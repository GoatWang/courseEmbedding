Andina Bottling Harvard Case Solution & Analysis

Andina Bottling Case Solution
Operations Management – Case Study (Andina Bottling Co)
1. For operations management to be effective suggest THREE areas which need to be focused on and improved to align operations in Chile, Brazil and Argentina. (20 marks) 
All areas in the stream of operations are extremely necessary including: production area, sales area, distribution area and logistic area. The whole supply chain is connected to each other. Any bottleneck in these operation processes can hinder business profits and create hurdles in the operations management.
A company must ensure that it is able to generate and increase the demand for its product. For this purpose, the sales and marketing area is very important. At Andina, the selling and distribution process started with taking orders. The sales force went out daily to take orders from customers, which were delivered the next day after going through the whole process of distribution and logistics. If the system was made online and orders were made through virtual presence rather than physically meeting every customer, then the supply chain would become more efficient and the process can be faster. Deliveries can be made on the same day it was ordered with the completion of the task of marketing and taking feedback at the time of actual deliveries. This will improve the process and operations to a large extent along with a reduction in the lead time.
The company must also ensure that the supply-demand match is achieved. Having an oversupply situation can be wasteful and costly whereas under-supply will result in missed opportunity situation; as a result potential customers will be lost. For this purpose, the production department should be closely aligned with the department that generates sales orders. Usually any inefficiency in gauging the correct demand figure and keeping the safety stock at each level creates the bull-whip effect that is not good for the company because the product will expire in the line with oversupply and production excess becoming evident. If the sales department is focused and linked with the production department, and  receives timely information then the company will be able to follow pull-strategy rather than push-strategy for its production. This will help to eradicate the bull-whip effect and the number of rejections will also be reduced. At the Brazilian production, similar issue arose because the distribution rejection resulted in increased freight cost of the company. Although, it was because of managers’ unethical practices that the company was paying high cost, otherwise the firm could have avoided it if it did not have un-aligned system.
Last but not least, the timely production and elimination in the bottlenecks of the process line will not matter much if the distribution is not timely, proper and cost-efficient. In Argentina, the unavailability of concrete data from the distribution department created a lag in the company’s operational system and it could not identify that a large number of clients were just resulting in 3% of sales and distribution costs were increasing highly because of this. Thus, improving the distribution area will benefit the company to achieve operational efficiency.
 
2. If overall strategy comes from Coke, what should Andina look at as a bottler to achieve operational success? (20 marks) 
The overall strategy does come from the TCCC but there are certain things that have to be handled by bottlers. Firstly, fixed assets are owned by bottlers along with the inventory management and credit risks that are passed on to the them by the TCCC. Andina can use these factors in their favour. First of all, the organization has to improve its marketing and research department.
The company should be able to estimate demand figures and should adjust the inventory accordingly. The proper inventory management can lead them to eliminate much of its operational inefficiency. The real time data from customers can be used to estimate inventory levels and the past data trend of the company will help to identify seasonal fluctuations, if any.
If the inventory is properly maintained and optimization level is known then, the capacity utilization of fixed assets can be achieved. The excess fixed inventory that is causing additional cost with no value addition can be discarded. This will help the company to streamline operations and eliminate redundancies in the system.
One of the most important factors is to manage the credit risk. It is crucial because loosened credit policies will result in cash flow mismanagement and tight situations for the organization whereas rigid credit policies will reduce sales and competitors will be able to attract customers through their policies. At this point, it is evident that the credit management of Andina was very poor. Some customers were never called for the collection while others were visited more than once. Thus, improving the credit collection system will ensure operational success of the company.
The research department also plays a direct and indirect role in the operational efficiency of the company. Bottlers have the option to present proposals to the company about certain things like packaging. Hence, if they manage to do a proper research about the needs and wants of the target market then, they can present ideas to the management about better advertisement and packaging (bottling techniques). If the sales of the product increase, so will the margin of the bottler because of achieving economies of scale in their plant……

 Andina Bottling Company Case


     Andina is a major distributor of Coca-Cola products in Latin America. The market for soft drinks is very competitive in Latin America. The dominate brands are not necessarily Coca-Cola or Pepsi brands. For a company to succeed in the distribution and manufacturing of soft drinks in Latin America, they need to be efficient. The plants need to work at capacity or close to it. The distribution also has to be logical. It is not worth it for them to sell to less populated mountain areas. The point of the new system that Andina is introducing is going to make sales, distribution, and manufacturing easier. The three countries are going to share their information with each other. Control panel and the rest of the system will be successful if Andina can convince each country that they can trust it. Andina is doing a good job of trying to unite the three subsidiaries through Control Panel. 

     For Andina to succeed in the bottled drinks manufacturing and distribution business, they need to be the most efficient that they can be. There are many bottled drinks in Latin America. There are many knock-offs of Coca-Cola as well. Andina is facing a lot of competition. They need to make sure that they are selling to a larger audience and not to a smaller one. There is no point in concentrating a large amount of your sales force on a mountain area or one that is spread out over some distance unless there is a large population that the drink is marketed to. If the mountain region makes up less than 5% of the company’s sales, they should try to focus on a more populated area with more of a target market. In the case, it talks about how this happened in Argentina. They had 25,000 clients that accounted for only 3% of their sales, (10). The distribution costs were incredibly high on these customers. The smaller clients were raising their distribution costs because delivering a case here and a case there adds up. 

     When it comes to manufacturing, the company needs to make sure that they have enough outputs for the demand. Also the sales force needs to target the correct market. If the sales force focuses on a market with low consumption, their sales are not going to be as good as a market with high consumption. 

     With the implementation of the new system and control panel, Andina is trying to bring their company together. T...

In order for Control Panel to work fully, Andina corporate needs to convince their Brazilian subsidiary that the Control Panel is here to help not hurt them. Also it seems like a case of the managers being afraid of losing their jobs to other managers such as one from Chile. The corporate headquarters needs to reassure them that Control Panel is not a way to fire the employee but there to help them do their job more effectively and efficiently. Maybe a training session with the employees could help boast their confidence in the system. For the managers in Brazil, they could hold like a managers retreat and inform them of how useful the whole system and it components are. They could also try to reassure them that they will not be losing their jobs because of the implementation of the new system.

Andina is making a very good effort to combine their company. They seem to be willing to work with each subsidiary to try and make the manufacturing and distribution processes easier. They need to continue to take the path they are currently on. They also need to keep reassuring their subsidiaries that this new system and all it components are there to help not destroy.

If the mountain region makes up less than 5% of the company’s sales, they should try to focus on a more populated area with more of a target market.  In the case, it talks about how this happened in Argentina.  They had 25,000 clients that accounted for only 3% of their sales, (10).  The distribution costs were incredibly high on these customers.  The smaller clients were raising their distribution costs because delivering a case here and a case there adds up.  
	When it comes to manufacturing, the company needs to make sure that they have enough outputs for the demand.  Also the sales force needs to target the correct market.  If the sales force focuses on a market with low consumption, their sales are not going to be as good as a market with high consumption.  
	With the implementation of the new system and control panel, Andina is trying to bring their company together.  They want the process to be more uniform.  In the beginning of the case the company is operating like three separate companies with no connection to each other.  The point of the new system and control panel is to make these three countries processes easier.  The main system was there to help simplify the financials of each of the subsidiaries.  It also helped in making sure that all the information reached the headquarters and not just the positive.  Also the same process would used at every subsidiary.  The manager of the plant in Chile could be interchanged with the plant manager in Brazil.  


Control panel is supposed to be a place where central management in the main office can see what is going on at each subsidiary.  Control panel is there to find any discrepancies or issues in the operations at the subsidiaries.  It assesses how each division in the subsidiary is performing.  An example of what control panel can find is the 25,000 smaller clients in Argentina as one reason for high distribution costs.  Control panel showed the management that distribution costs were high in Argentina.  They investigated this and decided that they needed to start focusing on their larger clients.  
The system and control panel will be successful if they can open all their subsidiaries to it.  The case talks about how resistant Brazil is to this.  They do not like the idea of someone watching what they are doing.  They seem very independent and not very fond of suggestions.  Argentina, on the other hand, embraced the technology.  Chile is below Argentina when it comes to embracing the technology, but they are still above Brazil.  The managers of each of these subsidiaries needs to trust the system or else their employees will not.  If the manager does not believe in or follow the new system, there is no point in implementing it.  The success of the new system and control panel are contingent on how well the managers of the subsidiaries embrace it.  Eventually though, the managers who do not embrace it will come around or leave and new people will be brought in.  The system will succeed especially if it does make life easier.  
The main problem in Chile is the insurgence of B-Brands or cheaper substitutes for Coca-Cola.  These knock-offs were invading Coca-Cola’s market share in Chile.  They were also causing the market price for a Coca-Cola to drop.  To counter the B-Brands, Chile introduced a low cost line of non-soda to the public.  This new line was failing.  Andina has
