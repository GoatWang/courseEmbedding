Biography  |




 Interview Date:  12/17/2012 
 Education administrator Erroll Brown Davis, Jr. was born on August 5, 1944 and grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. While Davis had a close relationship with his parents, Erroll, Sr. and Eleanor, his strongest influence as a child was his grandfather, John Boykin, a Georgia farmer who had migrated to Pittsburgh and worked as a chauffeur.
Davis graduated from high school at age sixteen, and then worked his way through Carnegie-Mellon University, becoming, along with his sister Diana who graduated the same year, the first members of his family to graduate from college. Davis received his B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1965 at the age of twenty. He moved to Chicago for graduate school, receiving his M.B.A. degree in finance from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business in 1967. 
Following his graduation from Chicago, Davis worked briefly at ARCO, an international oil company, and then spent two years as an U.S. Army officer during the Vietnam War.. In 1969, Davis joined the Ford Motor Company as a systems analyst. He later spent five years working in corporate finance at Xerox Corporation. Davis worked for Ford Motor Company until 1973, when he left for a position in Stamford, CT with Xerox Corporation, with whom he was affiliated until 1978. At Xerox, his focus was on strategic financial planning. Prior to the creation of Alliant Energy, Davis worked at Wisconsin Power and Light Company (WPL). From 1978 to 1990, Davis received several promotions through the senior management ranks at WPL, starting as vice president of finance and ending as CEO and President. 
Davis’ higher education experience includes serving as a member of the University of the Wisconsin System Board of Regents from 1987 to 1994, and as a former chairman of the board of trustees of Carnegie Mellon University, where he is a life member.  From 2006 to 2011, Davis served as chancellor of the University System of Georgia. He was appointed superintendent of Atlanta Public Schools in July of 2011. He is a member of the board of directors of General Motors and Union Pacific Corp., and serves on the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) board and on the advisory board of the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) along with numerous professional associations and civic organizations. He is a former member of the U.S. Olympic Committee Board (2004-2008) and the University of Chicago Board of Trustees.
Davis is the recipient of numerous honors and awards, including recognition as one of the Atlanta Business Chronicle’s “100 Most Influential Atlantans,” one of the “75 Most Powerful Blacks in Corporate America” by Black Enterprise Magazine. Davis also was named one of the “50 Most Powerful Black Executives in America” by Fortune Magazine in 2002 and received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of Chicago’s Graduate School of Business in 1993. In addition, Davis was honored by the magazine U.S. Black Engineer as the “Black Engineer of the Year” in 1988.
Davis and his wife, Elaine, live and in work in Atlanta, Georgia.
Erroll B. Davis was interviewed by The HistoryMakers on December 17, 2012.

ATLANTA — For years, Beverly L. Hall, the former school superintendent here, ruled by fear. Principals were told that if state test scores did not go up enough, they would be fired — and 90 percent of them were removed in the decade of Dr. Hall’s reign.Underlings were humiliated during rallies at the Georgia Dome. Dr. Hall permitted principals with the highest test scores to sit up front near her, while sticking those with the lowest scores off to the side, in the bleachers.She was chauffeured around the city, often with an entourage of aides and security guards. When she spoke publicly, questions had to be submitted beforehand for screening. “She was known as the queen in her ivory tower,” said Verdaillia Turner, president of the Atlanta teachers’ union.But Dr. Hall got results. Test scores soared. Two national groups named her superintendent of the year. The secretary of education, Arne Duncan, hosted her at the White House.

Fear seemed to work.Then, last summer, the Atlanta miracle collapsed. A state investigation found that 178 principals and teachers at nearly half the district’s schools — desperate to raise test scores — had cheated. Students from this poor, mostly African-American school district who could barely read were rated proficient on state tests, and they didn’t receive the remedial help they needed.

For months, the Fulton County district attorney has been investigating former school officials. Felony indictments are expected, for altering state documents, lying to investigators and theft of government funds.By last spring, Gov. Nathan Deal and Mayor Kasim Reed of Atlanta knew they had to find someone to clean up the mess. They asked Erroll B. Davis Jr. to become the new superintendent when Dr. Hall left at the end of June.Mr. Davis, who is 67, did not need the job. His wife of 43 years hoped he would not take it. He had nothing to prove. An engineer by training, he had been the chief executive of a Wisconsin-based utility company, and then, starting in 2006, the chancellor of the University System of Georgia. In October 2010, he announced he would retire from the chancellorship the following summer.People tried to warn him off the Atlanta job. Michael Bowers, a former attorney general who was co-director of the state investigation, understood how pervasive the corruption was and how daunting it would be to change the culture. “I know Erroll. I told him, ‘You’re crazy as a bedbug to take that job at your age,’ ” Mr. Bowers recalled. “You know why he did it? He is a genuine public servant.”For his part, Mr. Davis said, “When I look back at my life, I don’t want my contribution to have been shaving a few eighths off a bond deal to make a million dollars.”On July 1, the day he was supposed to retire, Mr. Davis was sitting at Dr. Hall’s old desk, reading the 800-page investigative report and trying to figure out which, if any, of the people in the offices surrounding him could be trusted.Since then, he has been unbending about rooting out corruption, to the point that Richard L. Hyde, who had been the lead investigator on the commission that issued the state report, said, “He’s brought order to chaos, it’s very impressive.” Mr. Davis has removed more than the 178 teachers and principals named in the report, and he dismissed several top administrators.

He has also made himself accessible, visiting 8 to 10 schools each month unannounced. And he has been kind. During a stop at Slater Elementary last week, he walked into every classroom. “I want to thank you for what you do,” he told each teacher. “I couldn’t do your job.”As he travels the district, often driving himself to meet with small groups of principals, Mr. Davis repeatedly tells them, “Education is the only industry in this country where failure is blamed on the workers, not the leadership.”Politically, he was the right choice for the job. On one level, the state investigation had been viewed as racially tinged, pitting former Gov. Sonny Perdue, a white Republican who ordered the inquiry in 2010, while still in office, against Dr. Hall, a black woman who served a Democratic constituency.Beyond his talents, Mr. Davis offered something to both sides.He had been chosen for the university chancellorship by Mr. Perdue. And he is African-American, a must for a school district where most of the work force and students are black.Mr. Davis says he is not political, describing himself as “slightly left of center on social issues and slightly right of center on fiscal matters.”His salary as superintendent is $240,000, less than half of what he made as the university system chancellor.He is an engineer to the core, bringing office work to football games to read during breaks. “A football game takes three and a half hours,” he said, “but if you add up the actual playing time, it’s much less, so there’s a lot I can get done.” He hangs his suits on two racks, taking the first in line, wearing it for a day, putting it at the end, and repeating.Dr. Hall and her top aides had six secretaries and receptionists; Mr. Davis and his have three.People are still shellshocked from the Hall years. Ms. Turner, the union president, said she was surprised when Mr. Davis’s secretary called to set up a lunch. “I said, ‘Why does he want to do that?’ ” Ms. Turner recalled. “She said, ‘He wants to get to know you.’ The man is a breath of fresh air.”

Dr. Hall was viewed as inaccessible, sequestered in her office.Mr. Davis’s home telephone number is listed.Recently he received a complaint that a teacher had given her students the answers to a test. After investigating, he immediately removed her from the classroom. “My policy is zero tolerance,” he said. “I do not want people who cheat teaching children. Can I do that? We’ll find out. If I lose, so be it, sue me.”During his visit to Slater Elementary, he stopped to inspect the bathrooms. “Everything good?” asked the assistant principal, Jeffrey Copeland.“Actually, no,” Mr. Davis said. “A toilet overflowed.”Later, as he was leaving, Mr. Davis checked to see if it had been fixed.“Done,” said a custodian, explaining that someone had clogged it with a whistle.“Thank you for what you do,” Mr. Davis said.A product of the Pittsburgh public schools, Mr. Davis finished high school at age 16. By 20, he had an engineering degree from Carnegie Mellon University, by 22 a master’s degree in business from the University of Chicago. He says he does not want a school system driven by test results.“That is not how education should work,” Mr. Davis said. “If you create the right kind of system, run by the right kind of people, tests scores will take care of themselves.”When Dr. Hall was the superintendent, she covered one wall in her office with bar graphs showing the test results for all 100 city schools.After Mr. Davis became superintendent, he took the test scores down and replaced them with large color photographs of Atlanta schoolchildren.

University of Wisconsin SystemGrants & AwardsAlliant Energy Erroll B. Davis, Jr. Academic Achievement AwardErroll B. Davis, Jr. 










Erroll B. Davis, Jr.





The Erroll B. Davis, Jr. Achievement Award, given by the UW System Administration and funded by an endowment contributed by Alliant Energy Foundation in 2006, was established in honor of Erroll B. Davis, Jr.’s leadership in both the corporate world and in the realm of public education.  Davis is the first black leader of a “Business Week 1,000” company and has a special connection to the University of Wisconsin System as a member of UW System Board of Regents from 1987 to 1994.
Erroll B. Davis, Jr. joined Alliant Energy in 1998 as president and chief executive officer, and began serving as chairman of the board of Alliant Energy Cooperation- an energy holding company with $8.3 billion in total assets and annual operating revenues of $3 billion at that time- in 2000.  Prior to the creation of Alliant Energy, Davis served as president and CEO of WPL Holdings from 1990 to 1998. From 1978 to 1990, he rose through the senior management ranks at Wisconsin Power and Light Company, starting as vice president of finance and ending as CEO and president.
Davis retired from his dual roles as president and CEO of Alliant in July 2005 and retained the chairman’s post until his move to the University System of Georgia in 2006.  Serving as Chancellor to the University System of Georgia, Davis was responsible for the state’s 35 public colleges and universities, approximately 302,000 students, 40,200 faculty and staff, and an annual budget of approximately $6.3 billion.  In July 2011, Erroll B. Davis, Jr. was appointed interim superintendent of Atlanta Public Schools, a system of 50,000 students and 6,000 employees with an annual operating budget of $578 million.  He served in this capacity until 2014.
Davis’ higher education experiences includes the previously mentioned service as a member of the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents and as a former chairman of the board of trustees of Carnegie Mellon University, of which he is a life member. A native of Pittsburgh, Davis earned a bachelor of science in electrical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 1965, and an M.B.A. in finance from the University of Chicago in 1967. He is a member of the board of directors of General Motors and Union Pacific Corp., and serves on the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) board and on the advisory board of the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) along with numerous professional associations and civic organizations. He is a former member of the U.S. Olympic Committee Board (2004-2008) and the University of Chicago Board of Trustees.
Davis and his wife, Elaine, established the Davis Family Foundation, which makes annual grants to numerous students. He is the recipient of numerous honors and awards, including recognition as one of Georgia Trend magazine’s “100 Most Influential Georgians,” the Atlanta Business Chronicle’s “100 Most Influential Atlantans,” one of the “75 Most Powerful Blacks in Corporate America” by Black Enterprise magazine, one of the “Top 50 Blacks in Technology” at the Black Engineer of the Year 2005 Awards Conference and the Carnegie Mellon Alumni Distinguished Service Award in 2004. Davis also was named one of the “50 Most Powerful Black Executives in America” by Fortune magazine in 2002 and received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of Chicago’s Graduate School of Business in 1993, the same year he received a Bronze Medal in Financial World’s “CEO of the Year” competition. In addition, Davis was honored by the magazine U.S. Black Engineer as the “Black Engineer of the Year” in 1988.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
