Support.com Announces Elizabeth Cholawsky as New President and CEOSupport.com Announces Elizabeth Cholawsky as New President and CEO
Transformational leader with success in high-growth SaaS businesses 
Redwood City, CA – May 19, 2014 – Support.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: SPRT), a leading provider of cloud software and services for technology support, today announced that its Board of Directors has appointed Elizabeth Cholawsky as President and Chief Executive Officer. Cholawsky comes to Support.com from Citrix Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: CTXS) where she most recently served as General Manager and Vice President of the IT Support and Access lines of business.
“Elizabeth has the vision, the experience, and the passion to take Support.com to its next stage of growth,” commented Jim Stephens, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Support.com. “She is a customer-centric leader who has transformed markets, driven technology innovation, and is exactly who Support.com needs as we start our next exciting chapter.”
Cholawsky has over 20 years of experience as an executive in technology industries, and she is an award-winning product thought leader who has grown businesses through organic innovation and acquisitions. Cholawsky’s deep expertise in cloud products and support markets coupled with her years of experience leading client services organizations are tremendous assets as she joins Support.com as President and CEO. At Citrix, Cholawsky held executive positions in the Citrix SaaS division, with leadership roles spanning product management, general management, global client services and the contact center. In her time at Citrix SaaS, Cholawsky revitalized product development and client services, grew customer satisfaction and retention to their highest levels, and expanded GoToAssist® to the IT support market, all while continuing the product’s uninterrupted streak of being #1 in its market (IDC) for five consecutive years.
“I am honored to be chosen to lead Support.com as President and CEO. Support.com has a strong customer base, a terrific portfolio of technology and great teams in both its software and services groups,” Cholawsky said. “We now have the opportunity to combine these assets and meet the new demands of the changing support marketplace. I look forward to working with our customers and employees to build a bright and successful future.” Cholawsky stated.
Before her leadership roles at Citrix, Cholawsky served in senior marketing and product strategy roles at Move, Inc. (NASDAQ: MOVE) and ValueClick, Inc. (NASDAQ: CNVR). Cholawsky has been consistently recognized for her business leadership, including receipt of prestigious Stevie Awards in 2010, 2012 and 2013. Cholawsky has a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Minnesota, and a B.A. (Phi Beta Kappa, cum laude) from Franklin & Marshall College. Cholawsky will be relocating to the San Francisco Bay Area from her current home in Santa Barbara, California, where she is an avid triathlete and a volunteer with Exceeding Expectations, a non-profit that encourages at-risk children to move their lives in a positive direction using the sport of triathlon as the vehicle.

Redefining Support for a Connected IoT World





How “Support Interaction Optimization” Will Reshape the World of Customer SupportBy: Elizabeth CholawskyPosted on December 4, 2014 in Nexus®, Support Interaction Optimization    
One of the most exciting parts of running a company involves helping it keep its bearings while its industry undergoes a fundamental transformation.
Which is why I’m proud to be at Support.com as it takes a leadership position in Support Interaction Optimization, a new industry category that responds to tectonic marketplace shifts by bringing sophisticated technology to the person-to-person interaction that is at the heart of most support operations. We’re doing this with our flagship product, Nexus®, which is the commercialized version of the in-house software that’s been the backbone of Support.com’s operations for over a decade.
A complete description of SIO, and how Nexus is poised to take advantage of it to transform the world of contact centers and customer support, is contained in the exclusive report being released today from Frost & Sullivan, the distinguished research and consulting company.
But I’d like to use this post to give my CEO’s perspective on what is happening in our industry, and how SIO represents its future direction. And what I see are two major forces at work.
First, companies have been using technology for many years to enhance their customer service operations. This begins even before a support call is answered, with integrated computer-telephony systems that figure out who the customer is from information in the customer database and route the call appropriately. We’ve become quite skilled at using interactive voice response technology to determine what the call is about, and match the call type with an agent’s skill. And once the right agent is located, the agent’s screen is filled automatically with all of the information on hand about the caller.
But then, the technology and the software come to an abrupt halt. It’s just the two people — the agent and the customer — one-on-one. For the most crucial part of the process, the part that most customers will remember about the entire experience, agents are forced to work without any sort of technology safety net. The situation is obviously not acceptable, and one of the main tasks of SIO is to use technology to optimize this final frontier in customer support: the live interaction between the caller with a technical issue and the agent trying to solve the problem.
The biggest SIO assist in Nexus comes in the form of “Guided Paths™.” Guided Paths have captured the company’s knowledge of their product — its “secret sauce” — and then formats that information into the form of steps an agent should take with any particular issue that might come up. A critical improvement that SIO brings to this process is that these steps are, whenever possible, automated. The good news is that this happens without needing to call in programmers from the IT department to write custom code.
For example, if remote operation software is needed at a particular point in a support call, it will be triggered automatically by the SIO platform. Agents shouldn’t need to spend their time launching .exe files; they should be helping customers with their problems.
This capability, I believe, gives companies the ability, as we like to say, “to make every agent their best agent.” It also brings us closer to the day when companies can offer entirely automated support that is every bit as robust and helpful as what can be attained by the very best contact center is today.
So why are we hearing about SIO now? It’s because of the second force that I see at work in today’s tech support world. That market is expanding in two directions: In the number of products that companies are being called on to support, and in the quality of the support they are being expected to deliver.
That first part should be pretty clear to everyone who’s been following technology. A few years ago “support” was most commonly associated with computers. Now, it involves a growing family of new devices: tablets, smart phones and the like. And in the very near future, we will be seeing even more devices as the “Internet of Things” brings smart, connected products to the home and work place.
Not only are there more products to support, but there has been a dramatic increase in the expectations that customers bring to the support experience. They are increasingly likely to drop products because of a support encounter they weren’t happy with. And odds are good that they’ll take their complaint to social media channels in the process.
Frost & Sullivan’s report captures another element of changing customer expectations, as it pertains to a new generation of customers. “Younger customers in particular have become more impatient, demanding, and knowledgeable,” says the report. “More and more, Generation Y consumers insist on ‘omni-channel support’ – a coherent, seamless Customer Experience, regardless of the channel through which they engage a business, from face-to-face service to self-service or support agents.”
Those words accurately describe a phenomenon we see every day with our Support.com customers. And, as mentioned, they’re a key driver of Support Interaction Optimization, a phenomenon that will be dominating the support industry in the coming years. With Nexus, and with other innovations that we have in the pipeline, Support.com plans to keep helping our customers stay ahead of the curve even as so much of the support industry changes around them.

Thought Leaders in Cloud Computing: Elizabeth Cholawsky, General Manager of IT Support Product Line, Citrix (Part 1)
Posted on Monday, Sep 10th 2012
 Next»» We’ve featured Citrix on the blog before. This time, we’re going to discuss the wonderful things that Citrix is doing in the cloud.
Sramana Mitra: Hi, Elizabeth. Let’s start with a bit of your personal background as well as what Citrix is doing in the area of cloud-based support.
Elizabeth Cholawsky: Right now I am the general manager for the IT support line of business at Citrix, which includes all of the GoToAssist branded products. I took this position a couple of years ago, but when I first joined Citrix, I was the VP of product management and client services. Client services runs through my career for the past 20 plus years. When we decided to focus on IT support, it was a natural segue from running our contact center operations and support operations to managing the business for these products.
SM: What business line are you responsible for? What does it cover?
EC: It’s all of the GoToAssist branded products. That’s two main product lines. One is called GoToAssist Corporate. That’s the first product that was produced by the startup Expert City, which has become the online services division for Citrix. GoToAssist was the first product on the market that allowed a support professional to be able to do screen sharing and remote access of PCs over 10 years ago. We made the market in the IT support area. We’ve grown that product and added to it, and we now own the majority market share for remote support worldwide. We have about 38% market share. The GoToAssist Corporate product is focused on the support of people, live support of people. It’s used by huge contact centers from companies such as BT, Verizon, Dell, and FedEx, all the way down to SMBs that find the need for sophisticated support of people in a live environment.
In the past four years, we added a product platform. It’s branded just GoToAssist, and it’s a modular platform. If you are a GoToAssist customer, you can buy just a remote support module or a monitoring module. We added that to the support capabilities a couple years ago for alarming, alerting, and monitoring machines that might be unattended. The GoToAssist platform is an integrated set of cloud-based tools for supporting both people and technology. You’ll see in the next few months, other things that we will add to that in a modular fashion to provide the tool set for support for a small company. That product has close to 30,000 customers using it today, primarily SMBs.
SM: What’s the difference between the second product and the third one?
EC: Let me clarify. The GoToAssist Corporate product is remote access and is focused on support of people, a live session. That’s one product. The second product is GoToAssist, and it has different modules on it. So, there are just two product lines. Some of our clients just use the GoToAssist monitoring modules. They want to keep abreast of what’s going on in their networks, if a machine is on or off or filling up disk space, get an alarm or alert on it. It also monitors network capabilities to make sure that the network bandwidth is as it should be and things are running smoothly.
SM: Let’s start discussing the competitive landscape. Whom do you compete with?
EC: We have 38% of the remote support market share, and the competitors in that area are WebEex with their support center product and LogMeIn with their rescue products. Then there are a number of smaller players such as TeamViewer, NTR Global, which just got bought by ASG, and Bomgar. IDC and Frost and Sullivan are the main analyst houses that measure the remote support market. They’re the ones that make it above a certain critical mass. And there are plenty of small startups that have small amounts, but nothing that meets the market share for analysts [to cover them].
