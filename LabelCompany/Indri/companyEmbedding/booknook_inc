Vendor & Product Compliance
Product quality and safety has always been a priority for Barnes & Noble, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Barnes & Noble”). Barnes & Noble requires all suppliers to stand fully behind their products. We depend on you to maintain knowledge of and comply with all safety standards for your products. To that extent, we have developed a Vendor and Product Compliance program to ensure that we continue to provide high quality, safe products to our customers.
All suppliers, manufacturers and other vendors (collectively, “Vendors”) of Barnes & Noble and its subsidiaries and affiliates must comply with the Barnes & Noble Vendor Guidelines. By supplying Barnes & Noble with products, Vendors agree to be bound by all Barnes & Noble Vendor Requirements, as each of the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time. All books will be considered for store placement based on subject matter and salability.
Please consider the following points when publishing and presenting your book: 






                Publishing & Presenting Your Book            



1. Does your book have an ISBN (International Standard Book Number)?


2. Does your book have a bar code?


3. What sort of binding is your book (Trade Paperback, Hardcover, Audiobook, etc.)?


4. Is your book available through a wholesaler?


5. Is your book priced competitively with other titles of a similar topic and quality?


6. Why should Barnes & Noble place your title on its shelves?


7. What if there's an error in a title listing?


 8. Where can you find more information on the topic of book writing, publishing, and marketing?




1. Does your book have an ISBN (International Standard Book Number)?


We use the ISBN to track inventory and sales information. An ISBN is a 13-digit number that specifically identifies your title. For further information, please see Barcoding Guidelines for the U.S. Book Industry on the Book Industry Study Group site. ISBNs are furnished by:
ISBN Agency
 630 Central Avenue
 New Providence, NJ 07974
 877-310-7333
 908-219-0188 (fax)
www.ISBN.org
Allow 5 business days for non-priority processing from the time an ISBN application is received at the agency (not from the date sent by the publisher). Priority processing is two business days from the time an application is received at the agency. Express processing is 24 business hours. If your book has already been printed, you can sticker your books with the ISBN once it is assigned. The ISBN and price should appear on the back cover of the book. 




2. Does your book have a bar code?


Bar codes help our stores handle books more efficiently. The bar code which incorporates your ISBN is scanned at the time of purchase, thus recording accurately the sale of your book. The book industry uses the Bookland EAN bar code, not the UPC. The barcode must have the U.S. retail price of the book embedded in it and printed on it. If your book is already printed, you can have pressure-sensitive labels produced for placement on the back cover. For a list of commercial bar code suppliers, please see Labels & Barcodes on the Book Industry Study Group site. 




3. What sort of binding is your book (Trade Paperback, Hardcover, Audiobook, etc.)?


For a complete listing of formats, please review the most recent version of the ONIX code lists at www.editeur.org/14/code-lists/#code. Since most of the titles in our stores are placed on the shelves spine out, we require both the title and author be printed on the spine of the book. 




4. Is your book available through a wholesaler?


Placing your book with a wholesaler/distributor will simplify your billing (one invoice to one location). It also allows B&N to consider placing larger orders and putting the book on automatic replenishment.
Wholesalers/distributors are used by many segments of the book industry: publishers, libraries and booksellers. Other bookstores order from the same wholesalers Barnes & Noble uses. We can help put you in touch with an appropriate wholesaler. 




5. Is your book priced competitively with other titles of a similar topic and quality?


Customers care about cost. Price can be a determining factor for a customer when looking at books similar in content, presentation and format. Look at the pricing of similar books in the category, and try to price yours competitively. 




6. Why should Barnes & Noble place your title on its shelves?


Tell us what makes your book unique or special. What is your marketing plan? Send us your publicity and promotional plans, along with any reviews or articles that may have been written about your book(s). 




7. What if there's an error in a title listing?


If you detect an error in a title listing, please email corrections@bn.com. Be sure to include the ISBN of the book. We receive a lot of copy that does not reference a specific ISBN, and this copy cannot be processed.
To add text content (descriptive content, author bios), email the information to titles@bn.com. Please include the ISBN with no dashes in the “Subject” line. For cover images, email a jpeg of the image to imagesinquiry@book.com. For more information about how to share content, please visit here. 




 8. Where can you find more information on the topic of book writing, publishing, and marketing?


The reference shelf in your favorite bookstore or local library features a wide variety of titles about writing books and the business of publishing.

The Barnes & Noble Nook (styled nook or NOOK) is a brand of e-readers developed by American book retailer Barnes & Noble,[1] based on the Android platform. The original device was announced in the U.S. in October 2009, and was released the next month.[2] The original Nook had a six-inch E-paper display and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device and was capable of Wi-Fi and AT&T 3G wireless connectivity.[3] The original nook was followed in November 2010 by a color LCD device called the Nook Color, in June 2011 by the Nook Simple Touch,[4] and in November 2011 and February 2012 by the Nook Tablet.[5][6] On April 30, 2012, Barnes & Noble entered into a partnership with Microsoft that spun off the Nook and college businesses into a subsidiary.[7] On August 28, 2012, Barnes and Noble announced partnerships with retailers in the UK, which began offering the Nook digital products in October 2012.[8][9] In December 2014, B&N purchased Microsoft's Nook shares, ending the partnership.[10]
Nook users may read nearly any Nook Store e-book, digital magazines or newspapers for one hour once per day while connected to the store's Wi-Fi.[11]

Naming[edit]
The Nook name and Identity was devised and created by the Brand Development Group at R/GA.[12] Nook was initially rejected as a name by Barnes & Noble but eventually the connection to nook being a familiar place to read was compelling enough to change the minds of the company's executives. This decision pivoted on the information contained within an NPR article which suggested that women readers tend to read more than men.[13] The name is also claimed by Rex Wilder when he was consulting for Ammunition Design Group. The name was among over 400 he created although that naming project ended with no name being chosen.
Devices[edit]
Current[edit]
Nook GlowLight Plus (E Ink)[edit]
The Nook GlowLight Plus e-reader was released on October 21, 2015 and it features a 6-inch 300ppi Carta E Ink screen with frontlight and touchscreen, Wi-Fi, an aluminum rear shell, six weeks of battery (1,500 mAh) life with wireless off, weights 6.9 ounces, and meets IP67, meaning it is waterproof for up to 30 minutes at a maximum depth of 1 meter and is dustproof.[14] The Nook software is run on Android 4.4 KitKat and it has 2.8GB of user-accessible storage.[15] The GlowLight Plus uses a Freescale i.MX6 1 GHz CPU and has 512MB RAM.[16]
Since the device runs Android 4.4, third party apps and launchers can be installed. Due to the lack of physical buttons, initial set up to install third party apps is done through a USB connection to a computer.[17]
Samsung Galaxy Tab Nook[edit]
In February 2014, B&N announced a new Nook color tablet would be released in 2014.[18] In June 2014, Barnes & Noble announced it would be teaming up with Samsung to develop co-branded tablets titled the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook. The devices would feature Samsung's hardware with a 7-inch display, and customized Nook software from Barnes & Noble.
Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook (7.0" LCD)[edit]
The Galaxy Tab 4 Nook was released in the US in August 21, 2014,[19] with B&N's Nook Division focusing on the software and content, and Samsung focusing on the hardware.[20][21] The product uses Android 4.4.2 KitKat on a 1.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon SOC with 1.5 GB RAM, WiFi, and Bluetooth, and features a 1.2 MP front-facing camera, a 3.2 MP rear camera, screen resolution of 1280 × 800, and a microSD storage slot that accepts cards up to 64GB. It launched with a US$199 retail price.[22] In May 2015, the price was reduced to $149.[citation needed]
Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 Nook (8" LCD)[edit]
In September 2015, B&N released the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 Nook, which is a Nook branded Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8" LCD tablet that includes some Samsung and B&N software.[23] It uses Android 5.0.2, and features an 8-core CPU (1.9 GHz Quad + 1.3 GHz Quad) with 3GB RAM, 32GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot, two cameras (2.1MP front and 8MP rear), and a 4,000 mAh battery, which B&N says will last for up to 14 hours of video usage and launched with a US$399.99 retail price.[24]
Samsung Galaxy Tab E Nook (9.6" LCD)[edit]
In October 2015, B&N released the Samsung Galaxy Tab E Nook, which is a Nook branded Samsung Galaxy Tab 9.6" LCD tablet that includes some Samsung, B&N and Microsoft software. This tablet runs Android 5.1.1 on a 1.2 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 CPU with 16GB of storage, microSD card support, weighs 547 grams, and two cameras (2MP front and 5MP rear); and its 9.6" display has a resolution of 1280 x 800 and it retails for $249.[25][26]
Nook Tablet 7[edit]
In November 2016, B&N released the Nook Tablet 7, which is a Nook-branded tablet with a 7" screen that has a resolution of 600 x 1024, and retails at $50.[27] It is using Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Nook apps included with a 1.3GHz MediaTek CPU. It has 8GB storage, a microSD card slot, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It weighs 8.8 ounces and has a battery for up to 7 hours.
Discontinued[edit]
Nook 1st Edition (E Ink)[edit]
Main article: Barnes & Noble Nook 1st Edition
The device has two versions, a Nook that includes Wi-Fi and AT&T 3G wireless connectivity, and one that only includes Wi-Fi.
3G + Wi-Fi version[edit]

This version made its debut on November 22, 2009, at a retail price of US$259. It was offered with built-in Wi-Fi + 3G connectivity for free access to the Barnes & Noble online store.
This has a six-inch E Ink display, and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device.[28]

Nook HD and Nook HD+[edit]
Nook HD[edit]
Main article: Nook HD
Nook HD (styled NOOK HD), announced September 26, 2012 and released November 1, 2012 along with the Nook HD+, is a 7-inch tablet with a resolution of 1440x900. It competes with the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD and comes in two colors: snow and smoke (a dark gray). It has a Texas Instruments 1.3 GHz dual-core processor with 1 GB RAM. It can play back video at 720p from the NOOK Video store, much like Amazon.com's Instant Video service. The Nook HD was initially priced at US$199 for 8 GB and US$229 for 16 GB.[31] It then sold at reduced prices at US$129 for 8 GB and US$149 for 16 GB.
The Nook HD runs a heavily modified version of Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich.
The Nook HD/HD+ line was originally planned to be discontinued, as announced in Barnes and Noble's 2013 Fiscal Year-End Report, due to financial losses.[32] A few months later, B&N President Michael P. Huseby announced that the company "intends to continue to design and develop cutting-edge Nook black and white and color devices at the best values in the marketplace",[33] following the resignation of former CEO William Lynch.
Nook HD+[edit]
Main article: Nook HD
Nook HD+ (styled NOOK HD+) is Barnes & Noble's first tablet capable of playing back movies and television shows downloadable from NOOK Video store at 1080p resolution.[34] Announced on September 26, 2012, the NOOK HD+ is a 9-inch tablet with a 1920 × 1280 resolution. It competes with the similar 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HD and has a Texas Instruments 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 processor and was initially priced at US$269 and US$299 for 16 and 32 GB, respectively.[34] Then only the 32 GB model was available at US$179.
Nook HD+ runs a heavily modified version of Android 4.0.3.
Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook (10.1" LCD)[edit]
On October 22, 2014, B&N released the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 10.1. It features the same specifications as the Galaxy Tab 4 10.1, so it has a 1.2 GHz Qualcomm processor, 1280x800 resolution with 149 ppi, a 1.3 MP front camera without flash, a 3.0 MP rear-facing camera, and a microSD storage slot that accepts cards up to 64GB. It launched with a US$299 retail price.[35] In May 2015, the price was reduced to $279.
Nook GlowLight (E Ink)[edit]
The Nook Glowlight (marketed as the "nook GlowLight") e-reader was released on October 30, 2013. The Glowlight uses a 6-inch touchscreen with E Ink Pearl, Wi-Fi and has a battery life of two months with wireless off; it launched at a US$119 retail price. It weighs 175 grams (6.2 oz) with dimensions of 6.5" × 5" × 0.42" and has 4 GB of storage, of which 2 GB is reserved for Nook Store content and 512 MB for additional user content. The device uses Android 2.3 and it has an 800 MHz processor with 256 MB of RAM.[36] Compared to the Nook Simple Touch Reader, the GlowLight has a white exterior, a brighter screen, a boost in screen resolution to 1024 × 758 and a more durable silicone edge.[37] Compared to the Simple Touch, the microSD card slot and page-turn buttons have been removed. On November 21, 2014, the Glowlight's price dropped to US$99.
Engadget gave the Glowlight a 73 out of 100, saying it is the best Nook with its improved display, lighter weight and front light, but didn't like that it lost its microSD slot, the contoured back and the lack of physical page turn buttons compared to previous Nooks.[38]

Sales[edit]
On December 1, 2011, Barnes & Noble stated that Nook and Nook-related sales for Q2 of 2011 were US$920 million.[39] The Nook had 13.4% global market share for E-paper readers in 2011.[40]
On October 29, 2012,[41] the rival Blackwells and Foyles bookshops, the John Lewis department stores, the Waitrose and Sainsbury's supermarket chains and high street catalogue retailer Argos launched the Nook e-reader in the UK—and, from November, the Nook HD and Nook HD+ tablet computers went on sale in the stores.[42]
In March 2016, Barnes & Noble stated they would no longer sell digital content in the United Kingdom.[43] It announced that from March 15, 2016, the UK Nook Store and the UK Nook Reading App for Android will cease operation. Whilst Barnes & Noble did not give a reason for ceasing Nook sales in the UK, commentators attributed the decision to declining sales.[44] On March 15, 2016, Barnes & Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video,[45] likely reasoned with the success of Google's Play Store, which runs on Barnes & Noble devices, and has been inevitably far more successful.[46] In the UK, those who have bought, respectively, e-book or video content will need to open accounts with other providers in order to not lose the content.[46]
B&N continues to sell e-books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US.
Nook e-reader applications for third party devices[edit]
Barnes & Noble provides free e-reader applications to permit reading on devices other than Nooks. Selections include Nook Reading Apps, Nook for Web and Nook Study.
Nook free reading applications[edit]
Barnes & Noble offers free applications for various platforms, with which to access Nook digital reading material:[47]

For desktop and laptop computers:

NOOK for Mac
NOOK for PC
NOOK for Windows 8 (US only)


For smartphones and tablets:

NOOK for Android
NOOK for iPhone and iPad



Nook for Web[edit]
The Nook for Web is a cloud based web reader with the tagline: "Read Instantly on any browser".[48]
NookStudy and Yuzu[edit]
NookStudy[edit]
In August 2010, concurrently with introducing a web-based textbook rental service, Barnes and Noble - "one of the largest textbook retailers in the US"[49] - introduced the NOOK Study app "for the PC or Mac that lets users buy or rent e-book versions of their textbooks for use on the computer.[50] Mobileread describes Nook Study (sometimes styled "NookStudy" or "NOOK Study")[51][52] as "a free e‐textbook application from Barnes and Noble that provides a suite of digital study tools. It is available for Microsoft Windows and Apple's Mac OS X."[53] Nook Study cannot be used on Nook e‐readers; rather it is designed for use only on PCs, Macs, and iPads, and it permits one to read e-textbooks "on up to two (2) computers".[54]
Nook Study offers two categories of benefits: the ability to read ebooks and other content that is accessible via other eReading devices, and the ability to read e‐textbooks purchased from Barnes & Noble, which are meant to be read on one's computer via the Nook Study application. According to Barnes & Noble's NookStudy FAQs: "You cannot use your Nook or mobile device to read textbooks as the screens are too small to properly view the contents."[54]
In The Digital Reader, Nate Hoffelder describes capabilities possessed by Nook Study that render it superior to other e‐reading software for reading textbooks.[55] For example, he writes:

…you can do multiple types of annotations (highlight, asterisk, question) and you can do asterisks and questions in 7 different colors. You can also attach text notes as well as search Wikipedia, Google, Dictionary.com, Wolfram Alpha, and YouTube. And I just noticed that you can attach a link to the webpage you just found through the search. Attaching the link is not easy, but it can be done.
Now I’m really impressed. I love that I can search Dictionary.com, Wolfram Alpha, and YouTube. I think this might be the killer feature for NookStudy (like indexed search was for the Kindle).
Some of the other neat features include having multiple ebooks open in tabs, and a second TOC for annotations.

In an August 2, 2011, press release, BN College cited kudos publicized on NBC's Today Show and MSNBC.com that deemed NOOK Study "the "Coolest Digital Study Tool Around".[56] On the Today Show and in an MSNBC.com post, Wilson Rothman, Deputy Technology & Science Editor at MSNBC, had included NOOK Study in a list of 10 back-to-school tech survival tips to consider when shopping for college technology necessities, recommending: "NOOK Study is an essential back-to-school tool that students should consider when heading back to college – and may be the 'coolest digital study tool around.'"[57]

“Barnes & Noble may well have the coolest digital study tool around. Seriously, this free eTextbook application for PC and Mac lets you not only get books digitally, but organize coursework, compile syllabi and other documents, take notes, print, export and go online for related research. While the same warning about Amazon’s textbook rental program applies here — that your particular study materials might not be available — it’s certainly worth the $0.00 price to check it out, and the other features may end up being useful on their own.”

Yuzu[edit]
In April 2014, the Barnes & Noble website announced the Nook Study had been replaced by Yuzu, which the company called "the next-generation digital education platform from Barnes & Noble."[49][58] In April, NOOK Study had already been "retired", and a Beta version of Yuzu was introduced for the iPad and for Internet Explorer and Safari 6.1/7 browsers. Yuzu was formally rolled out that summer and made available to more browsers, and as an Android, iOS, and Windows app. However, the Nook Study site continued offering a link to the Nook Study program, explaining: "We understand that as a NOOK Study user, you may have some questions. On this page we will try to direct you to the appropriate websites to find what you are looking for."[59][60] Clicking "Get NookStudy Help" redirects one to the "NOOK Study Knowledge Base", where they can download the Nook Study app[61][62] as well as find answers to frequently asked questions.[63] Yuzu, like NOOKStudy, "offers students a next-generation reading and note-taking experience in a simple app, but it also improves on NookStudy by making it easier for educators to provide course materials"[58] by integrating with BN's college-focused website Faculty Enlight,[64] where educators can search for the textbooks and other academic material they need, assemble them into course packs, and then build a required and recommended reading list for a class.[58] Downsides of Yuzu, however, are: "Yuzu does not share the same accounts as the Nook Store or NookStudy"[58] and "Yuzu is not compatible with NookStudy textbooks".[65] Emily Price at Engadget made a similar observation: "With Yuzu, [NOOKStudy]'s being phased out, and sadly any pricey books you've already bought through that service are incompatible with the new app."[49]
In March 2016, B&N announced that Yuzu would be shut down and instead B&N would partner with VitalSource for digital textbooks.[66]
Issues[edit]
Compatibility issues[edit]
Nook for Mac users have noted the app has compatibility issues with Mac OS 10.8 Mountain Lion. While the application requires OS 10.6 Snow Leopard, many users have documented the performance issues under Mountain Lion (and consequently all Macs sold since July 2012).[67]
Locked file table[edit]
The file table on the Nook is locked, meaning that external programs, such as Calibre, cannot be used to automatically organize uploaded files. All organization must be undertaken on the device itself, one book at a time, and such organization cannot be backed up or saved elsewhere.[68]
Lending restrictions[edit]
A book can only be lent once through the Nook's LendMe program.[69][70]
Downloading of NOOK Store content[edit]

Purchasing Barnes & Noble digital content and letting the credit card expire prevents re-downloading of the content until a valid credit card is entered into the account.[71][72] This is required because most downloads from Barnes & Noble have copy restrictions (DRM), and credit cards are required to unlock them.
On September 17, 2014, Barnes & Noble removed the "download" button from many books in the My Nook online library, without advance warning. The removal of these buttons, which permitted readers to download copies of their ebooks and transfer that content to other apps or devices, upset numerous users. User complaints and inquiries, via telephone, email, online chats, and social media forums, yielded the following, standard B&N response:[73]


We're sorry, but the ability to sideload NOOK purchased content has been discontinued. We apologize for any inconvenience. — NOOK Customer Care (@NOOK_Care) September 17, 2014[74]

Spinoff of business[edit]
On June 25, 2014, Barnes & Noble announced that the Nook division business would be spun off into an independent company.[75] On December 4, 2014, Barnes & Noble announced an end to its partnership with Microsoft connected to Nook and that it intended to complete the separation of Nook by the end of the first quarter of 2015.[76] However, in February 2015, B&N decided to keep the Nook division for the short term future.[77] In April 2016, B&N outsourced most Nook services to be managed by an Indian tech company.[78], Bahwan CyberTek.

The Barnes & Noble Nook (styled nook or NOOK) is a brand of e-readers developed by American book retailer Barnes & Noble,[1] based on the Android platform. The original device was announced in the U.S. in October 2009, and was released the next month.[2] The original Nook had a six-inch E-paper display and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device and was capable of Wi-Fi and AT&T 3G wireless connectivity.[3] The original nook was followed in November 2010 by a color LCD device called the Nook Color, in June 2011 by the Nook Simple Touch,[4] and in November 2011 and February 2012 by the Nook Tablet.[5][6] On April 30, 2012, Barnes & Noble entered into a partnership with Microsoft that spun off the Nook and college businesses into a subsidiary.[7] On August 28, 2012, Barnes and Noble announced partnerships with retailers in the UK, which began offering the Nook digital products in October 2012.[8][9] In December 2014, B&N purchased Microsoft's Nook shares, ending the partnership.[10]
Nook users may read nearly any Nook Store e-book, digital magazines or newspapers for one hour once per day while connected to the store's Wi-Fi.[11]

Naming[edit]
The Nook name and Identity was devised and created by the Brand Development Group at R/GA.[12] Nook was initially rejected as a name by Barnes & Noble but eventually the connection to nook being a familiar place to read was compelling enough to change the minds of the company's executives. This decision pivoted on the information contained within an NPR article which suggested that women readers tend to read more than men.[13] The name is also claimed by Rex Wilder when he was consulting for Ammunition Design Group. The name was among over 400 he created although that naming project ended with no name being chosen.

Since the device runs Android 4.4, third party apps and launchers can be installed. Due to the lack of physical buttons, initial set up to install third party apps is done through a USB connection to a computer.[17]
Samsung Galaxy Tab Nook[edit]
In February 2014, B&N announced a new Nook color tablet would be released in 2014.[18] In June 2014, Barnes & Noble announced it would be teaming up with Samsung to develop co-branded tablets titled the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook. The devices would feature Samsung's hardware with a 7-inch display, and customized Nook software from Barnes & Noble.

The Galaxy Tab 4 Nook was released in the US in August 21, 2014,[19] with B&N's Nook Division focusing on the software and content, and Samsung focusing on the hardware.[20][21] The product uses Android 4.4.2 KitKat on a 1.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon SOC with 1.5 GB RAM, WiFi, and Bluetooth, and features a 1.2 MP front-facing camera, a 3.2 MP rear camera, screen resolution of 1280 × 800, and a microSD storage slot that accepts cards up to 64GB.

Nook HD[edit]
Main article: Nook HD
Nook HD (styled NOOK HD), announced September 26, 2012 and released November 1, 2012 along with the Nook HD+, is a 7-inch tablet with a resolution of 1440x900. It competes with the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD and comes in two colors: snow and smoke (a dark gray). It has a Texas Instruments 1.3 GHz dual-core processor with 1 GB RAM. It can play back video at 720p from the NOOK Video store, much like Amazon.com's Instant Video service. The Nook HD was initially priced at US$199 for 8 GB and US$229 for 16 GB.[31] It then sold at reduced prices at US$129 for 8 GB and US$149 for 16 GB.
The Nook HD runs a heavily modified version of Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich.
The Nook HD/HD+ line was originally planned to be discontinued, as announced in Barnes and Noble's 2013 Fiscal Year-End Report, due to financial losses.[32] A few months later, B&N President Michael P. Huseby announced that the company "intends to continue to design and develop cutting-edge Nook black and white and color devices at the best values in the marketplace",[33] following the resignation of former CEO William Lynch.
Nook HD+[edit]
Main article: Nook HD
Nook HD+ (styled NOOK HD+) is Barnes & Noble's first tablet capable of playing back movies and television shows downloadable from NOOK Video store at 1080p resolution.[34] Announced on September 26, 2012, the NOOK HD+ is a 9-inch tablet with a 1920 × 1280 resolution. It competes with the similar 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HD and has a Texas Instruments 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 processor and was initially priced at US$269 and US$299 for 16 and 32 GB, respectively.[34] Then only the 32 GB model was available at US$179.
Nook HD+ runs a heavily modified version of Android 4.0.3.
Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook (10.1" LCD)[edit]
On October 22, 2014, B&N released the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 10.1. It features the same specifications as the Galaxy Tab 4 10.1, so it has a 1.2 GHz Qualcomm processor, 1280x800 resolution with 149 ppi, a 1.3 MP front camera without flash, a 3.0 MP rear-facing camera, and a microSD storage slot that accepts cards up to 64GB. It launched with a US$299 retail price.[35] In May 2015, the price was reduced to $279.
Nook GlowLight (E Ink)[edit]
The Nook Glowlight (marketed as the "nook GlowLight") e-reader was released on October 30, 2013. The Glowlight uses a 6-inch touchscreen with E Ink Pearl, Wi-Fi and has a battery life of two months with wireless off; it launched at a US$119 retail price. It weighs 175 grams (6.2 oz) with dimensions of 6.5" × 5" × 0.42" and has 4 GB of storage, of which 2 GB is reserved for Nook Store content and 512 MB for additional user content. The device uses Android 2.3 and it has an 800 MHz processor with 256 MB of RAM.[36] Compared to the Nook Simple Touch Reader, the GlowLight has a white exterior, a brighter screen, a boost in screen resolution to 1024 × 758 and a more durable silicone edge.[37] Compared to the Simple Touch, the microSD card slot and page-turn buttons have been removed. On November 21, 2014, the Glowlight's price dropped to US$99.
Engadget gave the Glowlight a 73 out of 100, saying it is the best Nook with its improved display, lighter weight and front light, but didn't like that it lost its microSD slot, the contoured back and the lack of physical page turn buttons compared to previous Nooks.[38]

Sales[edit]
On December 1, 2011, Barnes & Noble stated that Nook and Nook-related sales for Q2 of 2011 were US$920 million.[39] The Nook had 13.4% global market share for E-paper readers in 2011.[40]
On October 29, 2012,[41] the rival Blackwells and Foyles bookshops, the John Lewis department stores, the Waitrose and Sainsbury's supermarket chains and high street catalogue retailer Argos launched the Nook e-reader in the UK—and, from November, the Nook HD and Nook HD+ tablet computers went on sale in the stores.[42]
In March 2016, Barnes & Noble stated they would no longer sell digital content in the United Kingdom.[43] It announced that from March 15, 2016, the UK Nook Store and the UK Nook Reading App for Android will cease operation. Whilst Barnes & Noble did not give a reason for ceasing Nook sales in the UK, commentators attributed the decision to declining sales.[44] On March 15, 2016, Barnes & Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video,[45] likely reasoned with the success of Google's Play Store, which runs on Barnes & Noble devices, and has been inevitably far more successful.[46] In the UK, those who have bought, respectively, e-book or video content will need to open accounts with other providers in order to not lose the content.[46]
B&N continues to sell e-books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US.
Nook e-reader applications for third party devices[edit]
Barnes & Noble provides free e-reader applications to permit reading on devices other than Nooks. Selections include Nook Reading Apps, Nook for Web and Nook Study.
Nook free reading applications[edit]
Barnes & Noble offers free applications for various platforms, with which to access Nook digital reading material:[47]

For desktop and laptop computers:

NOOK for Mac
NOOK for PC
NOOK for Windows 8 (US only)


For smartphones and tablets:

NOOK for Android
NOOK for iPhone and iPad



Nook for Web[edit]
The Nook for Web is a cloud based web reader with the tagline: "Read Instantly on any browser".[48]
NookStudy and Yuzu[edit]
NookStudy[edit]
In August 2010, concurrently with introducing a web-based textbook rental service, Barnes and Noble - "one of the largest textbook retailers in the US"[49] - introduced the NOOK Study app "for the PC or Mac that lets users buy or rent e-book versions of their textbooks for use on the computer.[50] Mobileread describes Nook Study (sometimes styled "NookStudy" or "NOOK Study")[51][52] as "a free e‐textbook application from Barnes and Noble that provides a suite of digital study tools. It is available for Microsoft Windows and Apple's Mac OS X."[53] Nook Study cannot be used on Nook e‐readers; rather it is designed for use only on PCs, Macs, and iPads, and it permits one to read e-textbooks "on up to two (2) computers".[54]
Nook Study offers two categories of benefits: the ability to read ebooks and other content that is accessible via other eReading devices, and the ability to read e‐textbooks purchased from Barnes & Noble, which are meant to be read on one's computer via the Nook Study application. According to Barnes & Noble's NookStudy FAQs: "You cannot use your Nook or mobile device to read textbooks as the screens are too small to properly view the contents."[54]
In The Digital Reader, Nate Hoffelder describes capabilities possessed by Nook Study that render it superior to other e‐reading software for reading textbooks.[55] For example, he writes:

…you can do multiple types of annotations (highlight, asterisk, question) and you can do asterisks and questions in 7 different colors. You can also attach text notes as well as search Wikipedia, Google, Dictionary.com, Wolfram Alpha, and YouTube. And I just noticed that you can attach a link to the webpage you just found through the search. Attaching the link is not easy, but it can be done.
Now I’m really impressed. I love that I can search Dictionary.com, Wolfram Alpha, and YouTube. I think this might be the killer feature for NookStudy (like indexed search was for the Kindle).
Some of the other neat features include having multiple ebooks open in tabs, and a second TOC for annotations.

In an August 2, 2011, press release, BN College cited kudos publicized on NBC's Today Show and MSNBC.com that deemed NOOK Study "the "Coolest Digital Study Tool Around".[56] On the Today Show and in an MSNBC.com post, Wilson Rothman, Deputy Technology & Science Editor at MSNBC, had included NOOK Study in a list of 10 back-to-school tech survival tips to consider when shopping for college technology necessities, recommending: "NOOK Study is an essential back-to-school tool that students should consider when heading back to college – and may be the 'coolest digital study tool around.'"[57]

“Barnes & Noble may well have the coolest digital study tool around. Seriously, this free eTextbook application for PC and Mac lets you not only get books digitally, but organize coursework, compile syllabi and other documents, take notes, print, export and go online for related research. While the same warning about Amazon’s textbook rental program applies here — that your particular study materials might not be available — it’s certainly worth the $0.00 price to check it out, and the other features may end up being useful on their own.”

Yuzu[edit]
In April 2014, the Barnes & Noble website announced the Nook Study had been replaced by Yuzu, which the company called "the next-generation digital education platform from Barnes & Noble."[49][58] In April, NOOK Study had already been "retired", and a Beta version of Yuzu was introduced for the iPad and for Internet Explorer and Safari 6.1/7 browsers. Yuzu was formally rolled out that summer and made available to more browsers, and as an Android, iOS, and Windows app. However, the Nook Study site continued offering a link to the Nook Study program, explaining: "We understand that as a NOOK Study user, you may have some questions. On this page we will try to direct you to the appropriate websites to find what you are looking for."[59][60] Clicking "Get NookStudy Help" redirects one to the "NOOK Study Knowledge Base", where they can download the Nook Study app[61][62] as well as find answers to frequently asked questions.[63] Yuzu, like NOOKStudy, "offers students a next-generation reading and note-taking experience in a simple app, but it also improves on NookStudy by making it easier for educators to provide course materials"[58] by integrating with BN's college-focused website Faculty Enlight,[64] where educators can search for the textbooks and other academic material they need, assemble them into course packs, and then build a required and recommended reading list for a class.[58] Downsides of Yuzu, however, are: "Yuzu does not share the same accounts as the Nook Store or NookStudy"[58] and "Yuzu is not compatible with NookStudy textbooks".[65] Emily Price at Engadget made a similar observation: "With Yuzu, [NOOKStudy]'s being phased out, and sadly any pricey books you've already bought through that service are incompatible with the new app."[49]
In March 2016, B&N announced that Yuzu would be shut down and instead B&N would partner with VitalSource for digital textbooks.[66]
Issues[edit]
Compatibility issues[edit]
Nook for Mac users have noted the app has compatibility issues with Mac OS 10.8 Mountain Lion. While the application requires OS 10.6 Snow Leopard, many users have documented the performance issues under Mountain Lion (and consequently all Macs sold since July 2012).[67]
Locked file table[edit]
The file table on the Nook is locked, meaning that external programs, such as Calibre, cannot be used to automatically organize uploaded files. All organization must be undertaken on the device itself, one book at a time, and such organization cannot be backed up or saved elsewhere.[68]
Lending restrictions[edit]
A book can only be lent once through the Nook's LendMe program.[69][70]
Downloading of NOOK Store content[edit]

Purchasing Barnes & Noble digital content and letting the credit card expire prevents re-downloading of the content until a valid credit card is entered into the account.[71][72] This is required because most downloads from Barnes & Noble have copy restrictions (DRM), and credit cards are required to unlock them.
On September 17, 2014, Barnes & Noble removed the "download" button from many books in the My Nook online library, without advance warning. The removal of these buttons, which permitted readers to download copies of their ebooks and transfer that content to other apps or devices, upset numerous users. User complaints and inquiries, via telephone, email, online chats, and social media forums, yielded the following, standard B&N response:[73]


We're sorry, but the ability to sideload NOOK purchased content has been discontinued. We apologize for any inconvenience. — NOOK Customer Care (@NOOK_Care) September 17, 2014[74]

Spinoff of business[edit]
On June 25, 2014, Barnes & Noble announced that the Nook division business would be spun off into an independent company.[75] On December 4, 2014, Barnes & Noble announced an end to its partnership with Microsoft connected to Nook and that it intended to complete the separation of Nook by the end of the first quarter of 2015.[76] However, in February 2015, B&N decided to keep the Nook division for the short term future.[77] In April 2016, B&N outsourced most Nook services to be managed by an Indian tech company.[78], Bahwan CyberTek.

The Barnes & Noble Nook (styled nook or NOOK) is a brand of e-readers developed by American book retailer Barnes & Noble,[1] based on the Android platform. The original device was announced in the U.S. in October 2009, and was released the next month.[2] The original Nook had a six-inch E-paper display and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device and was capable of Wi-Fi and AT&T 3G wireless connectivity.[3] The original nook was followed in November 2010 by a color LCD device called the Nook Color, in June 2011 by the Nook Simple Touch,[4] and in November 2011 and February 2012 by the Nook Tablet.[5][6] On April 30, 2012, Barnes & Noble entered into a partnership with Microsoft that spun off the Nook and college businesses into a subsidiary.[7] On August 28, 2012, Barnes and Noble announced partnerships with retailers in the UK, which began offering the Nook digital products in October 2012.[8][9] In December 2014, B&N purchased Microsoft's Nook shares, ending the partnership.[10]
Nook users may read nearly any Nook Store e-book, digital magazines or newspapers for one hour once per day while connected to the store's Wi-Fi.[11]

Naming[edit]
The Nook name and Identity was devised and created by the Brand Development Group at R/GA.[12] Nook was initially rejected as a name by Barnes & Noble but eventually the connection to nook being a familiar place to read was compelling enough to change the minds of the company's executives. This decision pivoted on the information contained within an NPR article which suggested that women readers tend to read more than men.[13] The name is also claimed by Rex Wilder when he was consulting for Ammunition Design Group. The name was among over 400 he created although that naming project ended with no name being chosen.
Devices[edit]
Current[edit]

The Nook GlowLight Plus e-reader was released on October 21, 2015 and it features a 6-inch 300ppi Carta E Ink screen with frontlight and touchscreen, Wi-Fi, an aluminum rear shell, six weeks of battery (1,500 mAh) life with wireless off, weights 6.9 ounces, and meets IP67, meaning it is waterproof for up to 30 minutes at a maximum depth of 1 meter and is dustproof.[14] The Nook software is run on Android 4.4 KitKat and it has 2.8GB of user-accessible storage.[15] The GlowLight Plus uses a Freescale i.MX6 1 GHz CPU and has 512MB RAM.[16]
Since the device runs Android 4.4, third party apps and launchers can be installed. Due to the lack of physical buttons, initial set up to install third party apps is done through a USB connection to a computer.[17]
Samsung Galaxy Tab Nook[edit]
In February 2014, B&N announced a new Nook color tablet would be released in 2014.[18] In June 2014, Barnes & Noble announced it would be teaming up with Samsung to develop co-branded tablets titled the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook. The devices would feature Samsung's hardware with a 7-inch display, and customized Nook software from Barnes & Noble.
Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook (7.0" LCD)[edit]
The Galaxy Tab 4 Nook was released in the US in August 21, 2014,[19] with B&N's Nook Division focusing on the software and content, and Samsung focusing on the hardware.[20][21] The product uses Android 4.4.2 KitKat on a 1.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon SOC with 1.5 GB RAM, WiFi, and Bluetooth, and features a 1.2 MP front-facing camera, a 3.2 MP rear camera, screen resolution of 1280 × 800, and a microSD storage slot that accepts cards up to 64GB.

Nook HD[edit]
Main article: Nook HD
Nook HD (styled NOOK HD), announced September 26, 2012 and released November 1, 2012 along with the Nook HD+, is a 7-inch tablet with a resolution of 1440x900. It competes with the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD and comes in two colors: snow and smoke (a dark gray). It has a Texas Instruments 1.3 GHz dual-core processor with 1 GB RAM. It can play back video at 720p from the NOOK Video store, much like Amazon.com's Instant Video service. The Nook HD was initially priced at US$199 for 8 GB and US$229 for 16 GB.[31] It then sold at reduced prices at US$129 for 8 GB and US$149 for 16 GB.
The Nook HD runs a heavily modified version of Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich.
The Nook HD/HD+ line was originally planned to be discontinued, as announced in Barnes and Noble's 2013 Fiscal Year-End Report, due to financial losses.[32] A few months later, B&N President Michael P. Huseby announced that the company "intends to continue to design and develop cutting-edge Nook black and white and color devices at the best values in the marketplace",[33] following the resignation of former CEO William Lynch.
Nook HD+[edit]
Main article: Nook HD
Nook HD+ (styled NOOK HD+) is Barnes & Noble's first tablet capable of playing back movies and television shows downloadable from NOOK Video store at 1080p resolution.[34] Announced on September 26, 2012, the NOOK HD+ is a 9-inch tablet with a 1920 × 1280 resolution. It competes with the similar 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HD and has a Texas Instruments 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 processor and was initially priced at US$269 and US$299 for 16 and 32 GB, respectively.[34] Then only the 32 GB model was available at US$179.
Nook HD+ runs a heavily modified version of Android 4.0.3.
Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook (10.1" LCD)[edit]
On October 22, 2014, B&N released the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 10.1. It features the same specifications as the Galaxy Tab 4 10.1, so it has a 1.2 GHz Qualcomm processor, 1280x800 resolution with 149 ppi, a 1.3 MP front camera without flash, a 3.0 MP rear-facing camera, and a microSD storage slot that accepts cards up to 64GB. It launched with a US$299 retail price.[35] In May 2015, the price was reduced to $279.
Nook GlowLight (E Ink)[edit]
The Nook Glowlight (marketed as the "nook GlowLight") e-reader was released on October 30, 2013. The Glowlight uses a 6-inch touchscreen with E Ink Pearl, Wi-Fi and has a battery life of two months with wireless off; it launched at a US$119 retail price. It weighs 175 grams (6.2 oz) with dimensions of 6.5" × 5" × 0.42" and has 4 GB of storage, of which 2 GB is reserved for Nook Store content and 512 MB for additional user content. The device uses Android 2.3 and it has an 800 MHz processor with 256 MB of RAM.[36] Compared to the Nook Simple Touch Reader, the GlowLight has a white exterior, a brighter screen, a boost in screen resolution to 1024 × 758 and a more durable silicone edge.[37] Compared to the Simple Touch, the microSD card slot and page-turn buttons have been removed. On November 21, 2014, the Glowlight's price dropped to US$99.
Engadget gave the Glowlight a 73 out of 100, saying it is the best Nook with its improved display, lighter weight and front light, but didn't like that it lost its microSD slot, the contoured back and the lack of physical page turn buttons compared to previous Nooks.[38]

Sales[edit]
On December 1, 2011, Barnes & Noble stated that Nook and Nook-related sales for Q2 of 2011 were US$920 million.[39] The Nook had 13.4% global market share for E-paper readers in 2011.[40]
On October 29, 2012,[41] the rival Blackwells and Foyles bookshops, the John Lewis department stores, the Waitrose and Sainsbury's supermarket chains and high street catalogue retailer Argos launched the Nook e-reader in the UK—and, from November, the Nook HD and Nook HD+ tablet computers went on sale in the stores.[42]
In March 2016, Barnes & Noble stated they would no longer sell digital content in the United Kingdom.[43] It announced that from March 15, 2016, the UK Nook Store and the UK Nook Reading App for Android will cease operation. Whilst Barnes & Noble did not give a reason for ceasing Nook sales in the UK, commentators attributed the decision to declining sales.[44] On March 15, 2016, Barnes & Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video,[45] likely reasoned with the success of Google's Play Store, which runs on Barnes & Noble devices, and has been inevitably far more successful.[46] In the UK, those who have bought, respectively, e-book or video content will need to open accounts with other providers in order to not lose the content.[46]
B&N continues to sell e-books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US.
Nook e-reader applications for third party devices[edit]
Barnes & Noble provides free e-reader applications to permit reading on devices other than Nooks. Selections include Nook Reading Apps, Nook for Web and Nook Study.
Nook free reading applications[edit]
Barnes & Noble offers free applications for various platforms, with which to access Nook digital reading material:[47]

For desktop and laptop computers:

NOOK for Mac
NOOK for PC
NOOK for Windows 8 (US only)


For smartphones and tablets:

NOOK for Android
NOOK for iPhone and iPad



Nook for Web[edit]
The Nook for Web is a cloud based web reader with the tagline: "Read Instantly on any browser".[48]
NookStudy and Yuzu[edit]
NookStudy[edit]
In August 2010, concurrently with introducing a web-based textbook rental service, Barnes and Noble - "one of the largest textbook retailers in the US"[49] - introduced the NOOK Study app "for the PC or Mac that lets users buy or rent e-book versions of their textbooks for use on the computer.[50] Mobileread describes Nook Study (sometimes styled "NookStudy" or "NOOK Study")[51][52] as "a free e‐textbook application from Barnes and Noble that provides a suite of digital study tools. It is available for Microsoft Windows and Apple's Mac OS X."[53] Nook Study cannot be used on Nook e‐readers; rather it is designed for use only on PCs, Macs, and iPads, and it permits one to read e-textbooks "on up to two (2) computers".[54]
Nook Study offers two categories of benefits: the ability to read ebooks and other content that is accessible via other eReading devices, and the ability to read e‐textbooks purchased from Barnes & Noble, which are meant to be read on one's computer via the Nook Study application. According to Barnes & Noble's NookStudy FAQs: "You cannot use your Nook or mobile device to read textbooks as the screens are too small to properly view the contents."[54]
In The Digital Reader, Nate Hoffelder describes capabilities possessed by Nook Study that render it superior to other e‐reading software for reading textbooks.[55] For example, he writes:

…you can do multiple types of annotations (highlight, asterisk, question) and you can do asterisks and questions in 7 different colors. You can also attach text notes as well as search Wikipedia, Google, Dictionary.com, Wolfram Alpha, and YouTube. And I just noticed that you can attach a link to the webpage you just found through the search. Attaching the link is not easy, but it can be done.
Now I’m really impressed. I love that I can search Dictionary.com, Wolfram Alpha, and YouTube. I think this might be the killer feature for NookStudy (like indexed search was for the Kindle).
Some of the other neat features include having multiple ebooks open in tabs, and a second TOC for annotations.

In an August 2, 2011, press release, BN College cited kudos publicized on NBC's Today Show and MSNBC.com that deemed NOOK Study "the "Coolest Digital Study Tool Around".[56] On the Today Show and in an MSNBC.com post, Wilson Rothman, Deputy Technology & Science Editor at MSNBC, had included NOOK Study in a list of 10 back-to-school tech survival tips to consider when shopping for college technology necessities, recommending: "NOOK Study is an essential back-to-school tool that students should consider when heading back to college – and may be the 'coolest digital study tool around.'"[57]

“Barnes & Noble may well have the coolest digital study tool around. Seriously, this free eTextbook application for PC and Mac lets you not only get books digitally, but organize coursework, compile syllabi and other documents, take notes, print, export and go online for related research. While the same warning about Amazon’s textbook rental program applies here — that your particular study materials might not be available — it’s certainly worth the $0.00 price to check it out, and the other features may end up being useful on their own.”

Yuzu[edit]
In April 2014, the Barnes & Noble website announced the Nook Study had been replaced by Yuzu, which the company called "the next-generation digital education platform from Barnes & Noble."[49][58] In April, NOOK Study had already been "retired", and a Beta version of Yuzu was introduced for the iPad and for Internet Explorer and Safari 6.1/7 browsers. Yuzu was formally rolled out that summer and made available to more browsers, and as an Android, iOS, and Windows app. However, the Nook Study site continued offering a link to the Nook Study program, explaining: "We understand that as a NOOK Study user, you may have some questions. On this page we will try to direct you to the appropriate websites to find what you are looking for."[59][60] Clicking "Get NookStudy Help" redirects one to the "NOOK Study Knowledge Base", where they can download the Nook Study app[61][62] as well as find answers to frequently asked questions.[63] Yuzu, like NOOKStudy, "offers students a next-generation reading and note-taking experience in a simple app, but it also improves on NookStudy by making it easier for educators to provide course materials"[58] by integrating with BN's college-focused website Faculty Enlight,[64] where educators can search for the textbooks and other academic material they need, assemble them into course packs, and then build a required and recommended reading list for a class.[58] Downsides of Yuzu, however, are: "Yuzu does not share the same accounts as the Nook Store or NookStudy"[58] and "Yuzu is not compatible with NookStudy textbooks".[65] Emily Price at Engadget made a similar observation: "With Yuzu, [NOOKStudy]'s being phased out, and sadly any pricey books you've already bought through that service are incompatible with the new app."[49]
In March 2016, B&N announced that Yuzu would be shut down and instead B&N would partner with VitalSource for digital textbooks.[66]
Issues[edit]
Compatibility issues[edit]
Nook for Mac users have noted the app has compatibility issues with Mac OS 10.8 Mountain Lion. While the application requires OS 10.6 Snow Leopard, many users have documented the performance issues under Mountain Lion (and consequently all Macs sold since July 2012).[67]
Locked file table[edit]
The file table on the Nook is locked, meaning that external programs, such as Calibre, cannot be used to automatically organize uploaded files. All organization must be undertaken on the device itself, one book at a time, and such organization cannot be backed up or saved elsewhere.[68]
Lending restrictions[edit]
A book can only be lent once through the Nook's LendMe program.[69][70]
Downloading of NOOK Store content[edit]

Purchasing Barnes & Noble digital content and letting the credit card expire prevents re-downloading of the content until a valid credit card is entered into the account.[71][72] This is required because most downloads from Barnes & Noble have copy restrictions (DRM), and credit cards are required to unlock them.
On September 17, 2014, Barnes & Noble removed the "download" button from many books in the My Nook online library, without advance warning. The removal of these buttons, which permitted readers to download copies of their ebooks and transfer that content to other apps or devices, upset numerous users. User complaints and inquiries, via telephone, email, online chats, and social media forums, yielded the following, standard B&N response:[73]


We're sorry, but the ability to sideload NOOK purchased content has been discontinued. We apologize for any inconvenience. — NOOK Customer Care (@NOOK_Care) September 17, 2014[74]

Spinoff of business[edit]
On June 25, 2014, Barnes & Noble announced that the Nook division business would be spun off into an independent company.[75] On December 4, 2014, Barnes & Noble announced an end to its partnership with Microsoft connected to Nook and that it intended to complete the separation of Nook by the end of the first quarter of 2015.[76] However, in February 2015, B&N decided to keep the Nook division for the short term future.[77] In April 2016, B&N outsourced most Nook services to be managed by an Indian tech company.[78], Bahwan CyberTek.

The Barnes & Noble Nook (styled nook or NOOK) is a brand of e-readers developed by American book retailer Barnes & Noble,[1] based on the Android platform. The original device was announced in the U.S. in October 2009, and was released the next month.[2] The original Nook had a six-inch E-paper display and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device and was capable of Wi-Fi and AT&T 3G wireless connectivity.[3] The original nook was followed in November 2010 by a color LCD device called the Nook Color, in June 2011 by the Nook Simple Touch,[4] and in November 2011 and February 2012 by the Nook Tablet.[5][6] On April 30, 2012, Barnes & Noble entered into a partnership with Microsoft that spun off the Nook and college businesses into a subsidiary.[7] On August 28, 2012, Barnes and Noble announced partnerships with retailers in the UK, which began offering the Nook digital products in October 2012.[8][9] In December 2014, B&N purchased Microsoft's Nook shares, ending the partnership.[10]
Nook users may read nearly any Nook Store e-book, digital magazines or newspapers for one hour once per day while connected to the store's Wi-Fi.[11]

Naming[edit]
The Nook name and Identity was devised and created by the Brand Development Group at R/GA.[12] Nook was initially rejected as a name by Barnes & Noble but eventually the connection to nook being a familiar place to read was compelling enough to change the minds of the company's executives. This decision pivoted on the information contained within an NPR article which suggested that women readers tend to read more than men.[13] The name is also claimed by Rex Wilder when he was consulting for Ammunition Design Group. The name was among over 400 he created although that naming project ended with no name being chosen.
Devices[edit]
Current[edit]
Nook GlowLight Plus (E Ink)[edit]
The Nook GlowLight Plus e-reader was released on October 21, 2015 and it features a 6-inch 300ppi Carta E Ink screen with frontlight and touchscreen, Wi-Fi, an aluminum rear shell, six weeks of battery (1,500 mAh) life with wireless off, weights 6.9 ounces, and meets IP67, meaning it is waterproof for up to 30 minutes at a maximum depth of 1 meter and is dustproof.[14] The Nook software is run on Android 4.4 KitKat and it has 2.8GB of user-accessible storage.[15] The GlowLight Plus uses a Freescale i.MX6 1 GHz CPU and has 512MB RAM.[16]
Since the device runs Android 4.4, third party apps and launchers can be installed. Due to the lack of physical buttons, initial set up to install third party apps is done through a USB connection to a computer.[17]
Samsung Galaxy Tab Nook[edit]
In February 2014, B&N announced a new Nook color tablet would be released in 2014.[18] In June 2014, Barnes & Noble announced it would be teaming up with Samsung to develop co-branded tablets titled the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook. The devices would feature Samsung's hardware with a 7-inch display, and customized Nook software from Barnes & Noble.
Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook (7.0" LCD)[edit]
The Galaxy Tab 4 Nook was released in the US in August 21, 2014,[19] with B&N's Nook Division focusing on the software and content, and Samsung focusing on the hardware.[20][21] The product uses Android 4.4.2 KitKat on a 1.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon SOC with 1.5 GB RAM, WiFi, and Bluetooth, and features a 1.2 MP front-facing camera, a 3.2 MP rear camera, screen resolution of 1280 × 800, and a microSD storage slot that accepts cards up to 64GB.

Nook HD and Nook HD+[edit]
Nook HD[edit]
Main article: Nook HD
Nook HD (styled NOOK HD), announced September 26, 2012 and released November 1, 2012 along with the Nook HD+, is a 7-inch tablet with a resolution of 1440x900. It competes with the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD and comes in two colors: snow and smoke (a dark gray). It has a Texas Instruments 1.3 GHz dual-core processor with 1 GB RAM. It can play back video at 720p from the NOOK Video store, much like Amazon.com's Instant Video service. The Nook HD was initially priced at US$199 for 8 GB and US$229 for 16 GB.[31] It then sold at reduced prices at US$129 for 8 GB and US$149 for 16 GB.
The Nook HD runs a heavily modified version of Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich.
The Nook HD/HD+ line was originally planned to be discontinued, as announced in Barnes and Noble's 2013 Fiscal Year-End Report, due to financial losses.[32] A few months later, B&N President Michael P. Huseby announced that the company "intends to continue to design and develop cutting-edge Nook black and white and color devices at the best values in the marketplace",[33] following the resignation of former CEO William Lynch.
Nook HD+[edit]
Main article: Nook HD
Nook HD+ (styled NOOK HD+) is Barnes & Noble's first tablet capable of playing back movies and television shows downloadable from NOOK Video store at 1080p resolution.[34] Announced on September 26, 2012, the NOOK HD+ is a 9-inch tablet with a 1920 × 1280 resolution. It competes with the similar 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HD and has a Texas Instruments 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 processor and was initially priced at US$269 and US$299 for 16 and 32 GB, respectively.[34] Then only the 32 GB model was available at US$179.
Nook HD+ runs a heavily modified version of Android 4.0.3.
Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook (10.1" LCD)[edit]
On October 22, 2014, B&N released the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 10.1. It features the same specifications as the Galaxy Tab 4 10.1, so it has a 1.2 GHz Qualcomm processor, 1280x800 resolution with 149 ppi, a 1.3 MP front camera without flash, a 3.0 MP rear-facing camera, and a microSD storage slot that accepts cards up to 64GB. It launched with a US$299 retail price.[35] In May 2015, the price was reduced to $279.
Nook GlowLight (E Ink)[edit]
The Nook Glowlight (marketed as the "nook GlowLight") e-reader was released on October 30, 2013. The Glowlight uses a 6-inch touchscreen with E Ink Pearl, Wi-Fi and has a battery life of two months with wireless off; it launched at a US$119 retail price. It weighs 175 grams (6.2 oz) with dimensions of 6.5" × 5" × 0.42" and has 4 GB of storage, of which 2 GB is reserved for Nook Store content and 512 MB for additional user content. The device uses Android 2.3 and it has an 800 MHz processor with 256 MB of RAM.[36] Compared to the Nook Simple Touch Reader, the GlowLight has a white exterior, a brighter screen, a boost in screen resolution to 1024 × 758 and a more durable silicone edge.[37] Compared to the Simple Touch, the microSD card slot and page-turn buttons have been removed. On November 21, 2014, the Glowlight's price dropped to US$99.
Engadget gave the Glowlight a 73 out of 100, saying it is the best Nook with its improved display, lighter weight and front light, but didn't like that it lost its microSD slot, the contoured back and the lack of physical page turn buttons compared to previous Nooks.[38]

Sales[edit]
On December 1, 2011, Barnes & Noble stated that Nook and Nook-related sales for Q2 of 2011 were US$920 million.[39] The Nook had 13.4% global market share for E-paper readers in 2011.[40]
On October 29, 2012,[41] the rival Blackwells and Foyles bookshops, the John Lewis department stores, the Waitrose and Sainsbury's supermarket chains and high street catalogue retailer Argos launched the Nook e-reader in the UK—and, from November, the Nook HD and Nook HD+ tablet computers went on sale in the stores.[42]
In March 2016, Barnes & Noble stated they would no longer sell digital content in the United Kingdom.[43] It announced that from March 15, 2016, the UK Nook Store and the UK Nook Reading App for Android will cease operation. Whilst Barnes & Noble did not give a reason for ceasing Nook sales in the UK, commentators attributed the decision to declining sales.[44] On March 15, 2016, Barnes & Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video,[45] likely reasoned with the success of Google's Play Store, which runs on Barnes & Noble devices, and has been inevitably far more successful.[46] In the UK, those who have bought, respectively, e-book or video content will need to open accounts with other providers in order to not lose the content.[46]
B&N continues to sell e-books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US.
Nook e-reader applications for third party devices[edit]
Barnes & Noble provides free e-reader applications to permit reading on devices other than Nooks. Selections include Nook Reading Apps, Nook for Web and Nook Study.
Nook free reading applications[edit]
Barnes & Noble offers free applications for various platforms, with which to access Nook digital reading material:[47]

For desktop and laptop computers:

NOOK for Mac
NOOK for PC
NOOK for Windows 8 (US only)


For smartphones and tablets:

NOOK for Android
NOOK for iPhone and iPad



Nook for Web[edit]
The Nook for Web is a cloud based web reader with the tagline: "Read Instantly on any browser".[48]
NookStudy and Yuzu[edit]
NookStudy[edit]
In August 2010, concurrently with introducing a web-based textbook rental service, Barnes and Noble - "one of the largest textbook retailers in the US"[49] - introduced the NOOK Study app "for the PC or Mac that lets users buy or rent e-book versions of their textbooks for use on the computer.[50] Mobileread describes Nook Study (sometimes styled "NookStudy" or "NOOK Study")[51][52] as "a free e‐textbook application from Barnes and Noble that provides a suite of digital study tools. It is available for Microsoft Windows and Apple's Mac OS X."[53] Nook Study cannot be used on Nook e‐readers; rather it is designed for use only on PCs, Macs, and iPads, and it permits one to read e-textbooks "on up to two (2) computers".[54]
Nook Study offers two categories of benefits: the ability to read ebooks and other content that is accessible via other eReading devices, and the ability to read e‐textbooks purchased from Barnes & Noble, which are meant to be read on one's computer via the Nook Study application. According to Barnes & Noble's NookStudy FAQs: "You cannot use your Nook or mobile device to read textbooks as the screens are too small to properly view the contents."[54]
In The Digital Reader, Nate Hoffelder describes capabilities possessed by Nook Study that render it superior to other e‐reading software for reading textbooks.[55] For example, he writes:

…you can do multiple types of annotations (highlight, asterisk, question) and you can do asterisks and questions in 7 different colors. You can also attach text notes as well as search Wikipedia, Google, Dictionary.com, Wolfram Alpha, and YouTube. And I just noticed that you can attach a link to the webpage you just found through the search. Attaching the link is not easy, but it can be done.
Now I’m really impressed. I love that I can search Dictionary.com, Wolfram Alpha, and YouTube. I think this might be the killer feature for NookStudy (like indexed search was for the Kindle).
Some of the other neat features include having multiple ebooks open in tabs, and a second TOC for annotations.

In an August 2, 2011, press release, BN College cited kudos publicized on NBC's Today Show and MSNBC.com that deemed NOOK Study "the "Coolest Digital Study Tool Around".[56] On the Today Show and in an MSNBC.com post, Wilson Rothman, Deputy Technology & Science Editor at MSNBC, had included NOOK Study in a list of 10 back-to-school tech survival tips to consider when shopping for college technology necessities, recommending: "NOOK Study is an essential back-to-school tool that students should consider when heading back to college – and may be the 'coolest digital study tool around.'"[57]

“Barnes & Noble may well have the coolest digital study tool around. Seriously, this free eTextbook application for PC and Mac lets you not only get books digitally, but organize coursework, compile syllabi and other documents, take notes, print, export and go online for related research. While the same warning about Amazon’s textbook rental program applies here — that your particular study materials might not be available — it’s certainly worth the $0.00 price to check it out, and the other features may end up being useful on their own.”

Yuzu[edit]
In April 2014, the Barnes & Noble website announced the Nook Study had been replaced by Yuzu, which the company called "the next-generation digital education platform from Barnes & Noble."[49][58] In April, NOOK Study had already been "retired", and a Beta version of Yuzu was introduced for the iPad and for Internet Explorer and Safari 6.1/7 browsers. Yuzu was formally rolled out that summer and made available to more browsers, and as an Android, iOS, and Windows app. However, the Nook Study site continued offering a link to the Nook Study program, explaining: "We understand that as a NOOK Study user, you may have some questions. On this page we will try to direct you to the appropriate websites to find what you are looking for."[59][60] Clicking "Get NookStudy Help" redirects one to the "NOOK Study Knowledge Base", where they can download the Nook Study app[61][62] as well as find answers to frequently asked questions.[63] Yuzu, like NOOKStudy, "offers students a next-generation reading and note-taking experience in a simple app, but it also improves on NookStudy by making it easier for educators to provide course materials"[58] by integrating with BN's college-focused website Faculty Enlight,[64] where educators can search for the textbooks and other academic material they need, assemble them into course packs, and then build a required and recommended reading list for a class.[58] Downsides of Yuzu, however, are: "Yuzu does not share the same accounts as the Nook Store or NookStudy"[58] and "Yuzu is not compatible with NookStudy textbooks".[65] Emily Price at Engadget made a similar observation: "With Yuzu, [NOOKStudy]'s being phased out, and sadly any pricey books you've already bought through that service are incompatible with the new app."[49]
In March 2016, B&N announced that Yuzu would be shut down and instead B&N would partner with VitalSource for digital textbooks.[66]
Issues[edit]
Compatibility issues[edit]
Nook for Mac users have noted the app has compatibility issues with Mac OS 10.8 Mountain Lion. While the application requires OS 10.6 Snow Leopard, many users have documented the performance issues under Mountain Lion (and consequently all Macs sold since July 2012).[67]
Locked file table[edit]
The file table on the Nook is locked, meaning that external programs, such as Calibre, cannot be used to automatically organize uploaded files. All organization must be undertaken on the device itself, one book at a time, and such organization cannot be backed up or saved elsewhere.[68]
Lending restrictions[edit]
A book can only be lent once through the Nook's LendMe program.[69][70]
Downloading of NOOK Store content[edit]

Purchasing Barnes & Noble digital content and letting the credit card expire prevents re-downloading of the content until a valid credit card is entered into the account.[71][72] This is required because most downloads from Barnes & Noble have copy restrictions (DRM), and credit cards are required to unlock them.
On September 17, 2014, Barnes & Noble removed the "download" button from many books in the My Nook online library, without advance warning. The removal of these buttons, which permitted readers to download copies of their ebooks and transfer that content to other apps or devices, upset numerous users. User complaints and inquiries, via telephone, email, online chats, and social media forums, yielded the following, standard B&N response:[73]


We're sorry, but the ability to sideload NOOK purchased content has been discontinued. We apologize for any inconvenience. — NOOK Customer Care (@NOOK_Care) September 17, 2014[74]

Spinoff of business[edit]
On June 25, 2014, Barnes & Noble announced that the Nook division business would be spun off into an independent company.[75] On December 4, 2014, Barnes & Noble announced an end to its partnership with Microsoft connected to Nook and that it intended to complete the separation of Nook by the end of the first quarter of 2015.[76] However, in February 2015, B&N decided to keep the Nook division for the short term future.[77] In April 2016, B&N outsourced most Nook services to be managed by an Indian tech company.[78], Bahwan CyberTek.

The Barnes & Noble Nook (styled nook or NOOK) is a brand of e-readers developed by American book retailer Barnes & Noble,[1] based on the Android platform. The original device was announced in the U.S. in October 2009, and was released the next month.[2] The original Nook had a six-inch E-paper display and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device and was capable of Wi-Fi and AT&T 3G wireless connectivity.[3] The original nook was followed in November 2010 by a color LCD device called the Nook Color, in June 2011 by the Nook Simple Touch,[4] and in November 2011 and February 2012 by the Nook Tablet.[5][6] On April 30, 2012, Barnes & Noble entered into a partnership with Microsoft that spun off the Nook and college businesses into a subsidiary.[7] On August 28, 2012, Barnes and Noble announced partnerships with retailers in the UK, which began offering the Nook digital products in October 2012.[8][9] In December 2014, B&N purchased Microsoft's Nook shares, ending the partnership.[10]
Nook users may read nearly any Nook Store e-book, digital magazines or newspapers for one hour once per day while connected to the store's Wi-Fi.[11]

Naming[edit]
The Nook name and Identity was devised and created by the Brand Development Group at R/GA.[12] Nook was initially rejected as a name by Barnes & Noble but eventually the connection to nook being a familiar place to read was compelling enough to change the minds of the company's executives. This decision pivoted on the information contained within an NPR article which suggested that women readers tend to read more than men.[13] The name is also claimed by Rex Wilder when he was consulting for Ammunition Design Group. The name was among over 400 he created although that naming project ended with no name being chosen.

Current[edit]
Nook GlowLight Plus (E Ink)[edit]

Since the device runs Android 4.4, third party apps and launchers can be installed. Due to the lack of physical buttons, initial set up to install third party apps is done through a USB connection to a computer.[17]
Samsung Galaxy Tab Nook[edit]
In February 2014, B&N announced a new Nook color tablet would be released in 2014.[18] In June 2014, Barnes & Noble announced it would be teaming up with Samsung to develop co-branded tablets titled the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook. The devices would feature Samsung's hardware with a 7-inch display, and customized Nook software from Barnes & Noble.

The Nook HD/HD+ line was originally planned to be discontinued, as announced in Barnes and Noble's 2013 Fiscal Year-End Report, due to financial losses.[32] A few months later, B&N President Michael P. Huseby announced that the company "intends to continue to design and develop cutting-edge Nook black and white and color devices at the best values in the marketplace",[33] following the resignation of former CEO William Lynch.

The Nook Glowlight (marketed as the "nook GlowLight") e-reader was released on October 30, 2013. The Glowlight uses a 6-inch touchscreen with E Ink Pearl, Wi-Fi and has a battery life of two months with wireless off; it launched at a US$119 retail price. It weighs 175 grams (6.2 oz) with dimensions of 6.5" × 5" × 0.42" and has 4 GB of storage, of which 2 GB is reserved for Nook Store content and 512 MB for additional user content. The device uses Android 2.3 and it has an 800 MHz processor with 256 MB of RAM.[36] Compared to the Nook Simple Touch Reader, the GlowLight has a white exterior, a brighter screen, a boost in screen resolution to 1024 × 758 and a more durable silicone edge.[37] Compared to the Simple Touch, the microSD card slot and page-turn buttons have been removed. On November 21, 2014, the Glowlight's price dropped to US$99.
Engadget gave the Glowlight a 73 out of 100, saying it is the best Nook with its improved display, lighter weight and front light, but didn't like that it lost its microSD slot, the contoured back and the lack of physical page turn buttons compared to previous Nooks.[38]

Sales[edit]
On December 1, 2011, Barnes & Noble stated that Nook and Nook-related sales for Q2 of 2011 were US$920 million.[39] The Nook had 13.4% global market share for E-paper readers in 2011.[40]
On October 29, 2012,[41] the rival Blackwells and Foyles bookshops, the John Lewis department stores, the Waitrose and Sainsbury's supermarket chains and high street catalogue retailer Argos launched the Nook e-reader in the UK—and, from November, the Nook HD and Nook HD+ tablet computers went on sale in the stores.[42]
In March 2016, Barnes & Noble stated they would no longer sell digital content in the United Kingdom.[43] It announced that from March 15, 2016, the UK Nook Store and the UK Nook Reading App for Android will cease operation. Whilst Barnes & Noble did not give a reason for ceasing Nook sales in the UK, commentators attributed the decision to declining sales.[44] On March 15, 2016, Barnes & Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video,[45] likely reasoned with the success of Google's Play Store, which runs on Barnes & Noble devices, and has been inevitably far more successful.[46] In the UK, those who have bought, respectively, e-book or video content will need to open accounts with other providers in order to not lose the content.[46]
B&N continues to sell e-books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US.
Nook e-reader applications for third party devices[edit]
Barnes & Noble provides free e-reader applications to permit reading on devices other than Nooks. Selections include Nook Reading Apps, Nook for Web and Nook Study.
Nook free reading applications[edit]
Barnes & Noble offers free applications for various platforms, with which to access Nook digital reading material:[47]

For desktop and laptop computers:

NOOK for Mac
NOOK for PC
NOOK for Windows 8 (US only)


For smartphones and tablets:

NOOK for Android
NOOK for iPhone and iPad



Nook for Web[edit]
The Nook for Web is a cloud based web reader with the tagline: "Read Instantly on any browser".[48]
NookStudy and Yuzu[edit]
NookStudy[edit]
In August 2010, concurrently with introducing a web-based textbook rental service, Barnes and Noble - "one of the largest textbook retailers in the US"[49] - introduced the NOOK Study app "for the PC or Mac that lets users buy or rent e-book versions of their textbooks for use on the computer.[50] Mobileread describes Nook Study (sometimes styled "NookStudy" or "NOOK Study")[51][52] as "a free e‐textbook application from Barnes and Noble that provides a suite of digital study tools. It is available for Microsoft Windows and Apple's Mac OS X."[53] Nook Study cannot be used on Nook e‐readers; rather it is designed for use only on PCs, Macs, and iPads, and it permits one to read e-textbooks "on up to two (2) computers".[54]
Nook Study offers two categories of benefits: the ability to read ebooks and other content that is accessible via other eReading devices, and the ability to read e‐textbooks purchased from Barnes & Noble, which are meant to be read on one's computer via the Nook Study application. According to Barnes & Noble's NookStudy FAQs: "You cannot use your Nook or mobile device to read textbooks as the screens are too small to properly view the contents."[54]
In The Digital Reader, Nate Hoffelder describes capabilities possessed by Nook Study that render it superior to other e‐reading software for reading textbooks.[55] For example, he writes:

…you can do multiple types of annotations (highlight, asterisk, question) and you can do asterisks and questions in 7 different colors. You can also attach text notes as well as search Wikipedia, Google, Dictionary.com, Wolfram Alpha, and YouTube. And I just noticed that you can attach a link to the webpage you just found through the search. Attaching the link is not easy, but it can be done.
Now I’m really impressed. I love that I can search Dictionary.com, Wolfram Alpha, and YouTube. I think this might be the killer feature for NookStudy (like indexed search was for the Kindle).
Some of the other neat features include having multiple ebooks open in tabs, and a second TOC for annotations.

In an August 2, 2011, press release, BN College cited kudos publicized on NBC's Today Show and MSNBC.com that deemed NOOK Study "the "Coolest Digital Study Tool Around".[56] On the Today Show and in an MSNBC.com post, Wilson Rothman, Deputy Technology & Science Editor at MSNBC, had included NOOK Study in a list of 10 back-to-school tech survival tips to consider when shopping for college technology necessities, recommending: "NOOK Study is an essential back-to-school tool that students should consider when heading back to college – and may be the 'coolest digital study tool around.'"[57]

“Barnes & Noble may well have the coolest digital study tool around. Seriously, this free eTextbook application for PC and Mac lets you not only get books digitally, but organize coursework, compile syllabi and other documents, take notes, print, export and go online for related research. While the same warning about Amazon’s textbook rental program applies here — that your particular study materials might not be available — it’s certainly worth the $0.00 price to check it out, and the other features may end up being useful on their own.”

Yuzu[edit]
In April 2014, the Barnes & Noble website announced the Nook Study had been replaced by Yuzu, which the company called "the next-generation digital education platform from Barnes & Noble."[49][58] In April, NOOK Study had already been "retired", and a Beta version of Yuzu was introduced for the iPad and for Internet Explorer and Safari 6.1/7 browsers. Yuzu was formally rolled out that summer and made available to more browsers, and as an Android, iOS, and Windows app. However, the Nook Study site continued offering a link to the Nook Study program, explaining: "We understand that as a NOOK Study user, you may have some questions. On this page we will try to direct you to the appropriate websites to find what you are looking for."[59][60] Clicking "Get NookStudy Help" redirects one to the "NOOK Study Knowledge Base", where they can download the Nook Study app[61][62] as well as find answers to frequently asked questions.[63] Yuzu, like NOOKStudy, "offers students a next-generation reading and note-taking experience in a simple app, but it also improves on NookStudy by making it easier for educators to provide course materials"[58] by integrating with BN's college-focused website Faculty Enlight,[64] where educators can search for the textbooks and other academic material they need, assemble them into course packs, and then build a required and recommended reading list for a class.[58] Downsides of Yuzu, however, are: "Yuzu does not share the same accounts as the Nook Store or NookStudy"[58] and "Yuzu is not compatible with NookStudy textbooks".[65] Emily Price at Engadget made a similar observation: "With Yuzu, [NOOKStudy]'s being phased out, and sadly any pricey books you've already bought through that service are incompatible with the new app."[49]
In March 2016, B&N announced that Yuzu would be shut down and instead B&N would partner with VitalSource for digital textbooks.[66]
Issues[edit]
Compatibility issues[edit]
Nook for Mac users have noted the app has compatibility issues with Mac OS 10.8 Mountain Lion. While the application requires OS 10.6 Snow Leopard, many users have documented the performance issues under Mountain Lion (and consequently all Macs sold since July 2012).[67]
Locked file table[edit]
The file table on the Nook is locked, meaning that external programs, such as Calibre, cannot be used to automatically organize uploaded files. All organization must be undertaken on the device itself, one book at a time, and such organization cannot be backed up or saved elsewhere.[68]
Lending restrictions[edit]
A book can only be lent once through the Nook's LendMe program.[69][70]
Downloading of NOOK Store content[edit]

Purchasing Barnes & Noble digital content and letting the credit card expire prevents re-downloading of the content until a valid credit card is entered into the account.[71][72] This is required because most downloads from Barnes & Noble have copy restrictions (DRM), and credit cards are required to unlock them.
On September 17, 2014, Barnes & Noble removed the "download" button from many books in the My Nook online library, without advance warning. The removal of these buttons, which permitted readers to download copies of their ebooks and transfer that content to other apps or devices, upset numerous users. User complaints and inquiries, via telephone, email, online chats, and social media forums, yielded the following, standard B&N response:[73]


We're sorry, but the ability to sideload NOOK purchased content has been discontinued. We apologize for any inconvenience. — NOOK Customer Care (@NOOK_Care) September 17, 2014[74]

Spinoff of business[edit]
On June 25, 2014, Barnes & Noble announced that the Nook division business would be spun off into an independent company.[75] On December 4, 2014, Barnes & Noble announced an end to its partnership with Microsoft connected to Nook and that it intended to complete the separation of Nook by the end of the first quarter of 2015.[76] However, in February 2015, B&N decided to keep the Nook division for the short term future.[77] In April 2016, B&N outsourced most Nook services to be managed by an Indian tech company.[78], Bahwan CyberTek.

The Barnes & Noble Nook (styled nook or NOOK) is a brand of e-readers developed by American book retailer Barnes & Noble,[1] based on the Android platform. The original device was announced in the U.S. in October 2009, and was released the next month.[2] The original Nook had a six-inch E-paper display and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device and was capable of Wi-Fi and AT&T 3G wireless connectivity.[3] The original nook was followed in November 2010 by a color LCD device called the Nook Color, in June 2011 by the Nook Simple Touch,[4] and in November 2011 and February 2012 by the Nook Tablet.[5][6] On April 30, 2012, Barnes & Noble entered into a partnership with Microsoft that spun off the Nook and college businesses into a subsidiary.[7] On August 28, 2012, Barnes and Noble announced partnerships with retailers in the UK, which began offering the Nook digital products in October 2012.[8][9] In December 2014, B&N purchased Microsoft's Nook shares, ending the partnership.[10]
Nook users may read nearly any Nook Store e-book, digital magazines or newspapers for one hour once per day while connected to the store's Wi-Fi.[11]

Naming[edit]
The Nook name and Identity was devised and created by the Brand Development Group at R/GA.[12] Nook was initially rejected as a name by Barnes & Noble but eventually the connection to nook being a familiar place to read was compelling enough to change the minds of the company's executives. This decision pivoted on the information contained within an NPR article which suggested that women readers tend to read more than men.[13] The name is also claimed by Rex Wilder when he was consulting for Ammunition Design Group. The name was among over 400 he created although that naming project ended with no name being chosen.

Since the device runs Android 4.4, third party apps and launchers can be installed. Due to the lack of physical buttons, initial set up to install third party apps is done through a USB connection to a computer.[17]
Samsung Galaxy Tab Nook[edit]
In February 2014, B&N announced a new Nook color tablet would be released in 2014.[18] In June 2014, Barnes & Noble announced it would be teaming up with Samsung to develop co-branded tablets titled the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook. The devices would feature Samsung's hardware with a 7-inch display, and customized Nook software from Barnes & Noble.

Main article: Nook HD
Nook HD (styled NOOK HD), announced September 26, 2012 and released November 1, 2012 along with the Nook HD+, is a 7-inch tablet with a resolution of 1440x900. It competes with the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD and comes in two colors: snow and smoke (a dark gray). It has a Texas Instruments 1.3 GHz dual-core processor with 1 GB RAM. It can play back video at 720p from the NOOK Video store, much like Amazon.com's Instant Video service. The Nook HD was initially priced at US$199 for 8 GB and US$229 for 16 GB.[31] It then sold at reduced prices at US$129 for 8 GB and US$149 for 16 GB.
The Nook HD runs a heavily modified version of Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich.
The Nook HD/HD+ line was originally planned to be discontinued, as announced in Barnes and Noble's 2013 Fiscal Year-End Report, due to financial losses.[32] A few months later, B&N President Michael P. Huseby announced that the company "intends to continue to design and develop cutting-edge Nook black and white and color devices at the best values in the marketplace",[33] following the resignation of former CEO William Lynch.
Nook HD+[edit]
Main article: Nook HD
Nook HD+ (styled NOOK HD+) is Barnes & Noble's first tablet capable of playing back movies and television shows downloadable from NOOK Video store at 1080p resolution.[34] Announced on September 26, 2012, the NOOK HD+ is a 9-inch tablet with a 1920 × 1280 resolution. It competes with the similar 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HD and has a Texas Instruments 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 processor and was initially priced at US$269 and US$299 for 16 and 32 GB, respectively.[34] Then only the 32 GB model was available at US$179.
Nook HD+ runs a heavily modified version of Android 4.0.3.
Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook (10.1" LCD)[edit]
On October 22, 2014, B&N released the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 10.1. It features the same specifications as the Galaxy Tab 4 10.1, so it has a 1.2 GHz Qualcomm processor, 1280x800 resolution with 149 ppi, a 1.3 MP front camera without flash, a 3.0 MP rear-facing camera, and a microSD storage slot that accepts cards up to 64GB. It launched with a US$299 retail price.[35] In May 2015, the price was reduced to $279.
Nook GlowLight (E Ink)[edit]
The Nook Glowlight (marketed as the "nook GlowLight") e-reader was released on October 30, 2013. The Glowlight uses a 6-inch touchscreen with E Ink Pearl, Wi-Fi and has a battery life of two months with wireless off; it launched at a US$119 retail price. It weighs 175 grams (6.2 oz) with dimensions of 6.5" × 5" × 0.42" and has 4 GB of storage, of which 2 GB is reserved for Nook Store content and 512 MB for additional user content. The device uses Android 2.3 and it has an 800 MHz processor with 256 MB of RAM.[36] Compared to the Nook Simple Touch Reader, the GlowLight has a white exterior, a brighter screen, a boost in screen resolution to 1024 × 758 and a more durable silicone edge.[37] Compared to the Simple Touch, the microSD card slot and page-turn buttons have been removed. On November 21, 2014, the Glowlight's price dropped to US$99.
Engadget gave the Glowlight a 73 out of 100, saying it is the best Nook with its improved display, lighter weight and front light, but didn't like that it lost its microSD slot, the contoured back and the lack of physical page turn buttons compared to previous Nooks.[38]

On December 1, 2011, Barnes & Noble stated that Nook and Nook-related sales for Q2 of 2011 were US$920 million.[39] The Nook had 13.4% global market share for E-paper readers in 2011.[40]
On October 29, 2012,[41] the rival Blackwells and Foyles bookshops, the John Lewis department stores, the Waitrose and Sainsbury's supermarket chains and high street catalogue retailer Argos launched the Nook e-reader in the UK—and, from November, the Nook HD and Nook HD+ tablet computers went on sale in the stores.[42]
In March 2016, Barnes & Noble stated they would no longer sell digital content in the United Kingdom.[43] It announced that from March 15, 2016, the UK Nook Store and the UK Nook Reading App for Android will cease operation. Whilst Barnes & Noble did not give a reason for ceasing Nook sales in the UK, commentators attributed the decision to declining sales.[44] On March 15, 2016, Barnes & Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video,[45] likely reasoned with the success of Google's Play Store, which runs on Barnes & Noble devices, and has been inevitably far more successful.[46] In the UK, those who have bought, respectively, e-book or video content will need to open accounts with other providers in order to not lose the content.[46]
B&N continues to sell e-books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US.
Nook e-reader applications for third party devices[edit]
Barnes & Noble provides free e-reader applications to permit reading on devices other than Nooks. Selections include Nook Reading Apps, Nook for Web and Nook Study.
Nook free reading applications[edit]
Barnes & Noble offers free applications for various platforms, with which to access Nook digital reading material:[47]

For desktop and laptop computers:

NOOK for Mac
NOOK for PC
NOOK for Windows 8 (US only)


For smartphones and tablets:

NOOK for Android
NOOK for iPhone and iPad



Nook for Web[edit]
The Nook for Web is a cloud based web reader with the tagline: "Read Instantly on any browser".[48]
NookStudy and Yuzu[edit]
NookStudy[edit]
In August 2010, concurrently with introducing a web-based textbook rental service, Barnes and Noble - "one of the largest textbook retailers in the US"[49] - introduced the NOOK Study app "for the PC or Mac that lets users buy or rent e-book versions of their textbooks for use on the computer.[50] Mobileread describes Nook Study (sometimes styled "NookStudy" or "NOOK Study")[51][52] as "a free e‐textbook application from Barnes and Noble that provides a suite of digital study tools. It is available for Microsoft Windows and Apple's Mac OS X."[53] Nook Study cannot be used on Nook e‐readers; rather it is designed for use only on PCs, Macs, and iPads, and it permits one to read e-textbooks "on up to two (2) computers".[54]
Nook Study offers two categories of benefits: the ability to read ebooks and other content that is accessible via other eReading devices, and the ability to read e‐textbooks purchased from Barnes & Noble, which are meant to be read on one's computer via the Nook Study application. According to Barnes & Noble's NookStudy FAQs: "You cannot use your Nook or mobile device to read textbooks as the screens are too small to properly view the contents."[54]
In The Digital Reader, Nate Hoffelder describes capabilities possessed by Nook Study that render it superior to other e‐reading software for reading textbooks.[55] For example, he writes:

…you can do multiple types of annotations (highlight, asterisk, question) and you can do asterisks and questions in 7 different colors. You can also attach text notes as well as search Wikipedia, Google, Dictionary.com, Wolfram Alpha, and YouTube. And I just noticed that you can attach a link to the webpage you just found through the search. Attaching the link is not easy, but it can be done.
Now I’m really impressed. I love that I can search Dictionary.com, Wolfram Alpha, and YouTube. I think this might be the killer feature for NookStudy (like indexed search was for the Kindle).
Some of the other neat features include having multiple ebooks open in tabs, and a second TOC for annotations.

In an August 2, 2011, press release, BN College cited kudos publicized on NBC's Today Show and MSNBC.com that deemed NOOK Study "the "Coolest Digital Study Tool Around".[56] On the Today Show and in an MSNBC.com post, Wilson Rothman, Deputy Technology & Science Editor at MSNBC, had included NOOK Study in a list of 10 back-to-school tech survival tips to consider when shopping for college technology necessities, recommending: "NOOK Study is an essential back-to-school tool that students should consider when heading back to college – and may be the 'coolest digital study tool around.'"[57]

“Barnes & Noble may well have the coolest digital study tool around. Seriously, this free eTextbook application for PC and Mac lets you not only get books digitally, but organize coursework, compile syllabi and other documents, take notes, print, export and go online for related research. While the same warning about Amazon’s textbook rental program applies here — that your particular study materials might not be available — it’s certainly worth the $0.00 price to check it out, and the other features may end up being useful on their own.”

Yuzu[edit]
In April 2014, the Barnes & Noble website announced the Nook Study had been replaced by Yuzu, which the company called "the next-generation digital education platform from Barnes & Noble."[49][58] In April, NOOK Study had already been "retired", and a Beta version of Yuzu was introduced for the iPad and for Internet Explorer and Safari 6.1/7 browsers. Yuzu was formally rolled out that summer and made available to more browsers, and as an Android, iOS, and Windows app. However, the Nook Study site continued offering a link to the Nook Study program, explaining: "We understand that as a NOOK Study user, you may have some questions. On this page we will try to direct you to the appropriate websites to find what you are looking for."[59][60] Clicking "Get NookStudy Help" redirects one to the "NOOK Study Knowledge Base", where they can download the Nook Study app[61][62] as well as find answers to frequently asked questions.[63] Yuzu, like NOOKStudy, "offers students a next-generation reading and note-taking experience in a simple app, but it also improves on NookStudy by making it easier for educators to provide course materials"[58] by integrating with BN's college-focused website Faculty Enlight,[64] where educators can search for the textbooks and other academic material they need, assemble them into course packs, and then build a required and recommended reading list for a class.[58] Downsides of Yuzu, however, are: "Yuzu does not share the same accounts as the Nook Store or NookStudy"[58] and "Yuzu is not compatible with NookStudy textbooks".[65] Emily Price at Engadget made a similar observation: "With Yuzu, [NOOKStudy]'s being phased out, and sadly any pricey books you've already bought through that service are incompatible with the new app."[49]
In March 2016, B&N announced that Yuzu would be shut down and instead B&N would partner with VitalSource for digital textbooks.[66]
Issues[edit]
Compatibility issues[edit]
Nook for Mac users have noted the app has compatibility issues with Mac OS 10.8 Mountain Lion. While the application requires OS 10.6 Snow Leopard, many users have documented the performance issues under Mountain Lion (and consequently all Macs sold since July 2012).[67]
Locked file table[edit]
The file table on the Nook is locked, meaning that external programs, such as Calibre, cannot be used to automatically organize uploaded files. All organization must be undertaken on the device itself, one book at a time, and such organization cannot be backed up or saved elsewhere.[68]
Lending restrictions[edit]
A book can only be lent once through the Nook's LendMe program.[69][70]
Downloading of NOOK Store content[edit]

Purchasing Barnes & Noble digital content and letting the credit card expire prevents re-downloading of the content until a valid credit card is entered into the account.[71][72] This is required because most downloads from Barnes & Noble have copy restrictions (DRM), and credit cards are required to unlock them.
On September 17, 2014, Barnes & Noble removed the "download" button from many books in the My Nook online library, without advance warning. The removal of these buttons, which permitted readers to download copies of their ebooks and transfer that content to other apps or devices, upset numerous users. User complaints and inquiries, via telephone, email, online chats, and social media forums, yielded the following, standard B&N response:[73]


We're sorry, but the ability to sideload NOOK purchased content has been discontinued. We apologize for any inconvenience. — NOOK Customer Care (@NOOK_Care) September 17, 2014[74]

Spinoff of business[edit]
On June 25, 2014, Barnes & Noble announced that the Nook division business would be spun off into an independent company.[75] On December 4, 2014, Barnes & Noble announced an end to its partnership with Microsoft connected to Nook and that it intended to complete the separation of Nook by the end of the first quarter of 2015.[76] However, in February 2015, B&N decided to keep the Nook division for the short term future.[77] In April 2016, B&N outsourced most Nook services to be managed by an Indian tech company.[78], Bahwan CyberTek.

The Barnes & Noble Nook (styled nook or NOOK) is a brand of e-readers developed by American book retailer Barnes & Noble,[1] based on the Android platform. The original device was announced in the U.S. in October 2009, and was released the next month.[2] The original Nook had a six-inch E-paper display and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device and was capable of Wi-Fi and AT&T 3G wireless connectivity.[3] The original nook was followed in November 2010 by a color LCD device called the Nook Color, in June 2011 by the Nook Simple Touch,[4] and in November 2011 and February 2012 by the Nook Tablet.[5][6] On April 30, 2012, Barnes & Noble entered into a partnership with Microsoft that spun off the Nook and college businesses into a subsidiary.[7] On August 28, 2012, Barnes and Noble announced partnerships with retailers in the UK, which began offering the Nook digital products in October 2012.[8][9] In December 2014, B&N purchased Microsoft's Nook shares, ending the partnership.[10]
Nook users may read nearly any Nook Store e-book, digital magazines or newspapers for one hour once per day while connected to the store's Wi-Fi.[11]

Naming[edit]
The Nook name and Identity was devised and created by the Brand Development Group at R/GA.[12] Nook was initially rejected as a name by Barnes & Noble but eventually the connection to nook being a familiar place to read was compelling enough to change the minds of the company's executives. This decision pivoted on the information contained within an NPR article which suggested that women readers tend to read more than men.[13] The name is also claimed by Rex Wilder when he was consulting for Ammunition Design Group. The name was among over 400 he created although that naming project ended with no name being chosen.
Devices[edit]
Current[edit]
Nook GlowLight Plus (E Ink)[edit]
The Nook GlowLight Plus e-reader was released on October 21, 2015 and it features a 6-inch 300ppi Carta E Ink screen with frontlight and touchscreen, Wi-Fi, an aluminum rear shell, six weeks of battery (1,500 mAh) life with wireless off, weights 6.9 ounces, and meets IP67, meaning it is waterproof for up to 30 minutes at a maximum depth of 1 meter and is dustproof.[14] The Nook software is run on Android 4.4 KitKat and it has 2.8GB of user-accessible storage.[15] The GlowLight Plus uses a Freescale i.MX6 1 GHz CPU and has 512MB RAM.[16]
Since the device runs Android 4.4, third party apps and launchers can be installed. Due to the lack of physical buttons, initial set up to install third party apps is done through a USB connection to a computer.[17]
Samsung Galaxy Tab Nook[edit]
In February 2014, B&N announced a new Nook color tablet would be released in 2014.[18] In June 2014, Barnes & Noble announced it would be teaming up with Samsung to develop co-branded tablets titled the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook. The devices would feature Samsung's hardware with a 7-inch display, and customized Nook software from Barnes & Noble.
Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook (7.0" LCD)[edit]
The Galaxy Tab 4 Nook was released in the US in August 21, 2014,[19] with B&N's Nook Division focusing on the software and content, and Samsung focusing on the hardware.[20][21] The product uses Android 4.4.2 KitKat on a 1.2 GHz quad-core Snapdragon SOC with 1.5 GB RAM, WiFi, and Bluetooth, and features a 1.2 MP front-facing camera, a 3.2 MP rear camera, screen resolution of 1280 × 800, and a microSD storage slot that accepts cards up to 64GB.

Nook HD and Nook HD+[edit]
Nook HD[edit]
Main article: Nook HD
Nook HD (styled NOOK HD), announced September 26, 2012 and released November 1, 2012 along with the Nook HD+, is a 7-inch tablet with a resolution of 1440x900. It competes with the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD and comes in two colors: snow and smoke (a dark gray). It has a Texas Instruments 1.3 GHz dual-core processor with 1 GB RAM. It can play back video at 720p from the NOOK Video store, much like Amazon.com's Instant Video service. The Nook HD was initially priced at US$199 for 8 GB and US$229 for 16 GB.[31] It then sold at reduced prices at US$129 for 8 GB and US$149 for 16 GB.
The Nook HD runs a heavily modified version of Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich.
The Nook HD/HD+ line was originally planned to be discontinued, as announced in Barnes and Noble's 2013 Fiscal Year-End Report, due to financial losses.[32] A few months later, B&N President Michael P. Huseby announced that the company "intends to continue to design and develop cutting-edge Nook black and white and color devices at the best values in the marketplace",[33] following the resignation of former CEO William Lynch.
Nook HD+[edit]
Main article: Nook HD
Nook HD+ (styled NOOK HD+) is Barnes & Noble's first tablet capable of playing back movies and television shows downloadable from NOOK Video store at 1080p resolution.[34] Announced on September 26, 2012, the NOOK HD+ is a 9-inch tablet with a 1920 × 1280 resolution. It competes with the similar 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HD and has a Texas Instruments 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 processor and was initially priced at US$269 and US$299 for 16 and 32 GB, respectively.[34] Then only the 32 GB model was available at US$179.
Nook HD+ runs a heavily modified version of Android 4.0.3.
Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 Nook (10.1" LCD)[edit]
On October 22, 2014, B&N released the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook 10.1. It features the same specifications as the Galaxy Tab 4 10.1, so it has a 1.2 GHz Qualcomm processor, 1280x800 resolution with 149 ppi, a 1.3 MP front camera without flash, a 3.0 MP rear-facing camera, and a microSD storage slot that accepts cards up to 64GB. It launched with a US$299 retail price.[35] In May 2015, the price was reduced to $279.
Nook GlowLight (E Ink)[edit]
The Nook Glowlight (marketed as the "nook GlowLight") e-reader was released on October 30, 2013. The Glowlight uses a 6-inch touchscreen with E Ink Pearl, Wi-Fi and has a battery life of two months with wireless off; it launched at a US$119 retail price. It weighs 175 grams (6.2 oz) with dimensions of 6.5" × 5" × 0.42" and has 4 GB of storage, of which 2 GB is reserved for Nook Store content and 512 MB for additional user content. The device uses Android 2.3 and it has an 800 MHz processor with 256 MB of RAM.[36] Compared to the Nook Simple Touch Reader, the GlowLight has a white exterior, a brighter screen, a boost in screen resolution to 1024 × 758 and a more durable silicone edge.[37] Compared to the Simple Touch, the microSD card slot and page-turn buttons have been removed. On November 21, 2014, the Glowlight's price dropped to US$99.
Engadget gave the Glowlight a 73 out of 100, saying it is the best Nook with its improved display, lighter weight and front light, but didn't like that it lost its microSD slot, the contoured back and the lack of physical page turn buttons compared to previous Nooks.[38]

Sales[edit]
On December 1, 2011, Barnes & Noble stated that Nook and Nook-related sales for Q2 of 2011 were US$920 million.[39] The Nook had 13.4% global market share for E-paper readers in 2011.[40]
On October 29, 2012,[41] the rival Blackwells and Foyles bookshops, the John Lewis department stores, the Waitrose and Sainsbury's supermarket chains and high street catalogue retailer Argos launched the Nook e-reader in the UK—and, from November, the Nook HD and Nook HD+ tablet computers went on sale in the stores.[42]
In March 2016, Barnes & Noble stated they would no longer sell digital content in the United Kingdom.[43] It announced that from March 15, 2016, the UK Nook Store and the UK Nook Reading App for Android will cease operation. Whilst Barnes & Noble did not give a reason for ceasing Nook sales in the UK, commentators attributed the decision to declining sales.[44] On March 15, 2016, Barnes & Noble announced it would close the Nook App Store and Nook Video,[45] likely reasoned with the success of Google's Play Store, which runs on Barnes & Noble devices, and has been inevitably far more successful.[46] In the UK, those who have bought, respectively, e-book or video content will need to open accounts with other providers in order to not lose the content.[46]
B&N continues to sell e-books as well as digital magazines and newspapers in the US.
Nook e-reader applications for third party devices[edit]
Barnes & Noble provides free e-reader applications to permit reading on devices other than Nooks. Selections include Nook Reading Apps, Nook for Web and Nook Study.
Nook free reading applications[edit]
Barnes & Noble offers free applications for various platforms, with which to access Nook digital reading material:[47]

For desktop and laptop computers:

NOOK for Mac
NOOK for PC
NOOK for Windows 8 (US only)


For smartphones and tablets:

NOOK for Android
NOOK for iPhone and iPad



Nook for Web[edit]
The Nook for Web is a cloud based web reader with the tagline: "Read Instantly on any browser".[48]
NookStudy and Yuzu[edit]
NookStudy[edit]
In August 2010, concurrently with introducing a web-based textbook rental service, Barnes and Noble - "one of the largest textbook retailers in the US"[49] - introduced the NOOK Study app "for the PC or Mac that lets users buy or rent e-book versions of their textbooks for use on the computer.[50] Mobileread describes Nook Study (sometimes styled "NookStudy" or "NOOK Study")[51][52] as "a free e‐textbook application from Barnes and Noble that provides a suite of digital study tools. It is available for Microsoft Windows and Apple's Mac OS X."[53] Nook Study cannot be used on Nook e‐readers; rather it is designed for use only on PCs, Macs, and iPads, and it permits one to read e-textbooks "on up to two (2) computers".[54]
Nook Study offers two categories of benefits: the ability to read ebooks and other content that is accessible via other eReading devices, and the ability to read e‐textbooks purchased from Barnes & Noble, which are meant to be read on one's computer via the Nook Study application. According to Barnes & Noble's NookStudy FAQs: "You cannot use your Nook or mobile device to read textbooks as the screens are too small to properly view the contents."[54]
In The Digital Reader, Nate Hoffelder describes capabilities possessed by Nook Study that render it superior to other e‐reading software for reading textbooks.[55] For example, he writes:

…you can do multiple types of annotations (highlight, asterisk, question) and you can do asterisks and questions in 7 different colors. You can also attach text notes as well as search Wikipedia, Google, Dictionary.com, Wolfram Alpha, and YouTube. And I just noticed that you can attach a link to the webpage you just found through the search. Attaching the link is not easy, but it can be done.
Now I’m really impressed. I love that I can search Dictionary.com, Wolfram Alpha, and YouTube. I think this might be the killer feature for NookStudy (like indexed search was for the Kindle).
Some of the other neat features include having multiple ebooks open in tabs, and a second TOC for annotations.

In an August 2, 2011, press release, BN College cited kudos publicized on NBC's Today Show and MSNBC.com that deemed NOOK Study "the "Coolest Digital Study Tool Around".[56] On the Today Show and in an MSNBC.com post, Wilson Rothman, Deputy Technology & Science Editor at MSNBC, had included NOOK Study in a list of 10 back-to-school tech survival tips to consider when shopping for college technology necessities, recommending: "NOOK Study is an essential back-to-school tool that students should consider when heading back to college – and may be the 'coolest digital study tool around.'"[57]

“Barnes & Noble may well have the coolest digital study tool around. Seriously, this free eTextbook application for PC and Mac lets you not only get books digitally, but organize coursework, compile syllabi and other documents, take notes, print, export and go online for related research. While the same warning about Amazon’s textbook rental program applies here — that your particular study materials might not be available — it’s certainly worth the $0.00 price to check it out, and the other features may end up being useful on their own.”

Yuzu[edit]
In April 2014, the Barnes & Noble website announced the Nook Study had been replaced by Yuzu, which the company called "the next-generation digital education platform from Barnes & Noble."[49][58] In April, NOOK Study had already been "retired", and a Beta version of Yuzu was introduced for the iPad and for Internet Explorer and Safari 6.1/7 browsers. Yuzu was formally rolled out that summer and made available to more browsers, and as an Android, iOS, and Windows app. However, the Nook Study site continued offering a link to the Nook Study program, explaining: "We understand that as a NOOK Study user, you may have some questions. On this page we will try to direct you to the appropriate websites to find what you are looking for."[59][60] Clicking "Get NookStudy Help" redirects one to the "NOOK Study Knowledge Base", where they can download the Nook Study app[61][62] as well as find answers to frequently asked questions.[63] Yuzu, like NOOKStudy, "offers students a next-generation reading and note-taking experience in a simple app, but it also improves on NookStudy by making it easier for educators to provide course materials"[58] by integrating with BN's college-focused website Faculty Enlight,[64] where educators can search for the textbooks and other academic material they need, assemble them into course packs, and then build a required and recommended reading list for a class.[58] Downsides of Yuzu, however, are: "Yuzu does not share the same accounts as the Nook Store or NookStudy"[58] and "Yuzu is not compatible with NookStudy textbooks".[65] Emily Price at Engadget made a similar observation: "With Yuzu, [NOOKStudy]'s being phased out, and sadly any pricey books you've already bought through that service are incompatible with the new app."[49]
In March 2016, B&N announced that Yuzu would be shut down and instead B&N would partner with VitalSource for digital textbooks.[66]
Issues[edit]
Compatibility issues[edit]
Nook for Mac users have noted the app has compatibility issues with Mac OS 10.8 Mountain Lion. While the application requires OS 10.6 Snow Leopard, many users have documented the performance issues under Mountain Lion (and consequently all Macs sold since July 2012).[67]
Locked file table[edit]
The file table on the Nook is locked, meaning that external programs, such as Calibre, cannot be used to automatically organize uploaded files. All organization must be undertaken on the device itself, one book at a time, and such organization cannot be backed up or saved elsewhere.[68]
Lending restrictions[edit]
A book can only be lent once through the Nook's LendMe program.[69][70]
Downloading of NOOK Store content[edit]

Purchasing Barnes & Noble digital content and letting the credit card expire prevents re-downloading of the content until a valid credit card is entered into the account.[71][72] This is required because most downloads from Barnes & Noble have copy restrictions (DRM), and credit cards are required to unlock them.
On September 17, 2014, Barnes & Noble removed the "download" button from many books in the My Nook online library, without advance warning. The removal of these buttons, which permitted readers to download copies of their ebooks and transfer that content to other apps or devices, upset numerous users. User complaints and inquiries, via telephone, email, online chats, and social media forums, yielded the following, standard B&N response:[73]


We're sorry, but the ability to sideload NOOK purchased content has been discontinued. We apologize for any inconvenience. — NOOK Customer Care (@NOOK_Care) September 17, 2014[74]

Spinoff of business[edit]
On June 25, 2014, Barnes & Noble announced that the Nook division business would be spun off into an independent company.[75] On December 4, 2014, Barnes & Noble announced an end to its partnership with Microsoft connected to Nook and that it intended to complete the separation of Nook by the end of the first quarter of 2015.[76] However, in February 2015, B&N decided to keep the Nook division for the short term future.[77] In April 2016, B&N outsourced most Nook services to be managed by an Indian tech company.[78], Bahwan CyberTek.

†Offer Details: Offer expires December 31, 2017.  Valid only for new Bing Ads customers who are first party recipients of the offer email. A new Bing Ads customer is one that has not advertised on Bing Ads before. Enter promotional coupon code and spend $25 (applies to threshold and prepaid accounts) to receive $100 in Bing Ads credits. Limit one promotion code per new Bing Ads customer. Promotional code must be redeemed within thirty (30) days of Bing Ads new customer account creation. Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up. Other terms and conditions may apply.  Microsoft reserves the right to cancel, change, or suspend this offer at any time without notice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
