As president of UPS International Dan Brutto is responsible for all international package freight forwarding and logistics businesses as well as U.S. international package services. He is also a member of UPS�s Management Committee which is responsible for the day-to-day management of the company.Most recently Brutto was president of Global Freight Forwarding for UPS where he was responsible for air freight network management and global brokerage services. In that role he helped integrate multiple UPS freight forwarding units that had been acquired or built by UPS into one global air and ocean forwarding offering.
