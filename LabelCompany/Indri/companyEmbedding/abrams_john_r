Roman Life vividly re-creates the lives and experiences of people living in the Roman Empire—not only the super-rich emperors and senators, but also ordinary citizens, merchants, slaves, and freedmen. Lavish, full-color illustrations, many made especially for this volume, invite the reader to explore all aspects of life as seen through Roman eyes, from religion, work, and the military to banqueting, funerals, and public architecture. An interactive CD-ROM provides a virtual exploration of the famous House of the Vettii—the most popular tourist attraction at Pompeii—that allows the user to experience its paintings, sculptures, and gardens as a slave, a client, a guest, or a family member, providing a deeper understanding of the complex culture of the Roman house. 


No other book has gone so far in bringing the ancient Romans to life in terms the 21st century reader can understand. It turns out that the Romans were both like us and quite different. Roman Life offers a fresh look—straight on—at the many facets of this important world culture, miraculously preserved in its beautiful art and architecture.






About the author
John R. Clarke is the author of five books on the art and culture of ancient Rome, including Roman Sex: 100 B.C. to A.D. 250.He is the recipient of two National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowships and a Guggenheim Fellowship.
