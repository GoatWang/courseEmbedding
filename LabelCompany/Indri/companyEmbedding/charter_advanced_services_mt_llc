Charter Adds Advanced Ad Products at NewFronts
Audience App allows marketers to target specific customer attributes


5/05/2017  4:05 PM Eastern
 

By: Mike  Farrell Follow @MikeFCable  









Charter Communications media unit Spectrum Reach introduced a handful of advanced advertising products at its NewFront presentation in New York Friday, including an app that lets advertisers target ads to specific customer attributes.
The Spectrum Audience App uses anonymized subscriber viewing data to target specific attributes like education level or car-ownership information.
Other products unveiled at the New Fronts included:

Spectrum Reach Digital Dashboard – A state-of-the-art planning and reporting tool that gives advertisers one place to view their digital campaign.
Household Addressability – This allows advertisers to pinpoint very specific targets by household. The plan is to launch household addressability on linear networks (using Charter's retained 2 ad minutes per hour, as is typical) in New York and Los Angeles by the end of the year, extending into other markets in 2018, executives said.
Ads Everywhere – This non-linear TV product, that allows digitally-inserted ads into the Spectrum app, cable networks' apps, Video On Demand apps' and the set-top-box, is being extended to every Charter market.

The NewFront presentation was held at The Edison Ballroom in Manhattan. Among the presenters at the invitation-only event were former Los Angeles Lakers star and current Spectrum SportsNet studio analyst James Worthy, Spectrum NY1 news morning anchor Pat Kiernan, traffic reporter Jamie Stelter and weekend evening anchor Cheryl Wills; Spectrum News 13 anchor Ybeth Bruzual and Spectrum NY 1 News “Inside City Hall” host Errol Louis. The theme for the presentation was Maximum Impact, emphasizing Charter's multi-screen marketing solutions anchored in programming across 26 million households and nearly 100 markets.

Cylinder Plating
Modern engine designs use very light aluminum cylinders. The aluminum base metal is very soft and would wear out almost instantly without a very special protective barrier. The Millennium Technologies Nickel Silicon Carbide (NSC) cylinder plating process forms an extremely hard, extremely durable barrier with less friction, improved heat transfer, less weight, and ultimately more horsepower. We stand behind our plating with a LIFETIME WARRANTY.

Received my repaired cylinder yesterday. It looks better than a new one, amazing quality work. This is the 2nd replate you have done for me and they were both flawless. Thanks for the great work.

Frequently Asked Questions



Cylinders


Q.What do I need to do to send my engine components to you to have them fixed? 
A. Click to reveal:


 We will need all the parts that we are working on, which may include your cylinder, head, power valve, and piston. Also before sending your cylinder in, you need to either fill out our Service Order Form or e-mail info@millennium-tech.net, or call us to  have an estimate created to print and send in with your cylinder to  Millennium Technologies1404 Pilgrim RoadPlymouth, WI 53073.





Q.Do I need to send my piston in with my cylinder? 
A. Click to reveal:


Although, it is not mandatory, providing us with a new piston is always a good idea. By having a piston we can ensure proper finish bore size, as well as making sure that your new piston hasn’t been damaged. In most cases, we can do a cylinder to stock dimensions based on provided make, model, and year. If you would like us to provide a new aftermarket piston, simply choose the type you would like and indicate it on our Service Order Form  and send it in with your cylinder. Keep in mind that ordering a piston through Millennium on your service order form does entitle you to a 20% discount off the retail price of the piston, as well as any other aftermarket parts, like gaskets or bearings, that you may need. So save some money and order through us! 





Q.Do I need to take my cylinder apart?
A. Click to reveal:


You can send in just your cylinder, all components you want serviced, or even your entire engine for us to provide engine rebuilding services for you. We recommend calling one of our service technicians to discuss all options available for your specific needs. Millennium Technologies will not be held liable for any damaged or broken parts that may result from disassembly. This includes cylinder head bolts! Please remove them from the cylinder; we will not be liable for any damaged or broken head bolts. If removing a head bolt results in the need for a heli-coil, the customer will be contacted to be notified of the additional costs.





Q.When sending in a cylinder, do the power valves need to be removed or is that part of the cylinder service?
A. Click to reveal:


No, we recommend that you send the entire power valve assembly along with your cylinder and take advantage of our power valve service





Q.Do you buy used or core cylinders?
A. Click to reveal:


Yes, we often will purchase your used cylinders without requiring any purchase or exchange with us, but it depends on your specific cylinder and the condition it is in. Feel free to call us to discuss selling us your used cylinder(s).





Q.Do you sell cylinders outright? 
A. Click to reveal:


We do sell cylinders outright depending on inventory levels and availability.





Q.Do you have a core cylinder for my application?
A. Click to reveal:


We carry over 10,000 cylinders in our core inventory to fit almost any application. We recommend calling one of our sales technicians to discuss all options available for your specific core needs.





Q.How long does it take to get my cylinder back?
A. Click to reveal:


Typical turn around times are 5-7 business days for single cylinder and head services, 7-10 business days for mono blocks, inlines, and integral top cases, 14-21 business days on automotive and engine building services.





Q.What are my options for repair on my order? Can I get by doing it cheaper?
A. Click to reveal:


There are always many repair or modifications options for your cylinder, please call one of our sales technicians to discuss what range of options and pricing are available for your needs.





Q.How big can I go?
A. Click to reveal:


Overbore or oversizing options vary by model and application. We recommend calling one of our sales technicians to discuss all options available for your specific needs.





Q.I am doing a big bore. Do I need to send any parts besides my cylinder?
A. Click to reveal:


When doing may big bore kits, it is necessary to modify other parts of the motor. Often times, the power valve assembly and/or cylinder head require changes to accept your new bore size. Failure to modify these parts will result in power loss and/or engine failure. If you are unsure of your needs please contact us.





Q.I am doing my own overboring. What size do I bore to?
A. Click to reveal:


Your cylinder should be bored to .007” (±.001”) over your finish bore size. In other words, take your piston size, add clearance, and then add .007”. When doing your final pass, it is a good idea to use a new bit to ensure we receive a smooth, groove free surface that is ready for plating. If left undersized or too rough we will need to re-bore your cylinder, negating your attempt to save cost and time. Please do not hone your cylinders at this point. Honing on bare aluminum forces oil into the casting and can result in excessive porosity.





Q.What is porosity, and will it affect my engine?
A. Click to reveal:


Porosity is gas trapped in the base metal aluminum during casting. These “holes” are exposed when the cylinder is machined or subjected to various chemicals in the plating process. The pits are usually small in size, and in good castings few and far between. When kept under acceptable levels, porosity will not adversely affect the performance or longevity of the engine.  In fact, it will improve lubrication. The pits will not cause the coating to peel, nor will a ring hook on them. As far as our specifications on porosity our cylinders carry a lifetime warranty against defects in materials and workmanship. Therefore, through extensive testing we have found that porosity is a cosmetic problem only. In our pursuit to have both cosmetic and functional perfection we do everything possible to remove these pits. In some cases, this is not possible, so we release the cylinder only in cases where it will not affect performance.





Q.What does oleofilic mean?
A. Click to reveal:


Oleofilic is a natural tendency to absorb oil. Coatings that are oleofilic help the oil retention of the coating and reduces the wear on the surface.





Q.When I do a big bore what should I jet my carburetor to?
A. Click to reveal:


Please see our jetting guidelines.





Q.What are the advantages to running a plated cylinder compared to a cast cylinder?
A. Click to reveal:


In most cases, your cylinder was not designed to run with an iron liner. Installing a sleeve not only adds weight to your cylinder, increases operating temperatures, but you will also be sacrificing the unbeatable wear characteristics of an NSC coating.  An iron liner will wear 10 times faster than a plated cylinder, resulting in too much piston to wall clearance. Which can result in engine failures. In addition, re-plating your cylinder with NSC will almost always be less expensive and less time consuming.





Q.Can you plate cast iron?
A. Click to reveal:


We can plate many materials, cast iron included. By plating cast iron the cylinder will have all the benefits of NSC except the heat transfer. These benefits include 10 times better wear resistance, more horsepower, and better ring seal.





Q.Do you offer porting packages for my two stroke and four stroke application?
A. Click to reveal:


We offer many porting options for two and four stroke applications. We recommend calling one of our sales technicians to discuss all options available for your specific needs.





Q.What do the packages that you offer give me as far as horsepower gain?
A. Click to reveal:


Depending on what your performance needs are, we can offer power gains and performance improvement for just about any application. We recommend calling one of our sales technicians to discuss all options available for your specific needs.





Q.Is there damage that can’t be fixed? – What then?
A. Click to reveal:


Most times we can fix just about anything however, there are few scenarios that the damage just can’t be repaired. We recommend calling one of our sales technicians to discuss all options available for your specific needs if repair can’t be completed.





Q.What is the difference between what you and your competition do?
A. Click to reveal:


We are the largest replating facility in the world. We use those resources to ensure that we have the highest quality and environmental standards in the industry.  With that volume there isn’t anything new to us. We produce cylinders for governments, original manufactures, race teams, and development engineers as well as thousands of customers just like you.

Our Mission



Booking commercial airline travel is easy. Booking a private jet charter is not.... We aim to change that.

Why should it be so tedious to book a private aircraft charter? We don't think it should be.
                         Introducing JetCharters.com - our mission is to remove the mystery and put
                        all the information on air charter and jet charter at your fingertips. That means with as little
                        as one search or one phone call, you can research private planes available at charter airports
                        around the world. Refine your search by airport, location, airplane type or whatever search
                        criteria you choose, connect with the private charter operator and get ready to take your next
                        trip.






Facts about private Jet Charters

A jet charter allows you access to 5000 destination charter airports vs. just 500.
Chartering a jet allows you to accomplish the most demanding business itinerary.
The service and convenience a private jet charter provides is unparalleled.
Whether a jet or air charter, travel anywhere, anytime on your schedule.
At private terminals, avoid crowded security lines of commercial airports and the jets
                                they serve.
                            
Your charter vacation starts the minute you board the private jet - not when you get to
                                your destination.
                            
You can have the charter operator plan catering aboard your next jet charter.
Travel with who you want aboard a charter jet.
Over 400 jets in our private jet search system.

Jet Charters - taking the hassle out of planning your next private
                            aircraft charter.







JetCharters Mobile
The JetCharters.com application makes arranging private aviation easier for retail charter
                            consumers by allowing one click access to aircraft near their current location, or by
                            searching cities or airports. Users also have instant access to discount one way flight
                            availability and the lastest in industry news.

                    the operating standard at which aircraft safety, regulations, maintenance, and pilot licensure are
                    ensured.

Safety
At Private Flight Network, safety has and continues to be our #1 priority. Our safety and security practices are of the highest quality and are taken very seriously, not only meeting, but exceeding the FAA requirements. In addition to the FAA training our crew must comply with every six months, we have an internal Safety Management System (SMS) in which all employees are required to follow.
These procedures are often evaluated and modified as we strive to improve and be the safest operation possible. At Private Flight Network, we ensure that all components of our safety standards are met on every trip to provide the safest travel possible.







Value
Part of our job at Private Flight Network is to identify the most economical solutions to fit your unique requirements. As we customize a program for you, there are no buy-in fees, markups, or extended obligations.
Strong relationships with vendors and fleet discount programs provide competitive pricing on fuel, training, insurance, maintenance and other services. The discounts we negotiate are always passed through to our clients to ensure complete satisfaction.







Service
Find comfort in the fact that you will be working one-on-one with an expert who not only you know, but more importantly, who knows you. At Private Flight Network, there are no automated phone systems or layers of middle management. We pride ourselves on our exceptional communication with clients and their satisfaction.
Our team at Private Flight Network shares a common love for aviation and a genuine desire to provide an exceptional service that is often neglected by larger management companies.







Global
While our headquarters are based in Morristown, NJ, Private Flight Network is a global operation. Over the years, we have established many relationships and developed an extensive network of charter operators, brokers, vendors and many other industry professionals that extend and expand our world wide capabilities.
Many of our clients travel around the world on a regular basis, and we at Private Flight Network are with them every step of the way to ensure a safe journey and hassle free experience.
