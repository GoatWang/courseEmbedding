Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the KAR Auction Services First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only-mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Eliason, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin.
Michael Eliason - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Thanks, Chelsea. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for the KAR Auction Services first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Today, we will discuss the financial performance of KAR Auction Services for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. After concluding our commentary, we will take questions from participants.
Before Jim kicks off our discussion, I would like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may affect KAR's business, prospects and results of operations, and such risks are fully detailed in our SEC filings. In providing forward-looking statements, the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update these statements.
Lastly, let me mention that throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the applicable GAAP financial measure can be found in the press release that we issued yesterday, which is also available in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Now, I'd like to turn this call over to KAR Auction Services' CEO, Jim Hallett. Jim?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Thank you, Michael, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to our call.
Let me start with laying out what I plan on covering on today's call in my comments. I want to provide a update on our guidance for 2017, give you an overview of our performance in the first quarter, discuss what we're seeing in the marketplaces that we serve. I'd like to talk about a couple of key strategies that we have going on within KAR and then provide you with some information on our acquisition of DRIVIN that was announced in mid-April, and then I'd like to finish up with an update on our plans to refinance our existing debt.
So, starting with our guidance for 2017, I can tell you that I feel very, very good about our performance of our businesses and more or so our outlook as we continue to move forward. There are no changes to our previous guidance as you saw in our earnings release. The cars are coming to auctions. And as I like to say, nobody is stockpiling these vehicles. These vehicles are primarily commercial vehicles, off-lease vehicles, repos and fleet vehicles and these cars are going to sell.
They traditionally sell at a very high conversion rate the first time through and if they don't sell first time through for one reason or another, we know they're definitely going to get sold second time through, the vehicles are not leaving our auction once they arrive there.

So, with that said, I would also mention that we continue to see the value in the complementary nature of our various businesses that we've spoken about many times. And again, I remain positive not only in the near term, but in the longer term outlook for KAR.
As I look at our first quarter performance, the quarter fell right in line with our consolidated expectations. We had a solid performance at Insurance Auto Auctions where we're seeing strong top- and bottom-line growth in the salvage industry, or in the salvage business.
I was most pleased that we were able to control the SG&A in this segment and we saw the increased volumes and revenues drive strong growth in the adjusted EBITDA.
Inventory levels at IAA were up 17% over the prior year at March 31 and I would mention that the relatively mild winter conditions allowed us to reduce the backlog of vehicles which definitely served as a bonus for our insurance customers. We still have strong inventory levels and this bodes very well in terms of setting up the second quarter.
At AFC, results were generally in line with our expectations. As we mentioned in our yearend call, we said that we would see more moderate growth in the number of the loan transactions throughout 2017. We now have visibility into the second and third quarter performance. We will continue to see elevated loan losses in the second quarter like we experienced in the first quarter. However, with that said, we are seeing substantial improvement late in the second quarter and into the third quarter on our current performance in the loan portfolio. And we continue to expect that loan losses for 2017 will be in the 1.75% to the 2.25% for the year that we outlined on our previous call.
Like the other business segments, ADESA's performance fell in line with our expectations. With that said, the month-to-month performance within the quarter was what I would term as very choppy. We had a strong January and a strong March and in between February was a different story, as it fell well below our expectations. This was consistent with retail sales of used cars in the U.S. where delays in the processing of tax refunds had an impact. Normally, we would not be discussing our performance trends on a month-to-month basis but I did feel it was important to mention this as it did impact our margins in the first quarter.
The better news, or the good news, is that the supply of commercial vehicles continues to be remain very strong throughout 2017.
A couple of trends that we're seeing going on within our business, very positive trends in the salvage business. Miles driven is growing and fuel prices remain relatively low. We're seeing improvement in commodity prices that will contribute to higher auction values at the low end of the salvage market. Lower used car prices increase the likelihood of an accident resulting in a total loss. Technology and safety advancements are also increasing the likelihood of insurance claims resulting in a total loss.
And one of the challenges in the growth of the salvage business is space constraints, and we expect that we will be adding hundreds of acres of land to meet the needs of our customers in the salvage business in 2017. And I would point out that this expansion of acquiring this land was contemplated in our guidance for 2017.
Our finance business, AFC, is experiencing slower growth this year as expected. The word I would use to describe our lending practices at AFC is disciplined; very disciplined. We have not changed our risk tolerance or our underwriting practices. We are expecting slower growth at AFC than in our other businesses, but this is due to the market served by the independent used car dealers, who is the primary customer at AFC.
For ADESA, I mentioned the choppiness of the performance in the first quarter, and let me clarify that choppy does not mean bad. The supply of commercial vehicles will be well above our prior-year levels and all of these cars will get sold as I mentioned earlier. We expect used car prices to decline about 5% in 2017, due to the increased supply.

With that said, none of this changes our outlook for ADESA in 2017. A couple of areas of strategic focus going on within KAR is, we are focused on entering new international markets and becoming a key player in the markets that we serve. We have started this strategic initiative in the UK. We are seeing excellent progress in the UK market as we develop a platform for meaningful growth in future years. We continue to see great interest in our online and our mobile technologies in the UK market and we have confirmed that we can be a disruptive competitor in these new markets with an asset-light business model. And my goal is to see the UK market become a meaningful contributor to our consolidated results in the next couple of years. And now, we are beginning to focus on other geographies. We have been in the process of developing a pipeline of potential acquisitions in new international markets.
Another strategic initiative that we're focused on is bringing improved data and analytical capabilities to our customers. This begins by leveraging the significant data generated by the large number of transactions processed in all of KAR's businesses. We have developed a data science team that is focused on taking large amounts of disparate data and turning it into actionable intelligence. We have introduced our data science capabilities to a number of customers and we are now working on specific projects designed to help our customers navigate the changing used car marketplace.
Integrating our data and analytics capabilities with our mobile, online and physical offerings will be an important differentiator for all of our businesses. We need to help our customers make better decisions on when and what channel and at what price to sell their vehicles. And that is why we acquired DRIVIN. DRIVIN will be an important component of our data and analytics offerings.
First, the DRIVIN organization brings key talent to our team that will allow us to accelerate the pace of developing solutions for our customers. They will work out of their current Chicago location and will give us access to the data science talent that is forming in the Chicago high-tech community.
We are integrating the DRIVIN team with our existing data science team and our technology-based service platforms within ADESA. The DRIVIN team will clearly contribute to our existing customers at ADESA and especially our commercial consigners and our online businesses. We expect we will see the results of their work in our organic growth within ADESA.
Recently I've been spending considerable time with many of our major customers and if there is one hot button that customers are talking to me about is how can we help them make better decisions on selling their vehicles, especially with the onslaught of these off-lease cars that are coming to the market. So, with that said, I'm very, very excited that I was able to announce to our customers that we've doubled down on our data science team, that we have acquired DRIVIN and we've brought this talent and this technology into our organization.
So with that, let me finish with a brief comment on our plans to refinance our debt. Current market conditions are making it possible for us to refinance our current debt at lower interest rates. At the same time, we may have an opportunity to issue bonds that fix the interest rate on a portion of our debt, and Eric will cover this in more detail here in a few moments.
As I look on the last 75 days since our last call, a lot has happened, and I am pleased with the performance and I like how our businesses are positioned. We've been able to respond to the market conditions and deliver on our targets. We continued to benefit from the complementary nature of all of KAR's businesses. We have strategic initiatives in place that will provide a platform for continued growth and we will continue to generate a lot of cash. And we will find ways to use that cash to create shareholder value. This is a great time to be in this industry and it's a great time to be part of KAR.

I'll now turn it over to Eric for his comments. We'll come back to you for some Q&A and maybe some closing comments from myself. With that, I'll give it to Eric. Thank you. Eric.
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. I would like to cover a couple of items in more detail. Let me start with a quick overview of our consolidated results. Revenues grew 14% in the first quarter, which led to an 11% increase in adjusted EBITDA and a 13% increase in operating adjusted net income per share.
We benefited from a lower effective income tax rate in the first quarter, as the benefit from stock-based compensation is recognized as a reduction in income tax expense beginning in 2017 in accordance with the new accounting pronouncements on accounting for stock-based compensation.
Previously, this income tax benefit was recorded as an increase in additional paid-in capital. I would like to point out that the impact on our first quarter effective tax rate is higher than what we expect the impact to be for the full year. A majority of our stock-based compensation programs have vesting dates in the first quarter.
Now, let me speak to a couple of items affecting the results of our business segments. ADESA had 20% growth in revenue and 20% growth in adjusted EBITDA.
Gross profit as a percent of revenue was down slightly, but this is consistent with our expectations when revenue growth is driven by the increase in revenue per unit as it was in the first quarter.
While volume growth was attributable to the online-only sales and acquired auction locations, the improvement in revenue per unit reflects the impact of the shift in mix of commercial vehicles to 56% of vehicles sold in 2017, from 53% of vehicles sold at physical auction in 2016. While our same-store volume growth was only 4% in the first quarter and flat year-over-year at physical auctions, I remind you that we had a tough comparison when looking back to last year's first quarter which was up 17% for total volume and 10% for the same-store year-over-year. Despite the modest increase in volume, we still had 8% same-store revenue growth in the first quarter.
As Jim mentioned earlier, February really weighed on our adjusted EBITDA margins in the first quarter. This was seen in the slight decrease in incremental adjusted EBITDA margins on a same-store basis. The good news is our integration activities are well underway and we saw an increased adjusted EBITDA margin from our acquired businesses in Q1.
Insurance Auto Auctions' performance in the first quarter was excellent. Double-digit volume growth drove double-digit revenue growth, increased gross profit as a percent of revenue and an 18% increase in adjusted EBITDA. While revenue per vehicle sold was flat year-over-year, we are seeing signs of improvement in scrap prices that could be a positive factor in future quarters.
The AFC segment is a little bit more difficult to analyze. The provision for credit losses is recorded as a reduction in net revenue for our finance company. Accordingly, net revenue declined in the first quarter as compared to the prior year. The number of loan transactions in Q1 was flat in comparison to the prior year and the provision for loan losses negatively impacted revenue per loan transaction by $12 as compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the provision for loan losses, we saw a nice growth in fee and interest income as a result of higher average loan balances and a modest increase in interest rates charged to our customers.
We are seeing improved performance in the portfolio for new loans that is consistent with our expectations for lower loan losses in the second half of the year. Loan losses as a percent of managed receivables were 2.5% in the first quarter and will remain at elevated levels in the second quarter.

Now, turning to our guidance for 2017. Our outlook has not changed. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $825 million to $850 million; net income per share of $1.70 to $1.80 and operating adjusted net income per share of $2.15 to $2.25. Although our guidance has not changed, we have considered the impact of our proposed refinancing and re-pricing of existing debt, the acquisition of DRIVIN and the impact of stock-based compensation on our effective income tax rate in determining and updating our expectations for 2017.
Now, let me discuss in more detail our plans to refinance and re-price our existing debt. We currently have approximately $2.4 billion of debt outstanding. This represents the aggregate borrowings under term loan B2, term loan B3 and our revolving credit facility.
Based on discussions with our advisors, we believe we can refinance a portion of our debt by issuing unsecured senior notes at a fixed rate. The remaining senior secured debt may be re-priced at lower interest costs than the current facilities.
The effort to refinance and re-price our debt will be pursued on a best efforts-basis and there is no assurance as to the amount or timing of the proposed transactions.
So, that concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn it back to Chelsea and we will now take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good morning, guys. Your tax rate was fairly low in 1Q and you mentioned the impact of stock-based comp, but you maintained your full year expectation of 37%. Do you think that your effective tax rate is really going to be 38.5% for the rest of the year to make that 37% for the full year or is that just some conservatism on your part?
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Well, Liz, it's what we think, but it's driven by the fact that this benefit is all in Q1, I'll have (18:50) a full year of earnings. If it has an impact, it will be fairly minor relative to the effective tax rate and what we expected at the beginning of the year. And our higher tax rate is really driven by state taxes more than federal taxes and that's the unpredictable portion is what will it actually turn out to be. I'm hoping for good news, but not counting on it.
Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, great. Thanks. In next quarter, the Brashers acquisition will have anniversaried. So, again, as we're thinking about organic volume growth, what are your expectations for the rest of the year, obviously we have some somewhat tough comps. So, I mean do you think somewhere in the mid single-digits is reasonable for organic growth or is it likely to kind of stay in the lower range?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Yeah, Liz, I would think that we would expect it to be in that mid-single-digit range or perhaps a little bit better. As we look at – we have a good feel for the existing business, for the new business we've been able to put in place. And then with the volumes that are coming, as Eric would say, we feel good about mid single digits, and we would hope that it could be a little bit higher in that.
Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. And I'll just squeeze in one more quick one which is, with used vehicle pricing coming down on a like-for-like basis, do you think it's reasonable to assume that your revenue per vehicle at ADESA could continue to trend positively just due to mix shift, or do you expect to see some pressure there by the end of the year?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
No, first and foremost I would say that, with pricing – although you didn't necessarily ask it this way, we're very focused on the transaction. We're very focused on getting the car and selling the car. And we know that more and more of these cars are going to be these off-lease cars, and as they get to physical auctions, they are the heavy users of these ancillary services. And now we're starting to see revenues that start with an eight, and those are the numbers that we haven't seen in the past. So, I think our revenues continue to improve.

Elizabeth Lane Suzuki - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. Thanks very much.
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC
Hey, good morning, guys.
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Hi, Bret.
Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC
A couple quick questions. And I guess, I'll start with dealer consignment and obviously it stabilized sequentially in the quarter. Could you give us maybe an outlook and where we might expect to see the trends go from here? I think it had gone from sort of a minus 3% midyear last year to minus 7%. And obviously given the comparisons and some of the dealer trends, could you maybe give us an outlook?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Yeah, Bret. First of all, I can tell you that it's very much in line with our expectations and what we were thinking it would come in at. Before we went into the recession, if you go back a number of years, we were heavily weighted on commercial where we're 70% commercial and 30% dealer. And as we worked our way through the recession, we're able to bring that balance to 50%-50%.
And we always felt that as we went into the cyclical recovery that there would be no question that the off-lease cars would displace some of these dealer consignment cars. And quite frankly, it didn't happen as fast as we thought it would happen, it held up stronger as you probably heard me say before.
We currently, I think Eric reported we're 56% commercial in the quarter, and 44% dealer. We think that number will look somewhere like 60%-40% when it's all said and done. We think that's kind of the numbers that we're pointing to and that's what our expectation would be.
Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC
Okay, great. And then on the IAA, we've heard a lot about hail and flooding in the recent past, are we seeing any sort of catastrophic event growth in the current quarter around IAA? And just sort of a second question on IAA while I have you, what's the export volume looking like, is there any change either around a strong dollar or relative change to the dollar versus the volumes that are sold at IAA that are going overseas?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Yeah. So, let me first of all say, catastrophic events, hail, storms, hurricanes, snow, sleet, ice, all that stuff related, those events are always going to be part of our industry, always part of what we do. We don't factor them in one way or the other.
Normally when they happen, they are obviously to our benefit and they're good for our business and it's good that we can provide this service for our customers. So, not predictable, not something that we build into our plans, but when they happen, it's good for our business.
So with that, the second part of the question on the exporting in the currency, I'm going to let Eric take that.
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Yeah. Bret, good question. We're still seeing active export activity. Even though the U.S. dollar is strong, gross auction proceeds or average price paid for a vehicle has come down to the point where it seems to be a very attractive transaction and we haven't seen anything that has caused a change in the interest by the international buyer. And again, we see plenty of cars going overseas, that's always been in that 25% to 30% of the vehicles and it's probably about that same amount right now going to wherever they're buying the vehicles.
Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.

Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks a lot, good morning.
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Good morning, Eric.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
A couple questions, first, on the whole car business and this was asked, I think a couple questions ago, maybe a bit differently. So, we have a couple quarters now under our belt with 4% unit growth ex acquisitions. And I know you talked about the impact of the election in Q4 and then you had the tax rebate issue impacting the entire market plus a very stiff compare in Q1. Jim, when you were talking about mid single digits or a bit better than that, was that essentially discussing the organic unit growth so would that suggest that without those impediments to the market and with some more normative compare, you could see a bit of acceleration underlying the guide for the rest of the year?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
That would be a yes, Matt.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. And then secondly, also on whole car, Eric, you talked about I guess one unusual factor that impeded the incremental margins a little bit in the whole car business. Should we be targeting something in the 20% to 25% range as kind of a sustainable incremental margin rate with the kind of line that you guys are discussing?
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Matt, again, we talked about February really impacting incremental margins. And we saw great movement on the integration of those activities, and as was pointed out earlier, we anniversaried those. We still think we can have stronger incremental margins than the mid-20s on the invested business.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got it. And then finally on AFC, so there was a point in time, call it a year ago, when you had talked about increasing competition, and presumably some irrational pricing gunning for that business. I know that the issue for the moment is more loan losses than anything else, we're familiar with what's going on in the market. Should we assume, based on what you said about taking rates a bit higher that some of the competition that had been entering the market and impeding profitability is pulling back, giving you the opportunity for sustained better pricing? Is that visible and (26:53) are people responding to that market adversity?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Yeah, Matt, I think good point and I would call it responsible behavior. I think people have pulled their horns in a little bit and are acting in a more responsible way in terms of how we look at extending credit. Eric, you might want to add to that.
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Right. I wouldn't call it pulling back, but I don't think they're using the pricing component as a competitive lever. That's what I would say, Matt. They're still in the marketplace aggressively pursuing market share. There still seems to be ample credit available for customers, and in some cases, more than we would like to lend, and we're making sure that we aren't involved in those customers where they have too much credit. That's really where we're focused.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Understood, gentlemen. Thank you so much.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.
Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Good morning.
Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.
Focusing on the ADESA business, the gross margin is under pressure, understandably given the mix shift towards institutional commercial volume. What are some of the things that you can do operationally to sustain or prop up that margin and help alleviate some of the pressure as a function of mix?

James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Yeah. I think, a couple of things. Really there is two things that stand out to me is number one is we absolutely have to get these integrations completed that we acquired in 2016. We acquired a lot of businesses in 2016. I won't go through them all; I think you're familiar with them. But it's completing those integrations, and then the other thing that we've been focused on – I spoke a little bit about data and analytics and the acquisition that we made there.
We've also brought a lot of talent into the organization and what I would term is key talent, senior levels, highly comp – and this is really bringing the skill set in to support what we're doing in terms of growing the business and just growing the things that our customers are expecting of us. Now, for the most part, those jobs have been filled, the most part we're well into the middle innings of integration and I think you should see those margins start to improve in the back half of the year.
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
And we're referring to gross margin as well on that Ben, because part of what we do is go in with a management operating system that really focuses on maintaining direct labor in line with the volume running through the auction. So you should see it at both the gross margin line as well as the adjusted EBITDA margin line.
Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.
That's great color. Thanks. Switching gears to IAA, you came into the quarter with inventory buildup 25%; you reported 11% volume growth and then you ended the quarter with inventory up 17%. Am I right to think that perhaps activity slowed in January, February, while you were selling through the inventory you had at the end of the quarter and then picked back up in March sort of coming into 2Q? And if so, is that just a function of milder weather that we saw during the quarter, maybe help me think through some of the sequencing of that?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Yeah. I'll start that conversation and then let Eric weigh in as well. At IAA, there is a much longer holding period for these vehicles. The average days to sell from the time that the car arrives to the time that it is sold is somewhere in the order of approximately 75 days. And so what you get there is you get an overlap of when the car arrives and when it actually gets sold and it could arrive in one quarter and go into the next quarter. So, you have to think about the processing and the time that it takes to process those vehicles. With that, Eric, you want to add?
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Yeah. And Ben, I'd point out, last year's first quarter was up 14% over 2015. Again, I don't want to complain about our comps, because they're great news in the past. But we were up against a tough compare, we had very strong flow-through in the auctions and the weather actually helped us get more cars out and that helped us reduce that inventory level a little bit, which is what our insurance carriers were pursuing. So, I would tell you it was all good news in the first quarter in the way it came together.
Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.
That's great. And then just one last one on the acquisition strategy, you highlighted some international markets that you're looking at, I assume both potentially ADESA and IAA; how do you think about the sort of critical mass that you need to achieve when entering a new market to make the economics work on that business? And what kind of pace do you think about, is the pipeline relatively robust? Or is this – I would assume it's a longer-term time horizon to sort out build out the capacity that you might need?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Yeah. So a couple things there that I'd mention is, first and foremost I would say that we're focused on mature vehicle markets, where the cars are. And I think a great way to maybe explain it – a good way for me to explain it is to take a look at what we did in the UK. We went into the UK, we focused on businesses that we feel we know something about, businesses that we operate here in North America.

We wanted to buy smaller existing businesses that have a customer base that we could grow in the businesses and we did it in salvage, we did it in an online platform with GRS and we introduced TradeRev. But maybe really, really key was our focus on the management team. Whenever you go into these international markets, certainly I believe that I and the management team support the fact that there's nobody from North America going over there to tell these people how to run their business.
And we have to have management teams that we're very confident in that not only know and understand the business that are interested in staying locked down and being part of our business going forward and we've been successful in doing that. So as we look at these businesses, and we look at new geographies, we're really looking at opportunities in all of our businesses; could be in salvage, whole car, could be with some of our other products and some of our services, a lot of our technologies that are very much in demand around the world that don't exist in other parts of the world.
So it's kind of assessing and prioritizing and looking at them one at a time and then I guess the great debate is, which one comes first. And that's something that we just have to take one step at a time in terms of where we get to with the seller and at what point we get there. But I would tell you without getting specific, there are a number of opportunities and we feel good about where we are in those discussions and we feel even better about where we are in those relationships and the things that we think about that are important to us. So with that said, I would say, we hope to be able to deliver you some good news on that front going forward.
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
And I'll add, we want to get started quickly, but this is a multi-year effort, because what we've learned is when we buy these businesses, we need to allow time for integration and to nurture them and bring to them the capabilities of KAR. So look to get started as quickly as they make sense, but it will be over multiple years that we build out that capability in new markets.
Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, guys. Best of luck.

Thank you. Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning, this is Samik here on behalf of Ryan. Jim, thanks for your comments on New Wave and just wanted to check with you, particularly in terms of timing based on the progress you've made, do you still feel comfortable with the timing. I think you earlier have mentioned that you should be able to launch something later this year. Earlier on this call, you mentioned you are doing specific projects with New Wave. And also in terms of technical capabilities, looks like DRIVIN will be helping in the launch of New Wave. Do you think you need more capabilities, more technical capabilities or acquisitions to sort of provide a integrated platform to the customer?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Yeah. So if I got all your questions, let me say, first of all, New Wave we obviously announced the capital investment of $20 million, $25 million over the next three years. I would say we're at the very front of that project. Obviously we've begun the work, but we're in the early stages and really nothing more than I can report other than I believe that the feedback from our employees and the feedback from our customers have been very positive. As I've been out talking with customers and visiting with customers, they're very complimentary of the fact that we continue to make the investment in New Wave.

With that said, your comment on DRIVIN, I would ask you to think of DRIVIN as a complementary service or a complementary company to what takes place within New Wave and within some of our other products and service offerings as well. And is there an opportunity to acquire more businesses like DRIVIN, I think you asked. I would say to you if there was an opportunity that came along and made sense and it was a good fit and we thought it would even build out our service more, obviously we would take a look at it, because in the big scheme of things, these are relatively small investments.
Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Got it. And secondly just on the IAA group, the average revenue per unit there was roughly consistent with 1Q last year and this is despite a pretty strong increase that we saw in crushed auto body prices. I'm wondering what the headwinds probably there were; you mentioned the export market is still quite strong, so maybe what headwinds are you seeing that's offsetting the better commodity environment there?
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
The commodity environment that we read about is typically being driven by the recyclers. We have a little bit of a lag before we typically see it in the prices paid at the salvage auctions. So that's why I'm optimistic, as I mentioned in my commentary, that we'll see it in future quarters because seeing it hold – we saw some increases last year that didn't hold and it never really was seen in the low-end car.
Right now, we're seeing some positive trends where we think it will start showing up as we get later in the year and come through. So, the recycling that – or the commodity prices you're seeing really are related to what the recyclers are selling their crushed auto body for, after they've bought our car.
Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking up the questions.
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Kennison with Baird. Your line is now open.
Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, Hertz recently called out the Uber risk to the car rental model. What is your exposure to the rental fleet and how do you assess the opportunity with ridesharing over time?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Great question. I would say in a word, opportunity. As you think about ridesharing, these are going to be very, very large fleets and these fleets are going to be very much interested in using – I believe in using the auction services. Number one is there's not only an opportunity to sell these vehicles, but I believe that there's going to be an opportunity to maintain and service these vehicles as well, which we have facilities that can provide those services which will be a good thing for KAR.
The other area that I expect that could benefit here is many of these cars in ridesharing would be expected to come back with, say, 300,000 miles on them. I believe that those vehicles will be very, very ripe for the export market and do very, very well in the export market. The other thing is when you start thinking about ridesharing and you start thinking about cars with 300,000 miles on them, start to think about the number of turns that these vehicles could take.
It's like when we're returning vehicles in the rental fleet every six months, right, the miles are going to build up very, very fast. So this isn't a rideshare car coming in and maybe turning once every three years. This is possibly ridesharing building up these miles and turning over with much more velocity, maybe one or two or three times more than what just a single lease car or rental car would, which I believe is going to produce more cars coming into the industry overall.

Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
That's great. And then I had a question on TradeRev. I'm just curious where you see the intersection between TradeRev and OPENLANE and whether having both of those assets has created any new opportunities?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Yeah. So when you think about OPENLANE and TradeRev, I do believe that it just gives us an additional channel, it gives customers an additional choice in a little bit different environment. As you think about OPENLANE, we're focused on the off-lease cars, we're focused on the private-label business and we're focused on really, really selling those cars in a bid now, buy now environment.
And when you think about TradeRev, TradeRev is the opportunity to be able to sell vehicles for our dealers and our commercial consigners over a mobile application. And again, a very short time period, an hour in duration, happens very, very quickly, and it just becomes another channel. We talk about the waterfall, and may be a term that I haven't used that much in the past but you'll be hearing a lot more about the waterfall as I go forward.
In the waterfall, it used to be that it would go to a closed sale, then it would go to an open sale and from an open sale, then it would move to a physical sale. And as you know, we had two exclusive opportunities in the open and the closed sale. Well, now think about TradeRev becoming another channel in that waterfall. So, now it would go close, it would go open, and now we're having customers move it to TradeRev before they go to shipping it to a physical auction. So I think there is a real opportunity where TradeRev comes in and complements what's going on in OPENLANE.
Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thanks. And a quick question for Eric on DRIVIN, how should we expect that to flow thorough the financial statements?
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Craig, it will have no impact on our expectations in 2017 and beginning in 2018 we think we will see it through our organic growth because again it's a data-oriented service offering. They have a couple of other revenue platforms that are very insignificant, and that will continue, but primarily you will see it in our organic growth in the existing businesses of ADESA.
Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Will it just show up as additional revenue per unit?
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Yeah, probably more; we're expecting it could have an impact on conversion rates and therefore the total volume in any of our channels; that would be online as well as physical.
Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.

James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Good morning.
Matthew Paige - G.research LLC
Just a couple of questions left for me. The first is, one technology we haven't touched on yet in this call is Autoniq, so I was wondering if you could just provide an update on that and talk about customer acceptance of the product and where you're seeing the opportunity going?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Yeah. So, you were very, very faint there, but I got your question, give you an update on Autoniq, which is another great story. We acquired this company a couple years ago, it's a subscription-based business that provides, really aggregates the data on the valuation of vehicles from all the different data sources over your iPhone. We continue to grow that business very, very nicely. Our subscriptions continue to grow. We continue to penetrate the franchise, as well as the independent market. And I would tell you, performing not only to our expectations, but maybe performing a little beyond our expectations. So very, very pleased with Autoniq. And as we think about Autoniq, now we think about how we can integrate Autoniq with some of our other offerings.

So, as you think about OPENLANE, you think about TradeRev, you think about some of the things we're doing with DRIVIN and we think about data and analytics, it's how do we bring all those forces together to provide a better outcome for our customers. So, again, glad you asked the question because it's a great story.
Matthew Paige - G.research LLC
Great, thanks. And hopefully this is a little bit better, but you also mentioned international opportunities. Are there any geographic areas in the North American market that you feel that IAA or ADESA are not well represented and you'd want to expand your presence?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
I think we're well represented in the markets that we certainly want to be in and I get asked this question from investors. I would tell you that there is probably a handful of markets that we would still take a look at if they were to come available. We would certainly continue to take a look at them; nothing imminent or on the radar as we speak right now.
Internationally, it's wide open. I mean the opportunities there, it's just a question of how soon can we get to them, and we're probably being very cautious in terms of how fast we go, although I do believe speed wins. But we've had a couple of press releases here in the last little while about two major pilots we rolled out with two of the largest leasing and fleet companies in the world, Arval and Motability.
And those pilots have gone very, very well, where we've seen our customers report back to us. They're pleased with the technology but they are even more pleased with eliminating the days to sell, and the fact of the matter is, we've been able to achieve more net proceeds than what they've been able to achieve at the physical auctions that they were using.
So again, a lot of geography, a lot of markets, a lot of interest, not only from dealers but from the fleets and from the OEMs. I believe the opportunity is really unlimited, it's just a case of how quickly can we get to them.
Matthew Paige - G.research LLC

I want to dig a little deeper in DRIVIN. Could you talk to us a little bit more about the business model itself, is this is a product for the OPENLANE customers, the dealer customers or both, and do they take inventory or is it just an agency transaction?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Yeah. So let me start by saying, first of all, DRIVIN has a transactional component platform that it can transact business on, but that was not what attracted us to the business. We were attracted to the business for the analytics capabilities that they have and the talent that they had within their organization. As we thought about our data science team, and I may have mentioned this before, but forgive me for repeating if I am.
I've been spending a lot of time with customers. And what customers are really focused on right now is these volumes that are coming at them. And they really have limited information. Our customers have information on their cars. KAR has information on cars within the entire industry. So we have millions and millions of data points.
And what our customers have really come to us and the conversations I'm having along with our senior management team is it's kind of the conversations are, Jim, how can you take our data along with all this industry data and how can you turn this into predictive analytics? How can you turn this into actionable intelligence that will help us make better decisions on, number one, what's the best channel to sell the car in, what's the best market to sell the vehicle and then what price should I be getting for the car? All those things. And this is really what DRIVIN brings to the table.

Now, we were building a data science team here, doing a very good job of building a data science team and attracting some really good talent. But we knew if we continued to build that it was going to take perhaps two to three years to build out that team and attracting the data scientists and the PhDs that we would require.
And I kind of would go back and compare it to what we did with OPENLANE. When we bought OPENLANE in 2011, we had the opportunity to try and build this service or buy this service. We bought OPENLANE and everybody knows what a great decision that turned to be.
And this is kind of similar here. Do we build it, or do we go out and acquire it. We went out and we acquired it. And we think it really accelerates the pace, because these customers don't have two to three years to wait for the pricing models and the pricing engines that we're going to build for them; they need it today.
And so really what we're going to do, and I believe I mentioned in my commentary, is we're going to bring that DRIVIN team, and we're going merge it with our data science team that we've been building here at ADESA or at KAR, and I can tell you, we're now going to the market, we're ready to go to the market almost immediately. We're in discussions with some of our major customers on building these pricing engines and we're talking about rolling out pilots here, as early as the second quarter of the year. So this ship is sailing and we don't want to miss the opportunity.
Bob J. Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.
Got it. And so in terms of if it's not primarily transaction based, it's subscription based, or how does the revenue model work?
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Bob, the revenue model – the interesting part, the revenue model will vary based upon the customer. But we will generally realize the value through the transactions, but not the transactions of DRIVIN, the transactions of ADESA.
Bob J. Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.

James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Good morning, Gary.
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Hey, Gary.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Couple of questions. Number one, Eric, what gives you the confidence that, in the back half of the year, the reserves at AFC are going to decline, relative to the first two quarters?
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
So Gary, what's interesting is, you have visibility into what the performance of new loans is doing. And we've already seen improvement in the portfolio for loans made in the last 90 days. So again, we have visibility into actual transactions and the things that are causing the write-offs and the bad debt now are cars that were perhaps put on the floor plan and current at the end of last year that aren't selling and you start to get the age of the vehicle and things like that. So we have all of that information. That's what gives us the confidence. It's real data on the actual loans that are outstanding.
It is little harder to look into Q4 but we already have visibility into things that we've loaned on now, what's again, the payoff rate, et cetera, because if it's not paid off now those will start to become issues in Q3.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Okay. So, some of the steps that you outlined, I think in the Q4 call as far as future lending are starting to take hold and you're just doing a better job of it?
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.

Right. I think we always did a great job of lending the money. What we've done is focused on what part of the market do we have the least risk and it's actually the lower end of the market. And as we mentioned in the yearend call, it's really these large balances that have caused the issue in the last couple of quarters. And deemphasizing that and not taking as much exposure into that part of the market is paying off for us.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then the choppiness that you saw in the independent dealer market in Q1, attributed to some of these tax refunds not coming through in February, does that portend that coming out of Q1, you were still seeing the independent dealer market, was still showing some strength and then that would translate into a better environment for the auction business itself?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Yeah, Gary, I think that we would expect that there will be continued increase in kind of what's taken place as we now get these tax refunds coming through. We would expect that independent market to pick up a little bit.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Okay. So it wasn't to have anything to do with the fact of extension of credit to the independent dealers for selling cars, it was just – a lot of it how had do with that tax issue?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Yeah, I think what happened is independent dealers got caught holding some inventory and they weren't able to move their inventory, which kind of choked them a little bit. And their only release was to either take that car back to the wholesale market and be forced with perhaps some potential losses or holding the vehicles. And I think they've had to some vehicles and now they've got to work their way through vehicles that were maybe bought at a little bit of a higher price in the previous market that they now have to liquidate in the current market.
Eric M. Loughmiller - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
And Gary, I'd like to remind you what Jim said, with a strong January and strong March, the inventory they bought in January didn't sell at the same pace that they expected. That's what slows it down, they sell the cars, March picks up again.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. Then lastly on DRIVIN, who is the end customer? I mean, I went to their website, I looked at it, it looked like a specialized, almost, search engine for dealer-to-dealer transactions. And from what you're talking about, it seems that you're going to more or less emphasize the data versus the dealer-to-dealer transactions. So who is the end customer? Is it your consigners, it that the dealers? How does this all work? And then the other question would be, where are they getting the data from, or where would you get the data from? Are there direct connects into the dealer's VMS system?
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Okay. So there is a lot there, Gary, but let me try and get that for you. First of all, understand that I did say that DRIVIN has a platform where they can transact and what I was referring to there is, we're servicing both the sellers and the buyers in terms of matching vehicles. DRIVIN has the ability to be able to know and understand a dealer's inventory, what inventory he buys, what inventory he sells, and to be able to match the inventory needs with the inventory that is being offered.
So, there is that capability where we serve the buyer and the seller, but then from the data standpoint, the data is really focused on helping these major commercial consigners. I think about the OEMs and the captive finance and the fleets and the rental companies and that whole commercial segment is helping them better understand the pricing of their vehicles. And then when you move the vehicle through the system, there is usually a reason why the vehicle doesn't sell in a close environment and it's either price or condition.

So, when that vehicle comes from a closed environment to the open environment, there has to be – there should be a price adjustment there, there should be a price adjustment unless it's just purely condition. But so, it's helping them understand how to price that vehicle in the open market. And then if it doesn't sell in the open market, then I mentioned to you, there's an opportunity to re-price that car and put it on TradeRev, because you would go through all these channels to avoid maybe the transportation costs and the days to sell, the depreciation cost of actually sending it to a physical auction.
So, it's helping these customers make better upstream decisions before they decided to finally send it to a physical auction. And this is where this data is really going to help them and as I said, I've sat in on a number of presentations and the discussions are very much heading in a direction where customers are really saying, think we need this help.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back to Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Jim Hallett, for closing remarks.
James P. Hallett - KAR Auction Services, Inc.
Thank you, Chelsea, and maybe I can just take a moment here and wrap up today with a few additional comments is first and foremost, I want to thank you for being on the call, and I want to thank you for the interest that you continue to take in our company. One of the things that I look back on is – as I look back on my career, over 40 years in the retail car business, over 30 years in the auction business, and I've seen a lot of change, and priding myself as an entrepreneur, I very much welcome change and I embrace change. But I will tell you, I've never seen change at the pace of change that we're seeing in the current market.
The customers' expectations, their pain points, the areas in which they need help and require help and the services that they need is accelerated beyond anything I've ever seen in my career. But the good news about that is, I feel that we, KAR, have never been in a better position to provide that service and to deal with this rate of change as we're positioned to today.
If I can, if you think about it just for a moment, we came together in 2007, and we got off to a great start and then along came the recession, we're working our way through the recession. We acquired OPENLANE in a down market at a critical time and we all know how that worked out, and then we went into the recovery in 2013, and we continued to focus on acquiring businesses that will continue to improve our customers' experience, help their economic outcome and take this company and transform it to another level.
And just quickly, we focused on technology and we focused on brick and mortar. We acquired TradeRev, we acquired DRIVIN, Autoniq, we acquired DataScan, we acquired CarsArrive, RDN and there is probably some that I'm leaving out there. And then we acquired brick and mortar. Last year you've seen us acquire 12 brick and mortar auctions. And then we invested in our existing platforms and we brought new benefits and features and enhancements. And with all of that, we've built a great company and we have positioned ourselves very well.
I would tell you in 2007, we may have been seen as a bit of a laggard. I can tell you today, I couldn't be more proud of this management team and what we've been able to accomplish and I see KAR very, very much as a leader in this industry, in all aspects of this industry. And now we have great visibility into 2019 and we know what's coming at us. And I would tell you, I am more confident and more enthusiastic and more energetic as to how we're prepared for what's next.

So, with that, I'll say thank you and we look forward to bringing you more good news. Have a good day.

Good day and welcome to the KAR Auction Services Q1 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Eliason. Please go ahead, sir.
Michael Eliason - Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer
Thanks, Tony. Good morning and thank you for joining us today for the KAR Auction Services first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Today, we will discuss the financial performance of KAR Auction Services for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. After concluding our commentary, we will take questions from participants.
Before Jim kicks off our discussion, I'd like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may affect KAR's business, prospects and results of operations, and such risks are fully detailed in our SEC filings. In providing forward-looking statements, the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update these statements.
Lastly, let me mention that throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the applicable GAAP financial measure can be found in the press release that we issued yesterday, which is also available in the Investor Relations section of our website.
Now, I'd like to turn this call over to KAR Auction Services' CEO, Jim Hallett. Jim?
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Great. Thank you, Michael, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our call. Today, I'd like to provide you with an outlook for the year, review our first quarter performance, and then discuss our capital allocation activities, including our expectations for the remainder of 2016.
We had a very strong first quarter and what we're seeing has caused us to update our guidance after only one quarter. We entered 2016 with a very positive view on our expected performance, and we're pleased that we have already exceeded our expectations. We continue to see very positive fundamentals that will continue through the remainder of the year. Retail new and used car activity continued to be relatively strong. And the industry supply of commercial vehicles, especially the off-lease and the repossession units, will continue to grow throughout 2016. Used car values are declining at a moderate pace.
So what does all this mean for KAR? At ADESA, we expect that we will exceed the volumes through 2016 over last year. Online-only is likely to grow at a greater pace than the physical auction volumes even not at same level as we saw in the first quarter. And the increased supply of off-lease and repo volumes should continue to support the increased volumes at physical auction. We believe the strong revenue per unit or the ARPU will continue as we see our consigners spending money on the vehicles to improve the condition, so the buyer can quickly retail the car. This is also important for maximizing the residual lease returns as well.

We do face some headwinds, especially at Insurance Auto Auctions. We continue to deal with currency and scrap prices. However, these headwinds are consistent with the expectations that we set during our guidance earlier in 2016.
The net of all of this is that we are increasing our guidance of adjusted EBITDA. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $735 million to $760 million. This will include approximately $25 million from the Brasher acquisition. And our free cash flow guidance remains the same as before. The improved operating performance is offset by an increase in cash interest expense, and free cash flow is expected to be approximately $340 million to $365 million for 2016. I will let Eric cover more details of the refinancing which drove our increase in cash interest expense for the year. All in all, our outlook for 2016 remains positive and the year is shaping up to be better than what we originally expected.
Now, let me highlight our strong first quarter performance. On a consolidated basis, we've seen our revenue grow 18% over last year; adjusted EBITDA is up 17%; and our operating adjusted EPS is up 17%. And obviously, this is a great way for us to start 2016. ADESA is driving our strong performance during the first quarter where we're seeing revenue up 22% over the prior year and 17% on a same-store basis. Volumes grew in online-only as well as at the physical auction. Our online-only was up 33%. Our physical auction volume was up 12%. And I'm very pleased to report that this also includes a 10% increase in our dealer consignment volumes year-over-year.
ARPU was up in both channels as well. Online-only ARPU was up $9 to $116 per unit. And physical auction ARPU was up $56 to $737 per unit. We're seeing strong revenue growth from transportation services and repossession-related activity. As well, we're seeing an increase in utilization of ancillary services such as reconditioning and mechanical. ADESA's adjusted EBITDA grew 35% over the prior year, 31% on a same-store basis.
And AFC is also benefiting from the strong wholesale used car activity. Revenue grew on a 10% increase in loan transactions. Average loan values are increasing, and we did see more bad debt in the first quarter than last year. The increase in bad debt expense was right in line with our expectation for the first quarter. And I think it's important to point out that the portfolio has grown 26% over the past year.
As mentioned earlier, Insurance Auto Auctions continued to face challenges in proceeds. Scrap and foreign currency negatively impact the amount bid on salvage vehicles. However, the volume is more than offsetting this pressure. And our ability to withstand these challenges demonstrates the value of our diversified business model. And this is really what Eric and I had been talking to you about for several years is really the strength of our business and the strength of our business model is how complementary these businesses are to one another, and it's really, as I say, a beautiful thing.
So, the pressure that we're seeing at IAA is offset by the strong performance in the other parts of our business. Inventory is up 4% over the prior year at March 31. This is a lower increase than we have reported for many quarters, and I believe there's a couple of things here that I would mention. Number one, I think it reflects on the mild winter conditions. And the other point I would make is we're seeing improved cycle times, especially with one of our largest insurance companies. And as you know, these improved cycle times benefit our consigners. As they say, time is money.
With that said, despite our strong performance, I know that we need to continue focusing on SG&A. And going back to the call in the previous quarter, I mentioned that we were getting laser-focused on SG&A. We've seen SG&A was up almost $20 million over the prior year, about $10 million of this increase relates to acquired SG&A and the timing of expenses for cost of our medical plan and accruals for annual bonuses. The rest of this increase relates to increases in our technology cost, people and other expenses required to support the growth in our businesses. Our management team is focused on controlling SG&A. We also realized that we need to support the growth in our businesses with the resources, so this is really a balancing act. The key is maintaining SG&A at a level that allows us to increase our adjusted EBITDA margin.

In terms of capital allocation, I think everybody is aware that we closed the Brasher's deal on April 1. This is a deal that we paid $275 million for eight auction locations. We are very excited about adding the Brasher family to the ADESA organization. This truly represents or I should say, this truly strengthens our presence in the Northwest United States where we were previously unrepresented. So with that, we have also announced plans to purchase an auction in Orlando, Florida. We have been focused on strengthening our presence in the key Florida markets. And as you probably know, Orlando is a very strong commercial market and we expect to close this transaction in the next few weeks.
We also announced the payment of our quarterly dividend at $0.29 per share, and we will continue to return capital to our shareholders in the form of a quarterly dividend. We will also evaluate all of our capital needs and utilize share repurchases as we see appropriate. I don't believe that we are done allocating capital to expanding our businesses. We are in active discussions with a number of targets, and at the right price, if these deals can make sense to us, we would certainly look to move forward on doing more acquisitions. There is no assurance that we will get any of them to the finish line in the near-term, but I do like the way our discussions are progressing. And with that, let me finish up my comments with an update on ADESA Chicago.
Construction is on target for opening in the third quarter. The customer reaction has been very, very positive. And I would say to you, as I mentioned before, Chicago is the third or fourth largest car market in the United States. We're moving into a major market that's been a big gap for us at what I would call a real opportune time as we are in the middle of the cyclical recovery. I couldn't think of a better time to be opening this location in Chicago. So, we're excited with that.
So, I'll now turn the call over to Eric for some additional comments, and then we'll come back to you for Q&A. Eric?
Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thank you, Jim. I would like to start my comments with a summary of our refinancing of long-term debt that was completed in March. On March 9, 2016, we completed the refinancing of our term loan B1 and revolving credit agreement. We issued $1.350 billion in term loan B3 at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points, with a LIBOR floor of 75 basis points. Term loan B3 matures in March 2023. We also established a $300 million revolving credit facility with interest at LIBOR plus 250 basis points that matures in March 2021. The proceeds of term loan B3 were used to repay the outstanding balance on term loan B1 and amounts outstanding on our old revolving credit facility.
In addition, funds from this financing were used for the purchase of Brasher's auctions for $275 million that closed on April 1. As a result of the issuance of term loan B3, we repriced the outstanding debt on term loan B2 to LIBOR plus 318.75 basis points from LIBOR plus 275 basis points. Both the old and new interest rates have a LIBOR floor of 75 basis points.
Term loan B2 has a maturity date of March 2021. As a result of this refinancing activity, we have updated our guidance on cash interest expense for 2016 to approximately $95 million from $85 million. In addition, we wrote off $4 million in unamortized debt issuance costs in the first quarter. We have capitalized original issue discount and debt issuance costs incurred in the refinancing, and this will increase our non-cash interest expense going forward, which I have reflected in our updated guidance.
Now, I would like to clarify a couple of items impacting our financial results for the first quarter. I will start with ADESA. As you saw in our earnings slides released last night, we have provided detail on the incremental operating profit margin for ADESA. The difference between adjusted EBITDA for acquisitions in the last 12 months of $3.1 million, and operating profit of $1.7 million, as disclosed in the earnings slides, is depreciation and amortization of $1.4 million. Excluding acquisitions, incremental margins for ADESA in the first quarter were 42.4% on an adjusted EBITDA basis. This is computed as the increase in adjusted EBITDA excluding acquisitions, divided by the increase in revenue excluding acquisitions for the quarter.

In the online-only channel, we have enhanced our disclosures after seeing the growing impact of the ADESA Assurance Program. The ADESA Assurance Program allows any vehicle purchased in the online-only open venue to be returned within 30 days, no questions asked. We have a very small number of vehicles returned under this program, but we found the impact on ARPU to be more significant. Like purchased vehicles, upon resale of these cars online, we recognize the gross auction price as revenue instead of the net fees. Excluding cars sold after being returned under the ADESA Assurance Program, ARPU for the online-only vehicles increased to $110 per unit in the first quarter from $105 per unit in the prior year.
Now, let me speak to the impact of HBC, our UK salvage business on the Insurance Auto Auctions margins in the first quarter. Substantially all of the salvage vehicles sold by HBC are purchased vehicles. The impact of including HBC within our salvage segment is a reduction in the gross profit of 1.4%. At AFC, we experienced increased bad debt expense in the first quarter as compared to the prior year. $5.5 million of net bad debt expense, up from $3.5 million last year was in line with our expectations for the quarter and reflects a level of losses we would expect going forward. This level of bad debt is still at a run rate below 1.5% of average portfolio balance for the year.
We have projected capital expenditures for 2016 of $145 million. In the first quarter, we expended $36 million including $1.3 million for ADESA Chicago. As you may recall, we estimated approximately $19 million in capital expenditures will be incurred in 2016 for ADESA Chicago. We expect the pace of spend to increase as the weather improves and we are anticipating an opening in the third quarter of this year.
In terms of guidance other than adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow that Jim spoke to, I would like to highlight that our GAAP net income per share guidance has been reduced to $1.56 to $1.71. Operating adjusted net income per share guidance has been reduced to $2.03 to $2.18. These adjustments to our guidance reflect the impact of our refinancing, including non-cash interest expense, which is offset by the increase in our expectations for adjusted EBITDA for the year. We have seen recent improvement in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar, but this is still within the range of our expectations in our initial guidance. We have made no adjustments in our expectations related to changes in the Canadian dollar at this time.
I will now return the call to Tony, our operator, so we can handle your questions. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Great. Thank you. First, we'll move to Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Ryan.
Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, Ryan.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
So obviously ADESA was great from both a volume and ARPU perspective. There was expectation volume to track higher, maybe not quite as high as it did, but obviously it's been strong for a while. From my conversations, the ARPU was a big surprise though. Can you walk us through in a little bit greater detail about the headwinds and the tailwinds to ADESA ARPU? Maybe you can help us sort of gauge the magnitude of the impact to ARPU from, say, lower used car prices. And then we know that ARPU increases from ancillary services just as more fuel cars fall further down into the funnel. But is there also this, like, paradoxically this tailwind where the lower used car prices go, people want to do more ancillary services to preserve residuals? How to think about that?

James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Ryan. I think you've got – first of all, what you got is you've got sellers wanting to maximize the resale price, getting the most money they can for the vehicle. And so, they're doing more and more work to achieve better results, financial results from the car. The second thing is they want to convert at a higher rate. They want to get more of these vehicles sold the first time through the auction. And the best way to assure that they can get these vehicles sold the first time through the auction is to do more work to them. And the third thing that many of these manufacturers are focused on is they're focused on residual values and keeping those residual values as high as they can, going forward with additional leasing.
So all in all, we are seeing increased utilization. And it's really a question of, how do I make my car stand taller? How do I separate my car from the pack and attract more buyers to my lane versus the lane beside me? So, it's a combination of all those things, I think, that has really driven the revenue here, and I think that the opportunity continues as we see more and more of these leased cars coming and more of these leased cars, and repossessed vehicles making their way to the physical auctions, we feel that there is opportunity to continue to grow those ancillary services. Eric?
Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And I'd add to that, the mix of vehicles is important. With more commercial vehicles, when you look at that denominator, it's more cars that are using these services than where there's a heavier dealer consignment. And this quarter, we're at 46.5% dealer consignment versus 53.5% commercial, which is a strong shift from that 50/50. And so, we're selling more transportation and it's profitable transportation because outbound transportation has profit, and we're seeing more activity on the repo side, bringing those cars in through our PAR and RDN businesses and things like that. So, all of that adds up to what Jim was summarizing there.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, to just kind of follow up on the ADESA volume side then. With the big increase, have you started to think about when growth is inevitably going to kind of normalize lower? If we look at the year-over-year increases in lease originations, it looks like the peak increase was in 2013. Is that what you see? And then, I know you don't guide to 2017 obviously, but off lease – and it's going to grow clearly through 2019, but is it also fair to say that it peaks this year? And then, just on a related note, so the potential for modest increase is kind of beyond 2019, not like we're seeing now, but it looks like lease penetration has gone from, like, 30% at the start of 2016 to 34%, 35% now. What do you think is driving that and do you care to guess how high it could potentially go?
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I'll start with your leasing question. On the leasing part, I think, it comes back to the fact that people can afford half a car, more than they can the full car, and leasing is really being able to drive a new car and your payment – and it's really matching your payment. So there's just more of an attraction to leasing in the fact that you get to turn the car over every three to four years, I think, is still part of the American culture. In terms of...
Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
In terms of the peak, the largest increase might have been from 2012 to 2013, but we're looking at least 0.5 million additional lease originations each year going 2014, 2015. And now 2016 is looking like it's on the same path, wouldn't you say, Jim?

James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Right.
Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So, when you say peak, maybe the largest year-over-year increase in lease originations might occur from 2012 to 2013, but there is strong growth that's continuing, as you say, into 2016 where we're seeing 33%, 34% lease origination rates.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I really don't think – truthful answer is I really don't think we know. We do have what we would term as very good visibility for the next few years. But getting beyond that, I think, we just have to wait and see it play out.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then last question is on online-only ARPU. I heard, Jim, in the prepared remarks say – I think you said it was up like $109, something like that. When you think about – when growth in online-only was preventing the incremental volume from flowing through to physical, which is no longer the case, I remember you were asked on these calls if there is anything you could do to help get increased fees from online-only, and your response then was kind of like, we're trying but it's really, really hard. So I'm just curious how you're able to take up that online-only ARPU and what the outlook for that is maybe going forward.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think, Ryan, the biggest opportunity there has been what we've been able to do in the open sale. When that car goes from close to open, then we're able to expose that vehicle to a whole new buyer base beyond the franchise dealers. And I think that's where we're able to increase our fees. As you know, the economics get much, much better in the open sale, and that's where we've been able to increase the average fee or the average revenue per car on those online sales.
Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And then with that said, Ryan, I'd like everyone to know, in 2011, when we acquired OPENLANE, we had a plan as to what we could do in the online-only space. I would say we are attaining those goals, if not even exceeding those goals, even with all of these close sales. I mean, this has been a great differentiator for our business and a great performer.
Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thank you.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
You're welcome.
Operator
Great. Thank you. Next we'll move to Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks a lot and good morning.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Matt.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
It's a terrific quarter obviously.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
First question, on ASP and ARPU, can you talk about the degree to which underlying pricing is changing in any way to help drive that number. And then also, Eric, related to that, if you could – I appreciate the enhanced disclosure. If you could just repeat precisely which numbers are impacted by the returned vehicles, and so what the reported number is and what the adjusted number is just so we can get the right context?
Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Okay. On the average selling price, I think, you're seeing what's being published. You're seeing call it 3% or so declines in the average selling price. But when you think about what that does – Jim mentioned it. What that does to the consignor who is trying to optimize if not maximize residuals, they're going to spend money on the car and we see that, Matt. So that's the answer to that.
On the online-only and the ADESA Assurance Program, thank you, I can repeat that, and you'll see it in the 10-Q that we file tonight. We reported $116 per car sold compared to $109 in the prior year. And when I take out the ADESA Assurance Program and I'll give you an example that's directionally correct. That number should be $110 because on a car that we purchase – we repurchase under our assurance and then resell, there's no real economic value to that transaction. We're just making good on our promise.

That $110 compared to $105 if I excluded the past year, by giving you that $6 number and the number of units we sold, you can calculate the value of the ADESA Assurance Program. And when you consider most of those are off-lease cars, let's hypothetically use a value of $15,000 per car that means that 75 cars sold is all in the quarter. That's how small the number of cars is, yet it had a $6 influence. That's all things you'll get out. It's in our earnings supplement, Matt. But that's what I was calling out because I felt you might reach the wrong impression on the growth in ARPU there. When these 75 out of, what, 180,000 cars or whatever the number was, let me look it up, I should give you the right number, it was a distortion that I felt we needed to clarify.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got it. And also, just rephrasing the first part of the question, on your fees per se, has there been any change in your pricing or your fee structure of late that would help explain the ASP acceleration, or is it really more about mix in the ancillary services that are being added to the package?
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Matt, I think, it's a little bit of both, primarily, I would say, focused on the ancillary services and the things that are going on there. But as I've always said, at ADESA more so, we continuously are monitoring the buying fees. And these are nationwide increases, these sometimes can be regional increases or local increases, and there have been some of those go in place probably in the first quarter. But again, I would take you back to – I would focus on the increase in ancillary services more so.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. And then just one follow-up from that. So your reported gross margin in ADESA was up, I believe, 98 basis points. It's the first increase of anything in that magnitude you've had in at least two years, maybe more. And you've had other quarters where your volume growth has come close to this. So was that really an outgrowth of that – of pricing in the average revenue per vehicle, or is there something else on the cost side, which I know you alluded to. Is that what's contributing to the better flow-through at the gross profit line?
Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Matt, as we look at it, the gross profit is coming really, I think, through the mix of vehicles getting us that leverage in the use of the shops, and it's from the ancillary services. Also, you look at things like PAR and our repossession activity, again, very good utilization. While that might be a lower margin business, it has a lot of scale in it, and we're getting the activity. So, it's more the scale with a little bit coming from the auction fees margin. That would be slightly up, but not account for a significant portion of that 90 basis points.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got it. Understood and appreciate it. Thank you.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Matt.
Operator
Great. Thank you. Next we'll move to Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Yeah. A couple of questions. First of all, if Chicago starts rolling out this year, how long would a new site like that be a drag on the adjusted EBITDA results?
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Gary, typically, we would tell you for a Greenfield location to be cash flow positive, we normally look at it in a period of 12 months to 18 months. In the case of Las Vegas, which was the last one that we did, we're very pleased that we're cash flow positive there in the first 12 months. And let me say, I'm optimistic that we can have strong results going into that Chicago market. I think we're going in at a very good time. We absolutely got the ideal location. The buyer base is there. The cars are there. The customers are there. I'm expecting a strong performance there coming out of the gate.

Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And, Gary, let me add when we say negative EBITDA initially, it's not going to be a material number. It's not something that we expect to be calling out as an influence on our performance. It's just not a big contributor.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Okay. Just was curious there. And then, just an industry question, in terms of the cars coming through lease or from lease returns, are you seeing less of an appetite for the grounding dealers to take these cars initially? They're flowing through the pipe and then going more towards the independent dealers versus the franchise dealers. Is there a shift that's starting to occur here because the franchise dealers have ample inventory of used cars now?
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think, Gary, there's – first of all, the grounding dealer, the residuals are maybe a little bit higher than market value. So you're seeing the grounding dealer pass on some of these cars at termination. And then, when they're getting into, as we call the top of the funnel in the closed sale, there is a lot more vehicles to choose from, so the dealers can be more selective.
And then, there's more cars going through the online open sale, which then brings in a whole new buyer base. It brings in all those independents, and you've already said it, but just to reinforce what you said, you've now got all those independents that are able to acquire some of this inventory as well. So, it's a combination of all those things, and primarily, all being driven by the residual value at termination.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then, just the last question on the loan loss reserve increase, which is understandable because of the growth in the portfolio, but it is my understanding that, really, you would have a huge loss if there was some kind of an outright fraud at the dealership where the car was domiciled where they bought it from you. Is the increase in the loss reserve really a function over the time from when it was bought to what the market value is now and you've got to write down that loan?
Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes, Gary, we actually – writing off the loan, actually this occurs so quickly given the nature of a floorplan lending business. But most of the losses are lost value in the vehicle where we feel we can't recover from other assets.
But the most significant individual losses are what we call sold out of trust. The car is sold. The proceeds are received by the dealer, and they're not remitted for payment on the loan and there's no collateral for us to act upon. As you would suspect, even in declining values, that loss would be relatively minor if we could repossess the car.
But if the car is in the possession of a consumer, consumer protection laws prohibit us from repossessing from the consumer even though we may have held title as collateral. So, again, the losses you see are heavily weighted by the car sold out of trust.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.

Great. Thank you. Next we'll move to Tony Cristello with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets
Thank you. Good morning.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Tony.
Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Hi, Tony.
Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets
The first question is sort of a bigger picture question. We continue to hear about more technology in the industry, dealers looking for ways to speed up the process of auction and/or move vehicles from dealer to dealer, and in some instances, bypassing auctions.

And I know you've got TradeRev and some other initiatives. I'm wondering if you could expand on how you will take advantage of a shift perhaps in technology and be able to continue to better balance both the physical and online use of where things may evolve.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think, we're very much aware of potential disruption and how we could be disrupted, and I would like to tell you that if there's disruption that's going to occur, we'd like to be disrupting ourselves. And that's exactly what we're planning – what our plans are with TradeRev. We actually feel like we are disrupting ourselves there. So that – TradeRev continues to rollout, and we continue to add resources in the markets that we are in with TradeRev. We are experiencing what I would call success. We're seeing the numbers continue to grow on a monthly basis. We've brought in – we've enhanced some of our technology with other products. We've talked about Autoniq, which gives the dealer real values on his smartphone while he's in the lane.
I think, it's being aware of what the technologies are that can really add value to the customers both on sell side and on the buy side, and allowing them to make better decisions. I think some of the things that we're doing with data and planning on doing with data in terms of big picture will give the buyers and sellers better information to be able to make more informed decisions.
So Eric, do you want add something?
Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. I mean, like our investment in photo booths allows you to look at an image and you might buy that car online instead of waiting until it gets to – all of this – better inspection reports and enhancing the technology around check-in processes, it's all about taking time out of the process so the car can be sold quickly.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, and the other thing that I mentioned in my commentary that I'll go back to is we talked about the cycle times at insurance auto auctions, and cycle time is money. And I think people are aware that the average cycle time historically at the salvage business has been in that 75-day to 90-day range. And we have a new product that we're offering at insurance auto auctions called Total Loss Solutions that we're introducing to some of our customers, and it's a product that we can scale across some of our customers that potentially can reduce cycle times, and I'm talking about potentially reducing cycle time significantly by 25 days – by 20 days, 25 days. That becomes a very meaningful number.
Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets
And I guess, it seems like so from the technology part on ADESA, you're sort of being part of that evolution of change. With IAA, it sounds like you're being able to help improve what the insurance company see as probably one of their bigger expenses. And so on that cycle time – or if you look at where the biggest opportunities are to communicating with the DMVs and improving that, is it being more efficient at that first notice of loss point? And are you able to see opportunities for yourself to continue to improve and obviously offer better services to your customers?
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think, it's a little bit of all that you've mentioned really. You think about the technology, you think about the enhancements to our existing technology, bringing in new technologies that we've talked about, bringing in the data and the analytics and other things that we may be doing and working on, I think, if you – it's kind of that story a little bit plus, a little bit plus a little bit adds up to a lot. And it's just being very focused on what's going on in their industry and what the trends are and what the shifts are and making sure that we're staying ahead of the curve.

Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And, Tony, using automation, the key is you can track it. It's not sitting on somebody's desk for five days waiting. It's in a queue, that someone says this is ready for the next step, and whether that be again at the reconditioning shop or the mechanic shop, right? It's everything, not just paper. It's everything.
Anthony F. Cristello - BB&T Capital Markets
Okay. That's great. Appreciate your time.

Great. Thank you. And next we'll move to Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Great. Thank you for taking my question. It's really on this recall trend. I think, AutoNation recently announced a change to its recall policy and may end up ultimately wholesaling more vehicles if they can get the repair done in a timely fashion. If that goes mainstream, does that have any influence on your volume trends?
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, perhaps, it could increase our volume overall if they start wholesaling more of those vehicles, but I think that we would probably be required to get those recalls done before the vehicle got resold.
Craig R. Kennison - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Thank you.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
You're welcome.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ali Faghri with CRT Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Ali Faghri - CRT Capital Group LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.
Ali Faghri - CRT Capital Group LLC
So, total physical auction volumes were up 12%, and dealer consignment was up 10%. I think that implies commercial was up roughly 12% to 13% in the quarter, which is a nice acceleration from low-single digits last quarter. Can you give us some color on what drove that specifically? Was that off-lease, repo, or maybe timing? And then also maybe some color on the cadence of volume trends at ADESA throughout the quarter.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. There is no question on the commercial is – there's just more and more volume coming. There's – these leases are continuing to come, and the question I've answered earlier, the grounding dealers passing on these cars and putting more vehicles into the funnel. And then with the financial institutions, those are writing more and more consumer credit, and that's just a straight math calculation.
The more paper written, the more repos you're going to have. If I go back in history, we peaked at about 1.9 million repos back in 2008, 2009, and we took that number down to 1.1 million. Now we're seeing those repossessions climb back up to that 1.5 million, 1.6 million, and I would expect that number will continue to grow as they continue to write more and more paper. So, the heavy influence has been with the commercial cars – there's no question.
And then, I think that on the dealer consignment, I'm extremely proud of what our ADESA organization has done with dealer consignment, and that was really an initiative that many of you are familiar with. It started back in 2009, and when we put that whole network in place, we have 300 people in the field approximately that are very focused on calling on dealers one at a time. We had people calling on the mid-sized groups and the large dealer groups, and we've just really created some good habits for our dealers. And we've started to treat the dealer consignment business more like we treat the commercial business, providing more and more services to them.
And I think the proof is in the pudding. We're getting the results and our dealers are all about results and that they have a good experience. They're returning, and I think that dealer consignment team, again, has just done a remarkable job. And quite frankly, Eric and I have been saying this for probably the last two years or three years is, we are surprised that the dealer consignment numbers have held up as strong as they have when you consider the impact of all of these commercial vehicles coming back. So, it's really been a great win for us.

Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
And let me clarify, I think you'll find the commercial volumes were up much more than 12% to 13%. If 46.5% of the physical auction volumes were up 10%, the other 53.5% were up by a greater amount. Ali, we can walk you through that at a later time, but you'll get a much higher number than the 12% to 13%.
Ali Faghri - CRT Capital Group LLC
Great. And then just on the cadence of volume trends as well throughout the quarter.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think, it's been steady. There was again...
Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I'd say it followed our seasonal pattern. January was January because of the slow start to the year and got very strong in March because that's when the lease returns really pick up.
Ali Faghri - CRT Capital Group LLC

Hi. Good morning, guys.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Bret.
Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC
A question on the IAA inventory, up 4%. You talked about improved cycle times. Was there any impact from generally warmer and less icy weather in the Northern or Northeastern states, and then again some volume shift with farmers in the quarter, or is it primarily just the cycle times?
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Bret, I'd mention that there certainly were some impact from the mild winter that we experienced. In terms of customers, we really don't get into talking about specific customers. But you have your wins and your losses, and they pretty much offset each other.
But maybe the bigger impact was improving these cycle times. And as I mentioned in my commentary, especially with one very large customer that we mentioned previously that they had kind of taken a pause, and they kind of taken the time out to restructure a lot of their internal processes.
And now that they've got those restructured and they're working with us in our Total Loss Solutions now in terms of how they cycle these vehicles to the market, that has reduced inventory at the end of the quarter.
Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Let me clarify one thing. They are utilizing the expertise of Total Loss Solutions. We are not processing titles for them.
Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Okay. And a housekeeping question on SG&A. You said $10 million of the incremental $20 million was acquired. How much of that was Brasher's eight, how do you see Brasher's adding to SG&A on the year?
Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Brasher's is not in our numbers.
Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC
Okay.
Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
They were acquired April 1st, so they don't even hit for one day, Bret. But Brasher's, again, we'll give more color on that. We just closed the transaction. It will – it's got a business that looks very much like the ADESA business with about 25% – 24% or 25% EBITDA margins coming in. And it's a local operation. It'll fit very nicely in the business model of ADESA.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
And the other thing that I would just add is very similar mix to what you see at ADESA as well between commercial and dealer.
Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. Thank you.

Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning, guys.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Eric M. Loughmiller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Hi, Ben.
Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.
Touching on the salvage business, your acquisition that you made in the UK, I'd just be curious to hear the progress there, how discussions with insurance companies are going, to the extent you can opine, and then your thoughts on the broader market there as well.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
As it turned out, our timing wasn't great when we did that acquisition. I think, as we said, scrap prices couldn't go any lower than they were at the time that we were getting that acquisition closed. And we've mentioned previously that we did go over and we sat with the management team.
We did kind of restructure the business model a little bit, not in terms of the amount of cars bought, but in terms of some of the pricing that was going on. And as Eric mentioned in his commentary, we're pleased that HBC was a positive contributor in the first quarter, and we think we've got the business model right, and we think we can continue to grow that. And in terms of looking forward, we're a very, very, very distant number two player, but we think there is opportunity to do further consolidation, and we'll just have to stand by and see how that plays out.
Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.
Great. And then your comments earlier around active discussions and deals, should we think there's possible opportunities in both North America and abroad, and then also ADESA and IAA? Maybe give us a sense of what those opportunities look like by business segment.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And I think you should think about all of our businesses and that we're actively looking at opportunities and targets, and you should think of them both domestically and internationally. And as I mentioned in the past, we're still very much a believer in brick and mortar. We believe brick and mortar still has a role to play here, and we can buy these at what we would believe are very attractive multiples. And as I've said previously, there's 5 to 10 what I would consider really plum-type acquisitions out there. Not that we're going to buy 5 to 10; that's not what I'm saying. Don't misunderstand that. But I'm saying of those 5 to 10, we are in active discussions with a number of those. And I would hope that we could possibly close on some additional independents with no time line in mind.
Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc.
Fantastic. Best of luck going forward.

Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.
Good morning.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Bob.
Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.
Hi. A lot of my questions have been answered, but just according to some trade magazines, TradeRev has moved into the Washington, D.C. area, and I was wondering if you could just talk about your progress and your plans on rolling out in the U.S. Obviously, it started in Canada and stuff. And just tell us how long you would expect this to take or how you're planning the rollout, if there's a lot of capital that has to go behind it at all. Give us some more insight on to that, please.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So a couple things. First of all, I'll acknowledge the Washington, D.C. market. We did have a press release announcing that TradeRev is now representing the Pohanka Group there. I think, it's 17 stores, and we're managing – we're selling, I believe, the majority or all of their vehicles, all of their trade vehicles and overaged inventory on TradeRev. So, that was a big announcement for us.

We've also updated our technology on TradeRev. We've come out with what we call TradeRev 3.0. That's been rolled out in both Canada and the U.S. We've added a number of resources here in the U.S. in terms of people. And it's really one market at a time, and it's just getting to these markets in an organized manner. And the markets that we're in, we're experiencing success, like the one you mentioned with Pohanka. Pohanka is not the only deal. But we're experiencing success. We're building the buyer base, and we're building the seller base as well. And again, we're seeing positive trends where the volume continues to reach new levels each month. So, we're very pleased with TradeRev. But I think the thing that I would remind you of is I do believe TradeRev has an opportunity to really be transformational in that dealer-to-dealer space. But I wouldn't want to suggest that this is going to be an overnight deal. I think, this is with a longer term vision.
I think about TradeRev as really being fully deployed and really hitting on all eight as they say probably over the course of what I would think the next three years to five years. I think it has the opportunity to really transform that dealer space. So, with all that said, we're very pleased with what we're seeing.
Robert Labick - CJS Securities, Inc.
Great. Appreciate that. Thank you very much.

Thank you. And we'll take our final question in queue from Bill Armstrong from C.L. King & Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, gentlemen. In Insurance Auto Auctions looks like the declines in revenue per vehicle are getting less negative. I was wondering if you could just discuss what you're seeing in terms of scrap pricing. Is that starting to become less of an issue? And you were mentioning cycle time is reducing. Is that helping your revenue per vehicle in any way?
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Bill, as I said, I don't think scrap prices can go any lower. So, anything is going to be an improvement. And we are seeing a slight improvement in scrap prices. Also, Eric mentioned we're seeing a slight improvement in currency as well. And then – so, yes, that is helping mildly I would say, very mildly at this point in time. And certainly, the improvement in the cycle time is just moving these cars to the system quicker.
William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Does that cycle time improvement really – does that help your revenue per vehicle, or is it more maybe a help on the gross margin side?
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Bill, to the extent that they get a higher auction price because it didn't further depreciate, there might be a slight tick up in the buy fee, but that would be the only way you'd see it.
William R. Armstrong - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
I see. Okay. Thank you.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Thank you. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Hallett for any closing comments or remarks.
James P. Hallett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Tony. And, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for being on the call. Again, we continue to appreciate your interest and your investment in our company. Obviously, we're very, very pleased to report on the quarter that we've reported on. But more so, I would say that we're pleased with the visibility that we have going forward.
And not only in 2016, but as we talked about, as you look out the next couple years, we think the business is in really good shape. We think management is very focused on managing this business and providing you with the best results that we can possibly provide you with and making the best acquisitions and deploying capital in the most disciplined manner to get the greatest returns. So we're excited about the business and really we'll look forward to coming back to you next quarter and hopefully reporting more good news. So with that, thank you for being on and have a great day.
