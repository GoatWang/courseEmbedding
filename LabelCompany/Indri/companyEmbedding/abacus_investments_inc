These courses are also referred to as the pre-filing and post-filing courses.  Abacus Credit Counseling is an approved credit counseling agency, and Sage Personal Finance is an approved debtor education provider.* Together, we offer a convenient and affordable solution for your bankruptcy courses.
* Approved to issue certificates in compliance with the Bankruptcy Code. Approval does not endorse or assure the quality of an Agency's services.

Abacus is approved to provide the pre-filing credit counseling course in all states. Sage is approved to provide the post-filing debtor education course in all states.*
* Approved to issue certificates in compliance with the Bankruptcy Code. Approval does not endorse or assure the quality of an Agency's services.

Pre-filing online $25    Telephonic $35
                                      Post-filing online $35    Telephonic $45
There are no other fees.  Married couples filing jointly only pay one fee provided they can take the course together.
Back to top
 
I am married, does my spouse have to complete the course as well?
If you and your spouse are filing jointly, you will both have to complete the courses.  If you are unsure, please consult your lawyer or your bankruptcy court.  Married couples filing jointly only pay one fee provided they can take the course together.
Back to top
 
Do I have to take the course online?
No. Both the first and second courses may be taken by phone. First Course: To take the first course by phone, please call (800) 516-3834 to register. Once you complete the phone portion of the phone course, you will be forwarded to a live credit counselor to complete the course and receive your certificate. Second Course: To take the second course by phone, please call (800) 516-2759 to register. Complete the entire course from your home phone, and your certificate will be sent to you as soon as you complete the automated course.
Back to top
 
What forms of payment do you accept?
Payments are accepted online or over the phone. We accept major credit cards, debit cards, and money orders (sent by mail).  Sage Personal Finance also accepts ACH (electronic checks).  If you do not have one of these forms of payment, you can purchase a pre-paid VISA, American Express or MasterCard card, from places like a drug store or Wal-Mart, or you can borrow a credit or debit card from a friend or family member. 
Back to top
 
How long is the course?
The pre-filing credit counseling course takes approximately 60-90 minutes to complete.  The post-filing debtor education course takes a minimum of 2 hours to complete (by law).
Back to top
 
Do I have to complete the course in one sitting?
No, your progress is saved as you proceed through each course.  You can close your browser at any time, and return to the site later.  When you log-on again, you will be taken back to the last page that you were on.
Back to top
 
How quickly can I receive a certificate of completion?
For both courses, immediately upon finishing the course, you will be provided with a link to your certificate, and you can print a copy.  In case you don't have a printer, or just want to have a copy for your record, we also send your certificate to you by fax and/or email when you finish the course.  You will be asked for an email address or fax number where your certificate should be sent, and you can provide your attorney's email address and fax if you are working with an attorney. We will deliver it to all of those places to ensure that you get it as quickly and easily as possible. If you do not have email or a fax number, we can send your certificate by mail upon request.  Please note that for the credit counseling course, you are required to chat or speak with a credit counselor to complete your course.
Back to top
 
How long is my certificate good for?
The Pre-filing Credit Counseling certificate expires 6 months from the date counseling is completed. 
In most cases, the Pre-Discharge Debtor Education certificate must be presented to the court within a certain amount of time after you file your bankruptcy case.  For more information on this, please contact your court or your attorney, if you are working with one.
Back to top


Do you offer fee discounts for individuals who can't afford the course?
Yes, fee discounts are available for both courses.
For the pre-filing credit counseling course (the first course):
									Abacus offers fee discounts for individuals whose household income is less than 150 percent of the poverty guidelines last published by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) (https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines) applicable to a family of their size. The income of a spouse is included in calculating income whether or not a joint petition is filed unless the spouses are separated. Fee discounts are determined during credit counseling. You will need to register for and complete the course to obtain a discount.
                                    For the post-filing debtor education course (the second course):
If your household income is less than 150% of the poverty guidelines provided
by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (see:

https://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty-guidelines
), you will become eligible for a full or partial fee waiver. If you meet
the poverty guideline requirement, but any of the following apply, you will
receive a partial waiver of 20% off:

1) you have paid more than $600 to an attorney or legal service to assist you
with your bankruptcy case,

2) you spend more than $200 per month on non-necessary items, or

3) you have assets of greater than $2000.

If you meet the poverty guideline requirement and none of the above apply, you
will be eligible for a full waiver. To obtain a full or partial waiver, please
click here, download
the form, and email, fax, or mail it to us. In addition to the form, we require
that you provide documentation of your income (e.g., recent pay stub, recent
social security stub, etc.) We will respond to your request within three
business days. (If you use a coupon code to receive a discount, the waiver
amount will not be applied above and beyond the coupon code. The waiver amount
will be applied toward the full price of the course.)
                                    Back to top
 
What impact will the credit counseling course have on my credit report?
The credit counseling course offered by Abacus has no impact on students' credit reports.
Back to top
 
Do you have any other affiliations or funding sources?
No, we are not affiliated with nor do we receive funding or endorsements from any entities, including those mentioned in the courses.
