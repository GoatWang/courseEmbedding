The California Transparency in  Supply Chains Act of 2010 (the ‘Act”) entered into effect on January 1, 2012,  the law requires manufacturers and retailers to make publicly available  information related to their efforts to eradicate the risks of slavery and  human trafficking from their supply chains.   Although Kraton Corporation(“Kraton”) does not currently:

Verify  product supply chains to evaluate and address these risks;
Conduct  audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards  regarding these risks; 
Require  all of our direct suppliers to certify that the materials incorporated in our  products comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in countries  where they do business; 
Maintain  internal standards and processes for employees and contractors who fail to meet  company standards regarding these risks; 
Provide  training for employees who have direct responsibility for supply chain  management on this subject matter,

 
Kraton is committed to conducting  business in an ethical and responsible manner, which includes complying with  applicable slavery and human trafficking laws.   Below are the Kraton programs and standards that reflect the objectives  of the Act:

Customs – Trade Partnership Against       Terrorism (C-TPAT)

 
Kraton has  actively participated in the C-TPAT program since 2003.  C-TPAT is a voluntary U.S. government program  designed to increase security and prevent slavery and human trafficking  throughout the global supply chain.  The  C-TPAT program involves risk-based audits of the company and unannounced audits  of suppliers

Authorized Economic Operator (AEO)

 
Kraton has  actively participated in the AEO program since 2012.  Like C-TPAT, AEO is a voluntary program administered  by various governments across the world that requires high quality internal  processes to ensure the integrity of the global supply chain.  The AEO program involves internal audits as  well as verifications of supply chain security and random on-site audits  performed by the customs authorities.

Kraton’s Code of Conduct 

 
Kraton’s Code  of Ethics and Business Conduct clearly demonstrates that we are committed to  conducting business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and in  accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and rules. 

  All employees,  officers, directors, anyone doing business on behalf of Kraton, as well as the  suppliers we do business with are expected to know and abide by this Code at  all times.  



 Kraton's  Core Values
1. Safety
The health of our people

					Full Description



Kraton Corporation, formerly Kraton Performance Polymers, Inc., incorporated on October 28, 2003, is a specialty chemicals company. The Company manufactures styrenic block copolymers (SBCs) and other engineered polymers. The Company also produces specialty products primarily derived from pine wood pulping co-products. The Company operates through two segments: Polymer Segment, which comprises SBCs and other engineered polymers business, and Chemical Segment, which comprises pine-based specialty products business. Its SBCs are used in a range of applications, including adhesives, coatings, consumer and personal care products, sealants, lubricants, medical, packaging, automotive, paving, roofing and footwear products. The Company also sells isoprene rubber (IR) and isoprene rubber latex (IRL), which are non-SBC products primarily used in applications, such as medical products, personal care, adhesives, tackifiers, paints and coatings. It offers crude tall oil (CTO) and crude sulfate turpentine (CST).Polymer SegmentThe Company's polymer products are high performance elastomers that are engineered for a range of applications. Its products can be processed in a variety of manufacturing applications, including injection molding, blow molding, compression molding, extrusion and hot melt, and solution applied coatings. Its portfolio includes polyvinyl chloride alternatives for medical applications; polymers for soft skin and coated fabric applications for transportation and consumer markets; high melt flow polymers for compounding and adhesives formulations, and synthetic cement formulations and polymers used for viscosity modification in oilfield applications. Its Polymer segment products are manufactured and its commercial activities are organized in various product groups based upon polymer chemistry and process technologies, such as Performance Products, Specialty Polymers, Cariflex and Other.In paving and roofing applications, its Performance Products primarily consist of styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) for use in modified asphalt applications. In personal care applications, its Performance Products primarily consist of SBS and styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS) for the manufacturing of ultra-thin stretchable films used for the production of diapers. In addition, its SIS polymers are also used in the lamination process for other personal care products. It markets IR and IRL products under the Cariflex brand name.Chemical SegmentThe Company manufactures and sells high value products primarily derived from pine wood pulping co-products. It refines and further upgrades two primary feedstocks, crude tall oil (CTO) and crude sulfate turpentine (CST), both of which are co-products of the wood pulping process, into value-added specialty chemicals. It refines CTO through a distillation process into four primary constituent fractions: tall oil fatty acids (TOFA); tall oil rosin (TOR); distilled tall oil (DTO), and tall oil pitch. It further upgrades TOFA, TOR, and DTO into derivatives, such as dimer acids, polyamide resins, rosin resins, dispersions, and disproportionated resins. It refines CST into terpene fractions, which can be further upgraded into terpene resins. The various fractions and derivatives resulting from its CTO and CST refining process provide for distinct functionalities and properties, determining their respective applications and end markets. It focuses its resources on four product groups: adhesives; roads and construction; tires, and chemical intermediates. Within its product groups, its products are sold into a diverse range of submarkets, including packaging, tapes and labels, pavement marking, high performance tires, fuel additives, oilfield and mining, coatings, metalworking fluids and lubricants, inks, and flavor and fragrances, among others. Its Chemical segment products are manufactured and its commercial activities are organized in various product groups based upon end markets and process technologies, such as Adhesives, Roads and construction, Tires and Chemical intermediates.The Company offers a range of products to service target adhesives submarkets, including rosin-based tackifiers for packaging and pressure-sensitive adhesive applications, terpene-based tackifiers for bookbinding, hygiene and pressure-sensitive adhesive applications, alpha-methyl-styrene (AMS) resins for bookbinding and pressure-sensitive adhesive applications and hot melt polyamides for flexible packaging. Its tackifiers are primarily used in hot melt adhesives, which are heavily used in the packaging submarket. It provides various products for use in roads and construction applications. Within the pavement marking submarket, it provides rosin-based binders for the thermoplastic pavement marking submarket and it sells TOFA for the asphalt paving market and produce rosin esters, insoluble maleic-based tackifiers and niche products, including bitumen additives. It sells a range of products that manages the performance and manufacturing of high performance, winter, and all-season tires. Its terpene-based tread enhancement resins optimize wet grip of tire treads while maintaining reduced rolling resistance and enhanced durability, which contribute to improved vehicle fuel efficiency. Its Chemical Intermediates products include TOFA, Dimer Acids, TOR, DTO and Terpene Fractions. Its dimer acids are used for the production of polyamide resins used in applications, such as epoxy coatings, flexographic inks, and high performance adhesive applications. In addition, dimer acids are building blocks in the production of corrosion inhibitors and emulsifiers used in the production and recovery of petroleum and natural gas. TOR is used in all major rosin applications for the manufacture of adhesives, inks, pavement markers, rubber, and paper. DTO is primarily used as an emulsifier for metalworking fluids and lubricants. It supplies terpene fractions, alpha-pinene and beta-pinene, mainly as specialty tackifiers for the adhesives market and tread enhancers for the tires market.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Kraton is the trade name given to a number of high performance elastomers manufactured by Kraton Polymers (NYSE: KRA), and used as synthetic replacements for rubber. Kraton polymers offers many of the properties of natural rubber, such as flexibility, high traction, and sealing abilities, but with increased resistance to heat, weathering, and chemicals. It was first made by the chemical division of the Shell Oil Company in the 1950s.[1] Shell sold its Kraton polymers business to private equity firm Ripplewood Holdings in March 2001.[2]
Properties[edit]




Sbs block copolymer in TEM


Kraton polymers are styrenic block copolymer (SBC) consisting of polystyrene blocks and rubber blocks. The rubber blocks consist of polybutadiene, polyisoprene or their hydrogenated equivalents. The tri-block with polystyrene blocks at both extremities linked together by a rubber block is the most important polymer structure observed in SBC. If the rubber block consist of polybutadiene, the corresponding triblock structure is: poly(styrene-block-butadiene-block-styrene) usually abbreviated as SBS. Kraton D (SBS and SIS ) and their selectively hydrogenated versions Kraton G (SEBS and SEPS) are the major Kraton polymer structures. The microstructure of SBS consists of domains of polystyrene arranged regularly in a matrix of polybutadiene, as shown in the TEM micrograph. The picture was obtained on a thin film of polymer cast onto mercury from solution, and then stained with osmium tetroxide.
The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polybutadiene blocks is typically -90 °C and Tg of the polystyrene blocks is +100 °C. So, at any temperature between about -90 °C and +100 °C Kraton SBS will act as a physically crosslinked elastomer. If Kraton polymers are heated substantially above the Tg of the styrene-derived blocks, that is, above about 100 °C, like 170 °C the physical cross-links change from rigid glassy regions to flowable melt regions and the entire material flows and therefore can be cast, molded, or extruded into any desired form. On cooling, this new form resumes its elastomeric character. This is the reason such a material is called a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). The polystyrene blocks form domains of nanometre size in the microstructure, and they stabilise the form of the moulded material. Depending on the rubber to polystyrene ratio in the material, the polystyrene domains can be spherical or form cylinders or lamellae. The hydrogenated Kraton polymers named Kraton G exhibit improved resistance to temperature (processing at 200–230 °C is common), to oxidation and to UV. SEBS and SEPS due to their polyolefinic rubber nature present excellent compatibility with polyolefins and paraffinic oils.
Applications[edit]
Kraton polymers are always used in blends with various other ingredients like paraffinic oils, polyolefins, polystyrene, bitumen, tackifying resins, fillers to provide a very large range of end-use products ranging from hot melt adhesives to impact modified transparent polypropylene bins, from medical TPE compounds to modified bitumen roofing felts or from oil gel toys (including sex toys) to elastic attachments in diapers.
It can make asphalt flexible, which is necessary if the asphalt is to be used to coat a surface that is below grade or for highly demanding paving applications like F1 racing tracks.
Kraton based compounds are also used in non-slip knife handles.

The earliest commercial components using Kraton G (thermoplastic rubber) in the automobile industry were in 1975.[3] American Motors (AMC) used this polymer plastic on the AMC Eagle for the color matched flexible wheel arch flares that flowed into rocker panel extensions.[4]
Some grades of Kraton can also be dissolved into hydrocarbon oils to create "shear thinning" grease type products that are used in the manufacture of telecommunications cables containing optical fibres.

It was first made by the chemical division of the Shell Oil Company in the 1950s.[1] Shell sold its Kraton polymers business to private equity firm Ripplewood Holdings in March 2001.[2]
Properties[edit]




Sbs block copolymer in TEM


Kraton polymers are styrenic block copolymer (SBC) consisting of polystyrene blocks and rubber blocks. The rubber blocks consist of polybutadiene, polyisoprene or their hydrogenated equivalents. The tri-block with polystyrene blocks at both extremities linked together by a rubber block is the most important polymer structure observed in SBC. If the rubber block consist of polybutadiene, the corresponding triblock structure is: poly(styrene-block-butadiene-block-styrene) usually abbreviated as SBS. Kraton D (SBS and SIS ) and their selectively hydrogenated versions Kraton G (SEBS and SEPS) are the major Kraton polymer structures. The microstructure of SBS consists of domains of polystyrene arranged regularly in a matrix of polybutadiene, as shown in the TEM micrograph. The picture was obtained on a thin film of polymer cast onto mercury from solution, and then stained with osmium tetroxide.
The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polybutadiene blocks is typically -90 °C and Tg of the polystyrene blocks is +100 °C. So, at any temperature between about -90 °C and +100 °C Kraton SBS will act as a physically crosslinked elastomer. If Kraton polymers are heated substantially above the Tg of the styrene-derived blocks, that is, above about 100 °C, like 170 °C the physical cross-links change from rigid glassy regions to flowable melt regions and the entire material flows and therefore can be cast, molded, or extruded into any desired form. On cooling, this new form resumes its elastomeric character. This is the reason such a material is called a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). The polystyrene blocks form domains of nanometre size in the microstructure, and they stabilise the form of the moulded material. Depending on the rubber to polystyrene ratio in the material, the polystyrene domains can be spherical or form cylinders or lamellae. The hydrogenated Kraton polymers named Kraton G exhibit improved resistance to temperature (processing at 200–230 °C is common), to oxidation and to UV. SEBS and SEPS due to their polyolefinic rubber nature present excellent compatibility with polyolefins and paraffinic oils.
Applications[edit]
Kraton polymers are always used in blends with various other ingredients like paraffinic oils, polyolefins, polystyrene, bitumen, tackifying resins, fillers to provide a very large range of end-use products ranging from hot melt adhesives to impact modified transparent polypropylene bins, from medical TPE compounds to modified bitumen roofing felts or from oil gel toys (including sex toys) to elastic attachments in diapers.
It can make asphalt flexible, which is necessary if the asphalt is to be used to coat a surface that is below grade or for highly demanding paving applications like F1 racing tracks.
Kraton based compounds are also used in non-slip knife handles.

The earliest commercial components using Kraton G (thermoplastic rubber) in the automobile industry were in 1975.[3] American Motors (AMC) used this polymer plastic on the AMC Eagle for the color matched flexible wheel arch flares that flowed into rocker panel extensions.[4]
Some grades of Kraton can also be dissolved into hydrocarbon oils to create "shear thinning" grease type products that are used in the manufacture of telecommunications cables containing optical fibres.
