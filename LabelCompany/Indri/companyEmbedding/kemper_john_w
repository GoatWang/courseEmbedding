ST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Commerce Bancshares, Inc. board of directors today named John W. 
      Kemper president and chief operating officer of Commerce Bancshares, 
      Inc. In this position, Kemper will have responsibility for directing the 
      company’s strategy and line operations, working closely with market and 
      business line leadership. David W. Kemper, chairman of the board and 
      chief executive officer of Commerce Bancshares, Inc., made the 
      announcement.
    


      Since joining Commerce in 2007, John Kemper has served in a number of 
      roles, leading bank strategy and M&A overseeing the bank’s credit card 
      businesses; and serving as chairman of Capital for Business, the bank’s 
      private equity subsidiary. Most recently, as Commerce Bancshares’ chief 
      administrative officer, he assumed overall responsibility for bank 
      credit and non-credit risk, legal, compliance and human resources.
    

      “Over the last six years, John has distinguished himself by steering 
      strategic planning for the company and by directly overseeing many of 
      Commerce’s key growth areas,” David W. Kemper said. “John has shown 
      strong leadership in working with all of our markets, lines of business, 
      and internal support services and, as such, is well suited to undertake 
      this new role and challenge.”
    

      “I am honored to serve Commerce Bank in this role,” John Kemper said. 
      “In this challenging time for the banking industry, Commerce is uniquely 
      well positioned to navigate regulatory and economic change. We believe 
      our bank’s super community model will continue to allow us to serve the 
      communities where we live and work, and to do it with industry leading 
      products and capabilities. We at the bank are all looking forward to a 
      bright future, and I’m glad to help contribute to our success.”
    

      Prior to joining Commerce, John Kemper worked as an engagement manager 
      with the New York and Chicago offices of McKinsey & Co., a consultancy. 
      There, he served blue chip clients in the financial services sector on a 
      variety of strategy and operations projects.
    

      Kemper has a B.A. in history and political science from Stanford 
      University, a Master of Science degree in economic history from the 
      London School of Economics, and an MBA from the Kellogg School of 
      Management at Northwestern University in Chicago.

Kemper Jr., John W.
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Wyoming:













Does Kemper Jr., John W carry a valid contracting license?



Contractors in Wyoming are registered at the city and county level. The state does not register contractors in Wyoming











How important is contractor licensing in Wyoming?



Contractors may be required to take the International Code Council National Exam before registering at the local level. The state does not require an exam to become a contractor.











Your liability risk when hiring Kemper Jr., John W



Contractors in Wyoming are not required by the state to carry general liability or workers compensation insurance.Local regulation may differ, it is always a good idea to only hire contractors with proof of active insurance.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Wyoming, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal,and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
