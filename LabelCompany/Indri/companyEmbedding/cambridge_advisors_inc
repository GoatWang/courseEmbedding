Welcome to Cambridge Advisors Inc.


When you work hard to accumulate wealth, you need an investment advisor who takes time to know you...who understands your situation and your goals...someone who will custom-tailor their service to you rather than trying to fit you into their models...someone who will provide clarity about your financial picture and what strategies will help you reach your goals...someone who you can rely on because you know their advice is objective and based on time-proven strategies...someone who will help simplify your life so you can focus on the activities you enjoy...You need Cambridge Advisors.
WHO WE ARE
Cambridge Advisors is an independent, fee-only registered investment advisor.  Our team of highly-educated investment professionals is dedicated to helping clients build and preserve their wealth.  We specialize in managing custom-tailored investment portfolios for clients with $500,000 or more of investable assets.
As the trend towards fee-only advice from a registered investment advisor is gaining popularity amongst investors and advisors, we have always operated under this optimum arrangement since our inception more than 25 years ago.  Gaylan Abood founded Cambridge Advisors on January 1, 1990 to provide a high level of personal service to investment management clients, a quality he felt was lacking in brokerage firms and bank trust departments.  As we have added new faces to Cambridge Advisors and widened our circle of clients, our core values have remained constant since the beginning:
♦ To always act with integrity
♦ To be aligned with the client's interests
♦ To have highly educated professionals working together as a team
♦ To have a client-focused approach
♦ To provide a high-quality service
If these values are attractive to you, we invite you to learn more about Cambridge Advisors.  Wondering if our services might benefit you?  Take our quick and easy Discovery Quiz to find out.

Our Fees



Cambridge Advisors is a fee-only firm and we believe in complete disclosure regarding fees.  We have no hidden fees or imbedded expenses.  The only source of revenue we receive is from the investment management fee.  We believe a fee-only arrangement (no commissions or revenue sharing programs, no company branded products) is best for clients because our advice is entirely objective and free from any conflicts of interest.  Our typical quarterly investment management fee is 0.25% of the assets under management and includes all investment management and financial planning services. 
For clients whose investable assets do not meet our minimum, we offer the financial planning services on a stand-alone basis for a stated fee of $2,500.

Retirement Planning



For most of our clients, enjoying their retirement is a main objective in why they choose a relationship with Cambridge Advisors.  If retirement is still years away, we can help you see if you are saving enough for the retirement you envision. If you are nearing retirement, we can help you determine when is the best time to retire, what your retirement lifestyle may look like, and which retirement payout options to choose from in your 401k, pension or other retirement plan.  If you are already retired, we can help you determine how much income you can comfortably spend and from which sources you should spend first. Our specialized retirement planning services include the following:
♦ Review and asset allocation recommendation for employer sponsored retirement plans
♦ Retirement planning projections
♦ IRA rollovers
♦ Retirement income planning
♦ Strategies for meeting retirement goals
For clients who do not meet our investment management minimum, we offer the financial planning on a stand alone basis which would include our retirement planning services.

Our Process



PERSONALIZED A.I.M. SYSTEM
We begin all of our relationships by going through The Cambridge Advisors Personalized A.I.M System.  Our comprehensive investment management process looks at each client's unique situation and develops a customized solution to help the client achieve their specific financial goals.

 





Step 1


Step 2


Step 3


Assess and Analyze
First, we assess and analyze the client's unique situation looking at factors such as time horizon, tax bracket, types of accounts, resources and investment experience.  We also discuss their  goals and needs for their accounts along with any preferences or limitations for the account.  From the information gathererd, we create and update the Investment Policy Statement which provides guidelines on how the portfolio should be invested.

 
Implement
Next, we develop and implement a custom-tailored investment plan.  We do not use model stock portfolios or proprietary investment funds so each client has an investment portfolio unique to them that is dependent on factors in their Investment Policy Statement as well as when they became a client.  The investment plan may be implemented immediately or gradually over time depending on the client and their situation. Monitor and Make adjustments
Then, on an ongoing basis, we monitor and make adjustments to the portfolio and the investment plan as needed.  We meet with the client periodically to review progress and keep the plans current with life events such as career change, retirement, death of a spouse, birth of children or grandchildren, or even changes in risk tolerance.  These events trigger the process to restart.


 
INVESTMENT COMMITTEE
Our advisors form the investment committee and are actively involved in the research functions of the firm as well as the portfolio management functions. We make our own investment decisions internally rather than rely on a "buy list" from a parent company or Wall Street third party.  Therefore, our recommendations and investment decisions are free from conflicts of interest.
The investment committee meets three times a week to discuss the economy, the markets, and securities we currently own or are considering buying. We gather information from a wide variety of sources for analysis and utilize state of the art research tools.  All advisors thoroughly understand the fundamentals of the securities they are buying and selling in the client portfolios they are managing.
The advisor implements the recommendations of the investment committee as appropriate for each client.
 
INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY
In an era when many investment managers seem intent on trying to create one-size-fits-all investment strategies and products, we have kept our focus on providing a high caliber of personalized investment management services.  Each client account is managed separately from other client accounts. Our portfolios are customized to each client so that we respect risk tolerance levels and return expectations.
When structuring portfolios, we consider several factors.  First, we take into account the client's investment policy statement.  Second, we strive to build a diversified portfolio.  Third, based on current market conditions and our future outlook, we emphasize areas where we see higher growth potential. Within this framework we build a portfolio that reflects each client's specific constraints including liquidity issues, investment horizon, government regulations, tax implications and unique needs.
While we are not "market-timers" we do recognize that the risk/reward relationship of the various asset classes will change over time.  Asset allocations are adjusted to reflect our outlook of future growth opportunities and risk levels as well as the client's needs.  Factors such as equity valuations and interest rate levels may influence asset allocations.  When equity valuations and/or interest rates are at historically high levels it may encourage a shift in asset allocation in favor of fixed income securities.  When equity valuations and/or interest rates are at historically low levels it may encourage a shift in favor of equity securities.  Most changes in asset allocation due to market factors are gradual.

Our Difference


Just as our clients are each unique, Cambridge Advisors is unique from other financial advisors.  First, Cambridge Advisors is an independent, fee-only firm so we are able to provide objective advice that is not influenced by commissions, revenue-sharing arrangements, products or affiliations.  Second, we limit the number of clients we serve so that our advisors build a relationship with each client enabling them to be proactive to the client's needs.  Third, our portfolio managers are dedicated to higher learning and have earned highly-sought-after professional designations including Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC), Chartered Market Technician (CMT), Certified Public Accountant (CPA), and advanced degrees including MBA.  Our professionals work as a team, sharing their knowledge, diverse experience and expertise to benefit all clients of the firm.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

Welcome to Cambridge Advisors Inc.


When you work hard to accumulate wealth, you need an investment advisor who takes time to know you...who understands your situation and your goals...someone who will custom-tailor their service to you rather than trying to fit you into their models...someone who will provide clarity about your financial picture and what strategies will help you reach your goals...someone who you can rely on because you know their advice is objective and based on time-proven strategies...someone who will help simplify your life so you can focus on the activities you enjoy...You need Cambridge Advisors.
WHO WE ARE
Cambridge Advisors is an independent, fee-only registered investment advisor.  Our team of highly-educated investment professionals is dedicated to helping clients build and preserve their wealth.  We specialize in managing custom-tailored investment portfolios for clients with $500,000 or more of investable assets.
As the trend towards fee-only advice from a registered investment advisor is gaining popularity amongst investors and advisors, we have always operated under this optimum arrangement since our inception more than 25 years ago.  Gaylan Abood founded Cambridge Advisors on January 1, 1990 to provide a high level of personal service to investment management clients, a quality he felt was lacking in brokerage firms and bank trust departments.  As we have added new faces to Cambridge Advisors and widened our circle of clients, our core values have remained constant since the beginning:
♦ To always act with integrity
♦ To be aligned with the client's interests
♦ To have highly educated professionals working together as a team
♦ To have a client-focused approach
♦ To provide a high-quality service
If these values are attractive to you, we invite you to learn more about Cambridge Advisors.  Wondering if our services might benefit you?  Take our quick and easy Discovery Quiz to find out.
ATTENTIVE      ♦      TRUSTED      ♦      ACCESSIBLE
