Before that, he was Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer of Pfizer, Inc. where he worked for 20 years in a variety of executive positions of increasing responsibility, including Treasurer and Senior Vice President of Finance & Strategic Management for the company’s research and development organization. Mr. Levin received a bachelor’s degree from Princeton University and a master’s degree from New York University’s Stern School of Business. Mr. Levin is a certified public accountant. He is a member of the Advisory Board of Auven Therapeutics, a private equity fund, Diffusion Pharmaceuticals LLC, a development stage oncology company, and the Critical Path Institute, a non-profit collaboration between the Food and Drug Administration and pharmaceutical industry participants. We believe that Mr. Levin’s financial experience, including his prior positions as chief financial officer of Endo and Pfizer and executive-level experience in the pharmaceutical industry, as well as his experience in financial reporting, treasury and corporate finance, gives him the qualifications and skills to serve as one of our directors.
