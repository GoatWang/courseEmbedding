Could my child be going through puberty too soon?

All photos are of models and not of persons with central precocious puberty.






When children show premature puberty (before age 8 in girls, age 9 in boys), it’s considered precocious. The most common type is known as central precocious puberty (CPP).1,2



Hear a doctor discuss when normal puberty starts for girls and boys.
Karen Klein, MD, Pediatric Endocrinologist

What is the “normal” age for puberty?

Karen Klein, MD, Pediatric Endocrinologist









CPP is when puberty starts sooner than it should.1,2 Everyone goes through puberty. It’s a normal part of growing up. But when a child goes through puberty sooner than normal, it’s called  early puberty or central precocious puberty (CPP).
CPP is triggered when the brain tells the pituitary gland (a pea-shaped gland located at the bottom of the brain) to release “puberty” hormones called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) too soon. The result is that girls start producing estrogen, boys start producing testosterone, and sexual development begins.3

Common signs of puberty in girls1,4-8






Breast development
Breast buds, a small lump under one or both nipples, begin to appear. The area may become tender and sore.
Menstrual periods
A few months before their first period, or menarche, some girls experience a clear or white vaginal discharge. The first period will likely be mild, with only a few drops of blood or spotting. However, the amount of blood and duration of periods varies from person to person.
Pubic or underarm hair
Light, straight hair appears in the pubic area but eventually turns darker, curlier, and coarser in texture. Approximately two years after pubic hair appears, hair appears on the underarms.
Oily skin/acne
At puberty, sebaceous glands underneath the skin become more active and may clog pores, leading to acne.
Adult body odor
This starts at puberty because of an increase in hormones. To regulate its temperature, your body sweats. When the sweat mixes with the bacteria on your skin, it causes body odor.
Sudden growth spurt
A dramatic growth spurt may make children going through puberty look gangly, but they will continue to fill out soon after.




Puberty in girls

									Normal puberty development in boys begins around age 11 (between 9 and 14 years old).

Common signs of puberty in boys1,7,8,10,11






Testicle & penis enlargement
The testicles almost double in size at the beginning of puberty, followed by growth of the penis (first in length, then width).
Erections
During puberty, erections occur more frequently and for no apparent reason (and often at inconvenient times). Over time, they become less frequent.
Voice change
During a boy's growth period, his voice box, or larynx, also grows. While at first a boy's voice will crack, once the larynx stops growing the cracking will stop and the voice will deepen for good.
Facial hair
Hair starts growing first on the upper lip, then on the cheek, and finally the chin.
Muscle growth
During puberty boys fill out, so by the late teens their body composition is only 12% fat.
Pubic or underarm hair
Light, straight hair appears in the pubic area but eventually turns darker, curlier, and coarser in texture. Approximately two years after pubic hair appears, hair appears on the underarms.
Oily skin/acne
At puberty, sebaceous glands underneath the skin become more active and may clog pores, leading to acne.
Adult body odor
This starts at puberty because of an increase in hormones. To regulate its temperature, your body sweats. When the sweat mixes with the bacteria on your skin, it causes body odor.
Sudden growth spurt
A dramatic growth spurt may make children going through puberty look gangly, but they will continue to fill out soon after.


Remember, just because you’re seeing early signs of puberty doesn’t necessarily mean your child has CPP.

If your child is showing signs of puberty too soon, see your pediatrician to get a diagnosis as soon as possible.
CPP can be treated. But, left untreated, precocious puberty can cause long-term complications.9 Only a qualified healthcare provider can diagnose CPP and help find a treatment that is appropriate for your child. That’s why it’s important to see your pediatrician now. The sooner you know for sure, the sooner your child can get the treatment he or she needs.

If your child is showing signs of puberty too soon, see your pediatrician to get a diagnosis as soon as possible.
CPP can be treated. But, left untreated, precocious puberty can cause long-term complications.9 Only a qualified healthcare provider can diagnose CPP and help find a treatment that is appropriate for your child. That’s why it’s important to see your pediatrician now. The sooner you know for sure, the sooner your child can get the treatment he or she needs.

Could my child be going through puberty too soon?

All photos are of models and not of persons with central precocious puberty.






When children show premature puberty (before age 8 in girls, age 9 in boys), it’s considered precocious. The most common type is known as central precocious puberty (CPP).1,2



Hear a doctor discuss when normal puberty starts for girls and boys.
Karen Klein, MD, Pediatric Endocrinologist

What is the “normal” age for puberty?

Karen Klein, MD, Pediatric Endocrinologist









CPP is when puberty starts sooner than it should.1,2 Everyone goes through puberty. It’s a normal part of growing up. But when a child goes through puberty sooner than normal, it’s called  early puberty or central precocious puberty (CPP).
CPP is triggered when the brain tells the pituitary gland (a pea-shaped gland located at the bottom of the brain) to release “puberty” hormones called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) too soon. The result is that girls start producing estrogen, boys start producing testosterone, and sexual development begins.3

Common signs of puberty in girls1,4-8






Breast development
Breast buds, a small lump under one or both nipples, begin to appear. The area may become tender and sore.
Menstrual periods
A few months before their first period, or menarche, some girls experience a clear or white vaginal discharge. The first period will likely be mild, with only a few drops of blood or spotting. However, the amount of blood and duration of periods varies from person to person.
Pubic or underarm hair
Light, straight hair appears in the pubic area but eventually turns darker, curlier, and coarser in texture. Approximately two years after pubic hair appears, hair appears on the underarms.
Oily skin/acne
At puberty, sebaceous glands underneath the skin become more active and may clog pores, leading to acne.
Adult body odor
This starts at puberty because of an increase in hormones. To regulate its temperature, your body sweats. When the sweat mixes with the bacteria on your skin, it causes body odor.
Sudden growth spurt
A dramatic growth spurt may make children going through puberty look gangly, but they will continue to fill out soon after.




Puberty in girls
Puberty in boys


									Normal puberty development in boys begins around age 11 (between 9 and 14 years old).

Testicle & penis enlargement
The testicles almost double in size at the beginning of puberty, followed by growth of the penis (first in length, then width).
Erections
During puberty, erections occur more frequently and for no apparent reason (and often at inconvenient times). Over time, they become less frequent.
Voice change
During a boy's growth period, his voice box, or larynx, also grows. While at first a boy's voice will crack, once the larynx stops growing the cracking will stop and the voice will deepen for good.
Facial hair
Hair starts growing first on the upper lip, then on the cheek, and finally the chin.
Muscle growth
During puberty boys fill out, so by the late teens their body composition is only 12% fat.
Pubic or underarm hair
Light, straight hair appears in the pubic area but eventually turns darker, curlier, and coarser in texture. Approximately two years after pubic hair appears, hair appears on the underarms.
Oily skin/acne
At puberty, sebaceous glands underneath the skin become more active and may clog pores, leading to acne.
Adult body odor
This starts at puberty because of an increase in hormones. To regulate its temperature, your body sweats. When the sweat mixes with the bacteria on your skin, it causes body odor.

Remember, just because you’re seeing early signs of puberty doesn’t necessarily mean your child has CPP.

Could my child be going through puberty too soon?

All photos are of models and not of persons with central precocious puberty.






When children show premature puberty (before age 8 in girls, age 9 in boys), it’s considered precocious. The most common type is known as central precocious puberty (CPP).1,2



Hear a doctor discuss when normal puberty starts for girls and boys.

What is the “normal” age for puberty?

Karen Klein, MD, Pediatric Endocrinologist









CPP is when puberty starts sooner than it should.1,2 Everyone goes through puberty. It’s a normal part of growing up. But when a child goes through puberty sooner than normal, it’s called  early puberty or central precocious puberty (CPP).
CPP is triggered when the brain tells the pituitary gland (a pea-shaped gland located at the bottom of the brain) to release “puberty” hormones called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) too soon. The result is that girls start producing estrogen, boys start producing testosterone, and sexual development begins.3

Common signs of puberty in girls1,4-8






Breast development
Breast buds, a small lump under one or both nipples, begin to appear. The area may become tender and sore.
Menstrual periods
A few months before their first period, or menarche, some girls experience a clear or white vaginal discharge. The first period will likely be mild, with only a few drops of blood or spotting. However, the amount of blood and duration of periods varies from person to person.
Pubic or underarm hair
Light, straight hair appears in the pubic area but eventually turns darker, curlier, and coarser in texture. Approximately two years after pubic hair appears, hair appears on the underarms.
Oily skin/acne
At puberty, sebaceous glands underneath the skin become more active and may clog pores, leading to acne.
Adult body odor
This starts at puberty because of an increase in hormones. To regulate its temperature, your body sweats. When the sweat mixes with the bacteria on your skin, it causes body odor.
Sudden growth spurt
A dramatic growth spurt may make children going through puberty look gangly, but they will continue to fill out soon after.




Puberty in girls
Puberty in boys


									Normal puberty development in boys begins around age 11 (between 9 and 14 years old).
									In boys, CPP is when puberty starts before age 9.1

Testicle & penis enlargement
The testicles almost double in size at the beginning of puberty, followed by growth of the penis (first in length, then width).
Erections
During puberty, erections occur more frequently and for no apparent reason (and often at inconvenient times). Over time, they become less frequent.
Voice change
During a boy's growth period, his voice box, or larynx, also grows. While at first a boy's voice will crack, once the larynx stops growing the cracking will stop and the voice will deepen for good.
Facial hair
Hair starts growing first on the upper lip, then on the cheek, and finally the chin.
Muscle growth
During puberty boys fill out, so by the late teens their body composition is only 12% fat.
Pubic or underarm hair
Light, straight hair appears in the pubic area but eventually turns darker, curlier, and coarser in texture. Approximately two years after pubic hair appears, hair appears on the underarms.
Oily skin/acne
At puberty, sebaceous glands underneath the skin become more active and may clog pores, leading to acne.
Adult body odor
This starts at puberty because of an increase in hormones. To regulate its temperature, your body sweats. When the sweat mixes with the bacteria on your skin, it causes body odor.
Sudden growth spurt
A dramatic growth spurt may make children going through puberty look gangly, but they will continue to fill out soon after.


Remember, just because you’re seeing early signs of puberty doesn’t necessarily mean your child has CPP.

If your child is showing signs of puberty too soon, see your pediatrician to get a diagnosis as soon as possible.
CPP can be treated. But, left untreated, precocious puberty can cause long-term complications.9 Only a qualified healthcare provider can diagnose CPP and help find a treatment that is appropriate for your child. That’s why it’s important to see your pediatrician now. The sooner you know for sure, the sooner your child can get the treatment he or she needs.
