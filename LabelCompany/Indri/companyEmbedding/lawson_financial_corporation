FINRA Files Complaint Charging Lawson Financial Corporation, CEO With Fraudulent Municipal Bond Sales, and Charging CEO With Misuse of Customer’s Charitable Trust Funds




Bonds Related to Charter School in Arizona and Two Assisted Living Facilities in Alabama
WASHINGTON — The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced today that it has filed a complaint against Phoenix-based firm, Lawson Financial Corporation, Inc. (LFC), and Robert Lawson, the firm’s President and Chief Executive Officer, charging them with securities fraud in connection with the sale of millions of dollars of municipal revenue bonds to customers. The complaint further charges Robert Lawson and Pamela Lawson, LFC’s Chief Operating Officer, with self-dealing by abusing their positions as co-trustees of a charitable remainder trust and improperly using the trust funds to indirectly prop up the struggling offerings. Based on the transfers of millions of dollars from the charitable remainder trust account, the complaint also charges Robert Lawson with misuse of customer funds.
The municipal revenue bonds at issue in the complaint include: (1) a $10.5 million bond offering in October 2014 for bonds relating to an Arizona charter school as underwritten by LFC and sold to LFC customers, as well as subsequent sales of these bonds to LFC customers in the secondary market; (2) secondary market bond sales to LFC customers in 2015 of earlier-issued municipal revenue bonds relating to the corporate predecessor of the same Arizona charter school; and (3) secondary market sales to LFC customers between January 2013 and July 2015 of earlier-issued municipal revenue bonds concerning two different assisted living facilities in Alabama.
The complaint alleges that Robert Lawson and LFC were aware of financial difficulties faced by the municipal revenue bond conduit borrowers (the charter school in Arizona and the two assisted living facilities in Alabama) and fraudulently hid from LFC customers who purchased the bonds the material facts that the charter school and the two assisted living facilities were under financial stress. The complaint alleges that Robert Lawson and LFC carried out their fraudulent scheme by transferring millions of dollars from a deceased customer’s charitable trust account to parties associated with the conduit borrowers to hide the financial condition of the bond borrowers and the risks posed to the municipal revenue bonds. In particular, the complaint alleges that LFC and Robert Lawson hid from LFC customers who purchased the bonds the material fact that Robert Lawson – in his role as co-trustee of the charitable trust account, and with the knowledge of his wife Pamela Lawson – was improperly transferring millions of dollars of funds from the charitable remainder trust account to various parties associated with the bond borrowers when the borrowers were not able to pay their operating expenses and, for certain of the bonds, were not able to make the required interest payments on the bonds.
The issuance of a disciplinary complaint represents the initiation of a formal proceeding by FINRA in which findings as to the allegations in the complaint have not been made, and does not represent a decision as to any of the allegations contained in the complaint. Under FINRA rules, a firm or individual named in a complaint can file a response and request a hearing before a FINRA disciplinary panel. Possible remedies include a fine, censure, suspension or bar from the securities industry, disgorgement of gains associated with the violations and payment of restitution.
Investors can obtain more information about, and the disciplinary record of, any FINRA-registered broker or brokerage firm by using FINRA's BrokerCheck. FINRA makes BrokerCheck available at no charge. In 2015, members of the public used this service to conduct 71 million reviews of broker or firm records.
Investors can access BrokerCheck at www.finra.org/brokercheck or by calling (800) 289-9999. Investors may find copies of this disciplinary action as well as other disciplinary documents in FINRA's Disciplinary Actions Online database. Investors can also call FINRA's Securities Helpline for Seniors at (844) 57-HELPS for assistance or to raise concerns about issues they have with their brokerage accounts and investments.
FINRA, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, is the largest independent regulator for all securities firms doing business in the United States. FINRA is dedicated to investor protection and market integrity through effective and efficient regulation and complementary compliance and technology-based services. FINRA touches virtually every aspect of the securities business – from registering and educating all industry participants to examining securities firms, writing rules, enforcing those rules and the federal securities laws, and informing and educating the investing public.

Lawson Financial Corporation Charged With Securities Fraud






Bond Fraud, Elder Abuse, Stockbroker Fraud News |

Lawson Financial Corporation, as well as Robert Lawson (the firm’s president, chief compliance officer, and chief executive officer), and Pamela Lawson (the firm’s owner and chief operating officer) were charged by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Department of Enforcement in a Complaint alleging securities fraud in the sale municipal revenue bonds. Department of Enforcement v. Lawson Financial Corporation, et al., No. 2014043854401 (May 16, 2016).
According to the Complaint, from 2013 through 2015, the firm and the Lawsons’ engaged in a mass securities fraud regarding sale of municipal revenue bonds. Apparently, the fraud was associated with the Decatur Bonds, Cullman Bonds, Destiny Bonds, and Hillcrest Bonds. The Complaint stated that the Hillcrest and Destiny Bonds funded an Arizona charter school. The Decatur and Cullman Bonds apparently funded two living facilities located in Alabama.
According to FINRA, the fraudulent Hillcrest Bond sales, which were effected by the firm and Robert Lawson, occurred both in the primary and the secondary markets. The Complaint alleged fraudulent sales regarding the Decatur, Cullman, and Destiny bonds to have occurred in the secondary bond market.
FINRA alleged in the Complaint that Lawson Financial Corporation was the underwriter for the aforementioned bond offerings. Apparently, the school and living facilities all sustained substantial financial troubles, and could not cover expenses associated with operations. The assisted living facilities, according to the Complaint, could not make the debt payments on the aforementioned Bonds unless funds were utilized from a charitable remainder trust held at Lawson Financial Corporation.
FINRA alleged that Lawson Financial Corporation and Robert Lawson were cognizant of the financial difficulties sustained by the assisted living facilities and the charter school, but omitted this material information to investors. FINRA claimed that the firm and Robert Lawson intended on concealing this information from investors in order to prevent them from becoming aware of the risks associated with the bonds purchased.
Additionally, the Complaint stated that investors were not informed by the firm and Robert Lawson that Robert Lawson served as co-trustee of the aforementioned charitable remainder trust. Further, investors were reportedly not informed that Pamela Lawson was also a co-trustee on the charitable remainder trust. Critically, FINRA alleged that the firm and the Lawsons had wrongly effected the transfers of several million dollars from the charitable remainder trust account to provide financial relief to the assisted living facilities and the charter school.
According to the Complaint, the funds coming from the charitable remainder trust belonged to WP, a Lawson Financial Corporation client. Apparently, the funds were originally held in the WP Trust, in which Robert Lawson was a trustee, where such funds were transferred to a charitable remainder trust upon WP’s death. FINRA alleged that by February 2012, Robert and Pamela Lawson were the only remaining trustees in the charitable remainder trust.
The Complaint stated that Robert Lawson directed $14,000,000.00 in funds to be transferred from the WP Trust to the assisted living facilities and the charter school in order to cover the debt of the Decatur and Cullman Bonds. The Complaint stated that the charitable remainder trust account’s assets were comprised mostly of municipal bonds, and severely depleted by such transfers. FINRA claimed that only $1,800,000.00 has been repaid to the charitable remainder trust.
FINRA alleged in the Complaint that the firm and Robert Lawson acted willfully in violating Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Section 10(b), Rule 10b-5, and violated MSRB Rule G-17. FINRA alleged (in an alternative cause of action) that the firm and Robert Lawson violated Securities Act of 1933 Section 17(a)(2) and (a)(3).
Further, the firm and Robert Lawson are alleged to have violated MSRB Rule G-19 as a result of the unsuitable recommendations made to investors concerning the municipal revenue bonds. Both Robert and Pamela Lawson are alleged by FINRA to have violated FINRA Rule 2010 in connection with their breaching of fiduciary obligations to the WP Trust. Further, the Lawsons are alleged to have violated FINRA Rule 2010 and 2150(a) for mishandling customer funds.
Public disclosure records reveal that Robert Lawson has been subject to eight disclosure incidents, six of which involve customer complaints. On September 1, 1995, Lawson settled a customer dispute for $25,000.00 amid allegations of misrepresentations concerning municipal bonds. On October 7, 1998, a customer was awarded $1,925.00 after alleging Lawson to have provided misleading and/or false information concerning municipal bonds.
On June 12, 2000, Lawson settled a customer dispute for $6,500.00 after a customer alleged investments purchased were unsuitable. On September 24, 2001, a customer was awarded $294,590.54 after alleging unsuitability, breach of fiduciary duty, and misrepresentations concerning municipal bonds.
On November 8, 2002, a customer was awarded $88,365.72 after alleging unsuitability and misrepresentation concerning municipal bonds. Finally, on October 19, 2009, a customer received an award of $237,500.00 after alleging negligence, misrepresentation, and suitability.
