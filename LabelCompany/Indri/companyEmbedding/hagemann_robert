https...Robert likedSummarySpeaker on entrepreneurship, brand management, personal success, goal setting, and professional network development.Currently leveraging my past experience in CPG marketing and sales as the founder of a craft liquor distillery in Jersey City, NJ.  At Corgi Spirits, we meticulously craft small-batch, ultra-premium liquors that are suited for drinking on their own or in making cocktails that are refined, yet playful, much like the dogs after which our brand is named. We're very excited to offer a range of gins and vodka for our launch. Our special botanical blends, which are artfully infused into our distillate, create a uniquely floral and citrusy flavour profile. All of our products are handcrafted. A portion of profits from every bottle of Corgi is donated to a local dog adoption agency in the Jersey City area, because we love dogs as much as we appreciate exceptional spirits. Learn more about our mission to craft exceptional spirits and help rescue animals on our website at corgispirits.com We're slated to launch and open our distillery to the public in July of 2017!

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
