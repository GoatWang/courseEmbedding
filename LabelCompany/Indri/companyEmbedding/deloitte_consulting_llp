About Deloitte Consulting LLP

With more than 70,000 professionals, Deloitte LLP is the largest
private professional services provider in the United States. Its
subsidiaries work in four key business areas-audit, advisory,
consulting, and tax-with the ability to combine elements of those
groups to address clients' needs.  
Deloitte* was recently ranked by Gartner, IDC, and Kennedy as a
leading consulting firm globally for the sixth consecutive year,
named a leader in business transformation consulting by Forrester,
and serves 80% of Fortune 500 companies. 
Demonstrating leadership, instilling
confidence
Deloitte Consulting LLP prides itself on being a "go-to"
organization helping clients to solve some of the most complex,
critical challenges - from initial strategy design through
implementation and ongoing operations. Its teams provide global
experience and local knowledge enabled by world-class technology
solutions to help clients focus on the big picture and succeed in
public or private business environments. 
Deloitte Consulting LLP is organized into Service Areas and
offerings, with three main practice areas: Human Capital, Strategy
& Operations, and Technology including branded offerings:
Deloitte Analytics and Deloitte Digital. Across these areas,
professionals serve clients in a number of industries, including
consumer and industrial products; energy and resources; federal and
state government; financial services; life sciences and health
care; and technology, media and telecommunications. The
organization focuses on demonstrating leadership and making an
impact on the issues that clients are-or will be-facing. Through
that leadership, Deloitte Consulting works to instill the
confidence in clients to make effective decisions and take a
preferred path that works for their organizations. 
Deloitte Consulting LLP's Strategy & Operations practice has
a double-digit share of the global market, and consistently ranks
as #1 or #2 in the profession. The practice works with senior
executives to help them solve their toughest and most complex
problems by bringing an executable strategy that combines deep
industry knowledge, rigorous analysis, and insight to enable
confident action. The Strategy & Operations practice provides
services such as corporate strategy, customer and marketing
strategy, digital transformation, innovation, mergers and
acquisitions, social impact strategy, business model
transformation, supply chain and manufacturing operations,
sector-specific service operations and financial management.
Deloitte's strategy practice Monitor Deloitte, and innovation
practice Doblin, both fall within Strategy &
Operations. 
The organization is also well known for its Human Capital
practice having been named a global leader-appearing furthest to
the right of the Vanguard for "breadth of capabilities"- in
Leadership Development Consulting by Kennedy. In addition, Deloitte
has been named a global leader in HR Transformation consulting by
Kennedy Research. The practice specializes in implementing
HR/talent solutions to solve key business challenges to help

Deloitte Consulting LLP's Technology practice has been rated and
ranked by industry analysts as one of the leading tech service
providers in the world, delivering a holistic portfolio of support
to clients, ranging from strategic advisory services to
implementation and operations assistance. The practice helps
clients align technology with the core of their business strategy
to deliver measurable results, providing tools to help clients
understand potential technology disruptions that could change
business as usual. Key services support such activities as
technology strategy and innovation, analytic and information
management, data center and cloud services, technology, and
application architecture, IT-led business transformation, mobility
solutions, and technology integration and optimization. 
Deloitte Consulting LLP also integrates its service areas into
two branded practices-Deloitte Analytics and Deloitte Digital.

business and technology experience to design and deliver digital

consulting practice of this scope and scale. 
During her 25 years with Deloitte, Janet led Deloitte's federal practice of more than 7,300

profitability. Prior to that she led Deloitte Consulting LLP's
Technology practice where she achieved double-digit growth and
launched several innovative businesses that address clients' needs
in evolving areas. During her career, Janet served clients across
industries and elevated awareness around critical topics like

The alliance combines Dassault Systemes' leadership in Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software and Deloitte's 15 years of deep experience in applying lean principles to complex product development processes and implementing PLM software to enable the processes. Today's product development teams are often cross functional including external partners that may be scattered across the globe.

Deloitte practitioners trained in ENOVIA V6 combine this PLM technology with Deloitte’s predefined PLM process models that incorporate 15 years of leading practices, lean product development principles, industry sector knowledge and domain experience to provide high value to clients.

			DECISION


		Deloitte Consulting, LLP, of Arlington, Virginia, protests the actions of the Department of Defense, Defense Health Agency (DHA) in its implementation of corrective action in response to Deloitte’s prior protest of the award of a contract to Data Networks Corporation (DNC), of Reston, Virginia, under request for proposals (RFP) No. HT0011-15-R-0010, for the agency’s governance, requirements, and architecture management support (GRAMS) requirement.  Deloitte alleges that the agency has imposed unreasonable limitations on the scope of final proposal revisions (FPRs), by prohibiting revisions in areas of proposals that are materially impacted by the corrective action. 

		We sustain the protest.

		BACKGROUND

		The agency issued the RFP on February 26, 2015, for the purpose of awarding a contract for the GRAMS requirement, which provides program management support to requirement managers in DHA’s Health Information Technology Directorate.  The RFP provided that the GRAMS contract was to be awarded on a best-value basis, for a one-year base period and four one-year option periods.  The best-value decision was to be based on four evaluation factors and subfactors, as follows:

		1.  Factor 1--Technical
Subfactor 1A--Technical Approach
Subfactor 1B--Staffing Approach
Subfactor 1C--Transition In and Out
Subfactor 1D--Quality Control Approach

		2.  Factor 2--Past Performance

		3.  Factor 3--Small Business Participation Plan
(acceptable/unacceptable)

		4.  Factor 4--Price

		RFP Amendment 004, at 61.  As relevant, the RFP performance work statement identified nine key personnel positions and the minimum requirements for those positions.  Id. at 130-131.  The RFP provided that the key personnel resumes and commitment letters would be evaluated under “Subfactor 1B--Staffing Approach,” in order to determine the “[r]elevant qualifications and experience of proposed Key Personnel.”  Id. at 62.

		Six offerors submitted proposals in response to the RFP.  Following an initial evaluation, discussions, and evaluation of FPRs, the agency made an initial award to DNC on September 17, 2015.  Deloitte protested that award decision with our Office, alleging in part that DNC had unmitigable impaired objectivity organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs) due to two other contracts held by DNC.  In response to Deloitte’s protest, the agency informed our Office that it would take corrective action and conduct a new OCI analysis concerning DNC’s contracts.  Our Office then dismissed Deloitte’s protest as academic on October 26.  Deloitte Consulting, LLP, B-412125, Oct. 26, 2015 (unpublished decision).

		The agency completed a new OCI analysis memorandum dated December 14, which concluded that the connections between DNC’s contracts did not present an OCI.  OCI Analysis Memo, at 6.  The agency reaffirmed the prior award to DNC on December 31.  Deloitte then filed its second protest of the award decision on January 6, 2016, alleging that the agency’s new OCI analysis was unreasonable.  Deloitte also alleged that the agency’s evaluations of the staffing approach subfactor and the past performance factor were unreasonable, and that the agency conducted unequal discussions with respect to past performance. 

		On April 15, 2016, we sustained the protest in part, finding that the agency conducted an unreasonable evaluation of the key personnel resumes under the staffing approach subfactor.  Deloitte Consulting, LLP, B-412125.2, B-412125.3, Apr. 15, 2016, 2016 CPD ¶ 119.  Specifically, we concluded that the resumes of multiple key personnel did not demonstrate that the individuals met the minimum requirements of the positions for which they were proposed, and that to the extent certain minimum requirements had been waived by the agency, we could not conclude that the waiver was equally applied to both offerors’ proposed personnel.  Id.

		We also sustained the protest on the basis that the agency’s evaluation of past performance was unreasonable and unsupported, and that the agency’s discussions with the offerors in this area were unequal.  Id.  We denied the protest with respect to Deloitte’s challenge to the agency’s OCI analysis.  Id.  We recommended that the agency reopen discussions with the offerors, request new FPRs, and conduct and document a new evaluation in accordance with the evaluation criteria of the RFP.  Id.  We also specifically noted that the agency’s discussions should include evaluation notices concerning any proposed key personnel whose resume did not meet the minimum requirements of the RFP.  Id.

		On April 29, the agency advised Deloitte of its planned corrective action in the following notice:

		Please be advised that the Defense Health Agency intends to take corrective action in this case, consistent with the GAO’s recommendations following the sustained protest.  The Agency corrective action will include conducting discussions regarding past performance and key personnel with offerors in the competitive range, permitting offerors to submit final proposal revisions (FPRs) limited to past performance and key personnel information, reevaluating the offerors’ past performance and key personnel information, and making a new source selection decision.  The Agency expects to execute this corrective action within the next several days.

		Request to Dismiss Protest B-412125.4, May 24, 2016, at 1-2.  On May 4 and May 5, the agency and protester exchanged further correspondence, in which the agency indicated that the “description of the scope of the Agency’s intended corrective action is accurate--we will limit FPR updates to past performance and key personnel information,” and that “[t]he agency will only be reevaluating past performance and key personnel information and does not intend to request revised price proposals from the offerors in the competitive range.”  Id. at 2.

		By email on May 16, the agency sent Deloitte evaluation notices and a cover letter that further explained the discussions process and final FPR limitations.  The evaluation notices (ENs) concerning Deloitte’s key personnel advised that on reevaluation, the agency was unable to confirm that [DELETED] of Deloitte’s nine key personnel met the minimum requirements of the positions for which they were proposed.  In the cover letter, the agency advised that it was reopening discussions “ONLY in the areas specifically related to Sub-factor 1B Key Personnel and Past Performance,” and that FPRs could update proposals “ONLY in the areas addressed in the enclosed EN.”  Protest B-412125.4, May 20, 2016, at 9. 

		In response to the cover letter, Deloitte again contacted the agency to clarify the restrictions on FPRs.  Specifically, Deloitte advised the agency that changes to its “key personnel information” in response to the agency’s ENs would require replacement of [DELETED] previously-proposed key personnel, and would necessitate key personnel-related revisions to all technical subfactors--not simply the key personnel area of subfactor 1B.  Deloitte explained that this was because the key personnel to be replaced had also been specifically identified in other areas of Deloitte’s technical proposal, and because the replacement of these personnel otherwise impacted Deloitte’s proposed approach such that it will cause a ripple effect throughout the technical proposal.  Accordingly, Deloitte requested that the agency confirm its intention to evaluate updated key personnel-related information throughout the revised technical proposal. 

		By email on May 17, the agency advised that “the process will remain as stated in the letter . . . dated May 16, 2016.”  Protest B-412125.4, May 20, 2016, at 10.  Deloitte then filed its first protest of the agency’s conduct of the corrective action on May 20.[1]

		On August 11, the GAO attorney handling the protest conducted an alternative dispute resolution, negotiation assistance, conference call with the parties.  The GAO attorney attempted to clarify the scope of Deloitte’s request to revise “key personnel information” throughout its technical proposal, as well as the basis for the agency’s opposition to those revisions, to assess the possibility of a mutually satisfactory resolution of the protest.  During that call, the GAO attorney expressed concern with the agency’s restrictions on revisions to FPRs to the extent that the restrictions would prevent an offeror from revising all references to specific key personnel to be replaced, thereby creating potentially material inconsistencies within the offeror’s revised proposal.  Following this conference call, on August 12, the agency advised our Office that it would take corrective action consisting of revising the FPR instructions.  Our Office then dismissed Deloitte’s protest on August 16.  Deloitte Consulting LLP, B-412125.4, Aug. 16, 2016 (unpublished decision).

		As a result of this corrective action, the agency updated its restrictions on FPRs as follows:

		(1) You may make written changes to Volume 1, Key Personnel, under Technical Subfactor 1B, and (2) you may make written changes to other aspects of your Technical Proposal (under Subfactors 1A, 1C, and 1D), but only to the extent that your initial proposal referenced your key personnel and/or the qualifications of said key personnel relative to their ability to execute your proposed technical approach.  More specifically, the scope of changes to your Technical Proposal outside of Technical Subfactor 1B is limited to updating the names of key personnel (as necessary) and updating any accompanying qualification descriptions for such new key personnel.  You may not update your technical approach under Subfactors 1A, 1C, or 1D.

		Corrective Action Letter, August 12, 2016, at 1 (emphasis original).

		On August 22, Deloitte filed the instant protest.

		DISCUSSION

		Deloitte argues that the agency’s updated FPR instructions continue to exclude proposal revisions “inextricably linked” to the key personnel substitutions permitted in response to discussions.[2]  Deloitte specifically asserts that the limitations, for example, improperly prohibit necessary revisions to its transition plan and unreasonably restrict the specific content of proposal updates in areas where revisions are permitted.

		The agency responds that its limitations on the scope of FPR revisions are reasonable and tailored to remedy the identified procurement improprieties in our Office’s April 15, 2016 decision sustaining Deloitte’s prior protest in part, and are consistent with GAO precedent regarding agency discretion to limit proposal revisions in the context of corrective actions.  The agency contends that Deloitte aims to update multiple aspects of its technical approach by using new key personnel to introduce new tools and techniques not presented in its prior proposal, and to alter its transition approach.  According to the agency, Deloitte should not be “allowed to augment its technical approach at this late stage, thereby disregarding a reasonable corrective action tailored to correct a procurement impropriety.”  Agency Report (AR) at 7.

		An agency’s discretion when taking corrective action extends to the scope of proposal revisions.  See, e.g., Computer Assocs. Int’l., B‑292077.2, Sept. 4, 2003, 2003 CPD ¶ 157 at 5; Rel‑Tek Sys. & Design, Inc.--Modification of Remedy, B‑280463.7, July 1, 1999, 99-2 CPD ¶ 1 at 3.  As a general matter, offerors in response to discussions may revise any aspect of their proposals as they see fit, including portions of their proposals which were not subject to discussions;  an agency, in conducting discussions to implement corrective action, may, however, reasonably limit the scope of revisions.  System Planning Corp., B‑244697.4, June 15, 1992, 92-1 CPD ¶ 516 at 3-4.  Where the corrective action does not also include amending the solicitation, we will not question an agency’s decision to restrict proposal revisions when taking corrective action so long as it is reasonable in nature and remedies the established or suspected procurement impropriety.  See, Consolidated Eng’g Servs., Inc., B-293864.2, Oct. 25, 2004, 2004 CPD ¶ 214 at 3-4; Computer Assocs. Int’l, supra.  In reviewing the reasonableness of an agency’s restrictions on proposal revisions in the context of discussions to implement corrective action, we will consider whether the discussions, and permitted revisions in response to discussions, are expected to have a material impact on other areas of the offeror’s proposal.  Evergreen Helicopters of Alaska, Inc., B‑409327.3, Apr. 14, 2014, 2014 CPD ¶ 128 at 8; Honeywell Technology Solutions, Inc., B‑400771.6, Nov. 23, 2009, 2009 CPD ¶ 240 at 4; see also Rel-Tek Sys. & Design, Inc.‑‑Modification of Remedy, supra.; ST Aerospace Engines Pte. Ltd., B-275725.3 Oct. 17, 1997, 97-2 CPD ¶ 106 at 4.

		We have reviewed the record here and, as a general matter, do not object to the agency’s decision to limit proposal revisions to areas in which our Office identified improprieties in the prior award decision.  However, even where an agency is justified in restricting discussions responses in corrective action, the agency may not prohibit offerors from revising related areas of their proposals which are materially impacted.  Whether these associated revisions may allow an offeror to further “augment its technical approach,”--as the agency asserts is Deloitte’s intention--is not the appropriate test of whether such revisions must be permitted.  Rather, as set forth above, when assessing the reasonableness of an agency’s restrictions on proposal revisions, we consider the extent to which the discussions, and the permitted changes in response to discussions, materially impact or are “inextricably linked” with other aspects of an offeror’s proposal.  Honeywell Technology Solutions, Inc., supra.

		In multiple prior protests concerning agency decisions to limit the scope of proposal revisions as part of corrective action, our Office has concluded that the limitations imposed were reasonable.  In each of these cases, we concluded that the permitted revisions in response to discussions would not impact other areas of the proposals in which revisions were prohibited.  For instance, in Evergreen Helicopters, our Office did not object to corrective action that limited FPR revisions to the addition of “performance data charts for the aircraft type and tail numbers proposed,” and prohibited any other revisions.  Evergreen Helicopters of Alaska, Inc., supra. at 3.  We concluded that the limited revisions were reasonable to correct informational deficiencies in the proposals, that other aspects of the proposals such as pricing would not be impacted by discussions limited to additional performance data, and that correction of informational deficiencies with respect to previously-proposed aircraft, therefore, need not open the door for offerors to substitute entirely new aircraft.

		Similarly, in Honeywell Technology Solutions, Inc., supra, our Office did not object to corrective action where the agency allowed offerors to revise their past performance proposals only.  In that case, we found that the limited revisions were reasonable to correct evaluation errors associated with two prior past performance evaluations.  Concerning the protester’s argument that the FPR limitations were unreasonably restrictive where other aspects of its proposal were “inextricably linked” to its past performance information, we disagreed, concluding that “Honeywell has failed to establish that NASA’s decision permitting offerors to update their past performance information is expected to have a material impact on their cost or technical proposals.”[3]  Id. at 3, 5.

		Finally, in Rel-Tek Sys. & Design, Inc.‑‑Modification of Remedy, supra, we did not object to corrective action which limited proposal revisions to three specific solicitation requirements, concerning “acceptance, warranty and software performance provisions” of the solicitation.  Id. at 2.  In that protest, Rel-Tek argued that the corrective action was improper because it precluded Rel-Tek from changing areas of its proposal that the firm desired to change in order to be more competitive.  Our Office concluded that the procurement improprieties and the corrective action involved separate aspects of the firm’s proposal and did not affect other portions of the proposal or requirements.  We also specifically noted, however, that the limitations imposed by the agency did not prohibit the protester from revising other aspects of its proposal to the extent they related to the acceptance, warranty, and software performance provisions.  Our decision indicated as follows:

		To the extent Rel-Tek contends that the limited [best and final offer (BAFO)] request prejudices its chances for award, since the firm cannot alter its cost proposal in other areas that may have included costs related to these three [solicitation] requirements, we are not persuaded by this argument--Rel‑Tek has not shown that the terms of the BAFO request are unnecessarily restrictive. The agency’s BAFO request, limited to the offerors’ technical and cost-related proposal revisions for acceptance, warranty, and system performance, did not prohibit revision to other areas of the offerors’ proposals to the extent that those proposal areas contained terms and related costs for the three requirements at issue

Id., at 4 n.5 (emphasis added).[4]

		In contrast, in the present protest, we conclude that the corrective action, to include discussions regarding key personnel, does materially impact the protester’s technical proposal beyond the limited revisions permitted in the agency’s updated FPR instructions letter.  On the record here, the protester has established that the permitted key personnel substitutions broadly impact its proposal due to the differing qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the key personnel substitutions, and their relative ability to perform the proposal as initially proposed.  Where the agency’s limitations on proposal revision prohibit such changes, they are unreasonable. 

		For example, we agree with the protester that the FPR instructions, as written, unreasonably prohibit the protester from revising its transition plan, which is materially impacted by the permitted key personnel substitutions.  Specifically, the FPR instructions permit revisions to proposal sections beyond those of subfactor 1B “only to the extent that your initial proposal referenced your key personnel.”  Corrective Action Letter, August 12, 2016, at 1.  While Deloitte’s transition plan, as proposed, did not directly address the transition of key personnel, Deloitte explains that its transition must nonetheless be revised because while its previously-proposed key personnel were all [DELETED] its substitute key personnel are [DELETED].  As a consequence, these new key personnel [DELETED].  Given that the agency’s proposal revision instructions preclude this change to a section of Deloitte’s proposal that would be materially impacted by the permitted key personnel substitutions, we conclude that the instruction’s limitations are unreasonably restrictive. 

		We also agree with the protester that the instruction limiting the contents of revisions to “updating the names of key personnel (as necessary) and updating any accompanying qualification descriptions for such new key personnel” unreasonably restricts the protester from conforming areas of its technical proposal that directly reference key personnel who will be removed.  For example, Deloitte explains, and the record reflects, that its prior proposal identified two key personnel‑‑its program manager and senior information architect (architecture)--as also performing in non‑key roles as [DELETED] in its transition approach.  Deloitte argues that these two individuals were selected based on prior experience [DELETED].  Both individuals are now to be replaced in Deloitte’s FPR.  Because Deloitte’s new senior information architect (architecture) does not have experience [DELETED], Deloitte proposes to replace its [DELETED] with an individual who will not be designated as a key person--a substitution which would be prohibited under a plain reading of the agency’s limitations on revisions since the new individual is not one of the “key personnel.”[5]

		Finally, we agree with the protester that the agency’s decision to limit proposal updates to “accompanying qualification descriptions” is unreasonably restrictive with respect to other skills and attributes of the key personnel that Deloitte highlighted throughout its technical proposal.  Specifically, Deloitte explains that because the substitute key personnel do not share the same skills and experience which led Deloitte to feature the prior key personnel in the other areas of its technical approach, those aspects of the approach also require revision.  In essence, Deloitte maintains that the required substitutions necessitate changes to its technical proposal beyond merely changing the qualification descriptions of the new key personnel. 

		For example, Deloitte’s prior proposal presented multiple descriptions of its key personnel’s knowledge of various management practices and techniques, which were presented as enhancements to, and impact its approach to performance of, technical subfactors outside of subfactor 1B.  Because Deloitte’s substitute key personnel have different skills and experience--with different [DELETED], for instance[6]--we agree that the permitted revisions should extend to revising references to substituted key personnel in Deloitte’s technical approach as necessary to reflect the skills of its new personnel, or to otherwise address the proposal content impacted by the removal of the prior key personnel.

		In conclusion, we find that the restrictions on proposal revisions imposed by the agency in connection with key personnel substitutions, as part of the agency’s implementation of corrective action, are unreasonably restrictive.  The protester has demonstrated that due to the inherently different qualifications, capabilities, and experience of key personnel, substitutions with respect to these individuals materially impact the protester’s proposal in a broad manner, in ways that need to be revised beyond merely substituting names and resumes for the individuals to be replaced.

		RECOMMENDATION

		We find that the agency’s limitations on the scope of revisions in response to corrective action are unreasonably restrictive, where the limitations prohibit the protester from revising all aspects of its technical approach that are materially impacted by the corrective action.  We recommend that DHA, at a minimum, amend its FPR instruction to permit offerors to revise all aspects of their technical proposals to the extent that the revisions relate to the permitted substitutions of key personnel, and thereafter reevaluate the offerors’ revised technical proposals.[7]  We also recommend that Deloitte be reimbursed the costs of filing and pursuing its protest, including reasonable attorney’s fees.  4 C.F.R. § 21.8(d)(1).  The protester should submit its certified claim for such costs, detailing the time expended and costs incurred, directly with the agency within 60 days of receiving this decision.  4 C.F.R. § 21.8(f)(1).

		The protest is sustained.

		Susan A. Poling

[1] The agency requested that our Office dismiss Deloitte’s protest as untimely, arguing that Deloitte knew or should have known the basis of its protest no later than May 5.  We disagreed, concluding that while Deloitte had been advised that revisions would be limited to “key personnel information,” the protester first learned that revisions to key personnel information would be limited to subfactor 1B in the May 16 cover letter.  GAO Email on Request for Dismissal, June 15, 2016.



[2] Deloitte also alleges that the corrective action letter is ambiguous with respect to the “qualifications” of key personnel that may be revised.  Based on our conclusion, below, that the restriction on revisions to only the “qualifications” of key personnel is unreasonably restrictive and our recommendation that the FPR instructions be revised, we conclude that this basis of Deloitte’s protest is academic.



[3] We reached a different result in the protest of Power Connector, Inc., B‑404916.2, Aug. 15, 2011, 2011 CPD ¶ 186, in which we concluded that offerors should be permitted to make revisions to all aspects of their proposals in response to corrective action concerning an impropriety in the evaluation of past performance.  However, the corrective action in that case included the issuance of an amendment to the solicitation.  Where an agency amends the solicitation and permits offerors to revise their proposals, our Office has held that offerors should be permitted to revise any aspect of their proposals--including those that were not the subject of the amendment--unless the agency demonstrates that the amendment could not reasonably have an effect on the other aspects of the proposals, or that allowing such revisions would have a detrimental impact on the competitive process.  Power Connector, Inc., supra; Cooperativa Muratori Riuniti, B-294980.5, July 27, 2005, 2005 CPD ¶ 144 at 7; Lockheed Martin Sys. Integration-Owego; Sikorsky Aircraft Co., B-299145.5, B-299145.6, Aug. 30, 2007, 2007 CPD ¶ 155 at 5.



[4] We conclude that this fact alone--that the agency in Rel-Tek expressed a limitation on the topical “areas” of proposals which could be revised, without limitation to where in the proposals the revisions could reach--significantly distinguishes the reasonable limitations described in Rel-Tek, from the unreasonable limitations at issue in this protest.



[5] In briefing, the agency expressed that it had no objection to the protester’s proposed revision of its [DELETED] to include a new non-key individual.  However, where a plain reading of the agency’s updated FPR instruction would prohibit such a revision, we conclude that we must sustain the protest in this respect.



[6] Deloitte explains that its replacements for [DELETED] bring new skills and experience that redefine the prior approach to multiple aspects of performance.  For example, Deloitte highlights the new [DELETED] experience with Deloitte’s [DELETED] as new and different skills versus the prior key personnel, which impact various areas of the technical approach in which the skills of the prior key personnel were discussed.  Protest at 14-15.   



[7] Concerning the agency’s disagreements with the protester over what aspects of the proposal “relate” to the permitted key personnel substitutions--previewed in the agency’s report here--we conclude that a ruling on specific proposal revisions is premature at this time.  To the extent that the agency declines to review certain revisions undertaken by the protester as “related” to the substitution of key personnel, such a dispute concerns an evaluation challenge that would potentially form the basis of a subsequent protest with this Office.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1845, William Welch Deloitte opened an office in London. Deloitte was the first person to be appointed an independent auditor of a public company, namely the Great Western Railway.[17] He went on to open an office in New York in 1880.[17]
In 1896, Charles Waldo Haskins and Elijah Watt Sells formed Haskins & Sells in New York.[17] It was later described as "the first major auditing firm to be established in the country by American rather than British accountants."[18]
In 1898, George Touche established an office in London and then, in 1900, joined John Ballantine Niven in establishing the firm of Touche Niven in the Johnston Building at 30 Broad Street in New York.[17] At the time, there were fewer than 500 CPAs practicing in the United States, but the new era of income taxes was soon to generate enormous demand for accounting professionals.
On 1 March 1933, Colonel Arthur Hazelton Carter, President of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants and Managing Partner of Haskins & Sells, testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking and Currency. Carter helped convince Congress that independent audits should be mandatory for public companies.[17]




William Welch Deloitte, founder of Deloitte


In 1947, Detroit accountant George Bailey, then president of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, launched his own organization. The new entity enjoyed such a positive start that in less than a year, the partners merged with Touche Niven and A. R. Smart to form Touche, Niven, Bailey & Smart.[17] Headed by Bailey, the organization grew rapidly, in part by creating a dedicated management consulting function. It also forged closer links with organizations established by the co-founder of Touche Niven, George Touche: the Canadian organization Ross and the British organization George A. Touche.[17] In 1960, the firm was renamed Touche, Ross, Bailey & Smart, becoming Touche Ross in 1969.[17] In 1968 Nobuzo Tohmatsu formed Tohmatsu Aoki & Co, a firm based in Japan that was to become part of the Touche Ross network in 1975.[17] In 1972 Robert Trueblood, Chairman of Touche Ross, led the committee responsible for recommending the establishment of the Financial Accounting Standards Board.[17] He led the expansion of Touche Ross in that era.
In 1952, Deloitte merged his firm (by then known as Deloitte, Plender, Griffiths & Co.) with Haskins & Sells to form Deloitte Haskins & Sells.[19]
In 1989, Deloitte Haskins & Sells merged with Touche Ross in the USA to form Deloitte & Touche. The merged firm was led jointly by J. Michael Cook and Edward A. Kangas. Led by the UK partnership, a smaller number of Deloitte Haskins & Sells member firms rejected the merger with Touche Ross and shortly thereafter merged with Coopers & Lybrand to form Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte (later to merge with Price Waterhouse to become PwC).[20] Some member firms of Touche Ross also rejected the merger with Deloitte Haskins & Sells and merged with other firms.[20] In UK, Touche Ross merged with Spicer & Oppenheim in 1990.[21]
Recent history[edit]
At the time of the US-led mergers to form Deloitte & Touche, the name of the international firm was a problem, because there was no worldwide exclusive access to the names "Deloitte" or "Touche Ross" – key member firms such as Deloitte in the UK and Touche Ross in Australia had not joined the merger. The name DRT International was therefore chosen, referring to Deloitte, Ross and Tohmatsu. In 1993, the international firm was renamed Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu to reflect the contribution from the Japanese firm,[17] as well as agreements to use both of the names Deloitte and Touche.




Deloitte Office Building in Downtown Chicago


In 1995, the partners of Deloitte & Touche decided to create Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group (now known as Deloitte Consulting).[22]
In 2000, Deloitte acquired Eclipse to add Internet design-based solutions to its consulting capabilities. Eclipse was later separated into Deloitte Online and Deloitte Digital.[23]
In 2002, Arthur Andersen's UK practice, the firm's largest practice outside the US, agreed to merge with Deloitte's UK practice. Andersen's practices in Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Mexico, Brazil and Canada also agreed to merge with Deloitte.[24][25] The spinoff of Deloitte France's consulting division led to the creation of Ineum Consulting.[26]
In 2005, Deloitte acquired Beijing Pan-China CPA Ltd to become the largest accountancy firm in China.[27]
In 2007, Deloitte began hiring former employees of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for their competitive intelligence unit known as Deloitte Intelligence.[28]
In 2009, Deloitte purchased the North American Public Service practice of BearingPoint (formerly KPMG Consulting) after it filed for bankruptcy protection.[29] The firm also took over the UK property consultants Drivers Jonas in January 2010.[30]
In 2011, Deloitte acquired DOMANI Sustainability Consulting and ClearCarbon Consulting in order to expand its sustainability service offerings.[31]
In January 2012, Deloitte announced the acquisition of Übermind, Inc., an innovative mobile agency.[32] The acquisition marked Deloitte's first entrance into the mobile application field.[33]
In November 2012, Deloitte acquired Recombinant Data Corporation, a company specializing in data warehousing and clinical intelligence solutions, and launched Recombinant by Deloitte.[34] In February 2013 Recombinant by Deloitte merged with an internal informatics unit (Deloitte Health Informatics) and launched ConvergeHEALTH by Deloitte.[35]
On 11 January 2013, Deloitte acquired substantially all of the business of Monitor Group,[36] the strategy consulting firm founded by Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter, after Monitor filed for bankruptcy protection.[37]
In 2014 the company introduced Rubix, a blockchain offering providing advisory services for clients in different business sectors, including government. In 2016 the company created its first blockchain lab in Dublin. A second hub was launched in New York in January, 2017. Deloitte became a member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance and the Hyperledger Project sponsored by the Linux Foundation in May, 2017.[38]
In 2015, the Pope of the Roman Catholic church, Pope Francis, appointed Libero Milone, former Chairman and CEO of Deloitte in Italy, as the first Auditor-General of Vatican City and Vatican Bank.[39][40][41]
In 2015, Indian Railways mandated Deloitte to formulate its entire manpower policy for its gazetted officers and study the functioning and the role of the departments at the zonal and divisional levels. Deloitte is expected to submit the report by March 31, 2016.[42]
In 2016, Deloitte acquired advertising agency Heat of San Francisco, best known for Madden NFL from EA Sports.[43]
In September 2016, Apple Inc. announced a partnership with Deloitte aimed at boosting sales of its phones and other mobile devices to businesses. As part of the partnership, the two companies will launch a service called Enterprise Next, in which more than 5,000 Deloitte consultants will advise clients on how to make better use of Apple products and services.[44][45][46]
In October 2016, Deloitte announced that they were creating Deloitte North West Europe. The Belgian, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish member firms will combine with the UK and Swiss member firms to create Deloitte North West Europe. Deloitte, over the next three years, will invest €200m to enhance its services to its global, national and private market clients and to create the best development opportunities. The firm will come into effect on 1 June 2017 and it is estimated to have 28,000 partners and people generating over €5bn in annual revenue. Deloitte North West Europe will account for approximately 20% of all revenue within their Global Network. [47]
Name and branding[edit]




Deloitte New Logo (Short)


While in 1989, in most countries, Deloitte, Haskins & Sells merged with Touche Ross forming Deloitte & Touche, in the United Kingdom the local firm of Deloitte, Haskins & Sells merged instead with Coopers & Lybrand (later renamed PwC).[48] For some years after the merger, the merged UK firm was called Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte and the local firm of Touche Ross kept its original name. In the mid-1990s however, both UK firms changed their names to match those of their respective international organizations.
While the full name of the UK private company is Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, in 1989 it initially branded itself DTT International. In 2003, the rebranding campaign was commissioned by William G. Parrett, the then-CEO of DTT, and led by Jerry Leamon, the global Clients and Markets leader.[49]
According to the company website, Deloitte now refers to the brand under which independent firms throughout the world collaborate to provide audit, consulting, financial advisory, risk management, and tax services to selected clients.[50]
In 2008, Deloitte adopted its new "Always One Step Ahead" (AOSA) brand positioning platform to support the existing Deloitte vision: "To be the Standard of Excellence". AOSA represents the global organization's value proposition and is never used as a tagline. The recent launch of the Green Dot ad campaign also aligns with Deloitte's brand strategy and positioning framework.[51]
In June 2016, Deloitte changed its branding and adopted a new logo with Deloitte written in black color instead of earlier blue.[52]
Global structure[edit]
For many years, the organization and its network of member firms were legally organized as a Swiss Verein (the equivalent to an unincorporated association, like the Associated Press in the United States). As of 31 July 2010, members of the Verein became part of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (DTTL), a UK private company, limited by guarantee. Each member firm in its global network remains a separate and independent legal entity, subject to the laws and professional regulations of the particular country or countries in which it operates.[53] Deloitte is registered under the NAIC code of 55112.[54]




30 Rockefeller Center is the location of Deloitte's Global Head Office.


This structure is similar to other professional services networks which seek to limit vicarious liability for acts of other members. As separate and legal entities, member firms and DTTL cannot obligate each other. Professional services continue to be provided by member firms only and not DTTL. With this structure, the members should not be liable for the negligence of other independent members. This structure also allows them to be members of the IFAC Forum of Firms[55] which is a network of accounting firm networks.
Services[edit]
Deloitte member firms offer services in the following functions, with country-specific variations on their legal implementation (i.e., all operating within a single company or through separate legal entities operating as subsidiaries of an umbrella legal entity for the country). The 2016 revenue shares are listed in parentheses.[5]

Audit (27%): Provides the organization's traditional accounting and audit services, as well as internal auditing and IT control assurance.
Consulting (34%): Assists clients by providing services in the areas of enterprise applications, technology integration, strategy & operations, human capital, and short-term outsourcing.
Financial Advisory (9%): Provides corporate finance services to clients, including dispute, personal and commercial bankruptcy, forensics, e-discovery, document review, advisory, capital projects consulting and valuation services.
Risk Advisory (11%): Provides offerings in enterprise risk management, information security and privacy, data quality and integrity, project risk and business continuity management.
Tax & Legal (19%): Helps clients increase their net asset value, undertake the transfer pricing and international tax activities of multinational companies, minimize their tax liabilities, implement tax computer systems, and provides advisory of tax implications of various business decisions.

Staff and offices[edit]
Deloitte offers its staff a variety of career models to choose from based on their preferences, strengths, geographic location, and business need. These career models also vary for each function and in some cases across different member firms around the world. Traditional titles for Consulting are Analyst, Consultant, Senior Consultant, Manager, Senior Manager, Director and Partner. In some of the more assurance centric functions the titles Consultant and Senior Consultant are substituted for Analyst and Senior Analyst. Many parts of Deloitte also offer an alternate career path for people that choose to pursue deep specialisation in their chosen fields but may not have Partnership aspirations. Titles for these position differ around the world but may include Specialist Senior, Specialist Master and Specialist Leader.
Awards and recognition[edit]

Deloitte, along with KPMG, PwC and PA Consulting Group were recognized among the UK's best companies to work for in 2017.[56]

Criticisms[edit]
Disputes involving Deloitte include:

ActionAid – In November 2013, the international development charity ActionAid accused Deloitte of advising large businesses on how they could use Mauritius to avoid potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of tax in some of the poorest countries in Africa.[57]
Adelphia Communications Corporation – The Securities and Exchange Commission announced on 26 April 2005 that Deloitte had agreed to pay $50 million to settle charges relating to Adelphia's 2000 financial statements.[58]
Guangdong Kelon Electrical Holdings Company Limited – Investors have claimed that there was a failure to alert them to the company's poor financial position.[59]
Haringey Council Refresh Project – A local government IT project in the UK, in which costs rose from £9 million to £24.6 million. Deloitte were consultants on the project, despite being employed at the same time as the council's auditors.[60]
Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) – The firm implemented the SAP HR system for LAUSD for $95 million and because of faults in the system, some teachers were underpaid, overpaid, or not paid at all.[61] As of 31 December 2007, LAUSD had incurred a total of $140 million in payments to Deloitte to get the system working properly.[62] In 2008, there was some evidence that the payroll issues had started to stabilize with errors below 1% according to LAUSD's chief operating officer.[63]
State of California Courts System – The firm worked on a statewide case management system which originally had a budget of around $260 million. Almost $500 million had been spent and costs were at one time projected to potentially run as high as $2 billion. No single court became fully operational.[64] California's Judicial Council terminated the project in 2012 citing actual deployment costs associated with the project and California's budget concerns.[65]
Australian Tobacco Industry – In 2011, Deloitte was commissioned by the tobacco industry to compile a report on illicit tobacco. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service officials called the report "potentially misleading" and raised concerns about the "reliability and accuracy" of the data.[66] When a second Deloitte report focusing on counterfeit cigarettes was released, Home Affairs Minister Brendan O'Connor described the second report as "baseless and deceptive" and "bogus".[67] Public health officials criticised Deloitte's decision to conduct the research, as it added credibility to the tobacco industry's effort to undermine the Australian Government's plain cigarette packaging legislation.[68][69]
Canadian Bar Association – In September 2003, Deloitte provided a report to the CBA that motor vehicle accident insurance claims for bodily injury had been declining since 1999 when taking inflation into account, which refuted the government's and industry's argument that general damages for soft-tissue injury had to be capped at $4,000. Within hours of release, a member of Deloitte was communicating with Insurance Bureau of Canada without the knowledge of CBA (their client) and providing confidential information. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Alberta found Deloitte guilty of unprofessional conduct and fined the firm $40,000.[70]
Standard Chartered Iranian Money Laundering – In August 2012, Deloitte was forced to publicly deny that as the official internal auditors for Standard Chartered, it helped the bank cover up suspected money laundering operations which were earning the bank significant profits by "intentionally omitting critical information".[71]
On 17 June 2014 Booz Allen Hamilton sued Deloitte, claiming the firm stole proprietary information in order to 'lift out' a specialized team of Booz employees.[72] Both firms agreed to dismiss the claims and counterclaims in late 2015.[73]
In proceedings arising from the insolvency of the former entertainment company Livent, in April 2014 its special receiver obtained judgment against Deloitte for $84,750,000 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, in relation to Deloitte's failure to exercise its duty of care with respect to the audit of Livent's financial statements during 1993–1998.[74] The ruling was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal in January 2016.[75][76]

Sponsorship[edit]
Deloitte serves as the official professional services sponsor of the United States Olympic Committee since year 2009.[77] The UK member firm of Deloitte was a sponsor of the London 2012 Olympics[78] and the Royal Opera House.[79] The Canadian member firm was also the official professional services supplier for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games[80] and 2010 Winter Paralympic Games.[81] In Asia, the Singapore member firm of Deloitte was a sponsor of the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics.[82]
Moreover, Deloitte sponsors many university sports teams and societies, such as Edinburgh University Hockey Club.[83] It also entered into a 3-year partnership with the Cambridge Union Society in November 2013.[84]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1845, William Welch Deloitte opened an office in London. Deloitte was the first person to be appointed an independent auditor of a public company, namely the Great Western Railway.[17] He went on to open an office in New York in 1880.[17]
In 1896, Charles Waldo Haskins and Elijah Watt Sells formed Haskins & Sells in New York.[17] It was later described as "the first major auditing firm to be established in the country by American rather than British accountants."[18]
In 1898, George Touche established an office in London and then, in 1900, joined John Ballantine Niven in establishing the firm of Touche Niven in the Johnston Building at 30 Broad Street in New York.[17] At the time, there were fewer than 500 CPAs practicing in the United States, but the new era of income taxes was soon to generate enormous demand for accounting professionals.
On 1 March 1933, Colonel Arthur Hazelton Carter, President of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants and Managing Partner of Haskins & Sells, testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking and Currency. Carter helped convince Congress that independent audits should be mandatory for public companies.[17]




William Welch Deloitte, founder of Deloitte


In 1947, Detroit accountant George Bailey, then president of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, launched his own organization. The new entity enjoyed such a positive start that in less than a year, the partners merged with Touche Niven and A. R. Smart to form Touche, Niven, Bailey & Smart.[17] Headed by Bailey, the organization grew rapidly, in part by creating a dedicated management consulting function. It also forged closer links with organizations established by the co-founder of Touche Niven, George Touche: the Canadian organization Ross and the British organization George A. Touche.[17] In 1960, the firm was renamed Touche, Ross, Bailey & Smart, becoming Touche Ross in 1969.[17] In 1968 Nobuzo Tohmatsu formed Tohmatsu Aoki & Co, a firm based in Japan that was to become part of the Touche Ross network in 1975.[17] In 1972 Robert Trueblood, Chairman of Touche Ross, led the committee responsible for recommending the establishment of the Financial Accounting Standards Board.[17] He led the expansion of Touche Ross in that era.
In 1952, Deloitte merged his firm (by then known as Deloitte, Plender, Griffiths & Co.) with Haskins & Sells to form Deloitte Haskins & Sells.[19]
In 1989, Deloitte Haskins & Sells merged with Touche Ross in the USA to form Deloitte & Touche. The merged firm was led jointly by J. Michael Cook and Edward A. Kangas. Led by the UK partnership, a smaller number of Deloitte Haskins & Sells member firms rejected the merger with Touche Ross and shortly thereafter merged with Coopers & Lybrand to form Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte (later to merge with Price Waterhouse to become PwC).[20] Some member firms of Touche Ross also rejected the merger with Deloitte Haskins & Sells and merged with other firms.[20] In UK, Touche Ross merged with Spicer & Oppenheim in 1990.[21]
Recent history[edit]
At the time of the US-led mergers to form Deloitte & Touche, the name of the international firm was a problem, because there was no worldwide exclusive access to the names "Deloitte" or "Touche Ross" – key member firms such as Deloitte in the UK and Touche Ross in Australia had not joined the merger. The name DRT International was therefore chosen, referring to Deloitte, Ross and Tohmatsu. In 1993, the international firm was renamed Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu to reflect the contribution from the Japanese firm,[17] as well as agreements to use both of the names Deloitte and Touche.

In 1995, the partners of Deloitte & Touche decided to create Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group (now known as Deloitte Consulting).[22]
In 2000, Deloitte acquired Eclipse to add Internet design-based solutions to its consulting capabilities. Eclipse was later separated into Deloitte Online and Deloitte Digital.[23]
In 2002, Arthur Andersen's UK practice, the firm's largest practice outside the US, agreed to merge with Deloitte's UK practice. Andersen's practices in Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Mexico, Brazil and Canada also agreed to merge with Deloitte.[24][25] The spinoff of Deloitte France's consulting division led to the creation of Ineum Consulting.[26]
In 2005, Deloitte acquired Beijing Pan-China CPA Ltd to become the largest accountancy firm in China.[27]
In 2007, Deloitte began hiring former employees of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for their competitive intelligence unit known as Deloitte Intelligence.[28]
In 2009, Deloitte purchased the North American Public Service practice of BearingPoint (formerly KPMG Consulting) after it filed for bankruptcy protection.[29] The firm also took over the UK property consultants Drivers Jonas in January 2010.[30]
In 2011, Deloitte acquired DOMANI Sustainability Consulting and ClearCarbon Consulting in order to expand its sustainability service offerings.[31]
In January 2012, Deloitte announced the acquisition of Übermind, Inc., an innovative mobile agency.[32] The acquisition marked Deloitte's first entrance into the mobile application field.[33]
In November 2012, Deloitte acquired Recombinant Data Corporation, a company specializing in data warehousing and clinical intelligence solutions, and launched Recombinant by Deloitte.[34] In February 2013 Recombinant by Deloitte merged with an internal informatics unit (Deloitte Health Informatics) and launched ConvergeHEALTH by Deloitte.[35]
On 11 January 2013, Deloitte acquired substantially all of the business of Monitor Group,[36] the strategy consulting firm founded by Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter, after Monitor filed for bankruptcy protection.[37]
In 2014 the company introduced Rubix, a blockchain offering providing advisory services for clients in different business sectors, including government. In 2016 the company created its first blockchain lab in Dublin. A second hub was launched in New York in January, 2017. Deloitte became a member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance and the Hyperledger Project sponsored by the Linux Foundation in May, 2017.[38]
In 2015, the Pope of the Roman Catholic church, Pope Francis, appointed Libero Milone, former Chairman and CEO of Deloitte in Italy, as the first Auditor-General of Vatican City and Vatican Bank.[39][40][41]
In 2015, Indian Railways mandated Deloitte to formulate its entire manpower policy for its gazetted officers and study the functioning and the role of the departments at the zonal and divisional levels. Deloitte is expected to submit the report by March 31, 2016.[42]
In 2016, Deloitte acquired advertising agency Heat of San Francisco, best known for Madden NFL from EA Sports.[43]
In September 2016, Apple Inc. announced a partnership with Deloitte aimed at boosting sales of its phones and other mobile devices to businesses. As part of the partnership, the two companies will launch a service called Enterprise Next, in which more than 5,000 Deloitte consultants will advise clients on how to make better use of Apple products and services.[44][45][46]
In October 2016, Deloitte announced that they were creating Deloitte North West Europe. The Belgian, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish member firms will combine with the UK and Swiss member firms to create Deloitte North West Europe. Deloitte, over the next three years, will invest €200m to enhance its services to its global, national and private market clients and to create the best development opportunities. The firm will come into effect on 1 June 2017 and it is estimated to have 28,000 partners and people generating over €5bn in annual revenue. Deloitte North West Europe will account for approximately 20% of all revenue within their Global Network. [47]
Name and branding[edit]




Deloitte New Logo (Short)


While in 1989, in most countries, Deloitte, Haskins & Sells merged with Touche Ross forming Deloitte & Touche, in the United Kingdom the local firm of Deloitte, Haskins & Sells merged instead with Coopers & Lybrand (later renamed PwC).[48] For some years after the merger, the merged UK firm was called Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte and the local firm of Touche Ross kept its original name. In the mid-1990s however, both UK firms changed their names to match those of their respective international organizations.
While the full name of the UK private company is Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, in 1989 it initially branded itself DTT International. In 2003, the rebranding campaign was commissioned by William G. Parrett, the then-CEO of DTT, and led by Jerry Leamon, the global Clients and Markets leader.[49]
According to the company website, Deloitte now refers to the brand under which independent firms throughout the world collaborate to provide audit, consulting, financial advisory, risk management, and tax services to selected clients.[50]
In 2008, Deloitte adopted its new "Always One Step Ahead" (AOSA) brand positioning platform to support the existing Deloitte vision: "To be the Standard of Excellence". AOSA represents the global organization's value proposition and is never used as a tagline. The recent launch of the Green Dot ad campaign also aligns with Deloitte's brand strategy and positioning framework.[51]
In June 2016, Deloitte changed its branding and adopted a new logo with Deloitte written in black color instead of earlier blue.[52]
Global structure[edit]
For many years, the organization and its network of member firms were legally organized as a Swiss Verein (the equivalent to an unincorporated association, like the Associated Press in the United States). As of 31 July 2010, members of the Verein became part of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (DTTL), a UK private company, limited by guarantee. Each member firm in its global network remains a separate and independent legal entity, subject to the laws and professional regulations of the particular country or countries in which it operates.[53] Deloitte is registered under the NAIC code of 55112.[54]




30 Rockefeller Center is the location of Deloitte's Global Head Office.


This structure is similar to other professional services networks which seek to limit vicarious liability for acts of other members. As separate and legal entities, member firms and DTTL cannot obligate each other. Professional services continue to be provided by member firms only and not DTTL. With this structure, the members should not be liable for the negligence of other independent members. This structure also allows them to be members of the IFAC Forum of Firms[55] which is a network of accounting firm networks.
Services[edit]
Deloitte member firms offer services in the following functions, with country-specific variations on their legal implementation (i.e., all operating within a single company or through separate legal entities operating as subsidiaries of an umbrella legal entity for the country). The 2016 revenue shares are listed in parentheses.[5]

Audit (27%): Provides the organization's traditional accounting and audit services, as well as internal auditing and IT control assurance.
Consulting (34%): Assists clients by providing services in the areas of enterprise applications, technology integration, strategy & operations, human capital, and short-term outsourcing.
Financial Advisory (9%): Provides corporate finance services to clients, including dispute, personal and commercial bankruptcy, forensics, e-discovery, document review, advisory, capital projects consulting and valuation services.
Risk Advisory (11%): Provides offerings in enterprise risk management, information security and privacy, data quality and integrity, project risk and business continuity management.
Tax & Legal (19%): Helps clients increase their net asset value, undertake the transfer pricing and international tax activities of multinational companies, minimize their tax liabilities, implement tax computer systems, and provides advisory of tax implications of various business decisions.

Staff and offices[edit]
Deloitte offers its staff a variety of career models to choose from based on their preferences, strengths, geographic location, and business need. These career models also vary for each function and in some cases across different member firms around the world. Traditional titles for Consulting are Analyst, Consultant, Senior Consultant, Manager, Senior Manager, Director and Partner. In some of the more assurance centric functions the titles Consultant and Senior Consultant are substituted for Analyst and Senior Analyst. Many parts of Deloitte also offer an alternate career path for people that choose to pursue deep specialisation in their chosen fields but may not have Partnership aspirations. Titles for these position differ around the world but may include Specialist Senior, Specialist Master and Specialist Leader.
Awards and recognition[edit]

Deloitte, along with KPMG, PwC and PA Consulting Group were recognized among the UK's best companies to work for in 2017.[56]

Criticisms[edit]
Disputes involving Deloitte include:

ActionAid – In November 2013, the international development charity ActionAid accused Deloitte of advising large businesses on how they could use Mauritius to avoid potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of tax in some of the poorest countries in Africa.[57]
Adelphia Communications Corporation – The Securities and Exchange Commission announced on 26 April 2005 that Deloitte had agreed to pay $50 million to settle charges relating to Adelphia's 2000 financial statements.[58]
Guangdong Kelon Electrical Holdings Company Limited – Investors have claimed that there was a failure to alert them to the company's poor financial position.[59]
Haringey Council Refresh Project – A local government IT project in the UK, in which costs rose from £9 million to £24.6 million. Deloitte were consultants on the project, despite being employed at the same time as the council's auditors.[60]
Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) – The firm implemented the SAP HR system for LAUSD for $95 million and because of faults in the system, some teachers were underpaid, overpaid, or not paid at all.[61] As of 31 December 2007, LAUSD had incurred a total of $140 million in payments to Deloitte to get the system working properly.[62] In 2008, there was some evidence that the payroll issues had started to stabilize with errors below 1% according to LAUSD's chief operating officer.[63]
State of California Courts System – The firm worked on a statewide case management system which originally had a budget of around $260 million. Almost $500 million had been spent and costs were at one time projected to potentially run as high as $2 billion. No single court became fully operational.[64] California's Judicial Council terminated the project in 2012 citing actual deployment costs associated with the project and California's budget concerns.[65]
Australian Tobacco Industry – In 2011, Deloitte was commissioned by the tobacco industry to compile a report on illicit tobacco. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service officials called the report "potentially misleading" and raised concerns about the "reliability and accuracy" of the data.[66] When a second Deloitte report focusing on counterfeit cigarettes was released, Home Affairs Minister Brendan O'Connor described the second report as "baseless and deceptive" and "bogus".[67] Public health officials criticised Deloitte's decision to conduct the research, as it added credibility to the tobacco industry's effort to undermine the Australian Government's plain cigarette packaging legislation.[68][69]
Canadian Bar Association – In September 2003, Deloitte provided a report to the CBA that motor vehicle accident insurance claims for bodily injury had been declining since 1999 when taking inflation into account, which refuted the government's and industry's argument that general damages for soft-tissue injury had to be capped at $4,000. Within hours of release, a member of Deloitte was communicating with Insurance Bureau of Canada without the knowledge of CBA (their client) and providing confidential information. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Alberta found Deloitte guilty of unprofessional conduct and fined the firm $40,000.[70]
Standard Chartered Iranian Money Laundering – In August 2012, Deloitte was forced to publicly deny that as the official internal auditors for Standard Chartered, it helped the bank cover up suspected money laundering operations which were earning the bank significant profits by "intentionally omitting critical information".[71]
On 17 June 2014 Booz Allen Hamilton sued Deloitte, claiming the firm stole proprietary information in order to 'lift out' a specialized team of Booz employees.[72] Both firms agreed to dismiss the claims and counterclaims in late 2015.[73]
In proceedings arising from the insolvency of the former entertainment company Livent, in April 2014 its special receiver obtained judgment against Deloitte for $84,750,000 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, in relation to Deloitte's failure to exercise its duty of care with respect to the audit of Livent's financial statements during 1993–1998.[74] The ruling was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal in January 2016.[75][76]

Sponsorship[edit]
Deloitte serves as the official professional services sponsor of the United States Olympic Committee since year 2009.[77] The UK member firm of Deloitte was a sponsor of the London 2012 Olympics[78] and the Royal Opera House.[79] The Canadian member firm was also the official professional services supplier for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games[80] and 2010 Winter Paralympic Games.[81] In Asia, the Singapore member firm of Deloitte was a sponsor of the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics.[82]
Moreover, Deloitte sponsors many university sports teams and societies, such as Edinburgh University Hockey Club.[83] It also entered into a 3-year partnership with the Cambridge Union Society in November 2013.[84]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1845, William Welch Deloitte opened an office in London. Deloitte was the first person to be appointed an independent auditor of a public company, namely the Great Western Railway.[17] He went on to open an office in New York in 1880.[17]
In 1896, Charles Waldo Haskins and Elijah Watt Sells formed Haskins & Sells in New York.[17] It was later described as "the first major auditing firm to be established in the country by American rather than British accountants."[18]
In 1898, George Touche established an office in London and then, in 1900, joined John Ballantine Niven in establishing the firm of Touche Niven in the Johnston Building at 30 Broad Street in New York.[17] At the time, there were fewer than 500 CPAs practicing in the United States, but the new era of income taxes was soon to generate enormous demand for accounting professionals.
On 1 March 1933, Colonel Arthur Hazelton Carter, President of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants and Managing Partner of Haskins & Sells, testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking and Currency. Carter helped convince Congress that independent audits should be mandatory for public companies.[17]




William Welch Deloitte, founder of Deloitte


In 1947, Detroit accountant George Bailey, then president of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, launched his own organization. The new entity enjoyed such a positive start that in less than a year, the partners merged with Touche Niven and A. R. Smart to form Touche, Niven, Bailey & Smart.[17] Headed by Bailey, the organization grew rapidly, in part by creating a dedicated management consulting function. It also forged closer links with organizations established by the co-founder of Touche Niven, George Touche: the Canadian organization Ross and the British organization George A. Touche.[17] In 1960, the firm was renamed Touche, Ross, Bailey & Smart, becoming Touche Ross in 1969.[17] In 1968 Nobuzo Tohmatsu formed Tohmatsu Aoki & Co, a firm based in Japan that was to become part of the Touche Ross network in 1975.[17] In 1972 Robert Trueblood, Chairman of Touche Ross, led the committee responsible for recommending the establishment of the Financial Accounting Standards Board.[17] He led the expansion of Touche Ross in that era.
In 1952, Deloitte merged his firm (by then known as Deloitte, Plender, Griffiths & Co.) with Haskins & Sells to form Deloitte Haskins & Sells.[19]
In 1989, Deloitte Haskins & Sells merged with Touche Ross in the USA to form Deloitte & Touche. The merged firm was led jointly by J. Michael Cook and Edward A. Kangas. Led by the UK partnership, a smaller number of Deloitte Haskins & Sells member firms rejected the merger with Touche Ross and shortly thereafter merged with Coopers & Lybrand to form Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte (later to merge with Price Waterhouse to become PwC).[20] Some member firms of Touche Ross also rejected the merger with Deloitte Haskins & Sells and merged with other firms.[20] In UK, Touche Ross merged with Spicer & Oppenheim in 1990.[21]
Recent history[edit]
At the time of the US-led mergers to form Deloitte & Touche, the name of the international firm was a problem, because there was no worldwide exclusive access to the names "Deloitte" or "Touche Ross" – key member firms such as Deloitte in the UK and Touche Ross in Australia had not joined the merger. The name DRT International was therefore chosen, referring to Deloitte, Ross and Tohmatsu. In 1993, the international firm was renamed Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu to reflect the contribution from the Japanese firm,[17] as well as agreements to use both of the names Deloitte and Touche.

In 1995, the partners of Deloitte & Touche decided to create Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group (now known as Deloitte Consulting).[22]
In 2000, Deloitte acquired Eclipse to add Internet design-based solutions to its consulting capabilities. Eclipse was later separated into Deloitte Online and Deloitte Digital.[23]
In 2002, Arthur Andersen's UK practice, the firm's largest practice outside the US, agreed to merge with Deloitte's UK practice. Andersen's practices in Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Mexico, Brazil and Canada also agreed to merge with Deloitte.[24][25] The spinoff of Deloitte France's consulting division led to the creation of Ineum Consulting.[26]
In 2005, Deloitte acquired Beijing Pan-China CPA Ltd to become the largest accountancy firm in China.[27]
In 2007, Deloitte began hiring former employees of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for their competitive intelligence unit known as Deloitte Intelligence.[28]
In 2009, Deloitte purchased the North American Public Service practice of BearingPoint (formerly KPMG Consulting) after it filed for bankruptcy protection.[29] The firm also took over the UK property consultants Drivers Jonas in January 2010.[30]
In 2011, Deloitte acquired DOMANI Sustainability Consulting and ClearCarbon Consulting in order to expand its sustainability service offerings.[31]
In January 2012, Deloitte announced the acquisition of Übermind, Inc., an innovative mobile agency.[32] The acquisition marked Deloitte's first entrance into the mobile application field.[33]
In November 2012, Deloitte acquired Recombinant Data Corporation, a company specializing in data warehousing and clinical intelligence solutions, and launched Recombinant by Deloitte.[34] In February 2013 Recombinant by Deloitte merged with an internal informatics unit (Deloitte Health Informatics) and launched ConvergeHEALTH by Deloitte.[35]
On 11 January 2013, Deloitte acquired substantially all of the business of Monitor Group,[36] the strategy consulting firm founded by Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter, after Monitor filed for bankruptcy protection.[37]
In 2014 the company introduced Rubix, a blockchain offering providing advisory services for clients in different business sectors, including government. In 2016 the company created its first blockchain lab in Dublin. A second hub was launched in New York in January, 2017. Deloitte became a member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance and the Hyperledger Project sponsored by the Linux Foundation in May, 2017.[38]
In 2015, the Pope of the Roman Catholic church, Pope Francis, appointed Libero Milone, former Chairman and CEO of Deloitte in Italy, as the first Auditor-General of Vatican City and Vatican Bank.[39][40][41]
In 2015, Indian Railways mandated Deloitte to formulate its entire manpower policy for its gazetted officers and study the functioning and the role of the departments at the zonal and divisional levels. Deloitte is expected to submit the report by March 31, 2016.[42]
In 2016, Deloitte acquired advertising agency Heat of San Francisco, best known for Madden NFL from EA Sports.[43]
In September 2016, Apple Inc. announced a partnership with Deloitte aimed at boosting sales of its phones and other mobile devices to businesses. As part of the partnership, the two companies will launch a service called Enterprise Next, in which more than 5,000 Deloitte consultants will advise clients on how to make better use of Apple products and services.[44][45][46]
In October 2016, Deloitte announced that they were creating Deloitte North West Europe. The Belgian, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish member firms will combine with the UK and Swiss member firms to create Deloitte North West Europe. Deloitte, over the next three years, will invest €200m to enhance its services to its global, national and private market clients and to create the best development opportunities. The firm will come into effect on 1 June 2017 and it is estimated to have 28,000 partners and people generating over €5bn in annual revenue. Deloitte North West Europe will account for approximately 20% of all revenue within their Global Network. [47]
Name and branding[edit]




Deloitte New Logo (Short)


While in 1989, in most countries, Deloitte, Haskins & Sells merged with Touche Ross forming Deloitte & Touche, in the United Kingdom the local firm of Deloitte, Haskins & Sells merged instead with Coopers & Lybrand (later renamed PwC).[48] For some years after the merger, the merged UK firm was called Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte and the local firm of Touche Ross kept its original name. In the mid-1990s however, both UK firms changed their names to match those of their respective international organizations.
While the full name of the UK private company is Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, in 1989 it initially branded itself DTT International. In 2003, the rebranding campaign was commissioned by William G. Parrett, the then-CEO of DTT, and led by Jerry Leamon, the global Clients and Markets leader.[49]
According to the company website, Deloitte now refers to the brand under which independent firms throughout the world collaborate to provide audit, consulting, financial advisory, risk management, and tax services to selected clients.[50]
In 2008, Deloitte adopted its new "Always One Step Ahead" (AOSA) brand positioning platform to support the existing Deloitte vision: "To be the Standard of Excellence". AOSA represents the global organization's value proposition and is never used as a tagline. The recent launch of the Green Dot ad campaign also aligns with Deloitte's brand strategy and positioning framework.[51]
In June 2016, Deloitte changed its branding and adopted a new logo with Deloitte written in black color instead of earlier blue.[52]
Global structure[edit]
For many years, the organization and its network of member firms were legally organized as a Swiss Verein (the equivalent to an unincorporated association, like the Associated Press in the United States). As of 31 July 2010, members of the Verein became part of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (DTTL), a UK private company, limited by guarantee. Each member firm in its global network remains a separate and independent legal entity, subject to the laws and professional regulations of the particular country or countries in which it operates.[53] Deloitte is registered under the NAIC code of 55112.[54]




30 Rockefeller Center is the location of Deloitte's Global Head Office.


This structure is similar to other professional services networks which seek to limit vicarious liability for acts of other members. As separate and legal entities, member firms and DTTL cannot obligate each other. Professional services continue to be provided by member firms only and not DTTL. With this structure, the members should not be liable for the negligence of other independent members. This structure also allows them to be members of the IFAC Forum of Firms[55] which is a network of accounting firm networks.
Services[edit]
Deloitte member firms offer services in the following functions, with country-specific variations on their legal implementation (i.e., all operating within a single company or through separate legal entities operating as subsidiaries of an umbrella legal entity for the country). The 2016 revenue shares are listed in parentheses.[5]

Audit (27%): Provides the organization's traditional accounting and audit services, as well as internal auditing and IT control assurance.
Consulting (34%): Assists clients by providing services in the areas of enterprise applications, technology integration, strategy & operations, human capital, and short-term outsourcing.
Financial Advisory (9%): Provides corporate finance services to clients, including dispute, personal and commercial bankruptcy, forensics, e-discovery, document review, advisory, capital projects consulting and valuation services.
Risk Advisory (11%): Provides offerings in enterprise risk management, information security and privacy, data quality and integrity, project risk and business continuity management.
Tax & Legal (19%): Helps clients increase their net asset value, undertake the transfer pricing and international tax activities of multinational companies, minimize their tax liabilities, implement tax computer systems, and provides advisory of tax implications of various business decisions.

Staff and offices[edit]
Deloitte offers its staff a variety of career models to choose from based on their preferences, strengths, geographic location, and business need. These career models also vary for each function and in some cases across different member firms around the world. Traditional titles for Consulting are Analyst, Consultant, Senior Consultant, Manager, Senior Manager, Director and Partner. In some of the more assurance centric functions the titles Consultant and Senior Consultant are substituted for Analyst and Senior Analyst. Many parts of Deloitte also offer an alternate career path for people that choose to pursue deep specialisation in their chosen fields but may not have Partnership aspirations. Titles for these position differ around the world but may include Specialist Senior, Specialist Master and Specialist Leader.
Awards and recognition[edit]

Deloitte, along with KPMG, PwC and PA Consulting Group were recognized among the UK's best companies to work for in 2017.[56]

Criticisms[edit]
Disputes involving Deloitte include:

ActionAid – In November 2013, the international development charity ActionAid accused Deloitte of advising large businesses on how they could use Mauritius to avoid potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of tax in some of the poorest countries in Africa.[57]
Adelphia Communications Corporation – The Securities and Exchange Commission announced on 26 April 2005 that Deloitte had agreed to pay $50 million to settle charges relating to Adelphia's 2000 financial statements.[58]
Guangdong Kelon Electrical Holdings Company Limited – Investors have claimed that there was a failure to alert them to the company's poor financial position.[59]
Haringey Council Refresh Project – A local government IT project in the UK, in which costs rose from £9 million to £24.6 million. Deloitte were consultants on the project, despite being employed at the same time as the council's auditors.[60]
Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) – The firm implemented the SAP HR system for LAUSD for $95 million and because of faults in the system, some teachers were underpaid, overpaid, or not paid at all.[61] As of 31 December 2007, LAUSD had incurred a total of $140 million in payments to Deloitte to get the system working properly.[62] In 2008, there was some evidence that the payroll issues had started to stabilize with errors below 1% according to LAUSD's chief operating officer.[63]
State of California Courts System – The firm worked on a statewide case management system which originally had a budget of around $260 million. Almost $500 million had been spent and costs were at one time projected to potentially run as high as $2 billion. No single court became fully operational.[64] California's Judicial Council terminated the project in 2012 citing actual deployment costs associated with the project and California's budget concerns.[65]
Australian Tobacco Industry – In 2011, Deloitte was commissioned by the tobacco industry to compile a report on illicit tobacco. The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service officials called the report "potentially misleading" and raised concerns about the "reliability and accuracy" of the data.[66] When a second Deloitte report focusing on counterfeit cigarettes was released, Home Affairs Minister Brendan O'Connor described the second report as "baseless and deceptive" and "bogus".[67] Public health officials criticised Deloitte's decision to conduct the research, as it added credibility to the tobacco industry's effort to undermine the Australian Government's plain cigarette packaging legislation.[68][69]
Canadian Bar Association – In September 2003, Deloitte provided a report to the CBA that motor vehicle accident insurance claims for bodily injury had been declining since 1999 when taking inflation into account, which refuted the government's and industry's argument that general damages for soft-tissue injury had to be capped at $4,000. Within hours of release, a member of Deloitte was communicating with Insurance Bureau of Canada without the knowledge of CBA (their client) and providing confidential information. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Alberta found Deloitte guilty of unprofessional conduct and fined the firm $40,000.[70]
Standard Chartered Iranian Money Laundering – In August 2012, Deloitte was forced to publicly deny that as the official internal auditors for Standard Chartered, it helped the bank cover up suspected money laundering operations which were earning the bank significant profits by "intentionally omitting critical information".[71]
On 17 June 2014 Booz Allen Hamilton sued Deloitte, claiming the firm stole proprietary information in order to 'lift out' a specialized team of Booz employees.[72] Both firms agreed to dismiss the claims and counterclaims in late 2015.[73]
In proceedings arising from the insolvency of the former entertainment company Livent, in April 2014 its special receiver obtained judgment against Deloitte for $84,750,000 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, in relation to Deloitte's failure to exercise its duty of care with respect to the audit of Livent's financial statements during 1993–1998.[74] The ruling was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal in January 2016.[75][76]

Sponsorship[edit]
Deloitte serves as the official professional services sponsor of the United States Olympic Committee since year 2009.[77] The UK member firm of Deloitte was a sponsor of the London 2012 Olympics[78] and the Royal Opera House.[79] The Canadian member firm was also the official professional services supplier for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games[80] and 2010 Winter Paralympic Games.[81] In Asia, the Singapore member firm of Deloitte was a sponsor of the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics.[82]
Moreover, Deloitte sponsors many university sports teams and societies, such as Edinburgh University Hockey Club.[83] It also entered into a 3-year partnership with the Cambridge Union Society in November 2013.[84]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
