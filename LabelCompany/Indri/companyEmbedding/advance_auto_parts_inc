History[edit]




2006-2010 Chevrolet HHR used as the fleet vehicle of the company.


In April 1932,[6] Arthur Taubman purchased the Advance Stores from Pep Boys, with two stores in Roanoke, Virginia and one in Lynchburg, Virginia.
The first major expansion of Advance Auto Parts was in 1998 when the company acquired the remaining operations of Western Auto, an auto parts and general store retailer. Most of the Western Auto operations had been taken over by Sears, Roebuck and Co. in 1987.[7]
In April 2001, Advance Auto Parts acquired Carport Auto Parts, a regional retail chain with 29 stores in Alabama and Mississippi.[8][9] On November 28, Advance acquired 671 Discount Auto Parts, Inc., a regional auto parts chain in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Louisiana.[10][11] Upon completion of this merger, Advance Auto Parts became a publicly traded company, listed as a common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AAP. The year ended with 2,484 stores in 38 states.

In July 2002, Advance Auto Parts received bankruptcy court approval to acquire 57 Trak Auto stores in northern Virginia, Washington, DC, and eastern Maryland.[12][13]
In September 2006, Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) announced an agreement with ADMMicro, a VA-based company, to retrofit certain existing stores and equip new stores with an Energy Management System (EMS).[14]
From 2010 to 2013, Advance Auto Parts was a title sponsor of Monster Jam and sponsored a truck on the circuit called the Advance Auto Parts Grinder. Advance Auto Parts has also served as a sponsor in NASCAR, including Alex Bowman's cars in 2015 and 2016 with Tommy Baldwin Racing and JR Motorsports, respectively.[15][16] In 2017, Advance Auto Parts became the title sponsor of the Advance Auto Parts Clash exhibition race at Daytona International Speedway.[17]
In December 2012, Advance Auto Parts acquired BWP Distributors, a Carquest franchise for the New England region that included the transfer of 124 company owned retail locations plus 2 distribution centers.[18][19] The responsibility for 92 independently owned location that were service by BWP were transferred to General Parts, Inc., the largest Carquest franchise along with one distribution center for servicing those locations.
On October 16, 2013, Advance Auto Parts entered into a definitive agreement to acquire General Parts International, Inc. (GPI), a leading privately held distributor and supplier of original equipment and aftermarket replacement products for commercial markets operating under the CARQUEST and WORLDPAC brands.[4][5] The deal created the largest automotive aftermarket parts[20] provider in North America.
General Parts International, with corporate headquarters in Raleigh, NC, has seen a significant rise in personnel since being acquired by Advance.[21] Most of these added jobs are personnel from Roanoke, Minnesota or between the now redundant GPI positions being transferred to Raleigh.
In 2014 Advance Auto Parts began a Loyalty Program for "Do-It-Yourself" retail customers, named SpeedPerks. By enrolling in the loyalty program, the member will receive discounts off of purchases without the need of a card or point system. When a customer spends $30 in store before tax, a $5 off coupon will be sent in their email, for a $100 purchase before tax a $20 off coupon will be emailed to the member.
On September 30, 2015, Starboard Value LP, an activist investment firm disclosed a 3.7 percent stake in Advance Auto Parts. Through a letter to Chief Executive Darren Jackson and a keynote presentation published on Starboard's website, Starboard Values believes that Advance Auto Parts shares have the potential to reach $350 each if the company takes steps to improve profit margins. The presentation also stated that "Advance Auto Parts has substantially underperformed compared to peers on almost any measure, including operating margins, revenue growth, and total shareholder return." [22][22] Roanoke, Virginia-based Advance Auto's sales have missed market expectations in four of the past six quarters.[22] Starboard Value LP was behind the ouster of the entire board of restaurant operator Darden Restaurants Inc last year, owners of the Red Lobster/Olive Garden restaurants.[23] Under market pressure in November 2015, Darren Jackson elected to resign his position as CEO effective January 2, 2016.[24] On April 4, 2016, Advance announced Frito-Lay North America CEO Tom Greco would succeed Jackson as CEO and 2016 Q3 results beat market expectations.[25]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Advance Auto Parts shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, Wellington Management Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, Lazard and others[26]).
Recognition[edit]
Advance Auto Parts is the largest automotive aftermarket retailer in the United States based on sales and store count. The company premiered on the Fortune 500 list of companies in 2003 at No. 466 and has remained on the list since that time. As of June 2014, it was ranked at No. 1,412 on the Forbes magazine "World's Biggest Public Companies" list.
Advance has received recognition for charitable contributions. The company has been named an "elite partner" for its fundraising for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), having donated more than $42 million since 1994.[27] Advance acts as an aggregator[28] for the largest portion of the donations for JDRF, collecting monies from both walk-in customers and commercial business through the sale of paper sneakers, that once purchased by the customer are displayed on the store windows.

History[edit]




2006-2010 Chevrolet HHR used as the fleet vehicle of the company.


In April 1932,[6] Arthur Taubman purchased the Advance Stores from Pep Boys, with two stores in Roanoke, Virginia and one in Lynchburg, Virginia.
The first major expansion of Advance Auto Parts was in 1998 when the company acquired the remaining operations of Western Auto, an auto parts and general store retailer. Most of the Western Auto operations had been taken over by Sears, Roebuck and Co. in 1987.[7]
In April 2001, Advance Auto Parts acquired Carport Auto Parts, a regional retail chain with 29 stores in Alabama and Mississippi.[8][9] On November 28, Advance acquired 671 Discount Auto Parts, Inc., a regional auto parts chain in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Louisiana.[10][11] Upon completion of this merger, Advance Auto Parts became a publicly traded company, listed as a common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AAP. The year ended with 2,484 stores in 38 states.

In July 2002, Advance Auto Parts received bankruptcy court approval to acquire 57 Trak Auto stores in northern Virginia, Washington, DC, and eastern Maryland.[12][13]
In September 2006, Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) announced an agreement with ADMMicro, a VA-based company, to retrofit certain existing stores and equip new stores with an Energy Management System (EMS).[14]
From 2010 to 2013, Advance Auto Parts was a title sponsor of Monster Jam and sponsored a truck on the circuit called the Advance Auto Parts Grinder. Advance Auto Parts has also served as a sponsor in NASCAR, including Alex Bowman's cars in 2015 and 2016 with Tommy Baldwin Racing and JR Motorsports, respectively.[15][16] In 2017, Advance Auto Parts became the title sponsor of the Advance Auto Parts Clash exhibition race at Daytona International Speedway.[17]
In December 2012, Advance Auto Parts acquired BWP Distributors, a Carquest franchise for the New England region that included the transfer of 124 company owned retail locations plus 2 distribution centers.[18][19] The responsibility for 92 independently owned location that were service by BWP were transferred to General Parts, Inc., the largest Carquest franchise along with one distribution center for servicing those locations.
On October 16, 2013, Advance Auto Parts entered into a definitive agreement to acquire General Parts International, Inc. (GPI), a leading privately held distributor and supplier of original equipment and aftermarket replacement products for commercial markets operating under the CARQUEST and WORLDPAC brands.[4][5] The deal created the largest automotive aftermarket parts[20] provider in North America.
General Parts International, with corporate headquarters in Raleigh, NC, has seen a significant rise in personnel since being acquired by Advance.[21] Most of these added jobs are personnel from Roanoke, Minnesota or between the now redundant GPI positions being transferred to Raleigh.
In 2014 Advance Auto Parts began a Loyalty Program for "Do-It-Yourself" retail customers, named SpeedPerks. By enrolling in the loyalty program, the member will receive discounts off of purchases without the need of a card or point system. When a customer spends $30 in store before tax, a $5 off coupon will be sent in their email, for a $100 purchase before tax a $20 off coupon will be emailed to the member.
On September 30, 2015, Starboard Value LP, an activist investment firm disclosed a 3.7 percent stake in Advance Auto Parts. Through a letter to Chief Executive Darren Jackson and a keynote presentation published on Starboard's website, Starboard Values believes that Advance Auto Parts shares have the potential to reach $350 each if the company takes steps to improve profit margins. The presentation also stated that "Advance Auto Parts has substantially underperformed compared to peers on almost any measure, including operating margins, revenue growth, and total shareholder return." [22][22] Roanoke, Virginia-based Advance Auto's sales have missed market expectations in four of the past six quarters.[22] Starboard Value LP was behind the ouster of the entire board of restaurant operator Darden Restaurants Inc last year, owners of the Red Lobster/Olive Garden restaurants.[23] Under market pressure in November 2015, Darren Jackson elected to resign his position as CEO effective January 2, 2016.[24] On April 4, 2016, Advance announced Frito-Lay North America CEO Tom Greco would succeed Jackson as CEO and 2016 Q3 results beat market expectations.[25]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Advance Auto Parts shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, Wellington Management Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, Lazard and others[26]).
Recognition[edit]
Advance Auto Parts is the largest automotive aftermarket retailer in the United States based on sales and store count. The company premiered on the Fortune 500 list of companies in 2003 at No. 466 and has remained on the list since that time. As of June 2014, it was ranked at No. 1,412 on the Forbes magazine "World's Biggest Public Companies" list.
Advance has received recognition for charitable contributions. The company has been named an "elite partner" for its fundraising for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), having donated more than $42 million since 1994.[27] Advance acts as an aggregator[28] for the largest portion of the donations for JDRF, collecting monies from both walk-in customers and commercial business through the sale of paper sneakers, that once purchased by the customer are displayed on the store windows.

Advance Auto Parts shares slide after earnings and revenue miss
Advance Auto Parts Inc.  shares are down 5.8% in Wednesday premarket trading after the company reported first-quarter earnings and sales that missed estimates. Net income was $108.0 million, or $1.46 per share, down from $158.8 million last year, or $2.16 per share. Adjusted EPS was $1.60, missing the $2.16 per share FactSet consensus. Revenue was $2.89 billion, down from $2.98 billion last year and below the $2.95 billion FactSet consensus. Same-store sales fell 2.7% versus the FactSet consensus for a 1.2% decline. Same-store sales were hurt by shifts in New Year's Day to the first quarter of 2017 and winter demand to December, said Chief Executive Tom Greco in a statement. Advance Auto Parts shares are down nearly 17% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index  has gained 7.1% for the period.

Auto parts retailer stocks tumble in wake of AutoZone's disappointing results
Shares of car-parts retailers are tumbling in premarket trade Tuesday, after AutoZone Inc.  reported fiscal third-quarter results that were "significantly" below expectations. Shares of Advance Auto Parts Inc. , which reports first-quarter results on Wednesday, sank 6.0% to put them on track to open at a 6 1/2-month low. O'Reilly Automotive Inc.'s stock  dropped 5% toward a 15-month low ahead of the open, while Genuine Auto Parts Co. shares  shed 3.7%. AutoZone's stock plunged 8%, to put it on course to open at the lowest level seen during regular trading hours since February 2015, after the company reported profit, revenue and same-store sales that missed expectations. The stock declines are bucking the trend in the broader stock market, as futures for the S&P 500  are rising 0.2% ahead of the open.

AutoZone Inc.'s stock  shed 3.8% premarket toward the lowest open since October 2014, while Genuine Parts Co. shares  slipped 1.8%.

Advance Auto Parts shares slide after earnings and revenue miss
Advance Auto Parts Inc.  shares are down 5.8% in Wednesday premarket trading after the company reported first-quarter earnings and sales that missed estimates. Net income was $108.0 million, or $1.46 per share, down from $158.8 million last year, or $2.16 per share. Adjusted EPS was $1.60, missing the $2.16 per share FactSet consensus. Revenue was $2.89 billion, down from $2.98 billion last year and below the $2.95 billion FactSet consensus. Same-store sales fell 2.7% versus the FactSet consensus for a 1.2% decline. Same-store sales were hurt by shifts in New Year's Day to the first quarter of 2017 and winter demand to December, said Chief Executive Tom Greco in a statement. Advance Auto Parts shares are down nearly 17% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index  has gained 7.1% for the period.

Auto parts retailer stocks tumble in wake of AutoZone's disappointing results
Shares of car-parts retailers are tumbling in premarket trade Tuesday, after AutoZone Inc.  reported fiscal third-quarter results that were "significantly" below expectations. Shares of Advance Auto Parts Inc. , which reports first-quarter results on Wednesday, sank 6.0% to put them on track to open at a 6 1/2-month low. O'Reilly Automotive Inc.'s stock  dropped 5% toward a 15-month low ahead of the open, while Genuine Auto Parts Co. shares  shed 3.7%. AutoZone's stock plunged 8%, to put it on course to open at the lowest level seen during regular trading hours since February 2015, after the company reported profit, revenue and same-store sales that missed expectations. The stock declines are bucking the trend in the broader stock market, as futures for the S&P 500  are rising 0.2% ahead of the open.

I recommend that you get a couple of friend s to help out the bumper is quite heavy and you will either need an over head lift or two I recommend three friends to lift and hold in place while you place the bolts on the holes. Also when removing the old bumper remember to unbolt the transmission radiator from the truck, you don't need to remove it completely but by removing the mounting bolts you will be able to maneuver the radiator out of the way to remove the OEI mounting bolts from the old stock bumper and place the new mounting bolts for the Ranch Hand. If I would have figured this out at first it would have made removal and installation go allot faster.TPosted by Timothy (Milton, FL) / July 20, 20172006 Dodge RamWas this review helpful for you?

YesThis review was helpful for 0 user!4.8 of 5Buy This BumperRanch Hand® BTD061BLR - Legend BullNose Series Full Width Black Front HD Bumper with Pre-Runner GuardThe bumper looks great and is fairly easy to install. I recommend that you get a couple of friend s to help out the bumper is quite heavy and you will either need an over head lift or two I recommend three friends to lift and hold in place while you place the bolts on the holes. Also when removing the old bumper remember to unbolt the transmission radiator from the truck, you don't need to remove it completely but by removing the mounting bolts you will be able to maneuver the radiator out of the way to remove the OEI mounting bolts from the old stock bumper and place the new mounting bolts for the Ranch Hand. If I would have figured this out at first it would have made removal and installation go allot faster.TPosted by Timothy (Milton, FL) / July 20, 20172006 Dodge RamWas this review helpful for you?

Demon camber. You may know it as oni-camber. You've seen the look, and whether you like it or not is totally beside the point. The great thing about this stanced look is that it gets your attention. From the interviews we've read with owners and drivers of these machines, that is exactly what they are after. They've said that it's all about being noticed.Custom wheels and tires have been around for years, and continue to be immensely popular. But customizers are always looking for ways to be ahead of the game, to be first with a trend. It is no longer enough to have the most outrageous set of rims. That look can be taken to the next level with stanced cars. Technically, demon camber is extreme negative camber. Let's explain what "negative camber" is and how that effect is achieved.Camber is one of the alignment specifications which affect the angle, or tilt of the wheel compared to the vehicle's body. If you are looking directly at the front or rear of a car, the angle of the tire relative to the ground is the camber. Look at the illustration below. Negative camber means that the tops of the tires lean in relative to the car's body. Zero camber means the tire is perfectly perpendicular to the ground. Positive camber means the tops of the tires are leaning out...March 18, 2015Pickup Truck Cab And Bed SizesTimothy ZahlAmericans love to have choices. Buying a dress shirt?

Neither are we, so upgrading your car or truck's power and handling is just a click away in our Performance Parts department. You can pack more air and fuel into your engine with free flowing filters and cold air intakes, big carburetors and throttle bodies, high flow injectors and intake manifolds; get a fat spark to fire that mixture with performance plugs, wires, and ignition systems; and give those spent gases a quick exit and get a rumble to boot with headers and low restriction exhaust systems. And if you crave massive increases in go-power, we have complete engines, turbochargers and superchargers, and nitrous oxide systems. But performance isn't just about power, you have to handle the turns and hit the binders once in a while and for that we have suspension and brake systems for every need and purpose.

History[edit]




2006-2010 Chevrolet HHR used as the fleet vehicle of the company.


In April 1932,[6] Arthur Taubman purchased the Advance Stores from Pep Boys, with two stores in Roanoke, Virginia and one in Lynchburg, Virginia.
The first major expansion of Advance Auto Parts was in 1998 when the company acquired the remaining operations of Western Auto, an auto parts and general store retailer. Most of the Western Auto operations had been taken over by Sears, Roebuck and Co. in 1987.[7]
In April 2001, Advance Auto Parts acquired Carport Auto Parts, a regional retail chain with 29 stores in Alabama and Mississippi.[8][9] On November 28, Advance acquired 671 Discount Auto Parts, Inc., a regional auto parts chain in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Louisiana.[10][11] Upon completion of this merger, Advance Auto Parts became a publicly traded company, listed as a common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AAP. The year ended with 2,484 stores in 38 states.

In July 2002, Advance Auto Parts received bankruptcy court approval to acquire 57 Trak Auto stores in northern Virginia, Washington, DC, and eastern Maryland.[12][13]
In September 2006, Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) announced an agreement with ADMMicro, a VA-based company, to retrofit certain existing stores and equip new stores with an Energy Management System (EMS).[14]
From 2010 to 2013, Advance Auto Parts was a title sponsor of Monster Jam and sponsored a truck on the circuit called the Advance Auto Parts Grinder. Advance Auto Parts has also served as a sponsor in NASCAR, including Alex Bowman's cars in 2015 and 2016 with Tommy Baldwin Racing and JR Motorsports, respectively.[15][16] In 2017, Advance Auto Parts became the title sponsor of the Advance Auto Parts Clash exhibition race at Daytona International Speedway.[17]
In December 2012, Advance Auto Parts acquired BWP Distributors, a Carquest franchise for the New England region that included the transfer of 124 company owned retail locations plus 2 distribution centers.[18][19] The responsibility for 92 independently owned location that were service by BWP were transferred to General Parts, Inc., the largest Carquest franchise along with one distribution center for servicing those locations.
On October 16, 2013, Advance Auto Parts entered into a definitive agreement to acquire General Parts International, Inc. (GPI), a leading privately held distributor and supplier of original equipment and aftermarket replacement products for commercial markets operating under the CARQUEST and WORLDPAC brands.[4][5] The deal created the largest automotive aftermarket parts[20] provider in North America.
General Parts International, with corporate headquarters in Raleigh, NC, has seen a significant rise in personnel since being acquired by Advance.[21] Most of these added jobs are personnel from Roanoke, Minnesota or between the now redundant GPI positions being transferred to Raleigh.
In 2014 Advance Auto Parts began a Loyalty Program for "Do-It-Yourself" retail customers, named SpeedPerks. By enrolling in the loyalty program, the member will receive discounts off of purchases without the need of a card or point system. When a customer spends $30 in store before tax, a $5 off coupon will be sent in their email, for a $100 purchase before tax a $20 off coupon will be emailed to the member.
On September 30, 2015, Starboard Value LP, an activist investment firm disclosed a 3.7 percent stake in Advance Auto Parts. Through a letter to Chief Executive Darren Jackson and a keynote presentation published on Starboard's website, Starboard Values believes that Advance Auto Parts shares have the potential to reach $350 each if the company takes steps to improve profit margins. The presentation also stated that "Advance Auto Parts has substantially underperformed compared to peers on almost any measure, including operating margins, revenue growth, and total shareholder return." [22][22] Roanoke, Virginia-based Advance Auto's sales have missed market expectations in four of the past six quarters.[22] Starboard Value LP was behind the ouster of the entire board of restaurant operator Darden Restaurants Inc last year, owners of the Red Lobster/Olive Garden restaurants.[23] Under market pressure in November 2015, Darren Jackson elected to resign his position as CEO effective January 2, 2016.[24] On April 4, 2016, Advance announced Frito-Lay North America CEO Tom Greco would succeed Jackson as CEO and 2016 Q3 results beat market expectations.[25]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Advance Auto Parts shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, Wellington Management Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, Lazard and others[26]).
Recognition[edit]
Advance Auto Parts is the largest automotive aftermarket retailer in the United States based on sales and store count. The company premiered on the Fortune 500 list of companies in 2003 at No. 466 and has remained on the list since that time. As of June 2014, it was ranked at No. 1,412 on the Forbes magazine "World's Biggest Public Companies" list.
Advance has received recognition for charitable contributions. The company has been named an "elite partner" for its fundraising for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), having donated more than $42 million since 1994.[27] Advance acts as an aggregator[28] for the largest portion of the donations for JDRF, collecting monies from both walk-in customers and commercial business through the sale of paper sneakers, that once purchased by the customer are displayed on the store windows.

In December 2012, Advance Auto Parts acquired BWP Distributors, a Carquest franchise for the New England region that included the transfer of 124 company owned retail locations plus 2 distribution centers.[18][19] The responsibility for 92 independently owned location that were service by BWP were transferred to General Parts, Inc., the largest Carquest franchise along with one distribution center for servicing those locations.
On October 16, 2013, Advance Auto Parts entered into a definitive agreement to acquire General Parts International, Inc. (GPI), a leading privately held distributor and supplier of original equipment and aftermarket replacement products for commercial markets operating under the CARQUEST and WORLDPAC brands.[4][5] The deal created the largest automotive aftermarket parts[20] provider in North America.
General Parts International, with corporate headquarters in Raleigh, NC, has seen a significant rise in personnel since being acquired by Advance.[21] Most of these added jobs are personnel from Roanoke, Minnesota or between the now redundant GPI positions being transferred to Raleigh.
In 2014 Advance Auto Parts began a Loyalty Program for "Do-It-Yourself" retail customers, named SpeedPerks. By enrolling in the loyalty program, the member will receive discounts off of purchases without the need of a card or point system. When a customer spends $30 in store before tax, a $5 off coupon will be sent in their email, for a $100 purchase before tax a $20 off coupon will be emailed to the member.
On September 30, 2015, Starboard Value LP, an activist investment firm disclosed a 3.7 percent stake in Advance Auto Parts. Through a letter to Chief Executive Darren Jackson and a keynote presentation published on Starboard's website, Starboard Values believes that Advance Auto Parts shares have the potential to reach $350 each if the company takes steps to improve profit margins. The presentation also stated that "Advance Auto Parts has substantially underperformed compared to peers on almost any measure, including operating margins, revenue growth, and total shareholder return." [22][22] Roanoke, Virginia-based Advance Auto's sales have missed market expectations in four of the past six quarters.[22] Starboard Value LP was behind the ouster of the entire board of restaurant operator Darden Restaurants Inc last year, owners of the Red Lobster/Olive Garden restaurants.[23] Under market pressure in November 2015, Darren Jackson elected to resign his position as CEO effective January 2, 2016.[24] On April 4, 2016, Advance announced Frito-Lay North America CEO Tom Greco would succeed Jackson as CEO and 2016 Q3 results beat market expectations.[25]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Advance Auto Parts shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, Wellington Management Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, Lazard and others[26]).
Recognition[edit]
Advance Auto Parts is the largest automotive aftermarket retailer in the United States based on sales and store count. The company premiered on the Fortune 500 list of companies in 2003 at No. 466 and has remained on the list since that time. As of June 2014, it was ranked at No. 1,412 on the Forbes magazine "World's Biggest Public Companies" list.
Advance has received recognition for charitable contributions. The company has been named an "elite partner" for its fundraising for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), having donated more than $42 million since 1994.[27] Advance acts as an aggregator[28] for the largest portion of the donations for JDRF, collecting monies from both walk-in customers and commercial business through the sale of paper sneakers, that once purchased by the customer are displayed on the store windows.

History[edit]




2006-2010 Chevrolet HHR used as the fleet vehicle of the company.


In April 1932,[6] Arthur Taubman purchased the Advance Stores from Pep Boys, with two stores in Roanoke, Virginia and one in Lynchburg, Virginia.
The first major expansion of Advance Auto Parts was in 1998 when the company acquired the remaining operations of Western Auto, an auto parts and general store retailer. Most of the Western Auto operations had been taken over by Sears, Roebuck and Co. in 1987.[7]
In April 2001, Advance Auto Parts acquired Carport Auto Parts, a regional retail chain with 29 stores in Alabama and Mississippi.[8][9] On November 28, Advance acquired 671 Discount Auto Parts, Inc., a regional auto parts chain in Florida, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Louisiana.[10][11] Upon completion of this merger, Advance Auto Parts became a publicly traded company, listed as a common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AAP. The year ended with 2,484 stores in 38 states.

In July 2002, Advance Auto Parts received bankruptcy court approval to acquire 57 Trak Auto stores in northern Virginia, Washington, DC, and eastern Maryland.[12][13]
In September 2006, Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) announced an agreement with ADMMicro, a VA-based company, to retrofit certain existing stores and equip new stores with an Energy Management System (EMS).[14]
From 2010 to 2013, Advance Auto Parts was a title sponsor of Monster Jam and sponsored a truck on the circuit called the Advance Auto Parts Grinder. Advance Auto Parts has also served as a sponsor in NASCAR, including Alex Bowman's cars in 2015 and 2016 with Tommy Baldwin Racing and JR Motorsports, respectively.[15][16] In 2017, Advance Auto Parts became the title sponsor of the Advance Auto Parts Clash exhibition race at Daytona International Speedway.[17]
In December 2012, Advance Auto Parts acquired BWP Distributors, a Carquest franchise for the New England region that included the transfer of 124 company owned retail locations plus 2 distribution centers.[18][19] The responsibility for 92 independently owned location that were service by BWP were transferred to General Parts, Inc., the largest Carquest franchise along with one distribution center for servicing those locations.
On October 16, 2013, Advance Auto Parts entered into a definitive agreement to acquire General Parts International, Inc. (GPI), a leading privately held distributor and supplier of original equipment and aftermarket replacement products for commercial markets operating under the CARQUEST and WORLDPAC brands.[4][5] The deal created the largest automotive aftermarket parts[20] provider in North America.
General Parts International, with corporate headquarters in Raleigh, NC, has seen a significant rise in personnel since being acquired by Advance.[21] Most of these added jobs are personnel from Roanoke, Minnesota or between the now redundant GPI positions being transferred to Raleigh.
In 2014 Advance Auto Parts began a Loyalty Program for "Do-It-Yourself" retail customers, named SpeedPerks. By enrolling in the loyalty program, the member will receive discounts off of purchases without the need of a card or point system. When a customer spends $30 in store before tax, a $5 off coupon will be sent in their email, for a $100 purchase before tax a $20 off coupon will be emailed to the member.
On September 30, 2015, Starboard Value LP, an activist investment firm disclosed a 3.7 percent stake in Advance Auto Parts. Through a letter to Chief Executive Darren Jackson and a keynote presentation published on Starboard's website, Starboard Values believes that Advance Auto Parts shares have the potential to reach $350 each if the company takes steps to improve profit margins. The presentation also stated that "Advance Auto Parts has substantially underperformed compared to peers on almost any measure, including operating margins, revenue growth, and total shareholder return." [22][22] Roanoke, Virginia-based Advance Auto's sales have missed market expectations in four of the past six quarters.[22] Starboard Value LP was behind the ouster of the entire board of restaurant operator Darden Restaurants Inc last year, owners of the Red Lobster/Olive Garden restaurants.[23] Under market pressure in November 2015, Darren Jackson elected to resign his position as CEO effective January 2, 2016.[24] On April 4, 2016, Advance announced Frito-Lay North America CEO Tom Greco would succeed Jackson as CEO and 2016 Q3 results beat market expectations.[25]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Advance Auto Parts shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, Wellington Management Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, Lazard and others[26]).
Recognition[edit]
Advance Auto Parts is the largest automotive aftermarket retailer in the United States based on sales and store count. The company premiered on the Fortune 500 list of companies in 2003 at No. 466 and has remained on the list since that time. As of June 2014, it was ranked at No. 1,412 on the Forbes magazine "World's Biggest Public Companies" list.
Advance has received recognition for charitable contributions. The company has been named an "elite partner" for its fundraising for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), having donated more than $42 million since 1994.[27] Advance acts as an aggregator[28] for the largest portion of the donations for JDRF, collecting monies from both walk-in customers and commercial business through the sale of paper sneakers, that once purchased by the customer are displayed on the store windows.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
