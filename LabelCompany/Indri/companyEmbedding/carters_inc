Carter’s Baby Clothes Make Excellent Gifts
Carter’s baby clothes are great gifts for parents and babies! With over 100 years of experience in children’s clothing, Carter’s knows the kind of clothing babies need and parents want. Shop layette sets for newborns. Layette sets are the perfect baby shower gift. The Carter’s Classic Baby Essentials collection includes all of the essential clothing parents will need for their new baby. The collection features bodysuits, hoodies, pants, bibs, and more. It also comes in neutral colors, making it a great unisex gift. The Take Me Home set is another wonderful gift. Mom and dad can bring baby home in this cozy little set that includes long-sleeve and short-sleeve bodysuits, footed pants, and a cap. Babies grow quickly, so get a few extra sets of clothing to accommodate rapid growth spurts. Carter’s knows the difficulty that comes with finding preemie clothing. While you’re at it, pick up a few accessories to give out too! Carter’s has super cute animal themed bath sets. Get a hood towel, washcloth, and robe with matching booties. Babies will sleep sweetly with a soother that sings lullabies, plays nature sounds, and casts moon images on the ceiling. Shop Carter’s baby clothes in the baby department for great gifts that parents will love.
 
Carter’s Clothing: Stylish Clothes for Babies of All Ages
Carter’s clothing makes the earliest years of your baby’s life super stylish! In the first three months, babies spend the majority of their time eating, sleeping, and in need of a diaper change. Simple clothing is the best in these early months. Stock up on Carter’s bodysuits, hats, and booties, made from warm and cozy cotton. Get these three essentials in packs or separates. From six to nine months, your baby will start getting mobile. They’ll begin crawling, scooting, and sliding. Rompers are a great choice to provide maximum mobility and comfort. We have adorable Carter’s rompers for boys and girls in beautiful colors and designs. From nine months and up, comfortable separates, such as t-shirts, sweat pants, leggings, and jeans are essential. Our Carter’s sale has all of these items and more! Outfit your future sports star in a handsome all-American varsity jacket with a button front. Carter’s even has baby puffer jackets for those bitter cold days when something heavier is necessary.

Boost productivity with exact positioning
Integrated laser projection systems for both 2D and 3D applications providing precision alignment. Allows for projection of laser patterns onto complex curved surfaces in complete 3D images, suitable for mold composite layup, wind turbine blade production, vehicle construction, aerospace and a variety of manufacturing processes.







Carter lights the way to greater accuracy
A full offering of high powered line lasers, both red and green, suitable for any application requiring a clean crisp line for visual alignment. These lasers carry a full two-year warranty, are waterproof and come in a variety of line lengths, optics and mounts.







The Next Evolution in Steadyrest Work Support Systems
This system is compatible with a range of lathe sizes from mini to 20" all with one unit. The system is lightweight, yet very robust. The system can be split open to access or remove the work piece as well as converting it from Steadyrest to Bowlrest configurations.







Spend more time cutting and less time adjusting
Carter Upgrade conversion kits increase your saws performance through the use of sealed ball bearing roller guides or Tefloy™ lubricated block support guides. This provides your saw with reduced blade friction, improved cutting accuracy, and is adjustable for various blade widths. Our bearing guides have no wear surfaces which means that until you need to change the blade size you won’t have to adjust your guides, so spend more time woodworking and less time adjusting.







Innovative new Hollowing System from Carter
The Hollow Roller™ system is a complete, easy to set-up turnkey hollowing system that allows the operator to focus on the work and art of the vessel being turned versus on the system. The boring bar is completely captive and incorporates a full sealed bearing lubrication free roller system that eliminates the drag on the bar, thus enabling a smoother flowing motion to all tool movements.

History[edit]
William Carter was the founder of William Carter Company in 1865 in Needham, Massachusetts. William Carter (1830–1918) was born in Alfreton, Derbyshire, England. He arrived in America on January 28, 1857. He married Martha Lee (1842-1873). They had four children: William Henry Carter (1864–1955), who served two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives (1915-1919) prior to being elected president of the William Carter Company in 1918; Mary Elizabeth Carter (1865-1961); John J. Carter (1867-1939); and Horace A. Carter (1869-1959). By the early 1960s, the William Carter Company manufactured at seven mills in Massachusetts and the south. The Carter family sold the business in 1990.[1]
In 2012, Carter's, Inc. announced that Braselton, Georgia would receive their one-million-square-foot, $50 million distribution center that will support their e-commerce, retail, and wholesale businesses. The company hopes to create 1,000 jobs at the facility by 2015.
In February 2017, Carter's, Inc. acquired Skip Hop Inc., an infant and child product company based in New York, for $140 million in cash and up to $10 million in future payments contingent on reaching certain financial goals in 2017.[3] Fireman Capital Partners, a private equity firm, had previously acquired a majority equity stake in Skip Hop Inc. for $50 million in November 2013.[4]
Headquarters[edit]
In October 2012 the Atlanta Business Chronicle reported that Carter's Inc. was likely to lease in the Phipps Tower in Buckhead for its headquarters.[5] In December 2012 Carter's Inc. announced that it was moving its headquarters from Midtown Atlanta. The lease of 222,730 square feet (20,692 m2) of space is one of the largest headquarters leases to have occurred to date. The estimated value of the lease, except for concessions and escalation, was $70 million. The lease in Midtown was scheduled to be terminated on December 31, 2013.[6]
The company consolidated its out of state jobs into the new facility, with 200 additional jobs going to Buckhead. Manulife Financial Corp owns both the Proscenium and the Phipps Tower so Carter's terminated its lease early in one building and moved to the other.[7]
The company now has its headquarters in Suite 1800 at Phipps Tower,[8] in Buckhead, Atlanta.

History[edit]
William Carter was the founder of William Carter Company in 1865 in Needham, Massachusetts. William Carter (1830–1918) was born in Alfreton, Derbyshire, England. He arrived in America on January 28, 1857. He married Martha Lee (1842-1873). They had four children: William Henry Carter (1864–1955), who served two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives (1915-1919) prior to being elected president of the William Carter Company in 1918; Mary Elizabeth Carter (1865-1961); John J. Carter (1867-1939); and Horace A. Carter (1869-1959). By the early 1960s, the William Carter Company manufactured at seven mills in Massachusetts and the south. The Carter family sold the business in 1990.[1]
In 2012, Carter's, Inc. announced that Braselton, Georgia would receive their one-million-square-foot, $50 million distribution center that will support their e-commerce, retail, and wholesale businesses. The company hopes to create 1,000 jobs at the facility by 2015.
In February 2017, Carter's, Inc. acquired Skip Hop Inc., an infant and child product company based in New York, for $140 million in cash and up to $10 million in future payments contingent on reaching certain financial goals in 2017.[3] Fireman Capital Partners, a private equity firm, had previously acquired a majority equity stake in Skip Hop Inc. for $50 million in November 2013.[4]
Headquarters[edit]
In October 2012 the Atlanta Business Chronicle reported that Carter's Inc. was likely to lease in the Phipps Tower in Buckhead for its headquarters.[5] In December 2012 Carter's Inc. announced that it was moving its headquarters from Midtown Atlanta. The lease of 222,730 square feet (20,692 m2) of space is one of the largest headquarters leases to have occurred to date. The estimated value of the lease, except for concessions and escalation, was $70 million. The lease in Midtown was scheduled to be terminated on December 31, 2013.[6]
The company consolidated its out of state jobs into the new facility, with 200 additional jobs going to Buckhead. Manulife Financial Corp owns both the Proscenium and the Phipps Tower so Carter's terminated its lease early in one building and moved to the other.[7]
The company now has its headquarters in Suite 1800 at Phipps Tower,[8] in Buckhead, Atlanta.

It is one of the oldest and largest branded marketers of premium infants’ and children's apparel in the United States. Carter’s has long been known for its product innovations including the dropseat unionsuit. We patented this in 1907. the jiffon ® neck, nevabind ® sleeve, – more... and handy-cuff mittens, all time-honored features, were originally patented in the 1930’s and are just as important today as they were then.Founded in 1895 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, Oshkosh B'gosh, Inc. has grown from a small-town manufacturer of adult workwear into a global marketer of children's clothing and accessories. Best known for our rugged, men's hickory-striped bib overalls, the company began making the pint size version in the early 1900's, so that children could dress like their fathers. It wasn't until Miles Kimball, a local mail order firm, featured a pair of children's bib overalls in its national catalog that sales of the item took off. prompted by the strong response, Oshkosh B'gosh expanded distribution into specialty and department stores, and gradually broadened our children's wear line.In July 2005 Oshkosh joined the carter's family of brands. Carter's and OshKosh are two of the oldest, largest, and most-recognized branded marketers of baby and young children's apparel in the U.S., our century-old heritage of quality and value has earned the respect and trust of generations of families. We continue that tradition with a company that addresses today's consumers, today's employees, and today's children. based on the belief that childhood is a celebration, our brands are all about creating products for children that are distinguished by quality and creative art and color. by celebrating childhood, we honor the creativity and imagination in children, and we foster an emotional connection to children and their families. We strive to be a great company to do business with, to have as a neighbor, and to work for. Our vision statement encompasses our values and beliefs and we strive to conduct our business in a manner that reflects this vision: "we embrace creative leadership, innovative teamwork and a winning spirit to be the best for the benefit of our customers, our consumers, our employees and our shareholders." – lessSee all 8 Carters, Inc photosClaimed ProfileHeadquartersAtlanta, GARevenue$1B to $5B (USD)Employees10,000+LinksCarters, Inc on InstagramCarters, Inc websiteCarter's YouTube ChannelOshKosh B'gosh YouTube ChannelOshKosh B'gosh InstagramTwitterFacebook

About CARTER'S, INC.

   Carter's has built a big business catering to little ones. Operating through its William Carter Company, it's the largest US branded marketer of apparel exclusively for babies and young children. Primary products include newborn layette clothing, sleepwear, and playwear. It markets its items under the Carter's and OshKosh B'Gosh brands, as well as private labels Child of Mine, Just One You, Genuine Kids, and Precious Firsts. While Carter's sells products online and as a wholesaler via 17,400 department and specialty stores, it also operates some 835 Carter's and OshKosh stores nationwide and almost 150 stores in Canada.
   Operations

   The company operates its business through five segments: Carter's Wholesale, Carter's Retail, OshKosh Retail, OshKosh Wholesale, and International. Following its Bonnie Togs purchase, Carter's realigned its reportable segments to include a new international segment to house its Canadian operations, existing international wholesale business, and royalty income from its international licensees.
  

   Under its Carter's brand, it designs, source, and market a broad array of products, primarily for sizes newborn to eight.
  

   Under the OshKosh brand, it designs, source, and market a broad array of young children's apparel, primarily for children in sizes newborn to 12.
  

   Its International segment includes company-operated retail, wholesale, and online operations in addition to royalty income from its international licensees.
  

   In fiscal 2016 (January year end) the company's international sales were 11% of total net sales; retail, 38%; and wholesale, 37%.
  

   That year, the company sold more than 342 million units of Carter's, Child of Mine, Just One You, and Precious Firsts products in the US.
  
Sales and Marketing

   Carter's markets its products through the department stores, national chains, outlet, specialty stores, off-price sales channels. The company sells its products through the wholesale channel, through company-owned retail stores in the US and Canada, and online. It partners with 20 licensees to sell the Carter's and OshKosh brands in 40 countries. Its Carter's brand wholesale customers include major retailers, such as, Costco, JCPenney, Kohl's, Macy's, and Sam's Club. Its OshKosh brand wholesale customers include major retailers, such as Belk, Bon-Ton, Fred Meyer, and Sears.
  

   The company's brands compete in the $20.5 billion children's apparel market for children newborn to age 7. Carter's enjoys the #1 branded position and a 14% market share; OshKosh has a 2% market share. Because the company uses a variety of distribution channels, it's able to market its products to a more diverse range of consumers and geographic regions. Wal-Mart sells its Child of Mine line, while Target offers the Just One You and Precious Firsts brands.
  

   Carter's maintains three distribution centers in US and other international distribution centers in Canada and Asia to support its direct-to-consumer retail operations.
  

   The company allocated $3.9 million for each of the fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 for advertising costs.
  

   Carter's' marketing is focused on connecting with millennials by strengthening and evolving its digital programs to put its brands in front of the consumer in new and innovative way.
  

   In fiscal 2016, the company implemented the Rewarding Moments rewards program to drive customer traffic, sales, and brand loyalty.
  

   Carter's trademarks and copyrights include Genuine Kids, Child of Mine, Just One You, Precious Firsts and Little Layette.
  
Financial Performance

   Net revenues have increased over the last five years. In fiscal 2016 revenues rose by 4% due to sales growth in all segments except OshKosh Wholesale.
  

   Carter's Retail net sales increased by 5.9% as the result of new store openings, e-commerce sales, and an increase in comparable store sales. Carter's Wholesale net sales increased 2.4% driven by a rise in average price per unit and a 0.9% increase in units shipped, primarily driven by increased seasonal product demand, a new playwear initiative, and favorable replenishment trends.
  

   OshKosh Wholesale net sales decreased 10.4%, reflecting a 15.8% decline in units shipped.
  

   In 2016 net income increased by 22% mainly due to higher net and other income of $1.8 million compared to expense of $3.1 million in 2015 relating to contracts settled and unrealized gains.
  

   Operating cash flows increased by 9%.
  
Strategy

   Carter's focuses on refreshing its brand presentation in all channels of distribution; geographic expansion, and strengthening its multi-channel business model. The company's strategy is to drive our brand image as the leader in baby and young children's apparel and to consistently provide high-quality products at a great value to consumers. It also strives to provide wholesale customers with a consistent, high-level of service, including delivering and replenishing products on time to fulfill customer needs. Its retail stores and websites focus on the customer experience through store and website design, visual enhancements, clear product presentation, and experienced customer service.
  

   The company has developed a reputation for producing high-quality clothing for children -- from the cradle through the early school years. The Carter's brand and private-label collections made for mass-market customers offer apparel in newborn through children's size 12. These lines mostly consist of cotton essentials, such as bodysuits and pajamas, and collectively typically account for the bulk of its revenues. Besides apparel, Carter's licenses bedding, toys, furnishings, baby gear, and gifts that are sold through mass merchandisers. The OshKosh brand, acquired in 2005, has extended the company's product range from newborns through children size 12. Known for its rugged playclothes, including overalls and T-shirts, OshKosh items are marketed at higher price points than the company's traditional Carter's branded products. The company is working to boost its revenues further through expansion of its retail and outlet store operations.
  

   In 2013 it opened 21 retail stores in Canada, expanded relationships with its global wholesale partners, and grew its eCommerce business. It also invested more than $180 million in capital expenditures in key areas including new retail stores, the build out of its new multi-channel distribution center in Georgia, the consolidation of operations into a new headquarters in Atlanta, and strengthening its information technology resources. During 2013 the company also opened 65 Carter's stores and 18 OshKosh stores in the US.
  

   The company replicated its US multi-channel business model in Canada, the company's largest international business, including the launch of eCommerce capabilities in 2014. The company is also looking for growth opportunities in China and Brazil, and assessing the full potential of relationships with its international partners representing the company's brands throughout the world.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   In 2014 Carter's acquired the exclusive rights to the Carter's brands including trademark registrations in Chile. The company acquired these rights ($3.6 million) in order to freely operate in Chile by offering products and service under the Carter's brand.
  
Company Background

   The company in 2013 acquired worldwide rights to the Carter's Watch the Wear and H.W. Carter & Sons brands (including trademark registrations) for $38 million.
  

   Carter's extended its reach northward into Canada and added an international segment to its business as a result of the company's 2011 $98 million purchase of Bonnie Togs, a Canadian specialty retailer of children's apparel and accessories. Bonnie Togs had been Carter's principal licensee in Canada since 2007.
  

   Carter's was established in 1865 by William Carter.

Carter’s Baby Clothes Make Excellent Gifts
Carter’s baby clothes are great gifts for parents and babies! With over 100 years of experience in children’s clothing, Carter’s knows the kind of clothing babies need and parents want. Shop layette sets for newborns. Layette sets are the perfect baby shower gift. The Carter’s Classic Baby Essentials collection includes all of the essential clothing parents will need for their new baby. The collection features bodysuits, hoodies, pants, bibs, and more. It also comes in neutral colors, making it a great unisex gift. The Take Me Home set is another wonderful gift. Mom and dad can bring baby home in this cozy little set that includes long-sleeve and short-sleeve bodysuits, footed pants, and a cap. Babies grow quickly, so get a few extra sets of clothing to accommodate rapid growth spurts. Carter’s knows the difficulty that comes with finding preemie clothing. While you’re at it, pick up a few accessories to give out too! Carter’s has super cute animal themed bath sets. Get a hood towel, washcloth, and robe with matching booties. Babies will sleep sweetly with a soother that sings lullabies, plays nature sounds, and casts moon images on the ceiling. Shop Carter’s baby clothes in the baby department for great gifts that parents will love.
 
Carter’s Clothing: Stylish Clothes for Babies of All Ages
Carter’s clothing makes the earliest years of your baby’s life super stylish! In the first three months, babies spend the majority of their time eating, sleeping, and in need of a diaper change. Simple clothing is the best in these early months. Stock up on Carter’s bodysuits, hats, and booties, made from warm and cozy cotton. Get these three essentials in packs or separates. From six to nine months, your baby will start getting mobile. They’ll begin crawling, scooting, and sliding. Rompers are a great choice to provide maximum mobility and comfort. We have adorable Carter’s rompers for boys and girls in beautiful colors and designs. From nine months and up, comfortable separates, such as t-shirts, sweat pants, leggings, and jeans are essential. Our Carter’s sale has all of these items and more! Outfit your future sports star in a handsome all-American varsity jacket with a button front. Carter’s even has baby puffer jackets for those bitter cold days when something heavier is necessary.
