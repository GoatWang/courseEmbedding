("Holdings") 1,106,616 Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Units (the "Series B Preferred Units") as payment for the quarterly distribution declared on the Series B Preferred Units.

7. The Reporting Persons disclaim beneficial ownership of the securities reported herein except to the extent of their pecuniary interest therein, if any, and this report shall not be deemed an admission that any such Reporting Person is the beneficial owner of, or has any pecuniary interests in, such securities for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or for any other purpose.
