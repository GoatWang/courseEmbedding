Praxair, Inc. is an American worldwide industrial gases company. It is the largest industrial gases company in North and South America, and the third-largest worldwide by revenue.
History[edit]
The company was founded by Carl von Linde as Linde Air Products Company in 1907. In 1917, it joined with 4 other chemical companies under the name Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation, while maintaining a separate identity.[1] Its degree of independence waxed and waned over the years, and in 1989, it was spun off as a subsidiary, Union Carbide Industrial Gases Inc., and renamed to Praxair when it became a formally independent company three years later.[2] The name is derived from a combination of the Greek word "praxis", or practical application, and "air", the company's primary raw material.[citation needed]
Praxair was the first company in North America to commercialize cryogenically separated oxygen.[citation needed] The company introduced the first distribution system for liquid gas in 1917 and developed on-site gas supply in the 1940s.[citation needed] In the 1960s, Praxair introduced non-cryogenic means of air separation.[citation needed]
In August 2016 it was publicly announced that the American company was in official negotiations to merger with the German competitor Linde Group, which would form the world's largest gas supplier.[3][4][5][6] The following month in September the negotiations were halted and suspended indefinitely.[7][8][9][10] As of mid December 2016 Praxair has resumed negotiations with Linde for a potential merger [11][12][13][14][15] In late December an official announcement was made that Praxair has reached an agreement to merger with Linde in a deal valued at $35 billion[16] with an overall merger value of $65 billion.[17] In April, 2017 Linde again rejected a request for a shareholder vote at its annual general meeting in May - this is the second time Linde has rejected Praxair's request.[17] In May 2017, both companies reached a deal in principle on an all-share merger of equals valued at $75 billion,[18] the deal will still need the approval of Praxair's board of directors as well as Linde's management and executive boards[19] and if approved, will form a new holding company.[20] In early June, both companies agreed to the merger.[21]

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Methodology: 
	Compensation rank is based on total compensation for latest fiscal year. Total compensation for each chief executive includes the following: salary and bonuses; other compensation, such as vested restricted stock grants, LTIP payouts and perks; and stock gains, the value realized by exercising stock options. Efficiency rank is based on our chief executive's performance/pay score. Ranks are given only to chief executives who have a six-year tenure and six-year compensation history. The most efficient rank is 1 and least efficient is 206.

Footnotes: 
	Compensation data is from the latest available proxy statements filed through Mar. 23, 2012. Total returns and value of stock owned (including all classes) is based on Mar. 14, 2011 stock price. Compensation percent change is based on combined salary and bonus. Annualized total return during tenure covers the tenure of the executive or from the time of the IPO or available stock history. Relative to market is the ending value of $100 invested in the stock, divided by the ending value of $1 invested in the S & P 500 (a score of 100 = the S & P 500). NA: Not available or not applicable.
