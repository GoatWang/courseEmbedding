Biography[edit]
In British political terms he is considered Asian, though both of his parents are from the Caribbean; (see Indo-Caribbean). His mother, a nurse, is from Trinidad, and his estranged father, a mechanic, is from British Guiana (now Guyana). His mother was Hindu and his father Muslim; he has two brothers, who are also Muslims.[3] He was named one of the 20 most important Asians in British media in 2005.[4] At the same time, he maintains ties with his Caribbean roots, both with other British-Guyanese politicians such as Valerie Amos and Trevor Phillips, and with President Bharrat Jagdeo.[5]
He is one of a group of highly successful Guyanese people in Britain (Michael White of The Guardian refers to them as the "Guyanese mafia"), which includes Raj Persaud, Herman Ouseley[6] and David Dabydeen, Cynthia Pine, Keith Waithe and Rudolph Dunbar.[7]
Alli grew up in humble surroundings, attended Stanley Technical College in South Norwood and left school at 16 with nine O-levels.[8]
Business career[edit]
Alli started work as a junior researcher for a finance magazine, crediting his first success to Salem Ghayar, who hired and mentored him. After a few years of preparing monthly reports for potential investors, he was headhunted by Save & Prosper, part of Robert Fleming & Co..[9] Eventually he returned to his original employer, and worked his way up in the media business within Robert Maxwell's stable of publications. He then went to the City for a second career in investment banking, through which he became wealthy.[10] In the mid-1980s he met Charlie Parsons, who was to become his business partner as well as his life partner.[11]
Alli's third career, and the first in which he achieved public prominence, was in the television industry. He and Parsons set up 24 Hour Productions, which produced The Word, "the most talked about television programme in Britain".[8] In 1992 they merged with Bob Geldof's Planet Pictures to form Planet 24. Such was its success that it became one of the largest TV production companies in the country, and the main independent supplier to Channel 4.[8] It was responsible for genre-breaking programmes such as Big Breakfast and Survivor. Carlton Television bought Planet 24 in March 1999 for £15 million, with Alli and Parsons prudently retaining the rights to the lucrative Survivor format. Waheed Alli became a Carlton board director before stepping down a year later.[12]
In April 2003 Alli took over as chairman of the media rights company Chorion Ltd,[13] which owns rights to Enid Blyton and Agatha Christie, and has offices beyond the UK in New York, Sydney, and Tokyo.[4] He was chairman of AIM-listed ASOS.com[14] and a director of Olga Television, entertainer Paul O'Grady's production company. He owns part of Shine Limited, a media production company he co-founded in March 2001 with Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of media-magnate Rupert Murdoch. In August 2011, he stepped down from the chairmanship of Chorion and sold half his stake in ASOS.com to start a new company called Silvergate Media.[citation needed]
He was part of a failed £100m bid backed by private equity firm 3i to buy Virgin Radio from SMG plc in 2005. In March 2007 he was appointed as SMG's non-executive director.[15]
Alli is a founder investor in Koovs, an Indian online retailer looking to replicate the success of Asos in the subcontinent. The company was set up in 2012 and intends to raise £22m with a stock market listing on London's Aim.[16]
Politics[edit]
Alli joined the Labour Party at the persuasion of his neighbour Emily Thornberry, to whom he remains close.[17] He is also close to Anji Hunter, Director of Government Relations in Tony Blair's first government.[18] Prime Minister Blair used him for years as a means to help him reach out to a younger generation (aka "yoof culture"),[10] and as such he is considered[by whom?] one of "Tony's Cronies".[5] He was made a life peer as Baron Alli, of Norbury in the London Borough of Croydon, on 18 July 1998[19][20] at the age of 34, becoming the youngest and the first openly-gay peer in Parliament. He sits on the Labour benches in the House of Lords. The BBC summarised his appointment as "the antithesis of the stereotypical 'establishment' peer – young, Asian and from the world of media and entertainment".[10]
Alli has used his political position to argue for gay rights. He spearheaded the campaign to repeal Section 28.[21] He advocated lowering the age of consent for homosexuals from 18 to 16, equal to heterosexuals; this eventually became law as the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000. It was during a heated exchange with conservative opponents, led by Baroness Young, that he informed his fellow peers that he was gay. In April 1999, he said in a speech, "I have never been confused about my sexuality. I have been confused about the way I am treated as a result of it. The only confusion lies in the prejudice shown, some of it tonight [i.e. in the House], and much of it enshrined in the law."[10][22]
In 2006, he participated the International Conference on LGBT Human Rights adopting Declaration of Montreal and in 2009, he spearheaded an effort to repeal clauses in the Civil Partnership Act 2004 which prohibited religious institutions from conducting the ceremonies on their premises.[23][24][25] This campaign culminated in a bipartisan amendment, which became part of the Equality Act 2010.[26][27] He influenced the draft Communications Bill in 2003.[4]
Other information[edit]
Alli's work has been focused around gay rights, youth and education. He is the former Chancellor of De Montfort University in Leicester. He is also the President of the Croydon Youth Development Trust.[28] He is a patron of Skillset,[29] the Sector Skills Council supporting skills and training within the creative media industries.
In Autumn 2008 he won a Stonewall Award for the category of political figure. In 2002 he became a patron of The Albert Kennedy Trust, stating: "Being a teenager isn't easy and it's particularly difficult for vulnerable and socially excluded members of our community. The Albert Kennedy Trust offers young gay men, lesbians and bisexuals a unique and targeted service. My first task as Patron will be to support plans to extend these services across the UK, to help the increasing number of young people contacting the Trust." He was a keynote speaker at the International Conference on LGBT Human Rights, part of the 2006 World Outgames, which led to the Declaration of Montreal. Alli is a patron of Oxford Pride, the annual Pride event in Oxfordshire, and of Pride London. He is a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.[30]
A portrait of Alli is in the National Portrait Gallery collection,[31] which contains "portraits of the Nation's great men and women".[32]

In Autumn 2008 he won a Stonewall Award for the category of political figure. In 2002 he became a patron of The Albert Kennedy Trust, stating: "Being a teenager isn't easy and it's particularly difficult for vulnerable and socially excluded members of our community. The Albert Kennedy Trust offers young gay men, lesbians and bisexuals a unique and targeted service. My first task as Patron will be to support plans to extend these services across the UK, to help the increasing number of young people contacting the Trust." He was a keynote speaker at the International Conference on LGBT Human Rights, part of the 2006 World Outgames, which led to the Declaration of Montreal. Alli is a patron of Oxford Pride, the annual Pride event in Oxfordshire, and of Pride London. He is a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.[30]

Biography[edit]
In British political terms he is considered Asian, though both of his parents are from the Caribbean; (see Indo-Caribbean). His mother, a nurse, is from Trinidad, and his estranged father, a mechanic, is from British Guiana (now Guyana). His mother was Hindu and his father Muslim; he has two brothers, who are also Muslims.[3] He was named one of the 20 most important Asians in British media in 2005.[4] At the same time, he maintains ties with his Caribbean roots, both with other British-Guyanese politicians such as Valerie Amos and Trevor Phillips, and with President Bharrat Jagdeo.[5]
He is one of a group of highly successful Guyanese people in Britain (Michael White of The Guardian refers to them as the "Guyanese mafia"), which includes Raj Persaud, Herman Ouseley[6] and David Dabydeen, Cynthia Pine, Keith Waithe and Rudolph Dunbar.[7]
Alli grew up in humble surroundings, attended Stanley Technical College in South Norwood and left school at 16 with nine O-levels.[8]
Business career[edit]
Alli started work as a junior researcher for a finance magazine, crediting his first success to Salem Ghayar, who hired and mentored him. After a few years of preparing monthly reports for potential investors, he was headhunted by Save & Prosper, part of Robert Fleming & Co..[9] Eventually he returned to his original employer, and worked his way up in the media business within Robert Maxwell's stable of publications. He then went to the City for a second career in investment banking, through which he became wealthy.[10] In the mid-1980s he met Charlie Parsons, who was to become his business partner as well as his life partner.[11]
Alli's third career, and the first in which he achieved public prominence, was in the television industry. He and Parsons set up 24 Hour Productions, which produced The Word, "the most talked about television programme in Britain".[8] In 1992 they merged with Bob Geldof's Planet Pictures to form Planet 24. Such was its success that it became one of the largest TV production companies in the country, and the main independent supplier to Channel 4.[8] It was responsible for genre-breaking programmes such as Big Breakfast and Survivor. Carlton Television bought Planet 24 in March 1999 for £15 million, with Alli and Parsons prudently retaining the rights to the lucrative Survivor format. Waheed Alli became a Carlton board director before stepping down a year later.[12]
In April 2003 Alli took over as chairman of the media rights company Chorion Ltd,[13] which owns rights to Enid Blyton and Agatha Christie, and has offices beyond the UK in New York, Sydney, and Tokyo.[4] He was chairman of AIM-listed ASOS.com[14] and a director of Olga Television, entertainer Paul O'Grady's production company. He owns part of Shine Limited, a media production company he co-founded in March 2001 with Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of media-magnate Rupert Murdoch. In August 2011, he stepped down from the chairmanship of Chorion and sold half his stake in ASOS.com to start a new company called Silvergate Media.[citation needed]
He was part of a failed £100m bid backed by private equity firm 3i to buy Virgin Radio from SMG plc in 2005. In March 2007 he was appointed as SMG's non-executive director.[15]
Alli is a founder investor in Koovs, an Indian online retailer looking to replicate the success of Asos in the subcontinent. The company was set up in 2012 and intends to raise £22m with a stock market listing on London's Aim.[16]
Politics[edit]
Alli joined the Labour Party at the persuasion of his neighbour Emily Thornberry, to whom he remains close.[17] He is also close to Anji Hunter, Director of Government Relations in Tony Blair's first government.[18] Prime Minister Blair used him for years as a means to help him reach out to a younger generation (aka "yoof culture"),[10] and as such he is considered[by whom?] one of "Tony's Cronies".[5] He was made a life peer as Baron Alli, of Norbury in the London Borough of Croydon, on 18 July 1998[19][20] at the age of 34, becoming the youngest and the first openly-gay peer in Parliament. He sits on the Labour benches in the House of Lords. The BBC summarised his appointment as "the antithesis of the stereotypical 'establishment' peer – young, Asian and from the world of media and entertainment".[10]
Alli has used his political position to argue for gay rights. He spearheaded the campaign to repeal Section 28.[21] He advocated lowering the age of consent for homosexuals from 18 to 16, equal to heterosexuals; this eventually became law as the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000. It was during a heated exchange with conservative opponents, led by Baroness Young, that he informed his fellow peers that he was gay. In April 1999, he said in a speech, "I have never been confused about my sexuality. I have been confused about the way I am treated as a result of it. The only confusion lies in the prejudice shown, some of it tonight [i.e. in the House], and much of it enshrined in the law."[10][22]
In 2006, he participated the International Conference on LGBT Human Rights adopting Declaration of Montreal and in 2009, he spearheaded an effort to repeal clauses in the Civil Partnership Act 2004 which prohibited religious institutions from conducting the ceremonies on their premises.[23][24][25] This campaign culminated in a bipartisan amendment, which became part of the Equality Act 2010.[26][27] He influenced the draft Communications Bill in 2003.[4]
Other information[edit]
Alli's work has been focused around gay rights, youth and education. He is the former Chancellor of De Montfort University in Leicester. He is also the President of the Croydon Youth Development Trust.[28] He is a patron of Skillset,[29] the Sector Skills Council supporting skills and training within the creative media industries.

A portrait of Alli is in the National Portrait Gallery collection,[31] which contains "portraits of the Nation's great men and women".[32]

Biography[edit]
In British political terms he is considered Asian, though both of his parents are from the Caribbean; (see Indo-Caribbean). His mother, a nurse, is from Trinidad, and his estranged father, a mechanic, is from British Guiana (now Guyana). His mother was Hindu and his father Muslim; he has two brothers, who are also Muslims.[3] He was named one of the 20 most important Asians in British media in 2005.[4] At the same time, he maintains ties with his Caribbean roots, both with other British-Guyanese politicians such as Valerie Amos and Trevor Phillips, and with President Bharrat Jagdeo.[5]
He is one of a group of highly successful Guyanese people in Britain (Michael White of The Guardian refers to them as the "Guyanese mafia"), which includes Raj Persaud, Herman Ouseley[6] and David Dabydeen, Cynthia Pine, Keith Waithe and Rudolph Dunbar.[7]
Alli grew up in humble surroundings, attended Stanley Technical College in South Norwood and left school at 16 with nine O-levels.[8]
Business career[edit]
Alli started work as a junior researcher for a finance magazine, crediting his first success to Salem Ghayar, who hired and mentored him. After a few years of preparing monthly reports for potential investors, he was headhunted by Save & Prosper, part of Robert Fleming & Co..[9] Eventually he returned to his original employer, and worked his way up in the media business within Robert Maxwell's stable of publications. He then went to the City for a second career in investment banking, through which he became wealthy.[10] In the mid-1980s he met Charlie Parsons, who was to become his business partner as well as his life partner.[11]
Alli's third career, and the first in which he achieved public prominence, was in the television industry. He and Parsons set up 24 Hour Productions, which produced The Word, "the most talked about television programme in Britain".[8] In 1992 they merged with Bob Geldof's Planet Pictures to form Planet 24. Such was its success that it became one of the largest TV production companies in the country, and the main independent supplier to Channel 4.[8] It was responsible for genre-breaking programmes such as Big Breakfast and Survivor. Carlton Television bought Planet 24 in March 1999 for £15 million, with Alli and Parsons prudently retaining the rights to the lucrative Survivor format. Waheed Alli became a Carlton board director before stepping down a year later.[12]
In April 2003 Alli took over as chairman of the media rights company Chorion Ltd,[13] which owns rights to Enid Blyton and Agatha Christie, and has offices beyond the UK in New York, Sydney, and Tokyo.[4] He was chairman of AIM-listed ASOS.com[14] and a director of Olga Television, entertainer Paul O'Grady's production company. He owns part of Shine Limited, a media production company he co-founded in March 2001 with Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of media-magnate Rupert Murdoch. In August 2011, he stepped down from the chairmanship of Chorion and sold half his stake in ASOS.com to start a new company called Silvergate Media.[citation needed]
He was part of a failed £100m bid backed by private equity firm 3i to buy Virgin Radio from SMG plc in 2005. In March 2007 he was appointed as SMG's non-executive director.[15]
Alli is a founder investor in Koovs, an Indian online retailer looking to replicate the success of Asos in the subcontinent. The company was set up in 2012 and intends to raise £22m with a stock market listing on London's Aim.[16]
Politics[edit]
Alli joined the Labour Party at the persuasion of his neighbour Emily Thornberry, to whom he remains close.[17] He is also close to Anji Hunter, Director of Government Relations in Tony Blair's first government.[18] Prime Minister Blair used him for years as a means to help him reach out to a younger generation (aka "yoof culture"),[10] and as such he is considered[by whom?] one of "Tony's Cronies".[5] He was made a life peer as Baron Alli, of Norbury in the London Borough of Croydon, on 18 July 1998[19][20] at the age of 34, becoming the youngest and the first openly-gay peer in Parliament. He sits on the Labour benches in the House of Lords. The BBC summarised his appointment as "the antithesis of the stereotypical 'establishment' peer – young, Asian and from the world of media and entertainment".[10]
Alli has used his political position to argue for gay rights. He spearheaded the campaign to repeal Section 28.[21] He advocated lowering the age of consent for homosexuals from 18 to 16, equal to heterosexuals; this eventually became law as the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000. It was during a heated exchange with conservative opponents, led by Baroness Young, that he informed his fellow peers that he was gay. In April 1999, he said in a speech, "I have never been confused about my sexuality. I have been confused about the way I am treated as a result of it. The only confusion lies in the prejudice shown, some of it tonight [i.e. in the House], and much of it enshrined in the law."[10][22]
In 2006, he participated the International Conference on LGBT Human Rights adopting Declaration of Montreal and in 2009, he spearheaded an effort to repeal clauses in the Civil Partnership Act 2004 which prohibited religious institutions from conducting the ceremonies on their premises.[23][24][25] This campaign culminated in a bipartisan amendment, which became part of the Equality Act 2010.[26][27] He influenced the draft Communications Bill in 2003.[4]
Other information[edit]
Alli's work has been focused around gay rights, youth and education. He is the former Chancellor of De Montfort University in Leicester. He is also the President of the Croydon Youth Development Trust.[28] He is a patron of Skillset,[29] the Sector Skills Council supporting skills and training within the creative media industries.
In Autumn 2008 he won a Stonewall Award for the category of political figure. In 2002 he became a patron of The Albert Kennedy Trust, stating: "Being a teenager isn't easy and it's particularly difficult for vulnerable and socially excluded members of our community. The Albert Kennedy Trust offers young gay men, lesbians and bisexuals a unique and targeted service. My first task as Patron will be to support plans to extend these services across the UK, to help the increasing number of young people contacting the Trust." He was a keynote speaker at the International Conference on LGBT Human Rights, part of the 2006 World Outgames, which led to the Declaration of Montreal. Alli is a patron of Oxford Pride, the annual Pride event in Oxfordshire, and of Pride London. He is a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.[30]
A portrait of Alli is in the National Portrait Gallery collection,[31] which contains "portraits of the Nation's great men and women".[32]

First published on Saturday 10 March 2001 22.46 EST







 Name:  Lord Waheed Alli
 Title:  Founder of Planet 24 
 Born:  16 November 1964 
 Other directorships:  Tornado Group; chairman of the Digital Radio Group 
 Hobbies:  Travelling, helping Labour win the next election 
Some things can be revived: Duran Duran, tank tops, even Paul Daniels' career. But a Sixties soap set in a Midlands motel which flatlined in the Eighties does not exactly scream 'resuscitate'. 
Yet last week more than 2 million people tuned in for the first episode of the new look Crossroads . Very new look in fact. The setting has shifted from the West to the East Midlands and, shock horror, the motel has gone. 
'We couldn't find a motel; they no longer exist,' says Lord Waheed Alli, who brought the soap back from TV purgatory. 'It would have been silly to pretend other wise, so we went for a four star hotel - very comfortable rooms.' 
Sitting in the House of Parliament canteen, Alli, small and intense, is clearly excited about the launch of his 'baby': 'I grew up with Crossroads , and I'm anxious to see whether people think we've done justice to it. Hearing that music come up is brilliant.' 
Alli breaks off to hum the soap's annoying signature tune. He and his partner, Charlie Parsons, who co-founded TV production house Planet 24 with Bob Geldof, wanted to remake the soap a few years ago, but the company which owned the rights wouldn't sell. 
Then, two years ago, Alli, Parsons and Geldof sold Planet, maker of The Big Breakfast and The Word , to Carlton for £15 million, a deal which reportedly earned Alli £5m. The sale cleared the way for him to make a renewed attempt to bring the soap back. He had joined Carlton as managing director of its programming arm, with a brief from chief executive Michael Green to shake up the division. In came Lily Savage and a deal was signed with Ragdoll Productions, maker of Teletubbies , to provide more children's programming. The company also invested in a raft of new prime-time dramas. And then came Crossroads . 
'I don't know why I loved the old Crossroads , but you have very few times in your life when you have the creative freedom to do what you want, and we wanted to bring it back.' 
The chance came when Channel 5 launched its audacious and successful bid to poach Aussie soap Home and Away from ITV. Alli pounced, seizing the weekday slot for his baby. While soaps tend not to be the greatest revenue drivers for networks, making Crossroads was not about economics, Alli says. It was part of a rebranding exercise, something that is yielding dramatic results - albeit after Alli quit Carlton to concentrate on politics. 
'I know I changed the face of Carlton,' Alli says proudly, a sentence which nearly causes Keith Vaz MP, sitting nearby, to choke on his lunch. 
'What's this: Lord Alli, my life story?' Vaz asks. 
'Keith I'm talking to the Observer ,' Alli says playfully. Vaz doesn't say much after that. 
Alli argues that consolidation among media companies means content is now at a premium. 'It's inevitable that Carlton and Granada will merge. Channel 5 is going to RTL. The challenge now is to build brands across the platforms, and this is why content is so important. Content may not be king just yet, but it's close. It's more like queen at the moment.'These days, Alli doesn't get too heavily involved in the production side of things. He's concentrating on his next offspring: winning the next election for Labour. 
Alli was probably New Labour before New Labour. Media savvy and, like all Labour apparatchiks, a mix of the urban and the urbane, Alli left school at 16 to find a job so he could support his immigrant parents. It's a stark contrast to the wealth he now enjoys, and his generosity is legendary. He once bought Big Breakfast star Denise Van Outen a £25,000 diamond necklace as a Christmas present. 
Other details about Alli's rise to media moguldom are sketchy. A close friend of both Peter Mandelson and Tony Blair, he doesn't do many interviews. He has been targeted by racist and homophobic groups, most notably over his opposition to Clause 28. 
After the election, Alli will probably spend more time building his portfolio of part-time careers. He's looking for a directorship with a blue chip FTSE company to add to the non-executive directorship he holds at Tornado Group, a company that specialises in distributing content over the internet. He is also chairman of the The Digital Radio Group. 
The two positions seem incongruous at first. 'If you look at Tornado, it seems an odd choice,' says Alli. 'But it's a business I understand. It's about delivering creatively. I love working with creative talent. I love making things.' 
He's keen to stress that although Tornado is involved with the internet, it's not a dotcom company, complete with short shelf-life and terrifying cash burn rate. 
Alli is scornful of the institutions that created the internet bubble: 'The people to blame are the venture capitalists. You can't give that sort of money to inexperienced managers. But now we've gone from one extreme to another, and the market has completely dried up.' 
Alli was offered the chairmanship of DRG, which holds London's third digital radio licence, when he left Carlton. The group is a consortium made up of GWR, Scottish Media Group, Emap, the Carphone Warehouse and Kelvin Mackenzie's Wireless Group. 
Again, radio is not something Alli would seem to know much about. But he argues that the consortium, which has yet to launch its digital channels, is all about choice, something he does understand. 'For instance we have an Asian service, which I'd like to listen to. And there's a gay service, which I'll probably tune into.' However, he's not too sure he'll be a regular listener to the country music channel - it's not very New Labour after all. 
But the problem is that no one listens to digital radio. The sets are prohibitively priced and the demand for the new medium just isn't there. 
'This is not a short-term project,' says Alli. 'But one day the Government will switch off analogue. Radio is going through a growth perception problem. It's seen as old media but it is growing audiences. Not many are doing that.' 
And what about Mackenzie, who, when editor of the Sun was not exactly renowned for his appreciation of multi-cultural, multisexual Britain. 'I've yet to meet him, but I'm looking forward to it. The world's moved on from when Kelvin was at the Sun . Today we don't have an editor of the Sun who goes round outing people. It's much less homophobic.' 
Alli could have been in the newspaper game himself if his bid to buy the Star last year had been successful. 'We didn't get it. Richard Desmond [owner of Northern & Shell, publisher of OK! and numerous pornographic magazines] was far quicker and far more adept.' Alli, it transpires, is a big fan of Desmond. 
'Richard's enthusiasm is amazing. The Express papers are looking much better since he took over. They look like winners.' You wouldn't expect a Labour lord to say anything else in the run-up to an election, but soon Alli won't have to play the political card so much. Alli and Parsons met with Geldof the other week for a spot of brain-storming. Alli grins at the recollection. 
'We've had to rest for a couple of years, which is contrary to our instincts. But when all three of us met up the sparks were flying.' What next? The return of El Dorado ... The Newcomers ... Compact ? We hold our breath.

Unfortunately, increasingly busy lifestyles make this a bit difficult at times, so it s important to create a nutritional safety net for yourself by consuming diet and nutritional supplements that can boost your health. The wide variety of diet and nutritional supplements can make it difficult to know what s right for you, so learning the basics of choosing nutritional supplements is the first step to getting the best supplements for your needs   along with talking to your doctor about what you might need to take. With the wide selection of diet and nutritional supplements available at Every Day Low Prices at Walmart, you can easily find all the vitamins and minerals that make it easier to lead a healthy lifestyle. Why should you use supplements? Nothing can replace a diet rich in minerals and vitamins, but when life gets busy and your stress levels rise, you may struggle to find the time to source and prepare nutritious dishes every day. By choosing nutrition supplements, you and your entire family can get the nutrition you need every day, no matter what life throws at you. Alternatively, if you're overweight and would like to lose weight, you may find it helpful to use dieting supplements such as appetite suppressants or fat inhibitors that can control your appetite and help you deal with the constant feeling of hunger. Vitamins and minerals Besides supporting general health, vitamins and mineral supplements may help head off chronic conditions, so it's important to make sure that your risk of dietary deficiencies is low by taking supplements. Before making your choice, ensure that you know what to look for in a multivitamin supplement.  Start by reading the label to identify the nutrients included as well as the amounts per serving.  If you're looking for a daily supplement that's suitable for most individuals, get a combination of basic vitamins and minerals. Some of the essential ingredients in such supplements include vitamins C, B1, B2, B3, B6, A, folic acid, Vitamin E, iodine, zinc, magnesium, calcium and iron. Multiple types of multivitamins are targeted at helping individuals with specific conditions or nutritional needs. Women, for example, could take a supplement with folic acid when they're pregnant to help avoid some congenital disabilities. Middle-aged women can take calcium and vitamin D supplements to lower the risk of osteoporosis. Check the percentages to determine whether a certain supplement offers you 100 percent of the Daily Value (DV) for the vitamins and minerals included. You shouldn t take multivitamins that exceed the 100 percent recommended dose. Proteins and meal replacements Protein powders, protein bars and meal replacement supplements are a popular choice for those who engage in sports regularly. The human body needs large amounts of protein as part of a balanced diet, but just like in the case of vitamins and minerals, it may be difficult to get all the amount you need from food. protein shakes are available in multiple types, with the most common of them being protein concentrate, isolate and hydrolysate. Meal replacement shakes are often made with skim milk, and they're high in protein and fiber while being low in fat. They offer a high-energy meal, but they only have around 200 to 300 calories per serving. Protein bars are ideal for those moments you want a nutritious snack on the go. Diet supplements If losing weight is your goal, diet supplements can help you by curbing cravings and suppressing your appetite. Remember that these supplements aren't magic pills for losing weight and that they work well in combination with a nutritious, low-calorie diet and regular exercise. Chromium diet supplements are available in tablet form and they do a good job at reducing excess body fat while helping your body maintain normal sugar levels. Control your diet with an everyday weight loss kit that come complete with everything you need to embrace healthy eating, offering you a variety of breakfast options and snacks. Slimming powders combine appetite suppressants with protein and other nutrients to boost your metabolism. Diet-specific supplements are available at Walmart, so you can find options that are tailored to the specific phases of various diets.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147349563, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

As you grow older, or if you have certain medical conditions, you may need to be seen more frequently. Why choose Walmart? Consider the following advantages offered at our optical centers. Value you can count on: You're already familiar with Walmart's Every Day Low Prices. And our commitment to providing our customers with the top brands at low prices is only the beginning. We offer free in-store pickup and free shipping on qualifying purchases. So you can visit our Vision Center today or shop online at your convenience without having to pay a penny more. The convenience you need: We know how busy you are. Why make an extra trip when you can have your eyes examined, pick out new glasses or buy contacts right where you shop? Styles you want: Walmart's Vision Center stocks the best brands and hottest styles in eyewear. Whether you shop in-store or online, you're sure to find a style to flatter your face and express your own unique personality. Tips for Eyeglass Shopping  Flatter your face Best for oval faces: All shapes. Because oval-shaped faces have balanced features and gentle curves, they can wear nearly any frame shape. To add a little pizzazz, try square and rectangular frames, which contrast with your facial structure. Avoid frames that are overly large or too small to maintain the natural balance of your features. Best for round faces: Square, rectangular and angular. Angular shapes play off of your fuller cheeks and rounded chin. Other shapes to try include those that upsweep at the corners to emphasize your eyes. Best for square faces: Oval and round frames. Your facial structure is characterized by straight lines, including a square chin and a broad forehead. Choose frames with soft, rounded edges to balance the lines of your face, while allowing your features to shine. Best for a heart shaped face: Varies. There's no set rule. Look for frames that balance the varying widths of your facial features. For example, bottom-heavy frames balance the narrowness of the lower half of your face, while oval shapes can soften a more pointed chin. Frame materials Choose a frame material that offers the right balance between durability and design. Plastic, or zyl, frames are lightweight and pretty sturdy. They also offer one of the widest color ranges available. If you want something a little more sleek and modern, metal frames such as titanium, beryllium or monel deliver the style you are looking for. Hinge styles Don't forget about the importance of hinges. Standard barrel hinges are easy to repair and durable, but they aren't very flexible. If you're hard on your glasses, you may want to opt for flex hinges, which feature a tiny spring that gives the arms of the glasses a little extra movement, making them ideal for active adults and kids. Shopping Tips for Contact LensesWalmart Vision Centers are the one-stop eye care shop you can rely on for everything from prescription glasses and sunglasses to contact lenses. To help you pick the right contacts for you, consider the following factors: Types of contact lenses Best for people who want easy care: Disposable contact lenses. Use them once, then throw them away. These lenses should be removed at the end of each day. Although they are convenient, they tend to be more expensive than standard daily wear soft contact lenses. Best for people who don't mind a little extra maintenance: Daily wear. These reusable contact lenses require removal and cleaning at the end of every day. They can last up to one year, and they're one of the most economical options. Your optician can help provide recommendations about the types of cleaning solutions available. Best for people who don't want to remove their lenses every day: Extended wear lenses. Extended wear contact lenses are designed to wear continually for one to four weeks. Although they're convenient, sleeping in contacts can increase your chances of developing an eye infection, so be sure to talk to a Walmart Vision Center professional before choosing extended wear contacts for the first time. Contact lens brands If you already wear contact lenses, you may want to stick with the brand you're familiar with. But if you're new to contacts or interested in trying something new, you're in luck. Walmart's Vision Center carries all the major brand names that you trust at low prices you can count on. Whether you need new glasses, new contacts or a quick checkup, we're here to help. Schedule your next eye exam at the Walmart Vision Center nearest you.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147332930, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
