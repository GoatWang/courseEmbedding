Yanac JV, Peru

 
 
 





 


AVAILABLE FOR JV

Opportunity
The Yanac Project is a drill-ready copper-molybdenum porphyry prospect in the Ica Department of southern Peru. The project is located approximately 60 km inland from the Pacific coast and 50 km from the nearest town of Chincha Alta. A newly constructed airport (Pisco International Airport) opened in 2016, 43 km south of Chincha Alta. A multipurpose port facility exists 78 km south of Chincha Alta.
The project is a result of an exploration alliance with Cliffs Natural Resources. Cliffs spent more than $1.2 million in exploration to bring this prospect to the drill ready stage prior to an internal corporate decision at Cliffs to discontinue all exploration worldwide in 2014. In late 2015, Cliffs sold its 50% interest to a private company as part of a larger sale of research and development technologies and exploration properties. Alianza regained 100% ownership of the property in late 2016.
Exploration has identified a 1.1 x 1.25 km area of alteration and porphyry style mineralization (pyrite-chalcopyrite-copper oxide-molybdenite) surrounded by a halo of quartz-pyrite veining. IP geophysics indicates a potentially larger mineralized body at depth.
Summary
The Yanac prospect is a copper ± molybdenum porphyry occurrence located in the Andean southern porphyry mineralization trend. The hydrothermal system is associated with Upper Cretaceous fine diorite to quartz diorite stocks of the Coastal Batholith.
The surface expression is a 1.1 km x 1.25 km area of alteration (chlorite, chlorite ~ epidote ± pyrite) with irregular silica clay ribs. Rock geochemistry is anomalous in copper (+ 600 ppm) and molybdenite (+ 10 ppm) over approximately 900 m x 900 m. Within this lies a 400 m x 400 m expression of porphyry-style mineralization with chlorite-epidote assemblages that also includes quartz stockwork (up to 10%) with magnetite and secondary biotite. Mineralization consists of chalcopyrite-pyrite (± CuOx) and molybdenite reflected in a 250 x 400 m area of >0.3% copper in rock samples.
Adjacent to this is a second area of >0.3% copper in rocks in a copper-bearing, coarse white silica breccia adjacent to the porphyry mineralization.
Numerous silica- clay ribs and sericitized areas surround the mineralization, including a halo of sheeted pyrite ± quartz veinlets. This distal-style (epidote-chlorite +/- magnetite and perhaps biotite) alteration in addition to geochemical pathfinder element distribution indicates the presence of an upper level porphyry system with high potential open at depth. This is corroborated by the high chargeability response (> 20 mV/V) that may reflect an upper level copper porphyry system with a sulfide cap where pyrite is dominate over chalcopyrite with the possibility of there being a change to a chalcopyrite dominant over pyrite mineralization at ±150 m depth.
Cliffs laid out a twenty drill hole proposal to test this hypothesis in 2014 but due to the aforementioned issues at Cliffs, it was never undertaken.
The Next Steps
Alianza is actively seeking a partner to fund an initial drill test of the Yanac porphyry project. A multiphase, 20 hole program has been planned and budgeted with the ability to commence work in 2017.

Tim Project, Yukon

 
 
 





 


AVAILABLE FOR JV
The Tim property consists of 72 mineral claims located 72 km west of Watson Lake, Yukon and 12 km northeast of the Silvertip deposit. The property is accessible by road. The Tim property claims cover an area of anomalous silver-lead-zinc in soil geochemistry. Trenching in 1988 by Cordilleran Engineering uncovered silver, lead, zinc bearing iron and manganese oxides over widths of up to 30 m over a strike length of 1 km.
Alianza believes the property has the potential to host a carbonate replacement – manto style deposit, similar in nature to the nearby Silvertip/Midway deposit, owned by JDS Engineering. At Tim, historic trench chip samples returned 352.4 g/t silver, 9.12% lead over 4 m and two grab samples taken from another trench returned assays of 1248.1 g/t silver and 49.5% lead and 978.7 g/t silver and 32% lead respectively.
Confirmation sampling by Tarsis, using a rock saw in 2013 returned 6.4 meters grading 220 g/t silver and 4.74% lead. Within this interval, 3.7 meters assayed 365 g/t silver and 7.54% lead. Management believes the potential to expand on the known mineralization is excellent.

Pucarana Project, Peru

 
 
 





 


The Pucarana property contains 1,889 hectares of land located in the Orcopampa Silver-Gold District of Peru, between Buenaventura Mines’ Poracota Mine and Chipmo Mine. The Pucarana property contains gold and silver mineralization hosted in quartz vein zones, and associated with favourable epithermal alteration zones.
Alianza owns 36% interest in the Pucarana property. On May 22, 2015, Alianza assigned its rights to the Pucarana property to Compania de Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. for a 1.08% NSR interest.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018
