The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

 Career History



Analyst

                                    2012 - Current                


Bridger Management LLC


                  Bridger Management manages various pooled investment funds whose primary investment objective is to achieve long-term, risk-adjusted capital growth generally through investments in equity securities and equity related instruments, with emphasis on publicly traded securities.Bridger seeks to acquire long positions in companies where they have identified fundamental value drivers that have not been recognized or fully exploited by the broader investment community. Long positions typically consist of investments in companies whose growth prospects demonstrate significant potential for high incremental returns on investment, with well-defined competitive advantages. Such advantages may include high barriers to entry, large market opportunities and strong management teams. They may also seek to acquire long positions in companies whose valuation reflects a disproportionate discount to its private market value or peer group, where they have identified a catalyst for capital appreciation. These catalysts may include a restructuring, spin-off or change in management control.Bridger believes that short positions not only serve as a hedge against volatile market conditions, but also generate profit opportunities for the clients. Because of the risks inherent in short selling, the firm devotes significant effort to generating short ideas through their field research and proprietary screens. Bridger may seek to acquire a short position when they determine that the investment community has a fundamental misperception about a company’s business prospects and they have identified a timeline and catalyst for a correction in valuation. Such catalysts may include product failures, customer losses or overestimated market potential. Short positions may also be taken in companies with balance sheets that reflect significant business risk. Such companies may have deteriorating fundamentals, poor cash generation capabilities and reliance on debt financing. Bridger may seek to acquire securities of non-U.S. issuers and a variety of fixed income and equity or equity related instruments, including swaps, options, futures and forward contracts, as well as any other instruments (such as private investment funds managed by third party investment managers). The firm may use leveraging and hedging techniques to seek to maximize returns and minimize risk.
