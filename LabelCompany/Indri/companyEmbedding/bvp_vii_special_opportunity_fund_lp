LinkedIn



LinkedIn operates the world's largest professional network.  Started from a living room in 2002, the site officially launched on May 5, 2003.  After a month in business, it counted 4,500 members in the network. Today LinkedIn counts 300 million members in over 200 countries and territories around the globe.  BVP funded LinkedIn in 2006 and supported the company as it grew.  The company went public five years later in May 2011 (NYSE:LNKD).

Yelp



Yelp was founded in San Francisco in July 2004 to connect people to great local businesses. We became Yelp's first institutional investor in 2005. Shortly after our investment, Yelp's team of about a dozen people moved into a shuttered stereo store on San Francisco's Mission street. The location had an unexpected upside: Yelp board meetings took place in a padded room once used to demo loud set ups, which ensured that those confidential conversations would not be overheard. Today, that seems like ancient history. Yelp went public in 2012 (NYSE: YELP) and now has active communities in 32 countries around the world.  With more than 90 million rich, local reviews, Yelp is the leading local guide for real word-of-mouth on everything from boutiques and mechanics to restaurants and dentists.

Pinterest



Pinterest is a visual bookmarking tool that helps you discover and save creative ideas. Their mission is to help people discover the things they love, and inspire them to go do those things in their daily lives.  When BVP led the Series A investment in 2011, Pinterest was just five people working—and sometimes sleeping—in a Palo Alto Apartment that had seen better days.  Today, more than 500 Pinterest employees work in offices around the world.  Bessemer has supported the company at every stage.

Twilio, Inc.



Twilio makes communication easy and powerful. Twilio is a Communications Platform-as-a-Service providing Infrastructure APIs for developers and businesses to build scalable, communication apps in the cloud.  Since it was founded in 2007, over 700,000 web and mobile developers have used Twilio’s cloud-based platform to integrate voice, SMS and MMS capabilities into software applications.  Eager to help Jeff Lawson build the future of communications, Bessemer provided seed capital for Twilio and has continued to back the company at every stage.

OvaScience, Inc. 



OvaScience makes miracles happen. Founded in 2011, with the goal of improving the treatment of infertility, the company assembled a team of scientists, physicians and advisers that are recognized leaders in the field of reproductive medicine. In 2015, baby Zain Rajani was born.  Zain was the first baby born with the assistance of OvaScience's first product (AUGMENT) which increases the success of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and uses the mothers own cellular energy to revitalize her egg.  For Bessemer, backing the OvaScience founders in 2011 was an easy decision.   We’d funded Michelle Dipp, Christoph Westphal, and Rich Aldrich before.  (In fact, we’ve funded Christoph five times!)  OvaScience (NASDAQ: OVAS) became a public company in 2012.

Blue Apron



Blue Apron makes incredible home cooking easy and fun with a subscription grocery service that delivers original recipes and fresh ingredients to customers nationwide.  BVP was eager to support our and former Bessemer colleague, Matt Salzberg, with seed capital to build Blue Apron. We've continued to back the company at every stage.

Twitch 



Founded in 2011, Twitch is the world’s leading social video platform and community for gamers. Each month, more than 100 million community members gather to watch and talk about video games with more than 1.7 million broadcasters. Twitch’s video platform is the backbone of both live and on-demand distribution for the entire video game ecosystem. Bessemer first invested in Twitch in 2012 following the company’s pivot from JustinTV.  In 2014, Twitch was sold to Amazon for ~$1 billion. (NASDAQ: AMZN)

Periscope 



Periscope changed how we see the world.  Periscope is a live video streaming app developed by Kayvon Beykpour and Joe Bernstein.  The idea for Periscope was born in 2013, as Kayvon traveled abroad. He was in Istanbul when protests broke out in Taksim Square. He turned to Twitter for real-time updates but, while he could read about the protests, he was frustrated not to see them. Motivated by that experience, Kayvon and Joe started the company in February 2014.  Two months later, we provided seed capital to fund development of the app. Before launching their product, Periscope was acquired by Twitter (January 2015).   Periscope was launched in March 2015 and now has over 10 million registered users and 40 years of video watched per day.

Snapdeal.com



Snapdeal.com is India's largest e-commerce marketplace. The New Delhi-based company was started by Wharton grad Kunal Bahl, as part of the dual degree M&T Engineering and Business program at Penn, and Rohit Bansal, an alumnus of IIT Delhi in February 2010. Originally launched as a daily deals platform, the company expanded in 2011 to become an online marketplace focused on India.  Today, Snapdeal is the largest online marketplace in India offering an assortment of 10 million products across diverse categories from over 100,000 sellers, shipping to 5,000+ towns and cities in India.  In 2011, our India team made Bessemer’s first investment in Snapdeal and we’ve enjoyed watching it grow.

3. 

The Debtors commenced these chapter 11 cases to try and maximize the value of 

the Company through a sale process that commenced several months before the bankruptcy 
filing. The Debtors believe the process is designed to maximize the value of the Company. The 
Debtors began exploring a sale process that would maximize the Debtors’ value months before 
the chapter 11 filing. As explained further below, the Debtors’ operations were stymied by a 
liquidity crisis, which in turn made an out of court sale process unworkable. In fact, the Debtors’ 
lack of liquidity threatened the viability of any sale process, in or out of court. Accordingly, the 
Debtors’ Board of Directors authorized its financial advisors the Gordian Group to solicit bids 
for in or out of court financing. 

4. 

The Debtors’ solicitation of financing yielded two prospective lenders. After a 
series of vigorous negotiations, the Debtors determined that the structure and terms of Horizon 
Technology Finance Corporation’s (“Horizon”) ultimate proposal for a DIP Credit Facility best 
served the Debtors’ goal of providing liquidity for the proposed sale process. The other 
proposed lender acknowledged that it could not improve on the terms of its original proposal. 

There is no other available financing, secured or unsecured, known available to the Debtors. 

5. 

Under the terms of the DIP Credit Facility, Horizon will provide an initial 

advance of up to $1.3 million1 in weekly advances consistent with the Approved Budget (as 

defined in the DIP Term Sheet) (the “Initial DIP Availability”) on a senior secured basis that will, 

based on the Debtors’ projections, fund the Debtors’ operations while in chapter 11 through the 

end of February. In connection with the Initial DIP Availability, Horizon will serve as the Initial 

Stalking Horse (the “Back Up Sale Transaction”) while the Debtors and the Gordian Group 

actively search for a Substitute Stalking Horse. If the Debtors obtain a Substitute Stalking Horse

 This amount may be increased by the SVB cure payment of approximately $90,000.00, which will be announced at 
the hearing.

by February 24, 2014 (date to be verified), Horizon will advance an additional $1.2 million in 

weekly advances consistent with the Approved Budget (together with the Initial DIP Availability, 

the “DIP Availability”) to the Debtors on a senior secured basis to permit the Debtors to conduct 

a competitive bidding process with the Substitute Stalking Horse in hand. If no Substitute 

Stalking Horse or Substitute DIP Lender (as defined in the DIP Credit Facility) is obtained by 

February 24, 2014 (date to be verified), then Horizon shall have no further funding obligation 

under the terms of the DIP Loan after February 28, 2014 and the Back Up Sale Transaction will 

close. 

6. 

The proposed DIP financing and related sale framework is the best option to 

maximize the value of the Debtors’ estates under the circumstances. It provides the needed 

liquidity for the Debtors to obtain a Substitute Stalking Horse or a Substitute DIP Lender, either 

of which events will extend the sale process. If a Substitute Stalking Horse is located, the bid 

will be at a value sufficient to pay the Debtors’ senior-most secured lenders: Silicon Valley 

Bank (“SVB”) and Horizon.2 Moreover, locating a Substitute Stalking Horse triggers Horizon’s 

obligation to fund the second tranche of the DIP Credit Facility that will provide further needed 

liquidity for a competitive sale process. Further, the DIP Credit Facility provides another layer 

of flexibility for the sale process. In the event that the Debtors do not obtain a Substitute 

Stalking Horse by February 24, 2014, the Debtors may nonetheless continue its sale process for 

an extended period (subject to deadlines) if it obtains a financing commitment from another 

lender (whose liens will be junior to the liens securing SVB’s prepetition indebtedness and 

Horizon’s pre and post-petition indebtedness) (the “Substitute DIP Lender”) on or before

 SVB’s debt is approximately $500,000.00 and although primed by the Horizon DIP Facility, the 
it holds as security for a letter of credit that is described in more detail below. 
 

Debtor’s DIP budget was just revised to provide for cure of the principal and interest default of 
approximately $90,000.00. Also, the Horizon DIP Facility does not prime SBV’s lien on a $7 million CD

25

February 24, 2014 (date to be verified) that closes no later than February 28, 2014. Horizon will 

have no further funding obligation with respect to the extended process and its collateral may not 

be surcharged under 11 U.S.C. § 506(c) for any expenses incurred after February 28, 2014 if the 

process is extended by the Substitute DIP Lender process. 

7. 

If in the event that the Debtors do not locate a Substitute Stalking Horse or a 
Substitute DIP Lender by February 24, 2014 (date to be verified), the Debtors will sell 
substantially all of their assets to Horizon under the Back Up Sale Transaction with a February 
28, 2014 closing. The Back Up Sale Transaction is not the Debtors’ desired transaction, nor, 
upon information and belief, does Horizon desire to acquire the Debtors’ assets as a consequence 
of the Back Up Sale Transaction. 

8. 

The Debtors goal in these cases is to utilize the liquidity provided by the DIP 

loans to maintain the going concern value of the Company while they seek a higher and better 

offer from a strategic investor. A vigorous marketing process has been initiated by Gordian and 

the Debtors believe that most if not all of their secured lenders fully support this process, which 

they expect will take somewhere from 60 – 90 days, and which includes a motion to approve bid 

procedures that contemplates further marketing, a bidding process and an auction. The Debtors 

expect to file the bid procedures motion shortly and will request a hearing on the bid procedures 

motion and will seek entry of the Back Up Sale Transaction Order within 21 days of the Petition 

Date. 

9. 

The Debtors have filed several First Day Pleadings that seek relief necessary to 

avoid immediate and irreparable harm to the Debtors as they pursue their overall financial 

restructuring by allowing them to continue their operations and minimize disruptions to their 

business that could otherwise result from the commencement of the chapter 11 cases.

25

Specifically, the First Day Pleadings seek relief allowing the Debtors to: (a) stabilize and 

maintain their business operations through, among other things, the use of post-petition financing 

and cash collateral; (b) limit disruption to the Debtors’ business by continuing the use of their 

prepetition cash management system; (c) preserve their going concern value by obtaining 

approval to pay wages and salaries earned in the pre petition period, and (d) establish certain 

administrative procedures to facilitate an orderly transition into, and uninterrupted operations 

throughout, the chapter 11 process. 

B. 

PERSONAL BACKGROUND 

10. 

I had more than 20 years of finance and operations experience prior to assuming 
my role as CFO at Xtreme Power. Prior to joining Xtreme Power, I spent one year as CFO and 
COO at Open Labs, Inc. Prior to that, I spent 17 years at Dell Inc., serving in finance and 
operations roles. Prior to joining Dell, I served five years at Price Waterhouse Houston in the 
audit practice. I assumed my duties as CFO of the Xtreme Power Companies on November 17, 
2010. 

C. 

THE DEBTORS‘ ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 

11. 

The Debtors are Xtreme Power Inc. (“XPI”), Xtreme Power Systems, LLC 

(“XPS”), and Xtreme Power Grove, LLC (“XPG”) (collectively referred to as “Debtors” or 

“Xtreme Power”). XPI (a Delaware Corporation) is 100% owner of XPS (a Texas Limited 

Liability Company), and XPG (a Delaware Limited Liability Company). XPI also owns 25% of 

XDT, LLC (a Delaware Limited Liability Company), which is a non operating company and is 

not a Debtor. 

D. 

THE DEBTORS’ BUSINESS

12. 

Founded in November 2006, Xtreme Power designs, installs, and monitors energy 

storage and power management systems.3 The Debtors are leaders in the energy storage industry. 

Xtreme Power is headquartered in Kyle, Texas, with operations throughout the U.S. The 

powerpoint presentation attached hereto as Exhibit A was prepared by the Company to provide a 

general overview of its business. 

13. 

XPS has a staff of engineers and professionals who design and implement storage 

and power management systems specific to each customer’s need. Its customers are Independent 

Power Producers, Transmission and Distribution Utilities, and Commercial & Industrial End 

Users, among others. 

14. 

XPS’s dedicated staff is arguably its single most valuable asset, but unfortunately, 

the Debtor’s financial difficulties have mandated a series of staffing cutbacks, including reduced 

hours, salary cuts, layoffs, and furloughs. As part of the cutbacks, upper management has been 

working without pay. 

15. 

The Debtors manufacture and install battery and energy storage systems, and they 

also monitor and control the systems remotely from XPS’s facility in Kyle. XPS’s expertise 

allows it to ensure its systems integrate seamlessly with the power grids to which they are 

connected, and that the systems respond to and communicate with the grid and other external 

inputs as required by their customers. 

16. 

XPS implements its services with a wholly-owned software platform that it 

developed in-house called Xtreme Active Control Technology – “XACTTM.” XACT is a flexible 

and robust control platform capable of seamlessly integrating any battery technology with a

variety of electric power systems to command, monitor, and operate energy storage systems of 

any combination of power and duration. The XACT platform offers the following customer 

advantages, distinguishing it from all of its competitors: (a) provides multiple applications 

simultaneously; (b) prioritizes applications based on customer needs; (c) utilizes a distributed 

topology 

to command each system 

independently; 

(d) 

intelligent 

re-distribution of 

charge/discharge commands to optimize system performance; (e) full system response in less than 

50 milliseconds. XACT includes various supported products, including RAMP, RPM, PEAK, and 

BOOST, each of which is designed to satisfy a particular customer need. Importantly, XACT also 

allows XPS to remotely operate its storage installations from Kyle. 

17. 

XACT is proprietary and confidential, and while there is no patent for the overall 

XACT system, certain sub units of XACT may be protected by patent issued or pending. XACT, 

along with the Company’s engineers that write, maintain, and operate it, is the Company’s core 

competency and most valuable asset; however, because the XACT system was internally 

developed and the costs were not capitalized, it does not appear on the Company’s books as an 

asset, just as the value of the Company’s expert staff is not captured by normal accounting 

methods. 

18. 

XPG holds a license from Horizon Batteries, LLC to manufacture an advanced lead 

acid battery that Xtreme Power previously used in some of its energy storage systems and also 

sold to third parties. However, XPG shut down its battery manufacturing operations in early 2013 

and no longer manufactures or sells them. XPG had manufactured the batteries at a leased facility 

near the city of Grove, Oklahoma. There are several pending disputes between the Debtors and 

Horizon Batteries, which disputes, and potential for their resolution, are part of the reason for the 

Debtors’ bankruptcy cases.

19. 

XPI is primarily a holding company for XPS and XPG but also owns by way of 

assignment a portfolio of patents that were generated primarily by XPS, and is the owner of a $7 

million CD that is currently pledged to secure a letter of credit that stands as security for XPS’s 

performance with one of its customers. XPI is also owed inter-company accounts receivables by 

XPS and XPG of approximately $95 million. XPI has a fairly complex capital structure, having 

issued common stock, preferred stock, and convertible notes with warrants, all in private 

placements to sophisticated venture capital investors. XPI’s capital structure is explained in more 

detail below. 

E. 

FINANCING HISTORY 

20. 

Prior to the Debtors’ bankruptcy filing, one or more of the Debtors were parties to 

various debt instruments with lenders and investment groups (collectively, the “Prepetition 

Secured Lenders”). Below is a summary of the Debtors’ secured prepetition indebtedness. The 

Debtors are not waiving their right to challenge the validity or priority of any lien with respect 

to any of the lenders listed in the chart below.

It appears that only SVB and Horizon (on account of its prepetition indebtedness) 

have liens, security agreements, and perfected security interests in XPS in an approximately 

aggregate amount of $7.2 million. 
F. 

EVENTS LEADINGS TO THESE CHAPTER 11 CASES 


 

22. 

XPI is a privately held company. From 2009 through 2011 the Company 
experienced rapid growth, securing several large contracts for new systems. Xtreme Power was 

ranked number 15 on Inc. Magazine’s 500|5000 list of the fastest-growing private companies in 

the United States in 2012—the company’s second year in a row making the prestigious list—

based on Xtreme Power’s rapid three-year growth rate and 2011 revenues of $22.2 million. In 

2011, Xtreme Power had ranked 704th on the Inc. Magazine list. 

23. However, a slowdown in bookings and lower gross margins began impacting the 

2012 outlook, and although the Company remained a competitive bidder for a number of 

proposed projects, GAAP revenues for 2012 were eventually reported at -19%. 

24. Then on August 1, 2012, a fire occurred at the Kahuku Wind Farm in Hawaii in 

the building housing the battery energy storage system manufactured by the Company. The 

building and the energy storage system were destroyed by the fire. The root cause of that fire 

remains under investigation. Until such time as root cause is determined, it is not possible to 

determine what, if any, liability the Company may have as a result of this loss, for which the 

Company has insurance coverage. In any event, the Company believes publicity related to the 

fire has negatively impacted project bookings. 

25. The Company revised its business plan to reflect revenue and expense reductions 

consistent with market conditions, and began to look at restructuring its costs. At about the same 

time, the Company was pursuing its proposed Series D round of equity financing, but was unable

25

to generate sufficient interest, and so, to support the Company’s operational cash needs, the 

Company engaged in a series of bridge financings with convertible notes. Since 2011, the 

Company has raised approximately $50 million in this manner. 

26. By October 2013, various debt and lease agreements were in default and the 

Company was in default with its secured lenders on revenue and other operating covenants. The 

defaults were dealt with by another round of bridge financing, but the Company continued to 

forecast negative cash flow from operations, and the Company’s management and board of 

directors, who have closely monitored the impact of these conditions, determined to address 

potential alternatives with the assistance of various professionals and outside advisors, including 

Gordian Group, LLC (“Gordian Group”) and Roth Capital Partners, LLC. 

27. Several offers for purchase and financing arrangements were considered, and the 

Company was working with a large public company towards a transaction that the Company 

believed had potential to be a favorable, when the proposed purchaser withdrew from 

negotiations for reason unknown to the Company. Another large public company that had 

expressed interest in a transaction also notified the Company in December that it would not be 

pursuing the transaction. 

28. An attempt to obtain further bridge financing fell through in late December, and 

so in early January the Company’s Board determined that serious consideration must now be 

given to filing a Chapter 11 to protect the Company’s going concern value for a period of time 

long enough to effect a sale of the Company, an option that the board had been considering for 

several months. 

29. A number of lenders were approached for interim financing, and financing 

packages with two leading candidates were negotiated in earnest on a competitive basis. The 

Affidavit of Ken Hashman 

Page 13 

14-10096-hcm Doc#15 Filed 01/23/14 Entered 01/23/14 10:20:29 Main Document Pg 14 of

25

board chose to proceed with what it believes is the clearly superior proposal, which was a 

proposed interim financing that would permit the Company to continue its marketing efforts 

prior to a bankruptcy filing. However, the Company was informed late last week that the 

proposed lender would not proceed outside of bankruptcy. The Company went back to both 

potential lenders and after additional intensive negotiations arrived at the DIP lender/stalking 

horse arrangements with Horizon Financial that is being presented to the Court for approval. 

30. 

In the meantime, Gordian Group continued its efforts to secure a purchaser for the 

Company. According to Gordian Group, as of January 16 they had identified a universe of 81 

potential buyers, had contacted 43 and heard back from 32, sent out 28 “teasers”, have 15 parties 

signed up on confidentiality agreements to review company data, and have confirmed at least 5 

of those parties have already accessed the Company’s virtual data room. 

31. Several other events contributed to the Company’s decision to seek protection in 

Chapter 11. Many of the Company’s secured debt obligations had matured on December 31, 

2013. In early January, the Company received a demand letter from the lawyers for an investor 

for payment in full of the obligation that matured December 31. The Company’s two most 

senior secured lenders, Silicon Valley Bank and Horizon Financial, asked the Company to 

submit itself to an assignment for the benefit of Creditors in California, which management 

opposed. The Company’s operations team had become concerned about the Company’s ability 

to deliver project milestones on the Company’s currently booked projects. One of the 

Company’s production partners refused to commit to support that was needed for an ongoing 

project because of their expressed fears that the Company was facing financial difficulties and 

would be unable to meet its obligations.

32. On January 14, the Company received a notice of default from the lawyers for its 

landlord at its leased building at 1400 Goforth Road, although the landlord has given the 

Company verbal assurance that it does not intend to proceed in a manner damaging to the 

Company 

G. 

CURRENT FINANCIAL SITUATION 
33. As of the bankruptcy filing the Company is virtually out of cash. However, it has 
$4.8 million of awarded contracts in development, as well as one contract pending in Puerto Rico 
that if secured will result in bookings of $16 million, one in the US that would result in bookings 
of approximately $900 thousand, and one in the UK that would result in bookings of 
approximately $7 million. Debtors believe their bankruptcy filings and the processes 

contemplated will help them realize the potential for these contracts and thus enhance their going 

concern value. 

34. 

Over the last month, management has drastically reduced the employee head 

count, in incremental steps, to preserve capital, along with implementing pay cuts to regular 

employees an total deferment of compensation for senior management. After paying the 

retainers to bankruptcy and special counsel that they require to file the Company in Chapter 11 

and assist a sale transaction, the Company has only about $34,000 in cash. 

H. 

NEED FOR FIRST DAY RELIEF 
35. Contemporaneously herewith, the Debtors filed a number of motions, all 
described below (the “First Day Pleadings”), seeking orders granting various forms of relief 
intended to stabilize the Debtors’ business operations, facilitate the efficient administration of the 
chapter 11 cases, and which are necessary to avoid the immediate and irreparable harm to the 
Debtors. I believe that the relief requested in each of the First Day Pleadings is in the best

Page 15 

14-10096-hcm Doc#15 Filed 01/23/14 Entered 01/23/14 10:20:29 Main Document Pg 16 of

25

interests of the Debtors’ estates, their creditors, and all other parties in interest, and will enable 
the Debtors to continue to operate their businesses in chapter 11 without disruption. Accordingly, 
on behalf of the Debtors, I respectfully submit that all should be approved. 

(a) 
 

Complex 
 Case 
 Treatment 

36. The Debtors have total debts of more than $10 million and there are more than 

fifty (50) parties in interest in these cases. 

Joint Administration 

(b) 
37. The Debtors request entry of orders in each of their cases directing the joint 
administration of these cases. The Debtors believe that many, if not most, of the motions, 
applications, and other pleadings filed in these chapter 11 cases will relate to relief sought jointly 
by all of the Debtors. For example, virtually all of the relief sought by the Debtors in the First 
Day Pleadings is sought on behalf of all of the Debtors. Counsel has explained to me that joint 
administration of the Debtors’ chapter 11 cases, for procedural purposes only, on a single docket, 
will ease the administrative burdens on the Court, and reduce the cost of prosecuting these cases, 
by allowing the Debtors’ cases to be administered as a single joint proceeding instead of 3 
independent chapter 11 cases. 


 

(c) 
 

Cash 
 Collateral 

38. Debtor XPS has only a small amount of cash collateral and the other Debtors have 

virtually none. The Debtors’ operations in Chapter 11 will be financed primarily through the 

DIP loan from Horizon. The only other entity with an interest in XPS’s cash collateral is SVB. 

Debtors believe that SVB will consent to its use of its cash collateral, but if it will not, requests 

that the Court permit it to use such cash collateral. 

Affidavit of Ken Hashman

14-10096-hcm Doc#15 Filed 01/23/14 Entered 01/23/14 10:20:29 Main Document Pg 17 of

25

39. The Debtor requires the ability to use cash and the proceeds of existing accounts 
receivable to maintain the operation of its businesses and preserve its value as a going concern. 
These essential items, however, constitute part of the collateral for the loans made to the Debtor 
under the Prepetition Loan Documents with SVB, and, therefore, may not be used in support of 
the Debtor's ongoing business activities absent compliance with Section 363 of the Bankruptcy 
Code. The Debtors have no other source of secured or unsecured borrowing that could replace 
the need for the use of this cash collateral. Without authorization to use the Cash Collateral 
under Section 363(c)(2)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtor would be left without a small, 
but important, source of working capital.

42. Debtor is aware of only four outstanding checks and will issue stop pay requests 

to the bank. 

43. XPI’s SAM Pledge Account is used solely as a holding account for a CD owned 

by XPI, which CD is pledged as collateral to SVB to secure a Letter of Credit (“LC”) in the 

amount of $7 million that the Bank issued on behalf of XPS to secure a contract obligation of 

XPS to Duke Energy. It is possible that XPS’s contract obligations to Duke Energy could 

exceed the face amount of the LC and the CD, although the eventual result depends on energy 

prices. Thus the Debtors reserve all their rights to further investigate the amount of the potential 

obligations and whether or not the CD may eventually be redeemed. However, because the LC 

is in place until December of 2017, and the CD is pledged as security for the LC and is in the 

possession of the Bank that issued the LC, the value of the CD is not currently available to the 

Debtors for use for any other purpose. 

44. Debtors utilize various forms and checks in the operation of their business, 

although most of the Debtor’s business is conducted electronically via e mail, and in the case of 
banking, via wire transfers.

45. 

Schedules Extension, Consolidated Matrix, and Consolidated List of 30 
Largest Unsecured Creditors 
The Debtors request an additional 20 days to file their schedules of assets and 
liabilities, schedules of executory contracts and unexpired leases, and statements of financial 
affairs (collectively, the “Schedules and Statements”). 

46. 

I am the sole primary source of most of the information needed by Debtors’ 
counsel to prepare the Schedules and Statements, and I am currently overwhelmed with requests 
for information, requests for preparation of budgets, and all the other day to day and hour to hour 
information needed to prepare the bankruptcy filings, respond to inquiries from the proposed DIP 

Affidavit of Ken Hashman

25

lender and other creditors and potential investors and purchasers, not to mention continuing to 
manage the ongoing financial affairs of an operating business, it is simply impossible for me to 
locate, provide to counsel, and review for accuracy in 14 days all the data that goes into the 
Schedules and Statements. 

47. While the Debtors, with the help of their attorneys, are diligently preparing the 
Schedules and remaining Statements, the Debtors’ primary focus thus far has been preparing for 
the filing of their chapter 11 cases, securing DIP financing, and maintaining momentum in its 
sale process. In view of the amount of work entailed in completing the Schedules and 
Statements and the competing demands upon the Debtors’ employees and professionals to assist 
in efforts to stabilize business operations during the initial postpetition period, the Debtors will 
not be able to complete the Schedules and all of the Statements properly and accurately either 
within the required fourteen-day time period provided for under Bankruptcy Rule 1007(c) or by 
the Petition Date, as respectively required. 

48. 

Accordingly, the Debtors request that the deadlines by which the Debtors must 
file their Schedules and Statements be extended by sixteen days, to February 21, 2014. In view 
of the above, the amount of information that must be assembled and analyzed, and the significant 
amount of employee time that must be devoted to complete the Schedules and Statements, ample 
cause exists for the requested extension. 
(g) DIP Financing Motion 
49. 

The Debtors seek authority to obtain post-petition financing in the aggregate 

amount of up to $2.5 million (the “DIP Availability” or “DIP Credit Facility”), subject to the 

terms and conditions of the Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement (the “DIP Credit Agreement” 

Affidavit of Ken Hashman 

Page 19 

14-10096-hcm Doc#15 Filed 01/23/14 Entered 01/23/14 10:20:29 Main Document Pg 20 of

25

and collectively with all agreements, documents, and instruments delivered or executed in 
connection therewith, the “Financing Documents”) between the Debtors and Horizon. 

50. 

XPS’s payroll is due on Thursday, January 23, 2014, and it cannot be made absent 

the Initial DIP Availability funding. Thus, the Debtors requested that the Court schedule the 

Interim Hearing to consider this motion on January 23, 2014, and the Court granted the request. 

It is anticipated that the proposed the Initial DIP Credit Facility will enable the Debtors to pay 

their ongoing operating expenses and the administrative claims of the estates through the end of 

February. If applicable, the remaining DIP Availability or financing provided by the Substitute 
DIP Lender will provide sufficient funds to conduct a competitive § 363 sale process. 

51. 

The terms and conditions of the DIP Credit Facility shall be embodied in a final 

order and the DIP Credit Agreement. The Debtors will seek a hearing on the Final DIP Facility 

Order within 21 days. A summary of the terms of the proposed DIP Credit Facility can be found 
in the DIP Financing Motion. 

52. 

The Debtors have been unable to procure the credit required to fund the 

administration of their estates in the form of unsecured credit on better terms than those offered 

by the DIP Lender. The Debtors, therefore, have no choice but to seek credit on a secured basis 

in exchange for the granting of liens on the DIP Collateral. 

53. 

Since prior to the commencement of these cases, the Debtors have been 

confronted with the significant challenge of securing funding to pay for the expenses of the 

operation of their businesses as well as for the administration of their estates. If the Debtors 

cannot secure funding to pay payroll taxes, salaries, and other estate expenses, then the Debtors 

cannot reasonably accomplish a sale of their business or otherwise successfully reorganize. 

Affidavit of Ken Hashman 

Page 20 

14-10096-hcm Doc#15 Filed 01/23/14 Entered 01/23/14 10:20:29 Main Document Pg 21 of

25

54. 

The Debtors have negotiated the terms of this DIP Credit Facility in good faith 

and at arm’s-length to fund the administrative expenses of the Debtors’ estates (i) through the 

end of February if the Debtors do not obtain a Substitute Stalking Horse Bidder or (ii) through 

the end of the section 363 sale process (subject to certain deadlines) if the Debtors do obtain a 

Substitute Stalking Horse Bidder. The proposed post-petition financing will ensure that the 

Debtors have the funds necessary to pay taxes and salaries, and to the extent possible, to preserve 

the Debtors’ going concern value through the sale process. The Debtors’ regular cash flow is not 

sufficient to pay the ongoing operating and administrative expenses. Accordingly, the Debtors 

have been unable to obtain funds on an unsecured basis. 

55. 

Furthermore, the Debtors with the assistance of Gordian Group have diligently 

sought financing from sources other than the DIP Lender. The Debtors believe that in today’s 

market, debtor-in-possession or “DIP” financing on the same or similar terms of the DIP Credit 

Facility is not available from traditional third-party institutional lenders. The terms of the only 

other prospective lender’s financing proposal was not, in the Debtors’ business judgment, on 

better terms. After diligent efforts, the Debtors’ best business judgment is that the DIP Lender is 
the best source of financing and the DIP Credit Facility is on the best terms for these Debtors.

Employee Wages and Benefits 
As of the Petition Date, XPS had approximately 37 regular full-time and part-time 
employees out of a workforce that had been approximately 70 in December and approximately 
50 earlier this month. XPG has one part time employee and XPI has none. Additional furloughs 
may be necessary due to budget constraints.
