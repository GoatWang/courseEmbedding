1Forbes rankings are the opinion of SHOOK Research and are based on advisor interviews, client retention, industry experience, compliance record, assets under management and revenue generated for the firm. Investment performance is not considered. Advisors do not pay to be in the ranking.
2According to Barron's, "The formula [used] to rank advisors has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of the advisor's practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by each client's risk tolerance. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record." The rankings are based on the universe of applications submitted to Barron's. The selection process begins with a nomination and application provided to Barron's. Principals of Edelman Financial Services, LLC self-nominated the firm and submitted quantitative and qualitative information to Barron's as requested. Barron's reviewed and considered this information, which resulted in the rankings on Aug. 27, 2012/Aug. 28, 2010/Aug. 31, 2009.

Advice. Beyond investing.









For some of life’s questions, you’re not alone





























Together we can find an answer
To make the right choices you need to ask the right questions. And because your life keeps changing, we keep on asking. Let’s have a conversation to discover where you are today and uncover new opportunities to pursue the future you want.
Advice for the life you lead
Advice that’s all about you and what you need is what UBS does best. It starts with a plan that we develop together—as part of a strategy for managing your wealth and pursuing your personal goals for every part of your life, at every stage of your life. It’s what we call: Advice. Beyond investing.

First Command Financial Services - Mission




































Mission
The seeds of First Command’s commitment to serving the financial planning needs of American military families were planted in the early 1950s, when Air Force Lt. Col. Carroll Payne had the occasion to work closely with the families of several crew members killed in a training flight. Saddened by the survivors’ financial difficulties, Lt. Col. Payne began thinking about how he might be able to help other military families avoid the same fate. In 1958, he began laying the groundwork for the company that would become First Command.
First Command’s mission – coaching those who serve in their pursuit of financial security – hasn’t really changed in the ensuing years. Our focus continues to be on building trusting Client-Advisor relationships by meeting face-to-face with servicemembers, federal employees and their families to learn what’s important to them, helping them establish meaningful and specific goals that reflect their values, and then constructing comprehensive financial plans for protecting their loved ones and pursuing their goals.
Just as Lt. Col. Payne envisioned more than half a century ago, First Command is steadfastly committed to helping those who serve get their financial lives squared away.

First Command Financial Services - Financial Planning




































Planning
Reducing debt. Building savings. Protecting your future. Pursuing your goals. These things are important to most of us. And they’re important to the hundreds of thousands First Command has served since 1958.
Taking the time to discover what matters most to you is the first step in developing a meaningful financial plan. That’s why we offer complimentary financial plans to active-duty military members. We know your motivation, commitment and confidence are greatest when your plan matches your values – what’s important to YOU.
Together, we’ll develop a plan that’s:

Personalized. We design a plan to address your values, priorities and goals.
Comprehensive. We recommend specific investment, insurance and banking services to help you pursue your goals.
Integrated. We clearly define and carefully balance relationships between each part of the plan.
Complementary. Our Advisors are expertly trained to understand your unique military and federal benefits and complement them with your financial plan.

Your financial plan will be your guide as you pursue your goals: Meeting your daily and monthly expenses. Funding a child’s education. Building resources for the future. Providing for your loved ones’ financial security.
A First Command Financial Advisor will get you started on a plan. Through a thoughtful process and a trusted relationship, we will consistently focus on what’s important to YOU.

History[edit]
Business Model[edit]
First Command provides personalized services through locally based trained and licensed Financial Advisors and through its Home Office in Fort Worth, Texas. The company offers advice on securities, with an emphasis on mutual funds, annuities, life insurance, and municipal funds (including Section 529 Plans). Through related companies it offers insurance and banking products and services.[2] As of December 31, 2009, First Command had more than 285,000 client families, $14.7 billion in managed assets, $51.7 billion in life insurance policies in force and $615 million in banking assets.[2]
The company has a long history of working with military officers. In 2007, Scott Spiker, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy was named CEO in an effort to turn the company into a premier fiduciary firm serving military families after sanctions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over 13 years ago (2004). The firm has refocused on full compliance with various laws and proudly serves those seeking financial planning advice.
First Command provides complimentary financial plans for all active duty U.S. military service members. Currently, there are more than 473 Financial Advisors at First Command, 71% of whom are veterans or military spouses. First Command states its Mission as “coaching those who serve in their pursuit of financial security.”[3]
Early years[edit]
First Command was founded in 1958 by Carroll Payne, a retired military officer who realized that military families needed assistance in planning for their financial futures. Payne wanted to create a company that recognized and dealt with the unique circumstances applicable to United States military personnel.[4]
The company began as a broker/dealer called United Services Investment Association Inc. (USIA), which later became United Services Planning Association Inc. (USPA). USIA’s membership in the NASD (now FINRA) was approved on Jan. 21, 1959.[5] In 1963, USPA began offering financial plans to its clients, designed to promote long-term saving and investing. Dollar cost averaging and a pay-yourself-first approach were also used to encourage clients to invest on a regular basis.[6] In the mid ‘60s, USPA expanded its product offerings to include life insurance, leading to the creation of the Independent Research Agency for Life Insurance, Inc. (IRA).[5]
In 1970, USPA and IRA began operating under the combined name of USPA&IRA, a name which remained in use for the next three decades.
International expansion and corporate growth[edit]
In 1979, the company opened its first office outside the continental U.S, in Hawaii; three years later international operations began with an office in Germany.[5] A charitable foundation, now known as the First Command Educational Foundation, began in 1983.[5]
Payne died in 1984 and was succeeded by Ralph Smith, who served as chairman and CEO until his retirement in December 1985. George Talley then served as chairman and CEO from 1986–1991.[5] During Talley's tenure, USPA&IRA grew to 500 advisors and exceeded 200,000 families.[6] Lamar Smith, company president and COO, was promoted to chairman and CEO in 1992.
First Command Bank opened for business on April 21, 1997. In less than six months, the bank was posting more than 100 new deposit accounts and 50 new loans weekly.[6] In 1998, USPA&IRA went “private,” transitioning from a C Corporation to an S Corporation and later, in 2002, become 100% employee owned.[5] USPA&IRA launched a tax services program in 2001.
Name change to First Command[edit]
USPA&IRA changed its name to First Command Financial Planning in 2001.[5] The company explained that it changed its name because:

We are sometimes confused with other companies that service the military and former military clientele and whose names also start with letters “US...”. There are several such companies, but none like us and we don’t want any confusion.[7]

Becoming Registered Investments Advisors[edit]
In anticipation of an SEC ruling requiring that all firms whose primary business is financial planning must become a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA), First Command filed with the SEC to become one in the spring of 2005. This requires their agents to obtain additional training and certifications. As RIAs, the agents could now use the term "Financial Advisors" as compared to "Registered Agents", with the former being held to a higher ethical standard.[8] The higher standards require agents to document every client interaction in great detail and apply due diligence to all investment recommendations to ensure they are in the best interests of the client.[9] The company no longer offers the controversial systematic investment plans.[1]
Recognition as FPA Alliance firm[edit]
In 2009, First Command was recognized in the financial planning industry as an FPA Alliance firm, one of only two companies ever to receive this elite recognition from the 27,000-member Financial Planning Association. In an April 2009 announcement, FPA President Richard Salmen said First Command was being recognized for its “commitment to professionalism in financial planning. … First Command has publicly demonstrated a commitment to putting their clients' interests first. The company has registered with the SEC as an investment adviser and all of its financial planners are registered as Investment Adviser Representatives under First Command's RIA. And, First Command has met the program requirements, including adherence to the principles of professionalism for FPA Alliance. The firm has a strong commitment to lifelong learning and leadership development." [10]
Partnerships[edit]
First Command has partnered with several organizations that support military veterans and their families. These include Hiring Our Heroes,[11] Project Sanctuary,[12] the Association of the United States Army,[13] the Marine Corps Marathon,[14] Army West Point Athletics,[15] and the Department of Defense Military Spouse Employment Partnership.[16]
Charity Involvement[edit]
First Command established the First Command Education Foundation (FCEF). The FCEF is a 501(c)(3) non-profit public charity dedicated to improving financial readiness through education and scholarship opportunities. FCEF has been providing its services since 1983.[17]
Corporate Structure[edit]
Leadership Team[edit]
Scott Spiker became the first Chief Executive Officer recruited from outside the company in September 2007 after holding top leadership positions  at Norwest Corp., RBC Dain Rauscher, Definity Health, Stanton Group and Destiny Health.[26] In 2017, Spiker was elected into a dual role as Chairman of the Board and CEO.[18] The rest of the board includes Mark D. Steffe as Executive Vice President and National Director of Advisor Operations, Michael F. Morrison as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Hugh A. Simpson as Executive Vice President of General Counsel and Secretary, W. David White as President of First Command Bank, Jill Lyttle as Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Leadership Development, Jerry Wackerhagen as Executive Vice President of Operations and Technology, and Luis A. Muniz, CFP® as Senior Vice President of Advisor Services.[19]
First Command Financial Behaviors Index[edit]
First Command has developed the First Command Financial Behaviors Index. It assesses trends among the American public's financial behaviors, intentions and attitudes through a monthly survey of approximately 530 U.S. consumers, ages 25–70, with annual household incomes of at least $50,000. The survey includes active-duty service members in pay grades E-6 and above.[20] Survey results are regularly reported on by national news organizations including the Wall Street Journal,[21] The New York Times,[22] McClatchy-Tribune News Service,[23] USA Today [24] and Financial Planning magazine [25]
Financial Planner Oath[edit]
In the Spring 2010 issue of First Command’s Journey magazine, the company reiterated its commitment to the FPA Alliance program with the introduction of The Financial Planner Oath.[26] Resembling in part the Hippocratic Oath, the document is intended help members of the financial planning industry publicly state their commitment to act in their client’s best interests at all times. The Financial Planner Oath [27] is provided to new First Command Financial Advisors as part of their training, and the document is made available online to financial planners at other firms free of charge as a public service.
Criticism and Controversy[edit]
In 2004, a New York Times investigative report by Diana B. Henriques named First Command as being one of several investment firms engaged in deceptive marketing of financial instruments aimed at military veterans.[28] On 15 December of that year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) determined that First Command had "willfully violated the Securities Act of 1933 Section 17(a)(2) dealing with inter-state fraud" in its marketing activities targeting veterans.[29] In particular, the SEC concluded that First Command had sold mutual fund investments to veterans termed "systematic plans" that bore very high sales charges termed "front-end sales loads", "by, in part, making misleading statements and omissions concerning, among other things: (a) comparisons between the systematic plan and other mutual fund investments; (b) the availability of the Thrift Savings Plan ("TSP"), which offers military investors many of the features of a systematic plan at lower costs; and (c) the efficacy of the front-end sales load in ensuring that investors remain committed to the systematic plan."[29]
In an independent investigation, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) charged First Command "with inappropriately confronting a customer who complained, failing to maintain e-mail, failing to maintain adequate supervisory systems and procedures and filing an inaccurate Form U-5 regulatory report".[30][31]
In December 2004, First Command entered into a $12 million settlement with the SEC and NASD without admitting guilt.[32] As part of the settlement, First Command agreed to offer restitution to all clients who had purchased and sold a systematic plan between 1999 and 2004, establishment of educational programs, and monitoring or prefiling.[33] People who had not terminated their systematic plan were not covered in the settlement. In September 2007, a California judge granted "Class Action" status to a 2005 lawsuit filed by systematic plan holders whose plans were active when the SEC issued its ruling on December 15, 2004.[34] In October 2008, attorneys for the plaintiffs sought court approval for a settlement.[35] The settlement was approved by the court in April 2009.
In 2004, the SEC report noted "The great majority of the firm's agents are former commissioned or non-commissioned military officers.”[29] The report was part of the proceedings in reaching a settlement with First Financial over charges that the firm "willfully violated the Securities Act of 1933 Section 17(a)(2) dealing with inter-state fraud" in marketing financial instruments to veterans.[29]
As of August 2006, Mary Shapiro, the NASD Vice-Chairman and President of Regulatory Policy and Oversight, continued to be critical of First Command, calling it an "unscrupulous organization" with an "awful" product. First Command's new president, Marty Durbin, responded to her criticism by stating, "It’s unfortunate that settling these charges still doesn’t mean it’s behind us. But it’s a futile effort to try to fight negative press and so we decided not to put a lot of energy that way."[36]
Following Controversy[edit]
In 2006, First Command introduced long term care and property and casualty insurance.[9] Later that year in December, First Command announced it had signed on as a corporate partner with the Bell Helicopter Armed Forces Bowl.[37]
In September 2007, Samantha Hilliard, First Command district advisor was featured in Newsweek. Hilliard received the 2007 realLIFEstories Client Service Award for her service to the widow of an Army officer killed in Iraq. The award was presented by the Life and Health Insurance Foundation for Education (LIFE), a non-profit group dedicated to providing the public with information and education on life, disability, long-term care and health insurance.[38]
On July 4, 2008, ABC’s Good Morning America featured a story on a First Command sponsored charity the Package Brigade that sends care packages to troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.[39] That same summer, the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve honored First Command with the Patriotic Employer Award, which is presented to companies and individuals for contributing to national security and protecting liberty and freedom by supporting employee participation in America’s National Guard and Reserve force.[40]
Current Operations[edit]
First Command Financial Services, Inc. announced In June 2013 that it is offering banking support to its clients who have been impacted by the Black Forest Fire near Colorado Springs.[41] In February 2015, with the threat of a government-funding crisis, First Command Financial Services offered to cover Coast Guard pay in the event of a funding crisis.[42] With a new military retirement system being enforced, First Command’s CEO Scott Spiker offered his perspective to the Spring 2016 issue of Journey “I believe there are legitimate concerns about whether this structural reform of military retirement will really be in the long-term best interests of future service members,” Spiker said. “It almost assuredly will not be in the long-term best interests of those service members who fail to grasp the importance of taking full advantage of the Thrift Savings Plan and making smart, informed decisions about the new lump sum bonus opportunities and other key military benefits. This is not, in other words, a time for service members and their families to passively assume that their financial future is set.”[43]
Awards and Recognitions[edit]

In December, 2016 First Command Financial Services was ranked as one of the Best Places to Work in Texas by Texas Monthly, the Texas Association of Business, Texas Society for Human Resource Management and Best Companies Group.[44]
In August, 2016, First Command Financial Services was awarded the Silver Bowl Award for the Best Use of Social for Recruiting by LIMRA and LOMA.[45]
In November 2015, First Command Financial Services was named a top employer of military veterans and spouses by Victory Media, publisher of G.I. Jobs and Military Spouse magazines.[46]
In January 2016, Fort Worth Business Named First Command Financial Services as the Best Large Company to work for in Fort Worth.[47]
In May 2016, First Command Financial Services won the Most Valuable Employers (MVE) for Military by CivilianJobs.com.[48]

In 2007, Scott Spiker, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy was named CEO in an effort to turn the company into a premier fiduciary firm serving military families after sanctions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over 13 years ago (2004). The firm has refocused on full compliance with various laws and proudly serves those seeking financial planning advice.
First Command provides complimentary financial plans for all active duty U.S. military service members. Currently, there are more than 473 Financial Advisors at First Command, 71% of whom are veterans or military spouses. First Command states its Mission as “coaching those who serve in their pursuit of financial security.”[3]
Early years[edit]
First Command was founded in 1958 by Carroll Payne, a retired military officer who realized that military families needed assistance in planning for their financial futures. Payne wanted to create a company that recognized and dealt with the unique circumstances applicable to United States military personnel.[4]
The company began as a broker/dealer called United Services Investment Association Inc. (USIA), which later became United Services Planning Association Inc. (USPA). USIA’s membership in the NASD (now FINRA) was approved on Jan. 21, 1959.[5] In 1963, USPA began offering financial plans to its clients, designed to promote long-term saving and investing. Dollar cost averaging and a pay-yourself-first approach were also used to encourage clients to invest on a regular basis.[6] In the mid ‘60s, USPA expanded its product offerings to include life insurance, leading to the creation of the Independent Research Agency for Life Insurance, Inc. (IRA).[5]
In 1970, USPA and IRA began operating under the combined name of USPA&IRA, a name which remained in use for the next three decades.
International expansion and corporate growth[edit]
In 1979, the company opened its first office outside the continental U.S, in Hawaii; three years later international operations began with an office in Germany.[5] A charitable foundation, now known as the First Command Educational Foundation, began in 1983.[5]
Payne died in 1984 and was succeeded by Ralph Smith, who served as chairman and CEO until his retirement in December 1985. George Talley then served as chairman and CEO from 1986–1991.[5] During Talley's tenure, USPA&IRA grew to 500 advisors and exceeded 200,000 families.[6] Lamar Smith, company president and COO, was promoted to chairman and CEO in 1992.
First Command Bank opened for business on April 21, 1997. In less than six months, the bank was posting more than 100 new deposit accounts and 50 new loans weekly.[6] In 1998, USPA&IRA went “private,” transitioning from a C Corporation to an S Corporation and later, in 2002, become 100% employee owned.[5] USPA&IRA launched a tax services program in 2001.
Name change to First Command[edit]
USPA&IRA changed its name to First Command Financial Planning in 2001.[5] The company explained that it changed its name because:

We are sometimes confused with other companies that service the military and former military clientele and whose names also start with letters “US...”. There are several such companies, but none like us and we don’t want any confusion.[7]

Becoming Registered Investments Advisors[edit]
In anticipation of an SEC ruling requiring that all firms whose primary business is financial planning must become a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA), First Command filed with the SEC to become one in the spring of 2005. This requires their agents to obtain additional training and certifications. As RIAs, the agents could now use the term "Financial Advisors" as compared to "Registered Agents", with the former being held to a higher ethical standard.[8] The higher standards require agents to document every client interaction in great detail and apply due diligence to all investment recommendations to ensure they are in the best interests of the client.[9] The company no longer offers the controversial systematic investment plans.[1]
Recognition as FPA Alliance firm[edit]
In 2009, First Command was recognized in the financial planning industry as an FPA Alliance firm, one of only two companies ever to receive this elite recognition from the 27,000-member Financial Planning Association. In an April 2009 announcement, FPA President Richard Salmen said First Command was being recognized for its “commitment to professionalism in financial planning. … First Command has publicly demonstrated a commitment to putting their clients' interests first. The company has registered with the SEC as an investment adviser and all of its financial planners are registered as Investment Adviser Representatives under First Command's RIA. And, First Command has met the program requirements, including adherence to the principles of professionalism for FPA Alliance. The firm has a strong commitment to lifelong learning and leadership development." [10]
Partnerships[edit]
First Command has partnered with several organizations that support military veterans and their families. These include Hiring Our Heroes,[11] Project Sanctuary,[12] the Association of the United States Army,[13] the Marine Corps Marathon,[14] Army West Point Athletics,[15] and the Department of Defense Military Spouse Employment Partnership.[16]
Charity Involvement[edit]
First Command established the First Command Education Foundation (FCEF). The FCEF is a 501(c)(3) non-profit public charity dedicated to improving financial readiness through education and scholarship opportunities. FCEF has been providing its services since 1983.[17]
Corporate Structure[edit]
Leadership Team[edit]
Scott Spiker became the first Chief Executive Officer recruited from outside the company in September 2007 after holding top leadership positions  at Norwest Corp., RBC Dain Rauscher, Definity Health, Stanton Group and Destiny Health.[26] In 2017, Spiker was elected into a dual role as Chairman of the Board and CEO.[18] The rest of the board includes Mark D. Steffe as Executive Vice President and National Director of Advisor Operations, Michael F. Morrison as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Hugh A. Simpson as Executive Vice President of General Counsel and Secretary, W. David White as President of First Command Bank, Jill Lyttle as Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Leadership Development, Jerry Wackerhagen as Executive Vice President of Operations and Technology, and Luis A. Muniz, CFP® as Senior Vice President of Advisor Services.[19]
First Command Financial Behaviors Index[edit]
First Command has developed the First Command Financial Behaviors Index. It assesses trends among the American public's financial behaviors, intentions and attitudes through a monthly survey of approximately 530 U.S. consumers, ages 25–70, with annual household incomes of at least $50,000. The survey includes active-duty service members in pay grades E-6 and above.[20] Survey results are regularly reported on by national news organizations including the Wall Street Journal,[21] The New York Times,[22] McClatchy-Tribune News Service,[23] USA Today [24] and Financial Planning magazine [25]
Financial Planner Oath[edit]
In the Spring 2010 issue of First Command’s Journey magazine, the company reiterated its commitment to the FPA Alliance program with the introduction of The Financial Planner Oath.[26] Resembling in part the Hippocratic Oath, the document is intended help members of the financial planning industry publicly state their commitment to act in their client’s best interests at all times. The Financial Planner Oath [27] is provided to new First Command Financial Advisors as part of their training, and the document is made available online to financial planners at other firms free of charge as a public service.
Criticism and Controversy[edit]
In 2004, a New York Times investigative report by Diana B. Henriques named First Command as being one of several investment firms engaged in deceptive marketing of financial instruments aimed at military veterans.[28] On 15 December of that year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) determined that First Command had "willfully violated the Securities Act of 1933 Section 17(a)(2) dealing with inter-state fraud" in its marketing activities targeting veterans.[29] In particular, the SEC concluded that First Command had sold mutual fund investments to veterans termed "systematic plans" that bore very high sales charges termed "front-end sales loads", "by, in part, making misleading statements and omissions concerning, among other things: (a) comparisons between the systematic plan and other mutual fund investments; (b) the availability of the Thrift Savings Plan ("TSP"), which offers military investors many of the features of a systematic plan at lower costs; and (c) the efficacy of the front-end sales load in ensuring that investors remain committed to the systematic plan."[29]
In an independent investigation, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) charged First Command "with inappropriately confronting a customer who complained, failing to maintain e-mail, failing to maintain adequate supervisory systems and procedures and filing an inaccurate Form U-5 regulatory report".[30][31]
In December 2004, First Command entered into a $12 million settlement with the SEC and NASD without admitting guilt.[32] As part of the settlement, First Command agreed to offer restitution to all clients who had purchased and sold a systematic plan between 1999 and 2004, establishment of educational programs, and monitoring or prefiling.[33] People who had not terminated their systematic plan were not covered in the settlement. In September 2007, a California judge granted "Class Action" status to a 2005 lawsuit filed by systematic plan holders whose plans were active when the SEC issued its ruling on December 15, 2004.[34] In October 2008, attorneys for the plaintiffs sought court approval for a settlement.[35] The settlement was approved by the court in April 2009.
In 2004, the SEC report noted "The great majority of the firm's agents are former commissioned or non-commissioned military officers.”[29] The report was part of the proceedings in reaching a settlement with First Financial over charges that the firm "willfully violated the Securities Act of 1933 Section 17(a)(2) dealing with inter-state fraud" in marketing financial instruments to veterans.[29]
As of August 2006, Mary Shapiro, the NASD Vice-Chairman and President of Regulatory Policy and Oversight, continued to be critical of First Command, calling it an "unscrupulous organization" with an "awful" product. First Command's new president, Marty Durbin, responded to her criticism by stating, "It’s unfortunate that settling these charges still doesn’t mean it’s behind us. But it’s a futile effort to try to fight negative press and so we decided not to put a lot of energy that way."[36]
Following Controversy[edit]
In 2006, First Command introduced long term care and property and casualty insurance.[9] Later that year in December, First Command announced it had signed on as a corporate partner with the Bell Helicopter Armed Forces Bowl.[37]
In September 2007, Samantha Hilliard, First Command district advisor was featured in Newsweek. Hilliard received the 2007 realLIFEstories Client Service Award for her service to the widow of an Army officer killed in Iraq. The award was presented by the Life and Health Insurance Foundation for Education (LIFE), a non-profit group dedicated to providing the public with information and education on life, disability, long-term care and health insurance.[38]
On July 4, 2008, ABC’s Good Morning America featured a story on a First Command sponsored charity the Package Brigade that sends care packages to troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.[39] That same summer, the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve honored First Command with the Patriotic Employer Award, which is presented to companies and individuals for contributing to national security and protecting liberty and freedom by supporting employee participation in America’s National Guard and Reserve force.[40]
Current Operations[edit]
First Command Financial Services, Inc. announced In June 2013 that it is offering banking support to its clients who have been impacted by the Black Forest Fire near Colorado Springs.[41] In February 2015, with the threat of a government-funding crisis, First Command Financial Services offered to cover Coast Guard pay in the event of a funding crisis.[42] With a new military retirement system being enforced, First Command’s CEO Scott Spiker offered his perspective to the Spring 2016 issue of Journey “I believe there are legitimate concerns about whether this structural reform of military retirement will really be in the long-term best interests of future service members,” Spiker said. “It almost assuredly will not be in the long-term best interests of those service members who fail to grasp the importance of taking full advantage of the Thrift Savings Plan and making smart, informed decisions about the new lump sum bonus opportunities and other key military benefits. This is not, in other words, a time for service members and their families to passively assume that their financial future is set.”[43]
Awards and Recognitions[edit]

In December, 2016 First Command Financial Services was ranked as one of the Best Places to Work in Texas by Texas Monthly, the Texas Association of Business, Texas Society for Human Resource Management and Best Companies Group.[44]
In August, 2016, First Command Financial Services was awarded the Silver Bowl Award for the Best Use of Social for Recruiting by LIMRA and LOMA.[45]
In November 2015, First Command Financial Services was named a top employer of military veterans and spouses by Victory Media, publisher of G.I. Jobs and Military Spouse magazines.[46]
In January 2016, Fort Worth Business Named First Command Financial Services as the Best Large Company to work for in Fort Worth.[47]
In May 2016, First Command Financial Services won the Most Valuable Employers (MVE) for Military by CivilianJobs.com.[48]

Henriques named First Command as being one of several investment firms engaged in deceptive marketing of financial instruments aimed at military veterans.[28] On 15 December of that year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) determined that First Command had "willfully violated the Securities Act of 1933 Section 17(a)(2) dealing with inter-state fraud" in its marketing activities targeting veterans.[29] In particular, the SEC concluded that First Command had sold mutual fund investments to veterans termed "systematic plans" that bore very high sales charges termed "front-end sales loads", "by, in part, making misleading statements and omissions concerning, among other things: (a) comparisons between the systematic plan and other mutual fund investments; (b) the availability of the Thrift Savings Plan ("TSP"), which offers military investors many of the features of a systematic plan at lower costs; and (c) the efficacy of the front-end sales load in ensuring that investors remain committed to the systematic plan."[29]
In an independent investigation, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) charged First Command "with inappropriately confronting a customer who complained, failing to maintain e-mail, failing to maintain adequate supervisory systems and procedures and filing an inaccurate Form U-5 regulatory report".[30][31]
In December 2004, First Command entered into a $12 million settlement with the SEC and NASD without admitting guilt.[32] As part of the settlement, First Command agreed to offer restitution to all clients who had purchased and sold a systematic plan between 1999 and 2004, establishment of educational programs, and monitoring or prefiling.[33] People who had not terminated their systematic plan were not covered in the settlement. In September 2007, a California judge granted "Class Action" status to a 2005 lawsuit filed by systematic plan holders whose plans were active when the SEC issued its ruling on December 15, 2004.[34] In October 2008, attorneys for the plaintiffs sought court approval for a settlement.[35] The settlement was approved by the court in April 2009.
In 2004, the SEC report noted "The great majority of the firm's agents are former commissioned or non-commissioned military officers.”[29] The report was part of the proceedings in reaching a settlement with First Financial over charges that the firm "willfully violated the Securities Act of 1933 Section 17(a)(2) dealing with inter-state fraud" in marketing financial instruments to veterans.[29]
As of August 2006, Mary Shapiro, the NASD Vice-Chairman and President of Regulatory Policy and Oversight, continued to be critical of First Command, calling it an "unscrupulous organization" with an "awful" product. First Command's new president, Marty Durbin, responded to her criticism by stating, "It’s unfortunate that settling these charges still doesn’t mean it’s behind us. But it’s a futile effort to try to fight negative press and so we decided not to put a lot of energy that way."[36]
Following Controversy[edit]
In 2006, First Command introduced long term care and property and casualty insurance.[9] Later that year in December, First Command announced it had signed on as a corporate partner with the Bell Helicopter Armed Forces Bowl.[37]
In September 2007, Samantha Hilliard, First Command district advisor was featured in Newsweek. Hilliard received the 2007 realLIFEstories Client Service Award for her service to the widow of an Army officer killed in Iraq. The award was presented by the Life and Health Insurance Foundation for Education (LIFE), a non-profit group dedicated to providing the public with information and education on life, disability, long-term care and health insurance.[38]
On July 4, 2008, ABC’s Good Morning America featured a story on a First Command sponsored charity the Package Brigade that sends care packages to troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.[39] That same summer, the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve honored First Command with the Patriotic Employer Award, which is presented to companies and individuals for contributing to national security and protecting liberty and freedom by supporting employee participation in America’s National Guard and Reserve force.[40]
Current Operations[edit]
First Command Financial Services, Inc. announced In June 2013 that it is offering banking support to its clients who have been impacted by the Black Forest Fire near Colorado Springs.[41] In February 2015, with the threat of a government-funding crisis, First Command Financial Services offered to cover Coast Guard pay in the event of a funding crisis.[42] With a new military retirement system being enforced, First Command’s CEO Scott Spiker offered his perspective to the Spring 2016 issue of Journey “I believe there are legitimate concerns about whether this structural reform of military retirement will really be in the long-term best interests of future service members,” Spiker said. “It almost assuredly will not be in the long-term best interests of those service members who fail to grasp the importance of taking full advantage of the Thrift Savings Plan and making smart, informed decisions about the new lump sum bonus opportunities and other key military benefits. This is not, in other words, a time for service members and their families to passively assume that their financial future is set.”[43]
Awards and Recognitions[edit]

In December, 2016 First Command Financial Services was ranked as one of the Best Places to Work in Texas by Texas Monthly, the Texas Association of Business, Texas Society for Human Resource Management and Best Companies Group.[44]
In August, 2016, First Command Financial Services was awarded the Silver Bowl Award for the Best Use of Social for Recruiting by LIMRA and LOMA.[45]
In November 2015, First Command Financial Services was named a top employer of military veterans and spouses by Victory Media, publisher of G.I. Jobs and Military Spouse magazines.[46]
In January 2016, Fort Worth Business Named First Command Financial Services as the Best Large Company to work for in Fort Worth.[47]

History[edit]
Business Model[edit]
First Command provides personalized services through locally based trained and licensed Financial Advisors and through its Home Office in Fort Worth, Texas. The company offers advice on securities, with an emphasis on mutual funds, annuities, life insurance, and municipal funds (including Section 529 Plans). Through related companies it offers insurance and banking products and services.[2] As of December 31, 2009, First Command had more than 285,000 client families, $14.7 billion in managed assets, $51.7 billion in life insurance policies in force and $615 million in banking assets.[2]
The company has a long history of working with military officers. In 2007, Scott Spiker, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy was named CEO in an effort to turn the company into a premier fiduciary firm serving military families after sanctions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over 13 years ago (2004). The firm has refocused on full compliance with various laws and proudly serves those seeking financial planning advice.
First Command provides complimentary financial plans for all active duty U.S. military service members. Currently, there are more than 473 Financial Advisors at First Command, 71% of whom are veterans or military spouses. First Command states its Mission as “coaching those who serve in their pursuit of financial security.”[3]
Early years[edit]
First Command was founded in 1958 by Carroll Payne, a retired military officer who realized that military families needed assistance in planning for their financial futures. Payne wanted to create a company that recognized and dealt with the unique circumstances applicable to United States military personnel.[4]
The company began as a broker/dealer called United Services Investment Association Inc. (USIA), which later became United Services Planning Association Inc. (USPA). USIA’s membership in the NASD (now FINRA) was approved on Jan. 21, 1959.[5] In 1963, USPA began offering financial plans to its clients, designed to promote long-term saving and investing. Dollar cost averaging and a pay-yourself-first approach were also used to encourage clients to invest on a regular basis.[6] In the mid ‘60s, USPA expanded its product offerings to include life insurance, leading to the creation of the Independent Research Agency for Life Insurance, Inc. (IRA).[5]
In 1970, USPA and IRA began operating under the combined name of USPA&IRA, a name which remained in use for the next three decades.
International expansion and corporate growth[edit]
In 1979, the company opened its first office outside the continental U.S, in Hawaii; three years later international operations began with an office in Germany.[5] A charitable foundation, now known as the First Command Educational Foundation, began in 1983.[5]
Payne died in 1984 and was succeeded by Ralph Smith, who served as chairman and CEO until his retirement in December 1985. George Talley then served as chairman and CEO from 1986–1991.[5] During Talley's tenure, USPA&IRA grew to 500 advisors and exceeded 200,000 families.[6] Lamar Smith, company president and COO, was promoted to chairman and CEO in 1992.
First Command Bank opened for business on April 21, 1997. In less than six months, the bank was posting more than 100 new deposit accounts and 50 new loans weekly.[6] In 1998, USPA&IRA went “private,” transitioning from a C Corporation to an S Corporation and later, in 2002, become 100% employee owned.[5] USPA&IRA launched a tax services program in 2001.
Name change to First Command[edit]
USPA&IRA changed its name to First Command Financial Planning in 2001.[5] The company explained that it changed its name because:

We are sometimes confused with other companies that service the military and former military clientele and whose names also start with letters “US...”. There are several such companies, but none like us and we don’t want any confusion.[7]

Becoming Registered Investments Advisors[edit]
In anticipation of an SEC ruling requiring that all firms whose primary business is financial planning must become a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA), First Command filed with the SEC to become one in the spring of 2005. This requires their agents to obtain additional training and certifications. As RIAs, the agents could now use the term "Financial Advisors" as compared to "Registered Agents", with the former being held to a higher ethical standard.[8] The higher standards require agents to document every client interaction in great detail and apply due diligence to all investment recommendations to ensure they are in the best interests of the client.[9] The company no longer offers the controversial systematic investment plans.[1]
Recognition as FPA Alliance firm[edit]
In 2009, First Command was recognized in the financial planning industry as an FPA Alliance firm, one of only two companies ever to receive this elite recognition from the 27,000-member Financial Planning Association. In an April 2009 announcement, FPA President Richard Salmen said First Command was being recognized for its “commitment to professionalism in financial planning. … First Command has publicly demonstrated a commitment to putting their clients' interests first. The company has registered with the SEC as an investment adviser and all of its financial planners are registered as Investment Adviser Representatives under First Command's RIA. And, First Command has met the program requirements, including adherence to the principles of professionalism for FPA Alliance. The firm has a strong commitment to lifelong learning and leadership development." [10]
Partnerships[edit]
First Command has partnered with several organizations that support military veterans and their families. These include Hiring Our Heroes,[11] Project Sanctuary,[12] the Association of the United States Army,[13] the Marine Corps Marathon,[14] Army West Point Athletics,[15] and the Department of Defense Military Spouse Employment Partnership.[16]
Charity Involvement[edit]
First Command established the First Command Education Foundation (FCEF). The FCEF is a 501(c)(3) non-profit public charity dedicated to improving financial readiness through education and scholarship opportunities. FCEF has been providing its services since 1983.[17]
Corporate Structure[edit]
Leadership Team[edit]
Scott Spiker became the first Chief Executive Officer recruited from outside the company in September 2007 after holding top leadership positions  at Norwest Corp., RBC Dain Rauscher, Definity Health, Stanton Group and Destiny Health.[26] In 2017, Spiker was elected into a dual role as Chairman of the Board and CEO.[18] The rest of the board includes Mark D. Steffe as Executive Vice President and National Director of Advisor Operations, Michael F. Morrison as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Hugh A. Simpson as Executive Vice President of General Counsel and Secretary, W. David White as President of First Command Bank, Jill Lyttle as Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Leadership Development, Jerry Wackerhagen as Executive Vice President of Operations and Technology, and Luis A. Muniz, CFP® as Senior Vice President of Advisor Services.[19]
First Command Financial Behaviors Index[edit]
First Command has developed the First Command Financial Behaviors Index. It assesses trends among the American public's financial behaviors, intentions and attitudes through a monthly survey of approximately 530 U.S. consumers, ages 25–70, with annual household incomes of at least $50,000. The survey includes active-duty service members in pay grades E-6 and above.[20] Survey results are regularly reported on by national news organizations including the Wall Street Journal,[21] The New York Times,[22] McClatchy-Tribune News Service,[23] USA Today [24] and Financial Planning magazine [25]
Financial Planner Oath[edit]
In the Spring 2010 issue of First Command’s Journey magazine, the company reiterated its commitment to the FPA Alliance program with the introduction of The Financial Planner Oath.[26] Resembling in part the Hippocratic Oath, the document is intended help members of the financial planning industry publicly state their commitment to act in their client’s best interests at all times. The Financial Planner Oath [27] is provided to new First Command Financial Advisors as part of their training, and the document is made available online to financial planners at other firms free of charge as a public service.

Current Operations[edit]

History[edit]
Business Model[edit]
First Command provides personalized services through locally based trained and licensed Financial Advisors and through its Home Office in Fort Worth, Texas. The company offers advice on securities, with an emphasis on mutual funds, annuities, life insurance, and municipal funds (including Section 529 Plans). Through related companies it offers insurance and banking products and services.[2] As of December 31, 2009, First Command had more than 285,000 client families, $14.7 billion in managed assets, $51.7 billion in life insurance policies in force and $615 million in banking assets.[2]
The company has a long history of working with military officers. In 2007, Scott Spiker, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy was named CEO in an effort to turn the company into a premier fiduciary firm serving military families after sanctions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over 13 years ago (2004). The firm has refocused on full compliance with various laws and proudly serves those seeking financial planning advice.
First Command provides complimentary financial plans for all active duty U.S. military service members. Currently, there are more than 473 Financial Advisors at First Command, 71% of whom are veterans or military spouses. First Command states its Mission as “coaching those who serve in their pursuit of financial security.”[3]
Early years[edit]
First Command was founded in 1958 by Carroll Payne, a retired military officer who realized that military families needed assistance in planning for their financial futures. Payne wanted to create a company that recognized and dealt with the unique circumstances applicable to United States military personnel.[4]
The company began as a broker/dealer called United Services Investment Association Inc. (USIA), which later became United Services Planning Association Inc. (USPA). USIA’s membership in the NASD (now FINRA) was approved on Jan. 21, 1959.[5] In 1963, USPA began offering financial plans to its clients, designed to promote long-term saving and investing. Dollar cost averaging and a pay-yourself-first approach were also used to encourage clients to invest on a regular basis.[6] In the mid ‘60s, USPA expanded its product offerings to include life insurance, leading to the creation of the Independent Research Agency for Life Insurance, Inc. (IRA).[5]
In 1970, USPA and IRA began operating under the combined name of USPA&IRA, a name which remained in use for the next three decades.
International expansion and corporate growth[edit]
In 1979, the company opened its first office outside the continental U.S, in Hawaii; three years later international operations began with an office in Germany.[5] A charitable foundation, now known as the First Command Educational Foundation, began in 1983.[5]
Payne died in 1984 and was succeeded by Ralph Smith, who served as chairman and CEO until his retirement in December 1985. George Talley then served as chairman and CEO from 1986–1991.[5] During Talley's tenure, USPA&IRA grew to 500 advisors and exceeded 200,000 families.[6] Lamar Smith, company president and COO, was promoted to chairman and CEO in 1992.
First Command Bank opened for business on April 21, 1997. In less than six months, the bank was posting more than 100 new deposit accounts and 50 new loans weekly.[6] In 1998, USPA&IRA went “private,” transitioning from a C Corporation to an S Corporation and later, in 2002, become 100% employee owned.[5] USPA&IRA launched a tax services program in 2001.
Name change to First Command[edit]
USPA&IRA changed its name to First Command Financial Planning in 2001.[5] The company explained that it changed its name because:

We are sometimes confused with other companies that service the military and former military clientele and whose names also start with letters “US...”. There are several such companies, but none like us and we don’t want any confusion.[7]

Becoming Registered Investments Advisors[edit]
In anticipation of an SEC ruling requiring that all firms whose primary business is financial planning must become a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA), First Command filed with the SEC to become one in the spring of 2005. This requires their agents to obtain additional training and certifications. As RIAs, the agents could now use the term "Financial Advisors" as compared to "Registered Agents", with the former being held to a higher ethical standard.[8] The higher standards require agents to document every client interaction in great detail and apply due diligence to all investment recommendations to ensure they are in the best interests of the client.[9] The company no longer offers the controversial systematic investment plans.[1]
Recognition as FPA Alliance firm[edit]
In 2009, First Command was recognized in the financial planning industry as an FPA Alliance firm, one of only two companies ever to receive this elite recognition from the 27,000-member Financial Planning Association. In an April 2009 announcement, FPA President Richard Salmen said First Command was being recognized for its “commitment to professionalism in financial planning. … First Command has publicly demonstrated a commitment to putting their clients' interests first. The company has registered with the SEC as an investment adviser and all of its financial planners are registered as Investment Adviser Representatives under First Command's RIA. And, First Command has met the program requirements, including adherence to the principles of professionalism for FPA Alliance. The firm has a strong commitment to lifelong learning and leadership development." [10]
Partnerships[edit]
First Command has partnered with several organizations that support military veterans and their families. These include Hiring Our Heroes,[11] Project Sanctuary,[12] the Association of the United States Army,[13] the Marine Corps Marathon,[14] Army West Point Athletics,[15] and the Department of Defense Military Spouse Employment Partnership.[16]
Charity Involvement[edit]
First Command established the First Command Education Foundation (FCEF). The FCEF is a 501(c)(3) non-profit public charity dedicated to improving financial readiness through education and scholarship opportunities. FCEF has been providing its services since 1983.[17]
Corporate Structure[edit]
Leadership Team[edit]
Scott Spiker became the first Chief Executive Officer recruited from outside the company in September 2007 after holding top leadership positions  at Norwest Corp., RBC Dain Rauscher, Definity Health, Stanton Group and Destiny Health.[26] In 2017, Spiker was elected into a dual role as Chairman of the Board and CEO.[18] The rest of the board includes Mark D. Steffe as Executive Vice President and National Director of Advisor Operations, Michael F. Morrison as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Hugh A. Simpson as Executive Vice President of General Counsel and Secretary, W. David White as President of First Command Bank, Jill Lyttle as Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Leadership Development, Jerry Wackerhagen as Executive Vice President of Operations and Technology, and Luis A. Muniz, CFP® as Senior Vice President of Advisor Services.[19]
First Command Financial Behaviors Index[edit]
First Command has developed the First Command Financial Behaviors Index. It assesses trends among the American public's financial behaviors, intentions and attitudes through a monthly survey of approximately 530 U.S. consumers, ages 25–70, with annual household incomes of at least $50,000. The survey includes active-duty service members in pay grades E-6 and above.[20] Survey results are regularly reported on by national news organizations including the Wall Street Journal,[21] The New York Times,[22] McClatchy-Tribune News Service,[23] USA Today [24] and Financial Planning magazine [25]
Financial Planner Oath[edit]
In the Spring 2010 issue of First Command’s Journey magazine, the company reiterated its commitment to the FPA Alliance program with the introduction of The Financial Planner Oath.[26] Resembling in part the Hippocratic Oath, the document is intended help members of the financial planning industry publicly state their commitment to act in their client’s best interests at all times. The Financial Planner Oath [27] is provided to new First Command Financial Advisors as part of their training, and the document is made available online to financial planners at other firms free of charge as a public service.
Criticism and Controversy[edit]
In 2004, a New York Times investigative report by Diana B. Henriques named First Command as being one of several investment firms engaged in deceptive marketing of financial instruments aimed at military veterans.[28] On 15 December of that year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) determined that First Command had "willfully violated the Securities Act of 1933 Section 17(a)(2) dealing with inter-state fraud" in its marketing activities targeting veterans.[29] In particular, the SEC concluded that First Command had sold mutual fund investments to veterans termed "systematic plans" that bore very high sales charges termed "front-end sales loads", "by, in part, making misleading statements and omissions concerning, among other things: (a) comparisons between the systematic plan and other mutual fund investments; (b) the availability of the Thrift Savings Plan ("TSP"), which offers military investors many of the features of a systematic plan at lower costs; and (c) the efficacy of the front-end sales load in ensuring that investors remain committed to the systematic plan."[29]
In an independent investigation, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) charged First Command "with inappropriately confronting a customer who complained, failing to maintain e-mail, failing to maintain adequate supervisory systems and procedures and filing an inaccurate Form U-5 regulatory report".[30][31]
In December 2004, First Command entered into a $12 million settlement with the SEC and NASD without admitting guilt.[32] As part of the settlement, First Command agreed to offer restitution to all clients who had purchased and sold a systematic plan between 1999 and 2004, establishment of educational programs, and monitoring or prefiling.[33] People who had not terminated their systematic plan were not covered in the settlement. In September 2007, a California judge granted "Class Action" status to a 2005 lawsuit filed by systematic plan holders whose plans were active when the SEC issued its ruling on December 15, 2004.[34] In October 2008, attorneys for the plaintiffs sought court approval for a settlement.[35] The settlement was approved by the court in April 2009.
In 2004, the SEC report noted "The great majority of the firm's agents are former commissioned or non-commissioned military officers.”[29] The report was part of the proceedings in reaching a settlement with First Financial over charges that the firm "willfully violated the Securities Act of 1933 Section 17(a)(2) dealing with inter-state fraud" in marketing financial instruments to veterans.[29]
As of August 2006, Mary Shapiro, the NASD Vice-Chairman and President of Regulatory Policy and Oversight, continued to be critical of First Command, calling it an "unscrupulous organization" with an "awful" product. First Command's new president, Marty Durbin, responded to her criticism by stating, "It’s unfortunate that settling these charges still doesn’t mean it’s behind us. But it’s a futile effort to try to fight negative press and so we decided not to put a lot of energy that way."[36]
Following Controversy[edit]
In 2006, First Command introduced long term care and property and casualty insurance.[9] Later that year in December, First Command announced it had signed on as a corporate partner with the Bell Helicopter Armed Forces Bowl.[37]
In September 2007, Samantha Hilliard, First Command district advisor was featured in Newsweek. Hilliard received the 2007 realLIFEstories Client Service Award for her service to the widow of an Army officer killed in Iraq. The award was presented by the Life and Health Insurance Foundation for Education (LIFE), a non-profit group dedicated to providing the public with information and education on life, disability, long-term care and health insurance.[38]
On July 4, 2008, ABC’s Good Morning America featured a story on a First Command sponsored charity the Package Brigade that sends care packages to troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.[39] That same summer, the U.S. Department of Defense and the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve honored First Command with the Patriotic Employer Award, which is presented to companies and individuals for contributing to national security and protecting liberty and freedom by supporting employee participation in America’s National Guard and Reserve force.[40]
Current Operations[edit]
First Command Financial Services, Inc. announced In June 2013 that it is offering banking support to its clients who have been impacted by the Black Forest Fire near Colorado Springs.[41] In February 2015, with the threat of a government-funding crisis, First Command Financial Services offered to cover Coast Guard pay in the event of a funding crisis.[42] With a new military retirement system being enforced, First Command’s CEO Scott Spiker offered his perspective to the Spring 2016 issue of Journey “I believe there are legitimate concerns about whether this structural reform of military retirement will really be in the long-term best interests of future service members,” Spiker said. “It almost assuredly will not be in the long-term best interests of those service members who fail to grasp the importance of taking full advantage of the Thrift Savings Plan and making smart, informed decisions about the new lump sum bonus opportunities and other key military benefits. This is not, in other words, a time for service members and their families to passively assume that their financial future is set.”[43]
Awards and Recognitions[edit]

In December, 2016 First Command Financial Services was ranked as one of the Best Places to Work in Texas by Texas Monthly, the Texas Association of Business, Texas Society for Human Resource Management and Best Companies Group.[44]
In August, 2016, First Command Financial Services was awarded the Silver Bowl Award for the Best Use of Social for Recruiting by LIMRA and LOMA.[45]
In November 2015, First Command Financial Services was named a top employer of military veterans and spouses by Victory Media, publisher of G.I. Jobs and Military Spouse magazines.[46]
In January 2016, Fort Worth Business Named First Command Financial Services as the Best Large Company to work for in Fort Worth.[47]
In May 2016, First Command Financial Services won the Most Valuable Employers (MVE) for Military by CivilianJobs.com.[48]

1Forbes rankings are the opinion of SHOOK Research and are based on advisor interviews, client retention, industry experience, compliance record, assets under management and revenue generated for the firm. Investment performance is not considered. Advisors do not pay to be in the ranking.
2According to Barron's, "The formula [used] to rank advisors has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of the advisor's practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by each client's risk tolerance. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record." The rankings are based on the universe of applications submitted to Barron's. The selection process begins with a nomination and application provided to Barron's. Principals of Edelman Financial Services, LLC self-nominated the firm and submitted quantitative and qualitative information to Barron's as requested. Barron's reviewed and considered this information, which resulted in the rankings on Aug. 27, 2012/Aug. 28, 2010/Aug. 31, 2009.

Barron’s 2017 Best Online Broker Ranking
Fidelity takes the top spot, with Interactive Brokers and TD Ameritrade right on its heels


 







By

Theresa W. Carey

 Biography




 




March 18, 2017


The bull market is on sale for online brokerage customers. In the run-up to our 22nd annual ranking of Barron’s Best Online Brokers, two developments topped all others: The three major indexes—the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor’s 500, and the Nasdaq Composite—all set record highs, and six brokers slashed commissions and other fees. At the 16 brokers we reviewed this year, the average monthly cost of trading for an occasional investor had fallen 25% since early 2016, to $47.51 from $63.45. That means...

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
