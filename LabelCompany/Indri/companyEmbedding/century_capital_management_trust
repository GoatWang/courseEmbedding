Large Cap Growth Strategy

Portfolio Management
Kevin Callahan is the Lead Portfolio Manager of the Century Large Cap Growth strategy. Lanny Thorndike is the Co-Portfolio Manager. The Portfolio Managers conduct fundamental, bottom-up research analysis on existing and prospective holdings. Century’s equity analysts are leveraged for affirmation and confirmation on companies they are analyzing. The equity analysts have dedicated GICS sector coverage. We believe that this dedicated coverage leads to strong knowledge and experience which enhances the Large Cap Growth investment process.
Investment Philosophy
The key tenets of the Century Large Cap Growth investment philosophy are:

Invest in solid, high quality businesses to help mitigate risk
Be contrarian at purchase; exploit the herd mentality
Apply exhaustive fundamental research targeting growth, profitability and valuation
Express bets in a high conviction portfolio

Investment Approach & Universe
The Large Cap Growth investment approach is fundamental, bottom-up. The investment style is traditional Large Cap Growth. The strategy’s benchmark is the Russell 1000 Growth index. The investment universe typically consists of roughly 900 companies that have a market capitalization greater than $4 billion at purchase and trade on a U.S. stock exchange.
Fundamental Research
The Fundamental Research step of the investment process is perhaps the most important. This is the phase where we dig deeply into the fundamentals of the company and the industry in which it operates. The Large Cap Growth strategy invests primarily in two types of investment opportunities:
1) “Core Growth” companies, which typically have a leading market share position, high barriers to entry, consistent growth and profitability, a strong balance sheet, and business model sustainability; and
2) “Secular Growth” companies that commonly demonstrate faster top-line growth, are experiencing positive industry tailwinds, have disruptive business models that are redefining a value proposition for customers, and are often innovative businesses with visionary leaders.
At the buy point, the investment approach is contrarian in nature. We seek to identify companies experiencing a temporary event that has prompted the stock price to drop fairly meaningfully, creating an attractive valuation. Ideally, the stock price has stabilized leaving additional downside risk more muted as some short-term bad news is reflected in the stock price. At this point, the research conclusion is that there’s a potential multiple expansion opportunity with a company where forecasted earnings growth remains solid. To qualify for purchase, the Portfolio Managers seek at least 15% appreciation potential over the next 12 months.
With a list of candidates sourced from our screening methodology and idea generation, we then further filter the candidates through both a quantitative and qualitative analysis. In terms of the quantitative analysis, we compare and contrast a new idea’s financial performance against that of its industry peer group. This analysis incorporates a combination of growth, profit, valuation, and leverage metrics. Further, the analysis covers several years of historical performance as well as a couple years of forecasted assumptions. This analysis enables us to quickly compare and contrast the performance of one company against that of its peers. This assessment is important because we believe that a company’s ultimate valuation is a function of its growth and profit margin outlook. Armed with a better understanding of a company’s historical financial performance and outlook, we conduct a qualitative analysis. The qualitative analysis conducted is similar to Michael Porter’s Five Forces analysis. We analyze the level of competition within a given industry and business strategy development. We then dig into the annual and quarterly reports from the company and its competitors, listen to earnings conference calls, review sell-side research, and often conduct meetings directly with company managements. This analysis provides us with a more complete mosaic of the company and the industry in which it operates. The financial analysis paints the picture while the qualitative analysis provides the added context, which is also important.
Once an investment candidate passes the deeper quantitative and qualitative analyses, we then work to estimate, by establishing a price target, what potential return we might earn if we buy the stock.
Valuation
Once an understanding of the industry landscape is achieved for a company, the focus shifts to valuation. A company’s Price / Earnings (next 12 months), Price / Sales (next 12 months), and Enterprise Value / EBITDA (next 12 months) are analyzed both on an absolute basis and relative to a company’s sector and the broader market. A 12-month price target is established for each existing and prospective holding. Price targets are established by forecasting earnings expectations then applying an appropriate multiple.
Typically, Wall Street consensus estimates are used. Appropriate multiples are determined utilizing the following: 1) the historical multiple of the company going back 10 years, and 2) the current multiple being granted to the company’s industry peer group. A target multiple may be adjusted based on a company’s competitive positioning within its industry as well as company specific issues.
Portfolio Construction
Typically, the Portfolio Managers construct a high conviction portfolio of 25-45 companies with favorable growth, profitability, and valuation attributes. Position sizes mostly range from 2-6% of portfolio assets at purchase with a maximum position size of 8%. Cash reserves are generally less than 6%. The Portfolio Managers make the final decisions for the Century Large Cap Growth strategy, including portfolio construction.
Sell Discipline
A stock may be sold or trimmed for the following reasons:

Deterioration of fundamentals
Price target discipline
Better opportunities are available
Catalyst event – e.g. accounting irregularities, management changes, M&A activity
Position size exceeds 8%
Stock weakness: Underperformance >10% relative to the R1000G Index
triggers a re-examination of the position

Small Cap Value Strategy

Portfolio Manager
Jeff Kerrigan, CFA, is the Portfolio Manager for the Century Small Cap Value strategy. He is supported by Century’s equity analysts and traders.
The team conducts fundamental, bottom-up research analysis on existing and prospective holdings. The research analysts have dedicated GICS sector coverage. We believe that this dedicated focus leads to strong knowledge and experience, which we think enhances the Small Cap Value investment process. Each equity analyst has deep experience researching companies. As a result, each of them has developed an extensive list of company and industry contacts, along with domain expertise, that we believe are valuable when researching companies. The team’s approach to company research is intensive, with the Portfolio Manager and equity analysts each having a goal to meet with 60-80 companies per year.
Investment Philosophy
Century’s Small Cap Value investment philosophy has four primary tenets:

Small capitalization markets are inefficient. This provides an opportunity to utilize a fundamental research approach to identify superior companies trading at a discount to intrinsic value.
In the context of value investing, it is important to delineate between less innovative and more innovative sectors.
Focus on opportunities with the greatest upside potential, emphasizing a combination of both classic valuation and relative valuation/earnings power.
Neutralize relative benchmark risk to isolate stock selection as the primary source of alpha mitigating the difficulty of consistently predicting market, sector, and industry direction, while delivering high active share.

Investment Universe
The Small Cap Value market capitalization range is generally within the range of the Russell 2000 Value (R2000V) index (typically, $50 million to $5 billion).
Fundamental Research
The strategy’s fundamental research process includes both financial modeling and qualitative analysis. The model is designed to develop an understanding of a company’s operating dynamics: financials, margins and growth rates and perform various scenario and sensitivity analyses.
The strategy’s qualitative analysis is focused around researching the key drivers of the business. The Portfolio Manager analyzes the industry’s competitive landscape, speaks with company management and listens to past earnings calls. The company specific research is further complemented with a formal sector profile designed to focus on the key catalysts driving sector dynamics.
Valuation
The strategy’s primary valuation methodology is a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. Once the DCF analysis is completed, the Portfolio Manager considers the output within the context of less innovative and more innovative sectors. In less innovative sectors, we compare a company’s intrinsic value to the current stock price. In more innovative sectors, we compare a company’s intrinsic value to street estimates and the deviation between the two.
Portfolio Construction
The Portfolio Manager constructs a portfolio typically consisting of 70-110 companies. Larger positions generally range from 1.5 – 4.0% and tend to exhibit high expected return potential and a positive contribution to risk. Smaller positions typically range from 0.3 – 1.5%. The risk and return profile can be higher or more moderate. If the return profile is high, the smaller position is generally based on the desired sector or industry exposure relative to the benchmark from a portfolio construction standpoint.
Sell Discipline
The Portfolio Manager utilizes a comprehensive and flexible sell discipline. The following may trigger a sale:

Company’s cumulative valuation and earnings upside potential approaches fair value
Better opportunities exist
Fundamental deterioration of the company
Market capitalization rises above a targeted range
Position size exceeds 5%

Century Shares Trust One of the oldest mutual funds in the United States, the Fund seeks long­-term capital growth[1]. The Fund employs a bottom-­up, fundamental investment approach to uncover high­-quality, durable-­growth franchise companies. The Fund seeks companies that offer attractive long-­term growth and profitability prospects while trading at reasonable valuations.

1: Effective October 1, 2015 the Fund’s investment objective changed to long-term capital growth from long-term growth of principal and income.



Century Small Cap Select Fund The Fund operates under the philosophy that small capitalization markets are inefficient, which provides opportunities to utilize a disciplined, research intensive investment process to seek growth opportunities. The Fund’s focus on quality growth franchises is based on the belief that it allows for capital appreciation while potentially reducing the downside risk associated with higher volatility stocks.
