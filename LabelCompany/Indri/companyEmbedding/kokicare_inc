We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling
security holders. All of the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock will
go to the selling security holders. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating
to the registration of the common stock for the selling security holders.


The Company’s competition comes from software and technology companies that
develop or sell enterprise software in the global healthcare market. The
industry has many players with diverse solutions.


Company Description
KokiCare, Inc. was incorporated on April 24, 2015 under the laws of the State of
Delaware. The Company is in the discovery and planning phase to develop a
real-time, SaaS-based enterprise software application to manage the integration,
planning, tracking and management of healthcare assets, which


 include, people,
supplies, clinical data, relationships, and financial resources of healthcare
organizations.

KokiCare is currently in the design phase to develop a healthcare analytics
software platform to assist healthcare professionals with business analytics,
performance management and data warehousing. With increased regulatory
requirements and technology improvements in the healthcare industry, companies
are inundated with greater volumes of data than ever before. Our technology will
provide for healthcare organizations to store, manage and access their data in
meaningful ways, improving patient care and financial performance.

The Company plans to hire software engineers to develop a web-based application
using the latest Microsoft Stack tools. With an intuitive Web UI, our SaaS
modeled application will be scalable and flexible with multiple modules
integrated into the end product. The software will be licensed on an annual
contract by hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare facilities. The revenues
generated from the licensing fees and upfront integration fees, will create a
sustainable revenue model.

We have identified software engineers to perform the implementation phase, but
those individuals are currently not under any obligation or contract with
KokiCare. After we have completed the design phase of the software platform, and
have raised sufficient capital for the implementation phase, we will hire
engineers to begin development.

We anticipate the design phase will require approximately 6 months and the
implementation phase will require 6 to 12 months. Our founder and CEO, Jason
Lane, will complete the design phase.  We plan to hire 3 full time developers to
complete the implementation phase.  In our estimation, the capital required for
the implementation phase will be $200,000.  After the completion of the
implementation phase, the software application will be market ready.

Post implementation, Jason Lane will perform the sales function for the Company.
As customers are contracted, the development team will handle necessary
integrations and ongoing customer support. Customer contracts will require
upfront integration fees and ongoing license fees in excess of required costs,
including development talent and hosting fees.

There is significant risk in our ability to successfully (i) complete the design
phase, (ii) raise the required capital to hire engineers to begin the
implementation phase, (iii) successfully implement and release the software
application with all requirements, (iv) contract one or more customers to use
the software application, and (v) price the application so that we receive
revenues sufficient to cover the operating expenses of the Company, including
the cost of maintaining, supporting and improving the software application.

Notes to
the Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements

 

Note 1 -
Organization and Operations

 

KokiCare,
Inc.

 

KokiCare,
Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on April 24, 2015
under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company aims to
develop health care enterprise software to be sold to hospitals,
medical centers and health care facilities in the United States and
internationally.

 

Note 2 -
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

The
Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use
of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of
accounting policies and their application. Critical accounting
policies and practices are those that are both most important to
the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and
results and require management’s most difficult, subjective,
or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make
estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently
uncertain. The Company’s significant and critical accounting
policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally
accepted accounting principles.

 

Basis of
Presentation

 

The
Company’s financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

 

Fiscal
Year-End

 

The
Company elected June 30th as its fiscal year ending
date.

 

Use of
Estimates and Assumptions and Critical Accounting Estimates and
Assumptions

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date(s) of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period(s).

 

Critical
accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the
estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment
necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the
susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the
estimate on financial condition or operating performance is
material. The Company’s critical accounting estimates and
assumptions affecting the financial statements were as
follows:

 

(i)

Assumption
as a going concern :
Management assumes that the Company will continue as a going
concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization
of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of
business ;

 

(ii)

Valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets :
Management assumes that the realization of the Company’s net
deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss
(“NOL”) carry–forwards for Federal income tax
purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not
considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax
benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full
valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a)
the Company has incurred recurring losses, (b) general economic
conditions, and (c) its ability to raise additional funds to
support its daily operations by way of a public or private
offering, among other factors.

 

These
significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of
change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to
these estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or
assumptions are difficult to measure or value.

 

Management
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the
financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources.




6

 

  

 

Management
regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop
the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in
facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable
assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those
estimates are adjusted accordingly.

 

Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

 

The
Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its
financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph
820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial
instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”), and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair
value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37
establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3)
broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by
Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:

  




 



 



 





Level
1



 



Quoted
market prices available in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities as of the reporting date.





 



 



 





Level
2



 



Pricing
inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level
1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the
reporting date.





 



 



 





Level
3



 



Pricing
inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by
market data.




 

Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined
using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar
techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input
is unobservable.

 

The fair
value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used
to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more
than one level described above, the categorization is based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.

 

The
carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and
liabilities, such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their
fair values because of the short maturity of these
instruments.

 

Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on
an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive,
free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about
transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that
the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent
to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such
representations can be substantiated.

 

Cash
Equivalents

 

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of
three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash
equivalents.

 

Commitment
and Contingencies

 

The
Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are
issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will
only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to
occur. The Company assessed such contingent liabilities, and such
assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In
assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are
pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in
such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any
legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived
merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought
therein.

 

If the
assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a
material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can
be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the
Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates
that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is
reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then
the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the
range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be
disclosed.




7

 

  

 

Loss
contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless
they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be
disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon information
available at this time, that these matters will have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results
of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that
such matters will not materially and adversely affect the
Company’s business, financial position, and results of
operations or cash flows.

 

Revenue
Recognition

 

The
Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company
recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.
The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned
when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the
services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price
is fixed or determinable and (iv) collectability is reasonably
assured. 

 

Research
and Development

 

The
Company follows paragraph 730-10-25-1 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 2 “Accounting for Research and Development
Costs” ) and paragraph 730-20-25-11 of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification (formerly Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 68 “Research and Development
Arrangements” ) for research and development costs.
Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.
Research and development costs consist primarily of remuneration
for material and testing costs for research and development. There
was no research and development for the three months ended
September 30, 2016.

 

Income
Tax Provision

 

The
Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets
and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in
effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent
management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets
will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
the statements of operations in the period that includes the
enactment date.

 

The
Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification (“Section 740-10-25”). Section 740-10-25
addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or
expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the
financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may
recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it
is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on
examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the
financial statements from such a position should be measured based
on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%)
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section
740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,
interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim
periods and requires increased disclosures.

 

The
estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the
tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the
accompanying balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and
carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability
of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides
valuation allowances as management deems necessary.

 

Management
makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might
be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates
of tax liability. In management’s opinion, adequate
provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual
taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates,
additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.
All tax years since inception are open for examination by taxing
authorities.

 

Uncertain
Tax Positions

 

The
Company did not take any uncertain tax positions and had no
adjustments to its income tax liabilities or benefits pursuant to
the provisions of Section 740-10-25 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016.

Net
Income (Loss) per Common Share

 

Net
income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section
260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net
income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common
share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive
outstanding shares of common stock during the period to reflect the
potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable
through contingent share arrangements, stock options and
warrants.

 

The
Company issued convertible promissory notes on April 5, 2016 and
May 12, 2016 in the aggregate of $20,000 (see Note 3). The
promissory notes were potentially dilutive due to their convertible
features; however, due to the net loss for the reported periods,
the notes were determined to be non-dilutive.

 

There
were no other potentially dilutive common shares outstanding for
the for the three months ended September 30, 2016.

 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective
accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect
on the accompanying financial statements.

 

Note 3
– Notes Payable

 

Note
Payable - Related Party

 

On June
15, 2015, the Company issued an unsecured note payable in the
amount of $10,000 to a relative of the CEO. The note accrues
interest at 2% per annum and is payable on or before June 15, 2017.
The outstanding balance including accrued interest at September 30,
2016 and June 30, 2016 was $10,261 and $10,210,
respectively.

 

Convertible
Notes Payable

 

On April
5, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement
(“SPA”) in connection with the issuance of a
convertible promissory note (“Note 1”) in the aggregate
principal amount of $5,000. The Note matured on October 2,
2016.

 

On May
12, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement
(“SPA”) in connection with the issuance of a
convertible promissory note (“Note 2”) in the aggregate
principal amount of $15,000. The Note matured on November 8,
2016.

 

Note 1
and Note 2 bear interest at 8% per annum and together with all
accrued interest, are convertible into shares of the
Company’s common stock at a price equal to 60% multiplied by
the average of the lowest three (3) trading prices for the Common
Stock during the ten (10) trading day period prior to the date of
conversion; provided, however, that in no event shall the holder
convert any portion of the notes which would result in beneficial
ownership of more than 4.99%. The SPAs and the Notes contain
representations, warranties, conditions, restrictions, and
covenants of the Company that are customary in such transactions
with smaller companies. The outstanding balances on Note 1 and Note
2 at September 30, 2016 were $5,196 and $15,467, respectively. No
beneficial conversion feature was recorded on Note 1 or Note 2
because the Company’s stock had minimal trading as of
September 30, 2016.

 

The Notes
may be accelerated by the holder in the event of default and the
rate of interest on the Notes will increase to 24% per annum,
retroactive to the date of issuance. The Notes are direct financial
obligations of the Company and are considered current liabilities
of the Company for accounting purposes.

 

On
November 10, 2016, Note 1 was restructured as a non-convertible
promissory note and Note 2 was paid in full (see Note 7 –
Subsequent Events).

 

Note 4
– Going Concern

 

The
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company
will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of
operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in
the normal course of business.

 

As
reflected in the financial statements, the Company had an
accumulated deficit at September 30, 2016, and a net loss
and
