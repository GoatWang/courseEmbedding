About
an introduction by Lesley Jackson (Writer, Curator and Design Historian)
Although established less than a decade ago, the youthful company MARK has already made its mark in the newly reinvigorated British furniture industry. Founded by designers Anna Hart and John Miller – who also run Hart Miller Design, the creative driving force behind MARK – the company embodies their combined expertise and shared passion for well-designed, good-looking furniture.




‘Friendly’ might sound an odd way of describing furniture but with MARK, it seems somehow apt. Spearheaded by two individuals who care deeply about the objects they are bringing into the world, MARK’s small but growing team (now numbering seven) prides itself on its personal approach. Drawing on Hart Miller’s experience and insights, supplemented by the input of a circle of friends, hand-picked from across the British design community, MARK creates user-friendly furniture designed to improve quality of life and brighten up the environment.
What makes MARK stand out in the contract furniture market is its unusual combination of high principles and relaxed, people-centred design. Based in Cornwall, the company harnesses the area’s free-spirited creativity and local manufacturing skills.
Sustainable in the true sense of the word, MARK’s furniture is designed to last. This applies right through from creative decisions about colour and form, to choice of materials and methods of production.
Driven by a strong vision, but responsive to the needs of specifiers and end-users in different sectors of the market, MARK furniture is varied and dynamic in character. Hart Miller provide vital creative leadership, ensuring meticulous attention to detail in every aspect of the company’s approach to furniture design and production. Championing the idea of furniture as components of interiors, rather than as objects in isolation, Hart Miller are idealistic, yet pragmatic, with their head in the clouds but their feet firmly on the ground.

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.
                            



                                Entity Type
                            

                                Individual
                            

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Sole Proprietor
                            

                                N
                            

                                Indicate whether provider is a sole proprietor.

A sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.
In a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.
There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).





                                Provider Last Name (Legal Name)

                                The last name of the provider (if an individual). If the provider is an individual, this is the legal name. This name must match the name on file with the Social Security Administration (SSA). In addition, the date of birth must match that on file with SSA.

The First, Middle, Last and Credential(s) fields allow the following special characters: ampersand, apostrophe, colon, comma, forward slash, hyphen, left and right parentheses, period, pound sign, quotation mark, and semi-colon.
