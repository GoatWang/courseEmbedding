Securities-backed lending.
As you look ahead to retirement and your other long-term goals, you might be diligently building up your financial accounts. But in the meantime, you could put these assets to work—by borrowing against their value for, say, home renovations, college costs, tax bills or business start-up costs.




Right for you if:

 You want a lower interest rate than non-secured loan rates 
 You need cash for expenses, such as college fees, taxes or home upgrades 
 You don't want to sell securities to free-up cash 






 Still have questions? Call us at 1-800-846-5200  (TTY 1-800-788-6775).






To be sure, it's risky to borrow against the value of your securities, because the money borrowed accentuates your losses if your investments fall in value. Still, this strategy has three potential advantages. First, you can leave your portfolio in place, so that it can potentially continue to grow. Second, you can avoid selling securities, which could trigger capital-gains tax bills. Finally, because the loan is backed by your portfolio's value, the interest charged will be lower than for an unsecured loan. 
Working with your Financial Advisor, you may be able to pledge marketable securities, including stocks, corporate bonds, government bonds, mutual funds and other financial instruments, for a loan, line of credit or other borrowing. You may even be able to borrow against control and restricted stock, as well as other non-margin eligible securities.

Portfolio Line of Credit. This our quickest and easiest way to borrow against the value of your portfolio for just about any personal or business use, other than to purchase additional securities.

Not sure that a securities-backed loan is right for you? Talk to your Financial Advisor about the pros and cons. As an alternative, you could also explore a home-equity loan or line of credit. But these may take longer to set up than a loan tied to your portfolio's value. However, all three types of loans have risks and fees, so be sure to consult your advisor before taking out any type of loan to understand all the terms and conditions. 






Call us at 1-800-846-5200 (TTY 1-800-788-6775) to open an account or learn more.

to footnote reference 1






Borrowing against securities may not be suitable for everyone. If the value of the securities should decline below a minimum level, you may be subject to a collateral call without specific advance notice, requiring you to deposit additional cash or securities.  If you cannot do so, all or a portion of your collateral could be liquidated, and a potentially taxable event could result. You are not entitled to choose which securities are sold or any extension of time to meet a collateral call.  A concentrated portfolio holding a single or a few securities may be subject to greater risk of a collateral call than a diversified portfolio; a diversified portfolio will tend to be less subject to a sharp decline resulting from the negative performance of a single security. Availability, qualifications, and other restrictions may vary by state. Ask your Financial Advisor for details. 

A Home Equity Line of Credit is a form of revolving credit in which your home serves as collateral.  Home equity plans typically involve variable interest rates rather than fixed rates.

Before entering into a plan, consider how you will pay back any money you might borrow. Some plans set minimum payments that cover a portion of the principal (the amount you borrow) plus accrued interest. But, unlike the typical installment loan, the portion that goes toward principal may not be enough to repay the debt by the end of the term.

Costs to obtain a home equity line. Many of the costs in setting up a home equity line are similar to those you pay when buying a home. For example:


-a fee for a property appraisal, which estimates the value of your home;
-an application fee, which may not be refundable if you are turned down for credit;
-up-front charges, such as one or more points (one point equals one percent of the credit limit);
-other closing costs, which include fees for attorneys, title search, mortgage preparation and filing, property and title insurance as well as taxes;
-certain fees during the plan; for example, some plans impose yearly membership or maintenance fees;
-you also may be charged a transaction fee every time you draw on the credit line.
Diversification does not protect against loss or guarantee a profit.

There may be additional risks associated with international investing, including foreign, economic, political, monetary and/or legal factors, changing currency exchange rates, foreign taxes, and differences in financial and accounting standards. These risks may be magnified in emerging markets. International investing may not be for everyone.

Investors should carefully consider the funds investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information is found in the prospectus, which should be read carefully before investing. Please contact your Financial Advisor for a copy of the prospectus.

* Borrowing against securities may not be suitable for everyone. If the value of the securities should decline below a minimum level, you may be subject to a collateral call without specific advance notice, requiring you to deposit additional cash or securities. If you cannot do so, all or a portion of your collateral could be liquidated, and a potentially taxable event could result. You are not entitled to choose which securities are sold or any extension of time to meet a collateral call. A concentrated portfolio holding a single or a few securities may be subject to greater risk of a collateral call than a diversified portfolio; a diversified portfolio will tend to be less subject to a sharp decline resulting from the negative performance of a single security. Availability, qualifications, and other restrictions may vary by state. Ask your Financial Advisor for details.Back to reference *Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates do not provide tax or legal advice.
