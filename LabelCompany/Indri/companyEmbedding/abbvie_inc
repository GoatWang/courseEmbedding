Make Possibilities RealAbbVie employees work every day to discover and address many of the world's most pressing health challenges.






Skip to the next section














United by Our Purpose
We are scientists, researchers, communicators, manufacturing specialists, regulatory experts, marketing professionals and more. We’re also parents, brothers, sisters, friends, community leaders and volunteers. We come together every day to create, discover and deliver new ways to improve people’s health.













 








Play an Important Role
All career paths lead to the same outcome. Improving lives. Whether you work in the lab, in an office or on the production floor, the objective is the same. We offer development opportunities that provide you the chances to innovate, collaborate and demonstrate your passion for patients and excellence.


Search all jobs
Join our talent community














Meet the People. Share the Passion.
From our newest employees to our top executives, these five beliefs drive how we work—and fuel successful careers.













 







Putting Patients First
Emilie Moghabghab, Care Coach Manager, Beirut, Lebanon
“I work with all different types of patients. It’s not like one rule applies to all. You have to deal with each patient according to who they are.” Emilie has used a range of techniques when working with patients, especially children and those who are vulnerable. This includes motivational interviewing and reflective listening.












 







Breaking the Mold
José Otero Marrero, Clinical Operations Manager, San Juan, Puerto Rico
“I’ve been able to realize one of my dreams, which is to help patients and at the same time bring these clinical studies to Puerto Rico.” José overcame cultural barriers in Puerto Rico to contribute new advances in the treatment of hepatitis C. His unique approach increased the number of patients referred for clinical studies.












 







Rewarding the Best
Afif El Kik, Immunology Commercial Director, Sao Paulo, Brazil
“If you perform and know where you want go, you don’t have to look for the opportunities—they will find you.” Afif’s career trajectory at AbbVie has included numerous roles in several countries and continents—and shows no signs of stopping.












 







Leading by Example
Alexander Wuerfel, VP, Global Marketing, Lake County, IL
“It’s impossible to separate strategy from execution. You need to set aside time to develop a compelling vision and you need to drive execution. That’s where you see the difference between a good and a great company.” Alex’s career journey has spanned roles in project management all the way to General Manager, VP AbbVie Germany to his current role in the United States as VP of Global Marketing.












 







Making a World-Wide Impact
Kyle Holen, MD, Executive Medical Director, Oncology Development, Lake County, IL
“We can have such a greater impact because if we bring a new medicine to market, it can help patients worldwide, as opposed to the 20 or so patients we might see in clinic in one day.” Trained as a medical oncologist, Kyle’s focus at AbbVie is finding ways to treat cancers such as devastating glioblastoma brain tumors. He became a physician to help take care of patients, but he came to AbbVie to make an even greater impact.

About AbbVieWe’re a company that takes on the toughest health challenges. But we do more than treat diseases—we aim to make a remarkable impact on people’s lives. We are AbbVie, a highly focused research-driven biopharmaceutical company.












 
 









What We Do
Our ~29,000 employees are scientists, researchers, communicators, manufacturing specialists and regulatory experts located around the globe. We come up with new approaches to addressing today’s health issues—from life-threatening illness to chronic conditions.
We target specific difficult-to-cure diseases where we can leverage our core R&D expertise to advance science. We’re constantly working to create solutions that go beyond treating the illness to have a positive impact on patients’ lives, on societies—and on science itself.









Patients: Making an impact on more lives
To understand the patient journey, we collaborate with peers, academics, clinical experts, front-line practitioners, governments and advocacy groups. This fuels us to develop and deliver new solutions that truly make a difference.









Science: Finding better solutions to the world's toughest challenges
Research and innovation are the cornerstones of our business. We advance leading-edge science through a dynamic and collaborative approach. This enables us to find better solutions for treating the world’s most challenging diseases. We focus on discovering, developing and delivering drugs in therapeutic areas where we have proven expertise—and can make an impact. This includes:

Immunology
Oncology
Neuroscience
Virology
General Medicine










Partnerships: Working together to make a difference
Our partners share our commitment to solving the world’s greatest health needs. That’s why we collaborate with peers, universities, clinical experts, governments and advocacy groups to seek new solutions for patients throughout the world. By working together, we combine the best efforts, thinking and resources to find better solutions for patients.









Responsibility: Passionate about our work, responsible in our actions
At AbbVie, it’s both what we do and how we do it that matter. We go beyond medicine, using our resources to improve health care and communities. We’re committed to:

Improving health outcomes. We’re targeting unmet needs and working to enhance access to health care across geographies.
Operating responsibly. It’s the very basis of how AbbVie does business. We are committed to cultivating an ethical, transparent and inclusive culture to drive sustainable growth.
Contributing to communities. We’re passionate about partnering with our communities to address challenges of the underserved.










Culture: Fostering innovation and discovery
We are a diverse, inclusive organization with people who reflect the thousands of communities we serve around the world. For all of us, working at AbbVie is more than a job. It’s a purpose that leads to better lives for other people, across the world. When the stakes are as high as a patient’s well-being, the best ideas must rise to the top, no matter where they begin.













“Our 125-year legacy provides AbbVie a set of deeply held values. These guide our way, driving how we treat our patients and each other and how we design our strategies and operate our business. And they keep us focused on what matters most—our patients and our people.”













Our History
AbbVie may have been founded in 2013, but our roots run deep. In 2013, we became a separate company from Abbott, though we share a common legacy and strong prospects for future success.
Our name represents our connection to the past and the future. When we became our own company, AbbVie formed a new kind of enterprise—a biopharmaceutical company. We blend the stability, global scale, resources and commercial capabilities of a pharmaceutical company with the focus and culture of a biotech.
Today, our ~29,000 employees around the world focus on delivering transformational medicines and therapies that offer significant patient benefits.

History[edit]
On October 19, 2011, Abbott Laboratories announced its plan to separate into two publicly traded companies. The "new" Abbott Laboratories would specialize in diversified products including medical devices, diagnostic equipment and nutrition products, while AbbVie would operate as a research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer.[2] The separation was effective January 1, 2013, and AbbVie was officially listed on the New York Stock Exchange (ABBV) on January 2, 2013.[3]
According to Miles White, CEO at the time, the purpose of the split was to allow markets to value the two businesses separately; White said that investors would "benefit from two fundamentally different investment opportunities with distinct strategic profiles and business priorities."[4] Some investors were concerned that the split was done to protect the value of the device business from the loss of value facing the drug division due to the imminent expiration of patents on Humira, which accounted for about half of the drug division's revenue.[4]
As of December 2015, the company employed in excess of 28,000 globally, and provided products to individuals in more than 170 countries.[5]
In January 2014, the company acquired ImmuVen for an undisclosed sum.[6] On September 3, 2014, AbbVie and Infinity Pharmaceuticals announced that they had entered into a global collaboration to develop and commercialize duvelisib, Infinity's PI3K inhibitor for the treatment of patients with cancer. On the same day, AbbVie and Calico announced that they had entered into a R&D collaboration intended to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases including neurodegeneration and cancer. Calico (California Life Company) is an Alphabet Inc. subsidiary led by Arthur D. Levinson (former Chairman and CEO of Genentech) and Hal V. Barron (former Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Genentech) that is focused on aging and age-related diseases.[7]
In October 2014, after a long negotiation, Abbvie stopped its efforts to acquire Shire, which would have been one of the largest M&A deals of that year; Abbvie had to pay a $1.6 billion breakup fee.[8]
On March 4, 2015, AbbVie announced its agreement to acquire the oncology firm Pharmacyclics and its treatment for blood cancers, ibrutinib; AstraZeneca had also been bidding to acquire Pharmacyclics.[9][10] Under the terms of the transaction, AbbVie agreed to pay $261.25 per share as a mix of cash and AbbVie equity. The acquisition valued at approximately $21 billion was completed on May 26, 2015.[11] The Pharmacyclics name was retained, and it operates as a subsidiary of AbbVie from its previous Sunnyvale, California, headquarters.[12] On June 3, 2015, AbbVie and Halozyme Therapeutics announced that they had entered into a global collaboration and licensing agreement to develop and commercialize products that combine AbbVie’s treatments and Halozyme’s ENHANZE drug-delivery technology, this was terminated in November 2016.[13]
According to the Wall Street Journal as of January 2016 ibrutinib, a specialty drug, cost US$116,600 to $155,400 a year wholesale in the United States. In spite of discounts and medical insurance, the prohibitive price causes some patients to not fill their prescriptions.[14] AbbVie estimates global sales of the drug at $1 billion in 2016 and $5 billion in 2020.[14]
On February 10, 2016, AbbVie and Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Synlogic announced a multi-year R&D collaboration. Synlogic is a synthetic biology company built on research from the labs of James Collins and Tim Lu at MIT. As part of the collaboration, AbbVie is getting worldwide rights to Synlogic’s probiotic-based technology for treating inflammatory bowel disease, and the research teams will focus on Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.[15] In April 2016, the company partnered with the University of Chicago to investigate a number of areas of oncology: breast, lung, prostate, colorectal and hematological cancers.[16] In the same month the company announced it would co-commercialize Argenx's preclinical immunotherapy, ARGX-115. ARGX-115 is a first-in-class immunotherapy targeting GARP (glycoprotein A repetitions predominant), a membrane protein believed to enhance the immunosuppressive effects of T cells.[17] The company also announced a deal to co-develop/commercialize at least one of CytomX Probody's conjugates against CD71 (transferrin receptor 1).[18]
On 28 April 2016, the company announced it would acquire Stemcentrx for up to $9.8 billion.[19] A day later, the company announced an expansion of a two and a half year old cystic fibrosis deal with Galapagos, potentially doubling milestone payments to $600 million.[20]
Acquisitions[edit]
The following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors (this is not a comprehensive list):

Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 AbbVie shares are mainly held by institutional investors (Capital Group Companies,The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation and others[21]).
Products[edit]
AbbVie developed adalimumab, which is marketed under the trade name Humira, a biopharmaceutical treatment for autoimmune diseases that has exceeded $10 billion in global sales. AbbVie’s portfolio of medicines also includes AndroGel, Creon, Duodopa and Duopa, Kaletra, Lupron, Niaspan, Norvir, Sevoflurane, Synagis, Synthroid, TriCor and Trilipix, Viekira and Zemplar.

History[edit]
On October 19, 2011, Abbott Laboratories announced its plan to separate into two publicly traded companies. The "new" Abbott Laboratories would specialize in diversified products including medical devices, diagnostic equipment and nutrition products, while AbbVie would operate as a research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer.[2] The separation was effective January 1, 2013, and AbbVie was officially listed on the New York Stock Exchange (ABBV) on January 2, 2013.[3]
According to Miles White, CEO at the time, the purpose of the split was to allow markets to value the two businesses separately; White said that investors would "benefit from two fundamentally different investment opportunities with distinct strategic profiles and business priorities."[4] Some investors were concerned that the split was done to protect the value of the device business from the loss of value facing the drug division due to the imminent expiration of patents on Humira, which accounted for about half of the drug division's revenue.[4]
As of December 2015, the company employed in excess of 28,000 globally, and provided products to individuals in more than 170 countries.[5]
In January 2014, the company acquired ImmuVen for an undisclosed sum.[6] On September 3, 2014, AbbVie and Infinity Pharmaceuticals announced that they had entered into a global collaboration to develop and commercialize duvelisib, Infinity's PI3K inhibitor for the treatment of patients with cancer. On the same day, AbbVie and Calico announced that they had entered into a R&D collaboration intended to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases including neurodegeneration and cancer. Calico (California Life Company) is an Alphabet Inc. subsidiary led by Arthur D. Levinson (former Chairman and CEO of Genentech) and Hal V. Barron (former Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Genentech) that is focused on aging and age-related diseases.[7]
In October 2014, after a long negotiation, Abbvie stopped its efforts to acquire Shire, which would have been one of the largest M&A deals of that year; Abbvie had to pay a $1.6 billion breakup fee.[8]
On March 4, 2015, AbbVie announced its agreement to acquire the oncology firm Pharmacyclics and its treatment for blood cancers, ibrutinib; AstraZeneca had also been bidding to acquire Pharmacyclics.[9][10] Under the terms of the transaction, AbbVie agreed to pay $261.25 per share as a mix of cash and AbbVie equity. The acquisition valued at approximately $21 billion was completed on May 26, 2015.[11] The Pharmacyclics name was retained, and it operates as a subsidiary of AbbVie from its previous Sunnyvale, California, headquarters.[12] On June 3, 2015, AbbVie and Halozyme Therapeutics announced that they had entered into a global collaboration and licensing agreement to develop and commercialize products that combine AbbVie’s treatments and Halozyme’s ENHANZE drug-delivery technology, this was terminated in November 2016.[13]
According to the Wall Street Journal as of January 2016 ibrutinib, a specialty drug, cost US$116,600 to $155,400 a year wholesale in the United States. In spite of discounts and medical insurance, the prohibitive price causes some patients to not fill their prescriptions.[14] AbbVie estimates global sales of the drug at $1 billion in 2016 and $5 billion in 2020.[14]
On February 10, 2016, AbbVie and Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Synlogic announced a multi-year R&D collaboration. Synlogic is a synthetic biology company built on research from the labs of James Collins and Tim Lu at MIT. As part of the collaboration, AbbVie is getting worldwide rights to Synlogic’s probiotic-based technology for treating inflammatory bowel disease, and the research teams will focus on Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.[15] In April 2016, the company partnered with the University of Chicago to investigate a number of areas of oncology: breast, lung, prostate, colorectal and hematological cancers.[16] In the same month the company announced it would co-commercialize Argenx's preclinical immunotherapy, ARGX-115. ARGX-115 is a first-in-class immunotherapy targeting GARP (glycoprotein A repetitions predominant), a membrane protein believed to enhance the immunosuppressive effects of T cells.[17] The company also announced a deal to co-develop/commercialize at least one of CytomX Probody's conjugates against CD71 (transferrin receptor 1).[18]
On 28 April 2016, the company announced it would acquire Stemcentrx for up to $9.8 billion.[19] A day later, the company announced an expansion of a two and a half year old cystic fibrosis deal with Galapagos, potentially doubling milestone payments to $600 million.[20]
Acquisitions[edit]
The following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors (this is not a comprehensive list):

Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 AbbVie shares are mainly held by institutional investors (Capital Group Companies,The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation and others[21]).
Products[edit]
AbbVie developed adalimumab, which is marketed under the trade name Humira, a biopharmaceutical treatment for autoimmune diseases that has exceeded $10 billion in global sales. AbbVie’s portfolio of medicines also includes AndroGel, Creon, Duodopa and Duopa, Kaletra, Lupron, Niaspan, Norvir, Sevoflurane, Synagis, Synthroid, TriCor and Trilipix, Viekira and Zemplar.

Big Pharma & Medical Device ManufacturersAbbVie and AbbottAbbVieSpun off from Abbott Laboratories in January 2013, drug maker AbbVie now ranks 143 on Forbes’ list of the largest companies worldwide, pulling in at 71st in market value and 83 in sales, in spite of legal issues that have threatened some of its largest selling products.Jump To TopicBillion Dollar Making DrugsLawsuits & Challenges to Patent RightsLawsuits Over DrugsMedical MarijuanaCorporate HistoryJump To TopicSelect TopicBillion Dollar Making DrugsLawsuits & Challenges to Patent RightsLawsuits Over DrugsMedical MarijuanaCorporate HistoryEstablished: 2013 (History dates back to 1888)
Headquarters: Chicago, IL
Founder: Wallace C. Abbott
Size: 29,000 employees in 75 countries
Popular Products: Humira, Imbruvica, Viekira, Lupron, AndroGel, Marinol
2016 Revenue: $25.6 billion
AbbVie, the fledgling, research-based biopharmaceutical company, netted $18.8 billion in sales in its first year, growing to $25.6 billion in 2016, largely on the strength of Humira, its blockbuster arthritis drug. Now, the company, with 29,000 employees in 75 countries, markets more than 30 products and has more than 50 drugs in development.

The company focuses on four therapeutic areas where it says it has proven expertise. Those areas are:

Immunology
Oncology
Neuroscience
Virology


According to its website, AbbVie “takes on the toughest health challenges. But we do more than treat diseases — we aim to make a remarkable impact on people’s lives.”
Although the company has faced some legal issues, with lawsuits accusing it of fraudulent marketing of a testosterone-enhancing drug, for example, it has maintained a stellar reputation in the industry.
The Boston-based Reputation Institute announced in May 2017 that AbbVie had the best reputation among pharma companies. The ranking was based on more than 16,500 reputation rankings in eight markets, Brazil, France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.
In seven measured areas of reputation, AbbVie led in three of them: workplace, governance and citizenship.
“Since the company’s inception less than five years ago, we have worked to raise a better understanding of AbbVie among our key stakeholders,” said Laura Schumacher, executive vice president of external affairs at AbbVie. “We are pleased that these efforts have resonated with our global audience and driven greater understanding of who we are and what we stand for as a company.”
According to the reputation institute, higher reputation ratings translate in increases in the likelihood that people will recommend a company. “In a world where word of mouth is becoming more and more critical, reputation is proving to be a key driver of business success, and that’s why the leading companies are actively measuring and managing it,” said Kaspar Ulf Nielsen, an official at the Reputation Institute.
AbbVie’s Drugs Make Billions

Fact
Abbvie’s arthritis drug Humira is the world’s top-selling drug, bringing in $16 billion in 2016.

By far, AbbVie’s biggest sales generator — also the world’s top-selling drug — is the arthritis drug Humira, which brought in a jaw-dropping $16 billion in 2016. Forbes has called Humira one of the biggest selling products of all time.
To put that in some perspective, that’s more than the national government budgets of more than 100 countries, including Panama ($12.4 billion), Jordan ($11.2 billion), and Iceland ($7.9 billion).
All that revenue comes at a steep cost to patients, insurance companies and taxpayers, who can pay $50,000 a year or more per patient for the drug. AbbVie spends heavily marketing its crown jewel. In 2015, the company spent $357 million marketing Humira.
Also used to treat psoriasis and Crohn’s disease, Humira accounts for more than 62 percent of AbbVie’s total annual sales. Perhaps, not surprisingly, other pharmaceutical companies are looking for a piece of that action.

Humira works by blocking proteins called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) which are naturally produced by the immune system
Part of the reason for the high-level of revenue is that AbbVie doubled the price of the drug over a three-year period. The price actually went up about 3 percent every three months, according to one analyst.
Humira works by blocking certain proteins called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) which is naturally produced by the immune symptom. An overproduction of the proteins has been linked to Crohn’s disease and other inflammation conditions.
AbbVie Lawsuits and Challenges to Patent Rights
Humira is the focus of patent fights, as rivals seek to make generic versions known as biosimilars, and AbbVie tries to stave them off by filing new patents to keep the generics off the market. AbbVie has filed more than 70 new patents on Humira covering such things as formulations, manufacturing methods and uses. In May 2017, AbbVie lost a round to the company Coherus on a case in which it challenged one of AbbVie’s patents. However, according to Fortune, other patents should protect Abbvie’s sales through 2022.
“Any company seeking to market a biosimilar version of Humira will have to contend with this extensive patent estate, which AbbVie intends to enforce vigorously,” said AbbVie Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard A. Gonzalez, according to The New York Times.





“Any company seeking to market a biosimilar version of Humira will have to contend with this extensive patent estate, which AbbVie intends to enforce vigorously.”- Richard A. Gonzalez, AbbVie Chairman and Chief Executive Officer





But AbbVie isn’t relying solely on Humira in the arthritis market. It’s positioning a new drug, Upadacitinib, which in June 2017 succeeded in a late-stage study on patients who hadn’t responded well to other treatments. If the new drug gets the go-ahead from the FDA, it could ease the company’s reliance on Humira.
Patients Allege Drug Injuries
Humira has also been the subject of some litigation by people who say they were injured after taking the drug.
Abbott was ordered by a jury in 2013 to pay a North Dakota family $2.24 million in the case of Delores Tietz, who took the drug for almost seven months in 2009 until suffering from a fungal infection caused by the drug. She spent 13 months in the hospital and had to undergo physical and speech therapy.

Close up of histoplasmosis, an invasive fungal infection
The FDA in 2008 required the makers of TNF blocking drugs like Humira to strengthen existing warnings on the risk of developing fungal infections after some patients with the infections died. Although the risk of serious infections had been included in the prescribing information since the drugs were approved, the FDA said health care professionals weren’t always recognizing cases of histoplasmosis and other invasive fungal infections, leading to some delays in treatment.
In 2009, the FDA required makers of TNF blockers, including Humira, to update the boxed warning to alert healthcare professionals of an increased risk of lymphoma and other malignancies in children and adolescents treated with the drugs.
Other Top Performers
Although their revenue isn’t anywhere near Humira’s, other AbbVie top performers include Imbruvica (cancer drug), with $1.8 billion in 2016 world sales; Viekira (hepatitis C) at $1.5 billion, and Lupron (synthetic hormone), coming in at $821 million. Then there’s, Synthroid (thyroid) at $763 million and Synagis (prevents severe respiratory disease in infants) and Creon (replaces pancreatic enzymes) each at $730 million. Troubled testosterone booster AndroGel generated $675 million in sales in 2016, a tumble from 2013 when sales were at $1.4 billion. Sales of the drug dropped precipitously in 2015 after the Food and Drug Administration required a warning that testosterone supplements could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
AbbVie has sought FDA approval to market Imbruvica for additional conditions, including chronic graft-versus-host disease.
Lawsuits Over Some of AbbVie’s Drugs
The company faces thousands of lawsuits from men who say they suffered heart attacks and other injuries after taking AndroGel. The plaintiffs accuse the company and others of fabricating a condition called “Low T” in order to explode the market for a product that had been received FDA approval for a specific disease. The company is also accused of failing to disclose known risks associated with taking the drug.

AndroGel was marketed as a solution to the natural symptoms of aging
AbbVie and other companies are defendants in more than 4,000 lawsuits in federal court in multidistrict litigation Chicago, as well as hundreds of cases in various state courts. The lawsuits allege AbbVie aggressively marketed AndroGel as the solution to the natural symptoms of aging, such as fatigue and grumpiness. The plaintiffs say they were injured when they took the drug, which had risks that were known as far back as the 1970s but were never disclosed to patients.
AbbVie says the FDA approval process and regulations were followed, and that its marketing practices were covered by the First Amendment. It is also challenging whether AndroGel caused the specific injuries suffered. In a statement emailed to Bloomberg, AbbVie spokeswoman Toni Haubert said, “We believe our disease education and marketing of AndroGel have adhered strictly to FDA-approved uses and are in full compliance with applicable standards.”
AbbVie also sells the anti-seizure drug Depakote, but it is not one of the company’s top sellers. In 2012, Abbott agreed to pay $1.6 billion for illegal marketing of the drug, which is the focus of lawsuits over birth defects suffered by children of mothers who took it during pregnancy. In February 2017, a federal jury in Cleveland ruled in favor of Abbott and AbbVie in the case of a woman who had sued the companies claiming they were responsible for her son’s birth defects after she took Depakote while pregnant.
Medical Marijuana
Another of Abbvie’s drugs, Marinol, has caused some analysts to classify Abbvie as a medical marijuana maker. That’s because Marinol’s active ingredients is a synthetic cannabinoid — man-made delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol or THC.

Marinol was the first FDA-approved cannabis drug
Marinol received FDA approval in 1985 for chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting and in 1992 to treat anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS. It was the first FDA-approved cannabis drug.
Marinol was developed by Solvay Pharmaceuticals; In 2010 Abbott bought Solvay’s pharmaceutical division, including Marinol. Abbvie doesn’t release its sales numbers, but analysts think they may be suffering because of the availability of generic versions of the drug. According to one report, Solvay said in 2007 that the drug had generated more than $100 million, but those numbers sank to less than half of that when generics came on the market the following year.
AbbVie’s Corporate History
Although AbbVie is relatively new, it builds on the 125-year history of Abbott Laboratories, founded in 1888 by Dr. Wallace C. Abbott started making tiny “dosimetric granules,” tiny pills made from medicinal plants, which he sold in his drugstore in Chicago.
Abbott announced the planned split in 2011, maintaining the parts of the business that concentrated on medical devices such as heart stents, and allowing AbbVie to focus on research-based pharmaceuticals. The company says its name represents its connection to the past and future.
Analysts said the spinoff allowed investors to choose levels of risk and possible reward, with the pharmaceuticals having higher levels of both potential risk and possible payoff. AbbVie was led from the outset by Gonzalez, a veteran Abbott executive.
Since it split from Abbott, AbbVie has increased its annual research and development investment from $2.8 billion in 2013 to $4.15 billion in 2016. And it says its revenue and earnings have grown every year since it became a stand-alone entity.

Big Pharma & Medical Device ManufacturersBig Pharma and Medical Device ManufacturersBig Pharma is the nickname given to the world's vast and influential pharmaceutical industry and its trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or PhRMA. Big Pharma and medical device companies make billions of dollars every year selling drugs and devices — including those that were recalled or involved in fraud or product liability lawsuits.Jump To TopicAbout Big PharmaBig Pharma’s InfluenceBig Pharma Sways OpinionsInfluencing Doctors & ResearchersFraud SettlementsManufacturer DirectoryJump To TopicSelect TopicAbout Big PharmaBig Pharma’s InfluenceBig Pharma Sways OpinionsInfluencing Doctors & ResearchersFraud SettlementsManufacturer DirectoryThe pharmaceutical industry — nicknamed Big Pharma — is one of the most powerful industries in the world. The global revenue for pharmaceuticals was over $1 trillion in 2014. But nowhere else in the world do the drug and medical device industries have as much power and make as much money as in the U.S.
In fact, Americans spent an all-time high of $457 billion on prescription drugs in 2015. By 2020, it will be $610 billion. Medical devices are also lucrative. The U.S. makes up about half of the world’s share of the market at about $148 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.

US based big pharma companies
Meanwhile, drug prices continue to rise. Consulting firm Segal Consulting expects drug prices for Americans under age 65 to rise 11.6 percent in 2017. In contrast, wages are only expected to rise 2.5 percent, leaving many American unable to afford their medications.
Big Pharma even contributes heavily to the annual budget of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through application fees (user fees) for its new products. Experts say the industry contributes about two thirds of the FDA’s budget.
Five of the top 10 pharma and medical device companies for 2016 are headquartered in the U.S.: Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Merck, Gilead and AbbVie.
The underside of the industry reveals a history of fraud, bribery, product liability lawsuits and scandals that led to billions in settlements — a known cost of doing business for these companies who are “too big to jail.” Despite criminal charges and fines, the companies continue to do business.
Who is Big Pharma?
The majority of drugs and medical devices have ties to a small group of parent companies. Prescription drugs and devices manufactured by these companies bring in billions in profits. The biggest drug makers may also have subsidiaries that manufacture medical devices.
Pharmaceutical companies are typically larger and make more money than companies that focus on medical devices.


The most powerful drug and device companies are members of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) — the industry’s U.S. lobbying organization.

With the help of staggering profits and an army of 1,378 paid lobbyists, the industry spreads its influence on Capitol Hill. From 1998 to 2016, Big Pharma spent nearly $3.5 billion on lobbying expenses — more than any other industry. In 2016 alone, it spent about $246 million — more than the defense industries and corporate business lobbyists combined.

Fact
Only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma.

Only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma. In fact, they are the second most hated industry in the U.S. They are also the biggest defrauder of the Federal Government under the False Claims Act, according to consumer watchdog group Public Citizen.
The Reputation Institute evaluated public perception of 17 pharmaceutical companies for products and services, innovation, workplace, governance, citizenship and financial performance. The Institute based its results on 16,800 ratings from the U.S., U.K., Canada and other countries.
Of all the countries, the U.S. had the lowest opinion of pharmaceutical companies. Older people had the most favorable view of the industry.

Medical Device Manufacturers
Medical devices can be anything from hospital diagnostic equipment to hip and knee implants. Several companies only produce medical devices, but some drug manufacturers, such as Johnson & Johnson, also manufacture devices.

Fact
Part of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA).

Like Big Pharma, medical device manufacturers also have a lobbying group to pursue their interests in Washington.Part of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA).
In 2016, it contributed $1.2 million in lobbying funds. Its efforts concentrate on medical device friendly bills in Congress mostly related to how companies pay taxes.
Five of the top medical devices companies have their headquarters in the U.S.: Johnson & Johnson, Baxter International, Abbott Laboratories, Stryker and Boston Scientific.

Big Pharma’s Influence
Critics contend that Big Pharma uses manipulative tactics and expensive advertising to sway lawmakers, the FDA and the public to increase sales.
The public is exposed to Pharma’s misleading promotions and advertising. For example, critics say AbbVie and other companies who make testosterone replacement drugs such as AndroGel marketed their drugs as the fountain of youth to older men. They created a marketing campaign around the condition “Low T” that featured a quiz for men to self-diagnose Low T symptoms.

Androgel, above, was marketed as the “fountain of youth” with few studies to back it up
The testosterone market soared into the billions as a result. But few studies back up drug-company claims that the drug significantly enhances mood, vitality and sexual performance. Studies also link these drugs to heart problems. The FDA added a warning on the label after millions of men were already exposed to the risk.
The American public is not the only sector of society influenced by Big Pharma’s techniques. Doctors, scientists and research organizations, medical journals, teaching hospitals and university medical schools all exhibit disturbing conflicts of interest between their publicly stated missions and their financial and ideological subjection to Big Pharma.
Doctors conduct research with funds from Big Pharma. Private charities and foundations account for a mere 5 percent of the estimated $100 billion spent on biomedical research in the U.S. each year. Pharmaceutical and medical device companies contribute approximately 60 percent.
Big Pharma has a track record of hiring former government workers with valuable connections to gain political clout.

 The trade group PhRMA has many current or former staff members who once served in the political arena, including:

36 who worked for a member of Congress
13 who worked for a federal agency
12 who worked for a congressional committee
Two who worked for the White House
One who worked in the court system


Using these connections to pursue industry goals, Big Pharma has a significant competitive advantage over the public interest.
Marketing, Research and Development (R&D) and Drug Cost
Americans pay more than any other country in the world for pharmaceuticals — in some cases, thousands of dollars more per prescription. Big Pharma says this occurs because of the astronomical costs of developing a new drug.

Cost Facts
While companies claim each new drug costs them $1.2 billion, the true cost is more like 60 million.

The truth is that U.S. law allows drug companies to set the prices for drugs and protects them from free-market competition. Other countries set a limit on what companies can charge based on the benefit of the drug. The true cost of developing a drug is shrouded in mystery, with many unverifiable figures reported by Big Pharma.
Donald Light, a professor and expert on the pharma business model, said that while companies claim each new drug costs them $1.2 billion, the true cost is more like 60 million.
The industry also avoids talking about how much it spends on marketing, which is almost double what it spends on research.
Big Pharma Sways Opinions
The large amount of cash Big Pharma bestows on government representatives and regulatory bodies is small when compared with the billions it spends each year on direct-to-consumer advertising. The U.S. is one of only two countries in the world whose governments allow prescription drugs to be advertised on TV (the other is New Zealand).


In 2015, Big Pharma spent $5.4 billion on direct-to-consumer ads and fired off about 80 ads an hour, according to Nielsen.

Big Pharma also employs doctors, researchers and institutions.
The industry persuades doctors to allow ghostwriting, paying physicians to attach their names to positive articles about a particular drug with the goal of seeing it published in a reputable medical journal.

Paid copywriters were used in advertising Paxil,
above
Often the commentary is little more than an advertisement penned by a company paid copywriter showcasing a new product. Big Pharma used ghostwriting to promote numerous drugs, including the antidepressant Paxil, the recalled weight loss drug Fen-Phen, the anti-epilepsy drug Neurontin, the antidepressant Zoloft and painkiller Vioxx, to name a few.
In addition, even when a medical reviewer writes a comprehensive assessment of a new drug for a medical journal, it is common practice for those supposedly unbiased professionals to be on Big Pharma’s payroll.
These slanted studies appear in medical journals that are widely hailed as collections of unbiased scientific evaluation and separated from the long financial arm of pharmaceutical industry influence. Yet Richard Smith, former editor of the British Medical Journal, says, “All journals are bought — or at least cleverly used — by the pharmaceutical industry.”

Big Pharma tends to weaken the objectivity of even the most honest health professionals while encouraging them to overprescribe medications. Consider the numbers:

Advertising instead of research: For every $1 spent on “basic research,” Big Pharma spends $19 on promotions and advertising.
Distribution of free drug samples: The U.S. has one pharmaceutical sales representative for every five office-based physicians.
Sponsorship of symposiums and medical conventions: Drug and medical device makers spend lavishly on doctors, including covering meals, travel, seminars and conventions that sometimes look more like vacations.


Many medical journals, including the esteemed Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), actively vie for the attention of Big Pharma advertising dollars, billing themselves as the best way for drug companies to reach their professional readership.
How Big Pharma Influences Doctors and Researchers
Part of Big Pharma’s formula for creating blockbuster drugs is promoting to physicians and providing kickbacks and incentives to prescribe their expensive, brand name drugs.

Fact
In 2012, Big Pharma spent $24 billion on physician advertising, according to Pew Charitable Trusts.

Drug companies also buy doctors meals and pay them for “speaking engagements” in exchange for brand loyalty. One 2016 study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that when drug reps bought doctors just one meal costing less than $20 they were more likely to prescribe a promoted brand name drug.
According to ProPublica’s Dollars for Docs investigation, 1,866 companies paid $6.25 billion to doctors and hospitals from August 2013 to December 2015.

Drug and Device Company Payments to Doctors from Select Companies, August 2013 to December 2015:

DePuy (Johnson & Johnson)
$167 million


Stryker Corporation

Big Pharma and Researchers
Then there are medical researchers, who are hardly immune to Big Pharma’s financial power. Because drug companies sponsor clinical trials that researchers are paid to administer, too often the academics and scientists are hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to the instructions of their corporate employers.
Sponsors keep the data, analyze it, write the papers and decide whether and when and where to submit them for publication. Drug companies also stage-manage trials to produce predetermined outcomes that will put their products in the best light.
Medical Schools and Big Pharma
Big Pharma has also infiltrated medical schools. Teachers, department chairs and deans often sit on drug companies’ boards of directors. This influences educational content. Money from Big Pharma supports programs within many medical schools and teaching hospitals, and company reps are given access to young doctors to promote their company’s drugs.


The result is that doctors not only receive biased information but also learn a drug-intensive style of medicine.

Sales reps may influence these doctors to believe that newer, more expensive drugs are always better than old ones.
In most states, doctors must also take accredited education courses, called continuing medical education (CME). The pharmaceutical industry provides a substantial proportion of the billions spent on CME annually and continues to use that support as a marketing tool.
In addition, academic centers are able to receive royalties from Big Pharma on any drug or technology they help to create and patent as a result of research — sometimes underwritten with government funds.
Columbia University, for example, received nearly $790 million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companies during the 17-year life of its medical school’s patent on a method for synthesizing certain biological products.
Columbia University received nearly $790 million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companiesBig Pharma Fraud Settlements
In a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements totaling $35.7 billion for marketing fraud, according to Public Citizen’s 2013 report Pharmaceutical Industry Settlements: 1991 through 2015.

Fact
In a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements totaling $35.7 billion for marketing fraud.

The most common charge involved drug-pricing scams against state Medicaid programs. This meant state taxpayers ended up footing the bill while Big Pharma made billions.
Unlawful promotion of drugs yielded the biggest settlements. But these investigations take many years to complete. By then, drug companies have made hundreds of millions or even several billion, while the U.S. Department of Justice fine is typically only a few million.
This makes it too profitable to stop breaking the law for many companies, according to Michael Bobelian of Forbes Magazine.

AbbVie: Dependence On Key Product Risky - AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»AbbVie: Dependence On Key Product RiskyApr. 6.17 | About: AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) New Age Investing Long only, value, Growth, banksSummaryThe most substantial risks for AbbVie Inc. are stemming from its high business concentration on key markets, key customers, and key products.Few wholesalers make large portion of revenues for AbbVie, that dependence grants the wholesalers a significant purchasing power over ABBV.A buyer should have a medium- to long-term investment horizon to be able to withstand some stock price drop due to a potential decline of the company’s market share.AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is one of the leaders in sophisticated immunology, infectious disease, and oncology drugs development. Industry perspectives are bright given the demographical situation in the US. The most substantial risks for ABBV are stemming from its high business concentration. Reliance on key markets, key customers, and key products may affect the company's profitability significantly. The company's business is mostly concentrated in the US which accounted for about 62.1% of total revenues in FY2016. This dependence has actually been increasing steadily from 54.3% in FY2014.The company is also heavily reliant on its key customers. ABBV discloses that in FY2016, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of the US sales. Another vague disclosure that "no individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 41% of FY2016 gross revenues" indicates that most likely the largest wholesaler accounted for about 40% of total revenues. Potentially such dependence grants the wholesalers a significant purchasing power over ABBV. And this is actually a problem. The company reports that rebates given to customers increased twice for the last three years and totaled $10.8bn in 2016 (sharp rise from $8.6bn in 2015 and $5.9bn in 2014). Although most of these rebates are attributable to ABBV's participation in Medicare, the amounts given up to wholesalers also increased from $2.8bn in FY2014 to $4.0bn in FY2016. These rebates slow down the revenue growth (+12.2% YoY in FY2016).
 The external operating environment is ambiguous. Indeed, the pharmaceutical industry is on the rise given the demographical statistics in the key United States market. Percentage of population aged 60 and older (key group of ABBV's customers) has increased from 17.4% to 19.9% of the total US population in the 6-year period ended in 2015 and will most likely grow at a similar rate in the foreseeable future given fertility rates of less than 2.0 common to developed countries. From the other perspective, as the rest of the drug manufacturers, the company is exposed to risks arising from potential withdrawal / reducing of effective term of its patents after which cheaper "generic" analogs may enter the market and take a significant part of it due to a lower price. The latter is particularly important given the company's high dependence on revenues from a single product. Humira, the top-selling immunology drug, accounted for 63% of ABBV sales. The problem is that US patent for this drug already expired in December 2016 and the equivalent EU patent is expected to expire in the majority of the European countries in October 2018. The company is somewhat protected from generics by the fact that the drug is a biologic (manufactured in a living system and not synthesized) and cannot be that easily reproduced but the risks are still significant. Given this lack of earnings diversity, the company is quite active in M&A activities but its capacity for acquisitions is limited to the already significant debt. The company is heavily leveraged with Debt / Equity ratio of 7.9x, almost unchanged from 8.1x in FY2015. This is partially mitigated by the large amount of cash and equivalents - $6.4bn at end-FY2016 (including short-term investments). At the same time, the amount of long-term debt increased by 16.6% to a solid amount of $36bn. The increase was attributable to two large acquisitions of Pharmacyclics and Stemcentrx - the company is striving to diversify its revenue sources. In mid-2016 Moody's downgraded ABBV to 'Baa2' / 'Stable' and the main agency's concerns were also related to the elevated leverage ratios.
 In profitability terms ABBV is performing well. Net income is solid with a 15.7% increase in FY2016. The company also enjoys high margins. Namely, net profit margin exceeded 23% and operating margin was above 36% in FY2016 with the former being stable YoY and the latter increased by 3%. Almost all the foreign exposures totaling $8.8bn are hedged and the seasoned management team knows how to benefit from interest rate differential in the capital markets. In November 2016 the company issued Euro-denominated notes with only 0.55% rate for the bonds maturing in 2019 and foreign currency exposure was also fully hedged. The dividend yield is quite high at 3.9% and cash dividends per share have been growing for the last two year after a 12.5% decrease in FY2014. The company is expected to be more volatile than the market as indicated be its beta of about 1.5. At the same time, it outperformed the market and the relevant NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index over the last 4 years (by roughly 25% and 45% respectively). Currently, the P/E ratio is average at about 18x indicating a good time for a buy. Given the strong operating performance, ABBV may be a suitable purchase for a stable income-minded investor. A buyer should have a medium- to long-term investment horizon to be able to withstand some stock price drop due to a potential decline of the company's market share.

History[edit]
On October 19, 2011, Abbott Laboratories announced its plan to separate into two publicly traded companies. The "new" Abbott Laboratories would specialize in diversified products including medical devices, diagnostic equipment and nutrition products, while AbbVie would operate as a research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer.[2] The separation was effective January 1, 2013, and AbbVie was officially listed on the New York Stock Exchange (ABBV) on January 2, 2013.[3]
According to Miles White, CEO at the time, the purpose of the split was to allow markets to value the two businesses separately; White said that investors would "benefit from two fundamentally different investment opportunities with distinct strategic profiles and business priorities."[4] Some investors were concerned that the split was done to protect the value of the device business from the loss of value facing the drug division due to the imminent expiration of patents on Humira, which accounted for about half of the drug division's revenue.[4]
As of December 2015, the company employed in excess of 28,000 globally, and provided products to individuals in more than 170 countries.[5]
In January 2014, the company acquired ImmuVen for an undisclosed sum.[6] On September 3, 2014, AbbVie and Infinity Pharmaceuticals announced that they had entered into a global collaboration to develop and commercialize duvelisib, Infinity's PI3K inhibitor for the treatment of patients with cancer. On the same day, AbbVie and Calico announced that they had entered into a R&D collaboration intended to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases including neurodegeneration and cancer. Calico (California Life Company) is an Alphabet Inc. subsidiary led by Arthur D. Levinson (former Chairman and CEO of Genentech) and Hal V. Barron (former Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Genentech) that is focused on aging and age-related diseases.[7]
In October 2014, after a long negotiation, Abbvie stopped its efforts to acquire Shire, which would have been one of the largest M&A deals of that year; Abbvie had to pay a $1.6 billion breakup fee.[8]
On March 4, 2015, AbbVie announced its agreement to acquire the oncology firm Pharmacyclics and its treatment for blood cancers, ibrutinib; AstraZeneca had also been bidding to acquire Pharmacyclics.[9][10] Under the terms of the transaction, AbbVie agreed to pay $261.25 per share as a mix of cash and AbbVie equity. The acquisition valued at approximately $21 billion was completed on May 26, 2015.[11] The Pharmacyclics name was retained, and it operates as a subsidiary of AbbVie from its previous Sunnyvale, California, headquarters.[12] On June 3, 2015, AbbVie and Halozyme Therapeutics announced that they had entered into a global collaboration and licensing agreement to develop and commercialize products that combine AbbVie’s treatments and Halozyme’s ENHANZE drug-delivery technology, this was terminated in November 2016.[13]
According to the Wall Street Journal as of January 2016 ibrutinib, a specialty drug, cost US$116,600 to $155,400 a year wholesale in the United States. In spite of discounts and medical insurance, the prohibitive price causes some patients to not fill their prescriptions.[14] AbbVie estimates global sales of the drug at $1 billion in 2016 and $5 billion in 2020.[14]
On February 10, 2016, AbbVie and Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Synlogic announced a multi-year R&D collaboration. Synlogic is a synthetic biology company built on research from the labs of James Collins and Tim Lu at MIT. As part of the collaboration, AbbVie is getting worldwide rights to Synlogic’s probiotic-based technology for treating inflammatory bowel disease, and the research teams will focus on Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.[15] In April 2016, the company partnered with the University of Chicago to investigate a number of areas of oncology: breast, lung, prostate, colorectal and hematological cancers.[16] In the same month the company announced it would co-commercialize Argenx's preclinical immunotherapy, ARGX-115. ARGX-115 is a first-in-class immunotherapy targeting GARP (glycoprotein A repetitions predominant), a membrane protein believed to enhance the immunosuppressive effects of T cells.[17] The company also announced a deal to co-develop/commercialize at least one of CytomX Probody's conjugates against CD71 (transferrin receptor 1).[18]
On 28 April 2016, the company announced it would acquire Stemcentrx for up to $9.8 billion.[19] A day later, the company announced an expansion of a two and a half year old cystic fibrosis deal with Galapagos, potentially doubling milestone payments to $600 million.[20]
Acquisitions[edit]
The following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors (this is not a comprehensive list):

ImmuVen








Pharmacyclics








Stemcentrx












Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 AbbVie shares are mainly held by institutional investors (Capital Group Companies,The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation and others[21]).
Products[edit]
AbbVie developed adalimumab, which is marketed under the trade name Humira, a biopharmaceutical treatment for autoimmune diseases that has exceeded $10 billion in global sales. AbbVie’s portfolio of medicines also includes AndroGel, Creon, Duodopa and Duopa, Kaletra, Lupron, Niaspan, Norvir, Sevoflurane, Synagis, Synthroid, TriCor and Trilipix, Viekira and Zemplar.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
