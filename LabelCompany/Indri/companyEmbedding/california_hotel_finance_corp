 Ten Things to Know About Hotel Financing in 2017
Written by Live Oak Bank 

Adequate hotel financing continues to be a major resource for U.S. hoteliers. New construction and renovation projects are typically complex and expensive, so here are ten things you need to know about your funding options and industry trends as we move into 2017.
USDA Loans. Department of Agriculture loans are a viable funding option depending upon property location. They offer competitive interest rates as opposed to conventional rates and allow for higher leverage. Check with your lender to see if you’re eligible.
SBA Loans. Small Business Administration loans continue to be great options for hoteliers that have never had this type of loan and meet the requirements. Some SBA loans offer longer amortization periods and interest only periods that help ease cash flow during the ramp-up period.
Conventional Loans. Conventional capital for new development and construction is likely to continue decreasing, even if you’re a highly experienced and solvent borrower. Due to fears of an overbuilt marketplace, conventional banks will continue to shy away from these projects.
Creative Lending. In some cases, conventional capital can be layered into a comprehensive loan package with other types of loan proceeds. This innovative method is used by some lenders to achieve adequate project funding.
PIP Loans. Property improvement plans can be financed using conventional or SBA capital. These loans allow hoteliers to maintain their liquidity by keeping more capital while completing necessary renovations.
Refinance. With the continuing pullback of CMBS and life companies from the hotel lending market, it’s important to work with a trusted lender who understands the marketplace and various loan structures. Consider a lender who is committed to providing viable refinance options that meet your goals.
Flexibility. Flexible payment options, inclusion of closing costs and sufficient working capital in the final financing package are huge benefits. Not all lenders have the capacity to offer this, but hoteliers should seek these advantages.
Interest Rates. The continued suppression of interest rates could be artificially inflating real estate values which may lead to tightened underwriting standards. Thus, hoteliers may find that financial institutions are lowering loan to value thresholds and increasing minimum debt service coverage standards.
Construction Costs. These will likely continue to rise as they have in the recent past, making accessible financing even more valuable for hoteliers.
Preparedness. Most lenders will require a franchise comfort letter and want your loan terms to match your franchise agreement. Maximize your readiness for financing by obtaining the proper documents and organizing all required information.

 Five Keys to a Smooth Hotel PIP Renovation
Written by Live Oak Bank 

In the competitive hospitality industry, every hotel company is looking for ways to stand out from the crowd. The ability to boast a beautiful new lobby, reimagined guest rooms or innovative amenities is a pivotal step in attracting customers—benefitting both the franchisor and franchisee.
When completing a property improvement plan (PIP) required by a franchisor, hotel franchisees should give careful consideration to certain components and deadlines included in the agreement. Five key areas to take into account include financing, construction, legal, regulatory and negotiation. Paying close attention to these elements can help you maximize the advantages of a PIP and avoid potentially costly mistakes.
Of course, the details of these concerns will vary on a hotel-by-hotel basis. Your specific franchise or membership, the scope of your project, available hotel financing packages, branding and other unique components may prove significant. However, in general, getting advice from well-qualified professionals in each of these five areas will serve you well during a major renovation.

Financing: Simplify the Process

Property improvement plans are frequently very capital-intensive projects with complex financial implications. Seeking the best available loan programs for your particular project can be vital to meeting your obligations to the franchise. It can also facilitate the process and greatly benefit your business by wrapping up the renovations as quickly as possible and maintaining positive cash flow. Financing helps you maintain your liquidity, which is usually cheaper than raising equity on your own from investors.
The best route is to talk to a lender or bank that specializes in hotel financing. Loan programs like the Small Business Administration (SBA), in addition to conventional loans, are viable options and can be customized to meet your specific needs. Often these lenders can close and fund your project in less time than traditional banks because the process is streamlined for the hotel industry.
Another common option is leasing. Leasing the furniture, fixtures and equipment (FF&E) means that the lender owns the FF&E until the end of the lease contract, then the hotel owner purchases it from the lender. This option and other creative banking solutions are becoming increasingly popular alternatives that make PIPs easier to execute.

Construction: Managing the Details 

Will the franchisor select a qualified project manager, or will your business bear most of this responsibility? Have you prepared and submitted a timetable for meeting project goals? Who will draft, publicize, gather and review subcontractor bids? Before a major renovation, most franchisees will need to work closely with an assigned project manager to clarify in detail project goals and schedules. Such careful advance planning can help prevent cost overruns. Many hotel industry-focused banks can now assist you with the tasks involved in the construction phase.
There are as many reasons for construction schedule delays as there are pillows in hotels. Even when an authorized setback occurs, you still may find yourself contractually obligated to serve effective notice about anticipated completion dates. Consulting closely with your project manager helps ensure that everyone involved in your hotel renovation fully understands the expectations.

 Legal: Stick to the Contract

Gathering trusted legal advice at an early stage from an attorney who understands contract law and how the hotel industry operates can help you move forward efficiently. If you do experience a disruption in the course of implementing a property improvement plan, you’ll want to discuss performance obligations and deadline issues. For example, what if one of your major suppliers experiences a significant operational outage and can’t deliver your new FF&E on time? A modified time frame usually requires you to notify the franchisor about specific delays.
Also, consider that many franchises invest significant sums promoting hotel renovations and upgraded facilities. Should holdups occur, even for legitimate reasons, the documents underlying the plans for hotel renovations may require you to notify a specific office or individual in advance. Especially if your franchisor promotes thousands of hotels domestically or internationally, scheduling issues can figure prominently in maintaining a smooth business relationship. Even changing your brand within a single franchise often entails extensive planning, so make sure you understand and adhere closely to contractual provisions.

 Regulatory: From Ecology to Cocktails

Depending upon the extent of your project and the location of your hotel, you could encounter some regulatory issues as you prepare for renovations to begin. These concerns run the gamut from environmental factors—such as proposed refurbishments that impact environmentally fragile zones or endangered species of plants and animals—to the provision of public facilities, labor laws, and other bureaucratic matters.
If you plan to install a new upscale dining venue owned and operated directly by the hotel, you may need to check into local regulations relating to the sale and provision of alcoholic beverages. Typically, your franchisor will serve as a useful source of preliminary information about this issue since many chains possess extensive experience building and managing restaurants as well. Look to them as a valuable resource.

 Negotiation: Accomplishing Goals Together

Seeing eye-to-eye with the franchisor is normally a fluid process. Because you both have a sizable stake in the success of your business, it makes sense for both parties to come to a reasonable, mutual plan. No two hotel properties are the same; your hotel offers unique features, values, and challenges. Clearly communicate those to your franchise representatives while understanding that they have a brand to preserve and promote. Renovations should be viewed by both of you as an important and momentous step in the life of your hotel.
Success From Start to Finish
Carefully addressing the financing, construction, legal and regulatory issues of your PIP, then negotiating a fair plan with your franchise, is a wise path for everyone involved. At the end of the day, you are executing this PIP to enhance both the guest experience and your revenues. Advance planning will help you accomplish both.
As leading national experts in the hotel industry, Live Oak Bank assists hotel franchisees through its financing options and other phases of the hotel project. Our wealth of knowledge about this potentially complex hospitality industry is what separates us from other banks.

USDA Hotel Financing For Your Hotel Construction Project

Hotels Resource Center / USDA Financing for Your Hotel Construction Project








 USDA Financing for Your Hotel Construction Project
Written by Live Oak Bank 

Is your hotel property located in a rural or suburban community? If so, then your new development could be eligible for financing through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Business and Industry (B&I) Guaranteed Loan Program.
Purpose
The purpose of the B&I program is to enhance and expand economic growth opportunities available to business owners in rural communities. This is achieved by extending additional credit through guaranteed loans, which allows lenders more flexibility when offering terms and amounts to rural borrowers. Hotels are often ideal projects for this type of development financing depending upon location and other prerequisites.
Basic Criteria
To be eligible, a hotel borrower must have or propose a business that:

Resides in a USDA eligible area – check property address here
Positively impacts the local environment or economy;
Produces new employment opportunities for local citizens;
Focuses on and emphasizes water conservation; or
Promotes the construction and use of renewable energy systems like solar.

Ideal hotel borrowers have previous and extensive hotel ownership experience, as well as FICO credit scores of 665 or higher. All owners, individuals or entities, with at least a 20% ownership stake in the hotel, must be personal guarantors with full recourse.
Terms & Fees
The following illustrates certain terms and fees for hotel borrowers that meet the B&I program criteria.

The program leverages a blended amortization and maturity based upon the use of funds, which typically ranges from 22 to 28 years.
Interest rates are usually very competitive in comparison to conventional rates and are typically tied to the Prime Rate.
The guarantee structure is:

70% maximum for loans $5-10 million
60% maximum for loans over $10 million capping out at $25 million


LTV is up to 80%, but usually in the range of 72-78% due to certain ineligible budget costs in the Tangible Balance Sheet Equity (TBSE) test.
Standard fees are collected by the USDA, which is typically a guarantee fee of 3% and then a .25% renewal fee each subsequent year dependent on the outstanding guaranteed principle balance.

Most traditional banks and lenders don’t offer the USDA’s B&I program because of its unique process and standards. Unless you specialize in originating these loans, offering them can be more trouble than it’s worth for banks. Live Oak is one of the few that is committed to understanding and actively participating in this program for eligible hoteliers.
Also, the USDA lending process is frontloaded with more documentation and research than most other business loans. This makes the process more stringent at the beginning, but easier to close on the backend of the process if borrowers successfully survive the early gauntlet.
Getting Started
Live Oak is laser focused on innovation in financing and technology within niche industries like hotels. Therefore, we have streamlined the process as much as possible for borrowers looking to leverage the USDA B&I loan program. This translates to supreme confidence and transparency for our customers.
View our USDA Lending Process diagram.
Live Oak’s first step begins with project sizing and due diligence, which generally results in a project proposal letter to the borrower. From there, we support USDA environmental scoping, and order appraisal, IPR and Phase I. Next, our team completes the underwriting and submits a full application to the USDA.
The USDA’s first step starts with a pre-application review that hopefully results in pre-approval. Once Live Oak’s application is processed, the USDA oversees environmental scoping of the project site and any potential impacts due to development. They then submit a full application to an internal committee for further review. The goal of this phase of the process is to produce a conditional commitment from the USDA, which also triggers Live Oak to deliver a commitment letter to the borrower.
Meanwhile during this phase, you as the customer should provide both the lender and the USDA with full project details and a good faith deposit. The borrower will also concurrently support environmental scoping along with the lender. The borrower must obtain complete construction plans and provide any necessary support to the lender for the appraisal, IPR and Phase 1. Furthermore, any other required documents must be sent to the lender for underwriting. The result of this phase is an equity obligation by the borrower via an executed commitment letter.
Closing and Groundbreaking
Once Live Oak has delivered your commitment letter, we will begin completing our closing checklist and introduce our Construction Loan Department to the process. This specialized hotel construction team supports the USDA’s guarantee issuance process and helps you make plans with your contractor, architect, and any other construction vendors.
Meanwhile, the USDA will start processing Live Oak’s commitment and closing package with the end goal of a full guarantee issuance in mind.
At this point, you as the borrower should get:

TBSE statements certified by your CPA;
Continue to support Live Oak’s closing process with further required documents; and
Continue to support the USDA’s guarantee issuance process.

Of course, our ultimate goal is loan closing, full guarantee and groundbreaking of your new hotel property!
We’re ready when you are…

 Ten Things to Know About Hotel Financing in 2017
Written by Live Oak Bank 

Adequate hotel financing continues to be a major resource for U.S. hoteliers. New construction and renovation projects are typically complex and expensive, so here are ten things you need to know about your funding options and industry trends as we move into 2017.
USDA Loans. Department of Agriculture loans are a viable funding option depending upon property location. They offer competitive interest rates as opposed to conventional rates and allow for higher leverage. Check with your lender to see if you’re eligible.
SBA Loans. Small Business Administration loans continue to be great options for hoteliers that have never had this type of loan and meet the requirements. Some SBA loans offer longer amortization periods and interest only periods that help ease cash flow during the ramp-up period.
Conventional Loans. Conventional capital for new development and construction is likely to continue decreasing, even if you’re a highly experienced and solvent borrower. Due to fears of an overbuilt marketplace, conventional banks will continue to shy away from these projects.
Creative Lending. In some cases, conventional capital can be layered into a comprehensive loan package with other types of loan proceeds. This innovative method is used by some lenders to achieve adequate project funding.
PIP Loans. Property improvement plans can be financed using conventional or SBA capital. These loans allow hoteliers to maintain their liquidity by keeping more capital while completing necessary renovations.
Refinance. With the continuing pullback of CMBS and life companies from the hotel lending market, it’s important to work with a trusted lender who understands the marketplace and various loan structures. Consider a lender who is committed to providing viable refinance options that meet your goals.
Flexibility. Flexible payment options, inclusion of closing costs and sufficient working capital in the final financing package are huge benefits. Not all lenders have the capacity to offer this, but hoteliers should seek these advantages.
Interest Rates. The continued suppression of interest rates could be artificially inflating real estate values which may lead to tightened underwriting standards. Thus, hoteliers may find that financial institutions are lowering loan to value thresholds and increasing minimum debt service coverage standards.
Construction Costs. These will likely continue to rise as they have in the recent past, making accessible financing even more valuable for hoteliers.
Preparedness. Most lenders will require a franchise comfort letter and want your loan terms to match your franchise agreement. Maximize your readiness for financing by obtaining the proper documents and organizing all required information.

Hotels Resource Center / Five Keys to a Smooth Hotel PIP Renovation








 Five Keys to a Smooth Hotel PIP Renovation
Written by Live Oak Bank 

In the competitive hospitality industry, every hotel company is looking for ways to stand out from the crowd. The ability to boast a beautiful new lobby, reimagined guest rooms or innovative amenities is a pivotal step in attracting customers—benefitting both the franchisor and franchisee.
When completing a property improvement plan (PIP) required by a franchisor, hotel franchisees should give careful consideration to certain components and deadlines included in the agreement. Five key areas to take into account include financing, construction, legal, regulatory and negotiation. Paying close attention to these elements can help you maximize the advantages of a PIP and avoid potentially costly mistakes.
Of course, the details of these concerns will vary on a hotel-by-hotel basis. Your specific franchise or membership, the scope of your project, available hotel financing packages, branding and other unique components may prove significant. However, in general, getting advice from well-qualified professionals in each of these five areas will serve you well during a major renovation.

Financing: Simplify the Process

Property improvement plans are frequently very capital-intensive projects with complex financial implications. Seeking the best available loan programs for your particular project can be vital to meeting your obligations to the franchise. It can also facilitate the process and greatly benefit your business by wrapping up the renovations as quickly as possible and maintaining positive cash flow. Financing helps you maintain your liquidity, which is usually cheaper than raising equity on your own from investors.
The best route is to talk to a lender or bank that specializes in hotel financing. Loan programs like the Small Business Administration (SBA), in addition to conventional loans, are viable options and can be customized to meet your specific needs. Often these lenders can close and fund your project in less time than traditional banks because the process is streamlined for the hotel industry.
Another common option is leasing. Leasing the furniture, fixtures and equipment (FF&E) means that the lender owns the FF&E until the end of the lease contract, then the hotel owner purchases it from the lender. This option and other creative banking solutions are becoming increasingly popular alternatives that make PIPs easier to execute.

Construction: Managing the Details 

Will the franchisor select a qualified project manager, or will your business bear most of this responsibility? Have you prepared and submitted a timetable for meeting project goals? Who will draft, publicize, gather and review subcontractor bids? Before a major renovation, most franchisees will need to work closely with an assigned project manager to clarify in detail project goals and schedules. Such careful advance planning can help prevent cost overruns. Many hotel industry-focused banks can now assist you with the tasks involved in the construction phase.
There are as many reasons for construction schedule delays as there are pillows in hotels. Even when an authorized setback occurs, you still may find yourself contractually obligated to serve effective notice about anticipated completion dates. Consulting closely with your project manager helps ensure that everyone involved in your hotel renovation fully understands the expectations.

 Legal: Stick to the Contract

Gathering trusted legal advice at an early stage from an attorney who understands contract law and how the hotel industry operates can help you move forward efficiently. If you do experience a disruption in the course of implementing a property improvement plan, you’ll want to discuss performance obligations and deadline issues. For example, what if one of your major suppliers experiences a significant operational outage and can’t deliver your new FF&E on time? A modified time frame usually requires you to notify the franchisor about specific delays.
Also, consider that many franchises invest significant sums promoting hotel renovations and upgraded facilities. Should holdups occur, even for legitimate reasons, the documents underlying the plans for hotel renovations may require you to notify a specific office or individual in advance. Especially if your franchisor promotes thousands of hotels domestically or internationally, scheduling issues can figure prominently in maintaining a smooth business relationship. Even changing your brand within a single franchise often entails extensive planning, so make sure you understand and adhere closely to contractual provisions.

 Regulatory: From Ecology to Cocktails

Depending upon the extent of your project and the location of your hotel, you could encounter some regulatory issues as you prepare for renovations to begin. These concerns run the gamut from environmental factors—such as proposed refurbishments that impact environmentally fragile zones or endangered species of plants and animals—to the provision of public facilities, labor laws, and other bureaucratic matters.
If you plan to install a new upscale dining venue owned and operated directly by the hotel, you may need to check into local regulations relating to the sale and provision of alcoholic beverages. Typically, your franchisor will serve as a useful source of preliminary information about this issue since many chains possess extensive experience building and managing restaurants as well. Look to them as a valuable resource.

 Negotiation: Accomplishing Goals Together

Seeing eye-to-eye with the franchisor is normally a fluid process. Because you both have a sizable stake in the success of your business, it makes sense for both parties to come to a reasonable, mutual plan. No two hotel properties are the same; your hotel offers unique features, values, and challenges. Clearly communicate those to your franchise representatives while understanding that they have a brand to preserve and promote. Renovations should be viewed by both of you as an important and momentous step in the life of your hotel.
Success From Start to Finish
Carefully addressing the financing, construction, legal and regulatory issues of your PIP, then negotiating a fair plan with your franchise, is a wise path for everyone involved. At the end of the day, you are executing this PIP to enhance both the guest experience and your revenues. Advance planning will help you accomplish both.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
