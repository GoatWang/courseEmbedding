August 2013, ©2014


















For Instructors


For Students




Description
The 10th edition of Halliday's Fundamentals of Physics, Extended building upon previous issues by offering several new features and additions.  The new edition offers most accurate, extensive and varied set of assessment questions of any course management program in addition to all questions including some form of question assistance including answer specific feedback to facilitate success. The text also offers multimedia presentations (videos and animations) of much of the material that provide an alternative pathway through the material for those who struggle with reading scientific exposition.  Furthermore, the book includes math review content in both a self-study module for more in-depth review and also in just-in-time math videos for a quick refresher on a specific topic. The Halliday content is widely accepted as clear, correct, and complete. The end-of-chapters problems are without peer. The new design, which was introduced in 9e continues with 10e, making this new edition of Halliday the most accessible and reader-friendly book on the market.

New To This Edition

Rewritten chapters.  Based on feedback from his
students, Jearl Walker has rewritten material that students find
particularly challenging (eg Gauss’ law and electric
potential). Some other changes include expanded coverage of the
Schrödinger equation including reflection of matter waves from
a step potential and a decoupling of the discussion of the Bohr
atom from the Schrödinger solution for the hydrogen atom.
New Sample Problems and Homework Question and Problems.
16 new sample problems, 350 problems and 50 questions some of which
come from prior editions back by popular demand.

The Wiley Advantage

WileyPLUS is a research-based online environment for
effective teaching and learning. WileyPLUS is packed with
interactive study tools and resources–including the complete
online textbook–to give your students more value for their
money.
WileyPLUS is now equipped with an adaptive learning
module called ORION. Based on cognitive science,
WileyPLUS with ORION, provides students with a
personal, adaptive learning experience so they can build their
proficiency on topics and use their study time most effectively.
WileyPLUS with ORION helps students learn by learning about
them.
The Flying Circus of Physics, written by Jearl
Walker, is incorporated into sample problems, text examples and
end-of-chapter problems providing interesting real-world
physics.
Reading questions (available online) help test for
reading comprehension
Checkpoints offer stopping points so students can check
their understanding of a question.
Sample problems demonstrate how problems can be solved
with reasoned solutions rather than quick and simplistic plugging
of numbers into an equation with no regard for what the equation
means.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1859 edition. Volume: no. 690 Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: London : Church Missionary House 42 pages Volume: no. 690.  Bookseller Inventory # 451029211
