The New Skyus DS2 Modem Touts High Throughput & Reduced Downtime for
      Businesses
SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Inseego
      Corp. (Nasdaq:INSG) - a leading global provider of
      software-as-a-service (SaaS) and solutions for the Internet of Things
      (IoT) - announces the release of the Skyus DS2, a USB modem with LTE
      Advanced/Category 6 capability. This high-throughput capacity supports
      download speeds of 300 Mbps, making it the first of its class to deliver
      high-speed connectivity to provide seamless, uninterrupted coverage.
    
Where Performance Meets Versatility

      Today's demanding applications require a strong and highly available
      signal. Unlike many modems currently on the market, the Skyus DS2
      employs Category 6 (Cat6) technology, which uses carrier aggregation to
      combine the power of multiple LTE bands for throughput of nearly three
      times the previous generation of modems.
    

      The combination of faster data transfer, carrier aggregation, and rugged
      reliability makes the Skyus DS2 ideal for solutions that require the
      freedom of wireless mobility and demand ultimate performance.
      Enterprises will benefit from the DS2's use for applications like
      digital signage, in-store Wi-Fi and branch connectivity, kiosk
      point-of-sales systems, and failover for business continuity. The Skyus
      DS2 is also ideally suited for SD-WAN applications where a wireless
      modem is needed for primary or backup connectivity. Inseego's Skyus DS2
      is also backed by world-class support and expertise in providing
      high-speed LTE for primary and backup networks.
    

      The increased bandwidth supports additional users and faster data
      transfer, and the Skyus DS2 retains the reliability and versatility of
      the Skyus line. The Skyus DS2 pairs its LTE Advanced (LTE-A) performance
      with a dual SIM capacity, able to store up to four firmware images to
      speed up a switch in network selection, and is certified on all major
      networks, including Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T, and Sprint. "Inseego
      remains committed to providing Industrial IoT solutions," noted Inseego
      acting General Manager, Mary Cozza. "The release of the DS2 keeps pace
      with the growth in carrier capacity while remaining true to the power
      and simplicity of our original modem suite. The DS2 makes it easy for
      our customers to order one SKU and use it with their preferred carrier.
      By fully supporting the deployed LTE frequencies of the major carriers,
      the DS2 opens new opportunities for both carriers and customers."
    
Delivering Reliable Connectivity and Industrial Rating

      Inseego's cost effective cellular modems are designed to handle the
      varied and sometimes extreme environments in IoT. Unlike consumer-grade
      USB modems, Inseego's Skyus DS2 is compact and constructed to withstand
      the high heat tolerances needed for continuous-use. The Skyus DS2 also
      provides external SMA connectors that allow users to boost the signal
      with additional high-gain antennas.

The New Skyus DS2 Modem Touts High Throughput & Reduced Downtime for 
      Businesses



Inseego 
      Corp. (Nasdaq: INSG) – a leading global provider of 
      software-as-a-service (SaaS) and solutions for the Internet of Things 
      (IoT) – announces the release of the Skyus DS2, a USB modem with LTE 
      Advanced/Category 6 capability. This high-throughput capacity supports 
      download speeds of 300 Mbps, making it the first of its class to deliver 
      high-speed connectivity to provide seamless, uninterrupted coverage.
    

Where Performance Meets Versatility


      Today’s demanding applications require a strong and highly available 
      signal. Unlike many modems currently on the market, the Skyus DS2 
      employs Category 6 (Cat6) technology, which uses carrier aggregation to 
      combine the power of multiple LTE bands for throughput of nearly three 
      times the previous generation of modems.
    

      The combination of faster data transfer, carrier aggregation, and rugged 
      reliability makes the Skyus DS2 ideal for solutions that require the 
      freedom of wireless mobility and demand ultimate performance. 
      Enterprises will benefit from the DS2's use for applications like 
      digital signage, in-store Wi-Fi and branch connectivity, kiosk 
      point-of-sales systems, and failover for business continuity. The Skyus 
      DS2 is also ideally suited for SD-WAN applications where a wireless 
      modem is needed for primary or backup connectivity. Inseego’s Skyus DS2 
      is also backed by world-class support and expertise in providing 
      high-speed LTE for primary and backup networks.
    

      The increased bandwidth supports additional users and faster data 
      transfer, and the Skyus DS2 retains the reliability and versatility of 
      the Skyus line. The Skyus DS2 pairs its LTE Advanced (LTE-A) performance 
      with a dual SIM capacity, able to store up to four firmware images to 
      speed up a switch in network selection, and is certified on all major 
      networks, including Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T, and Sprint. “Inseego 
      remains committed to providing Industrial IoT solutions,” noted Inseego 
      acting General Manager, Mary Cozza. “The release of the DS2 keeps pace 
      with the growth in carrier capacity while remaining true to the power 
      and simplicity of our original modem suite. The DS2 makes it easy for 
      our customers to order one SKU and use it with their preferred carrier. 
      By fully supporting the deployed LTE frequencies of the major carriers, 
      the DS2 opens new opportunities for both carriers and customers.”
    

Delivering Reliable Connectivity and Industrial Rating


      Inseego’s cost effective cellular modems are designed to handle the 
      varied and sometimes extreme environments in IoT. Unlike consumer-grade 
      USB modems, Inseego's Skyus DS2 is compact and constructed to withstand 
      the high heat tolerances needed for continuous-use. The Skyus DS2 also 
      provides external SMA connectors that allow users to boost the signal 
      with additional high-gain antennas.
