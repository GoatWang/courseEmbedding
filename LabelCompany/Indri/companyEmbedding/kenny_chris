Kenny Brown Performance Group Becomes new suspension supplier and sponsor on Chris Cobetto's 2011 Championship-Winning NASA American Iron Mustang


Motorsports




Tweet



Wauconda, IL -- Kenny Brown Performance Group has taken another step forward in the professional road race world and partnered with Chris Cobetto and Performance Autoport in Virginia to help win another NASA Mid-Atlantic American Iron championship.  Kenny made his mark on professional racing last year with son Paul Brown winning the 2011 Pirelli World Challenge championship, and is expanding his pro racing support and sponsorship efforts in NASA American Iron with Cobetto Racing.
According to Kenny, “Chris is an incredible talent and his partnership with Performance Autosport is a perfect match for us.  Mark Lamaskin is a great friend and supporter of our brand and the work he does at Performance Autosport is not only excellent, but has put Chris in the winner's circle countless times.  We feel really good about this alliance and are not only using it as a continual development platform for our suspension products, but also another branding and marketing tool to showcase our technology”.
After winning both NASA American Iron races March 26-27 where the car made its debut Lamaskin commented, "Our sponsor Kenny Brown Performance sent us the new KB AGS 4.0 GT-4 Suspension System and after running the car on Friday, Cobetto was definitely feeling a difference from all the suspension changes. The car felt more stable all over the track, turned in nice and crisp, and let him jump on the throttle with confidence earlier than before. It will obviously take some tweaking to get absolutely perfect, but the results are there!  The Kenny Brown AGS 4.0 GT-4 Suspension System just provides grip for days and solves all our previous problems with the car a little pushy under turn-in and loose on exit. The whole marriage is exactly what we’ve been looking for and we are excited to be using their products this year".
Chris Cobetto and the Performance Autosport Mustang is also sporting a completely new livery this year, with not only the addition of Kenny Brown Performance, but also Moss Motor's and Vaughn Gittin Jr's RTR brands.  So not only does the car handle very well with an advanced geometry suspension, but it also looks fantastic with the RTR exterior accompaniments.  As a result of this cooperative effort you can expect a lot of press and positive branding to go along with the 2012 campaign.
You can follow all the racing action or news from pit lane by following us on Facebook, Kenny Brown Performance http://www.facebook.com/pages/Kenny-Brown-Performance/166156213457744 or Performance Autosport http://www.facebook.com/pages/Performance-Autosport-Inc/136936904209

Featuring Ronny, Larry, Yvonne and Bo Hinson, singing "Oasis."

Chris Kenny '86 M'98



Title: 
Director of Athletics


Phone: 
802.654.2200


Email: 
ckenny@smcvt.edu


Year: 
31st


Alma Mater: 
Saint Michael's '86











Bio







@SaintMikesAD on Twitter | @SMCAthletics on Twitter
Now in his third decade as a College employee, Director of Athletics Chris Kenny '86 M'98 was chosen to assume his current role on July 1, 2015, after a nationwide search for a new director of athletics. The 2017-18 school year is his 31st as an employee of the College.
The senior associate director of athletics during the 2014-15 school year, Kenny has served a host of roles during his time at the College, most recently being primarily responsible for NCAA compliance, marketing, development and sport administration for the Purple Knights prior to becoming director of athletics. Kenny is a product of Saint Michael's, earning a bachelor of arts degree in journalism in 1986, and a master of science degree in administration and management at the College in 1998.
After a brief stint as public relations director in the Cincinnati Reds and Philadelphia Phillies minor league systems following graduation, he returned to his alma mater in summer 1987 to become the College's sports information director, a position he held for eight years. Following his term as the school's SID, he served as director of athletic external affairs for two years before being promoted first to assistant director of athletics, then associate director of athletics. Kenny was again promoted in 2014-15, this time becoming the senior associate director of athletics.
A well-known face around campus, Kenny is a member of several committees, both on campus and in the outer realm of college athletics. A former member of the NCAA Division II Men's Soccer Committee, he is a member of the Northeast-10 Conference's Committee on Sports Administration. On campus, he is a member of the College's Athletic Task Force and Athletic Advisory Council and has chaired the College's Athletic Hall of Fame Committee.
Kenny is a graduate of Leadership Champlain, a prestigious year-long program focused on developing professional leadership and awareness of issues facing Vermont, and is an active volunteer in and outside the Burlington community. He is a volunteer youth sports coach, a Wish Granter for Make-A-Wish Vermont, and volunteers for Vermont's Camp Ta-Kum-Ta, a residential summer camp for children with cancer, having served the camp as a member of its board of directors for 10 years. He is also the Executive Director of the Robert J. Kenny Memorial Golf Tournament, a fundraising event that has endowed camping scholarships at the Clara Barton Camp for girls and Joslin Camp for boys with diabetes since 1994. He is a member of the Barton Center's "Friends of Barton" and serves on the Board of Directors for the Vermont Sports Hall of Fame.
