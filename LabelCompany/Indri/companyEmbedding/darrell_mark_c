A:Biotape Pain Relief Claims Disputed  
 June 24, 2004
The Federal Trade Commission has charged that Smart Inventions, Inc., a California-based direct response TV company, made false and unsubstantiated claims that a product called ?Biotape? can treat or cure severe pain. 
The FTC complaint, filed in the Central District of California, also alleges that the defendants falsely claimed Biotape is superior to commonly available over-the-counter analgesics and topical creams and ointments in treating pain. 
The defendants advertised Biotape, which resembles electrical tape, primarily through a 30-minute infomercial that aired nationally on various cable stations, including Women?s Entertainment, The Discovery Channel, and the Inspirational Network. 
Darrell Stoddard ? who developed Biotape and is featured in the infomercial along with the infomercial host Kevin Trudeau and the company's chief operating officerr, Jon D. Nokes ? also are named as defendants.
The infomercial sold Biotape in conjunction with Stoddard?s book, ?Pain Free for Life.? A sheet of 10 adhesive Biotape strips costs approximately $10. The infomercial directed consumers to apply Biotape to the parts of their bodies where they experience pain. Biotape was purported to contain a ?space age conductive mylar that connects the broken circuits that cause the pain.?
The FTC complaint alleges that the defendants have falsely and without substantiation claimed that Biotape: (1) significantly and permanently relieves severe pain caused by surgical procedures, arthritis, migraines, and other serious conditions; and (2) is superior to other products and treatments, such as over-the-counter analgesics and topical creams and ointments, in eliminating or relieving severe pain.
In a separate action filed by the Commission in June 2003, the FTC previously sued Trudeau for his role in making false or unsubstantiated pain-relief claims in the Biotape infomercial, charging that such claims violated a 1998 federal district court order. This contempt action against Trudeau is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

A:What Doctors & Health Care Professionals are saying about
Pain Free for Life and author Darrell Stoddard 
“I tried the Biotape and it worked. I placed the tape over a sore elbow that I’ve had for 6 months, and 10 minutes later when I was working on a patient, I noticed that the pain was gone. I have many patients that I can use the tape on.”
--Thaddeus Srutwa, M.D.
“ I continue to be astonished at how dramatically and completely Darrell can get rid of severe pain. I have seen with my own eyes thousands of people becoming completely pain free when they thought they would have to live with pain for the rest of their lives. … This book contains many important ideas for enhanced health and well-being. They are founded on the basis of published medical literature, and I believe are sound medical concepts.”
-- Dennis W. Remington, M.D., P.C.
Author: How to Lower You’re Fat Thermostat, Back to Health, The Bitter Truth About Artificial Sweeteners
“Deafferentation, neurogenic pain - which is the most treatment resistant, is due to loss of
neurologic signal from the periphery due to conduction loss - both neuropathic and tissue “volume conduction” changes. Stoddard's concept of reconnecting the system by use of conductive tape is a philosophical and practical “out of the box” end run for pain therapy.”
-- R. P. Iacono, M.D. FACS Neuroscience/Neurosurgery Explored the underlying physiology of chronic pain at U.S.C. and Duke University. Pioneer of sterotactic pallidotomy brain surgery for Parkinson’s disease. Has performed more than 1500 such surgeries. Has a waiting list of 1000 more. See Iacono Bio at: pallidotomy.com
“I am pleased to recommend Darrell Stoddard’s book Pain Free for Life that provides a valid, low cost, alternative to modern medicine’s drug and surgery approach to pain. Darrell’s work is based on many years of hands-on experience with thousands of people. He has demonstrated that his simple, non-invasive treatments cannot only relieve pain quickly, but actually stop the cause of pain. Medical practitioners would do well to incorporate his methods as a first response for dealing with pain.”
-- Mark C. Belk, Ph.D Zoology 
“ Since I began using the Biotape 5 years ago I would say it gives great results 90% of the time. I have sent it home with many patients with the instruction to apply it where it hurts! It always works within a few minutes to an hour and usually within a few days the disability is gone.”
-- John E. Gambee, M.D. 
“ Society has already gained immensely from Darrell Stoddard’s work – his “impossible dream”. Those who are fortunate enough to read Pain Free for Life will assuredly agree! The Darrell Stoddard Concepts deserve widespread confirmation and extension.”
-- John W. Gofman, M.D., Ph.D.
Professor Emeritus of Molecular and Cell Biology, Former Director Biomedical Research Division, Livermore National Laborator,y Author of nine books and more than 120 articles in peer review scientific journals.
“This book presents a 180-degree paradigm shift from the drug based pharmaceutical approach of managing pain, to treating the cause of pain. It is “outside the box” thinking that should be considered by every medical doctor.”
-- David Voss, D.O.
“ Darrell Stoddard presents information that when accepted and implemented will change the way modern medicine treats pain. Everyone suffering from pain will benefit.”
-- Kent Pendleton, Health Educator
“I have watched Darrell work and produce dramatic pain relief for my wife. We had the same machine Darrell uses in our home for a number of years and I was able to relieve my wife’s pain and that of many others. I have also used the instrument to measure resistance before and after treatment. There is no question that the resistance decreases with a decrease in the pain.”
-- A. Owen Smoot M.D., Orthopedic Surgeon
“I have seen Darrell Stoddard relieve chronic intractable pain in hundreds of patients – patients orthodox medicine could not help.”
--Dennis Harper, D.O.
“I have found that people in chronic pain do not usually get better with medication. In many cases the medication causes a worsening of pain overtime. On the other hand, I have seen Darrell Stoddard relieve severe, chronic pain in numerous patients that had received little or no help from medication. His theories concerning pain-relief, though controversial in the medical community, have proven effective over and over again.”
-- Dr. Judith S. Moore, D.O.
Co-author of Marie Osmond’s bestseller Behind the Smile and author of Healing from the Heart: the Inherent Power to Heal from Within.

A:Biotape: gimmick or pain-relief breakthrough?
For thousands of years Chinese healers have believed in and worked with an internal electrical energy system in the body called Chi. While Western medicine largely dismiss it as hocus-pocus, US-based Darrell Stoddard has devised a user-friendly super conductor which he claims is the cure for world suffering.
According to Darrell, regardless of the reason a person's pain persists, be in injury, disease or diet, he insists it is a result of a break or blockage in the flow of Chi around the body.
"I have measured electrical resistance at the site of pain in more than 18,000 patients and where there's pain there's always more electrical resistance," he says.
Based on his understanding of Chi, Darrell developed a super conductor known as Biotape. The tape looks and feels like electrical tape but it contains a polyester substance called Mylar and instead of insulating, it conducts electricity, in this case, our own.
"Theoretically, the body knows how to heal itself and when it doesn't it's because the signal can't get through to tell those cells to repair," he says. "By applying the tape, we not only connect the broken circuits on the surface immediately but we allow the signal to go through for all those cells to repair and reconnect."
But, not everyone is convinced Biotape is the answer.
Director of the Pain Management Clinic in Melbourne, Dr Len Rose, is highly skeptical, even though he practices acupuncture, which is another healing modality that incorporates Chi.
"There isn't any simple answer to pain," he says. "Pain is a simple word but it's an extraordinary, complex phenomenon."
Back to Biotape, and for it to work at its peak, it's vital the body be fully hydrated. Patients are required to drink at least a litre of non-chlorinated water for every 40 kilograms of body weight. A pinch of rock salt in the water assists conductivity and the simple rule of thumb is to stick the tape where it hurts.
Biotape has only been introduced into Australia and retails for around $30 per metre.
"I don't care how skeptical people are or who any doctor is, if they give me a chance I'll make a believer out of them," says Darrell.

 How does space illuminate educational inequity?Where and how can spatial analysis be used to disrupt educational inequity?Which tools are most appropriate for the spatial analysis of educational equity?This book addresses these questions and explores the use of critical spatial analysis to uncover the dimensions of entrenched and systemic racial inequities in educational settings and identify ways to redress them. The contributors to this book – some of whom are pioneering scholars of critical race spatial analysis theory and methodology – demonstrate the application of the theory and tools applied to specific locales, and in doing so illustrate how this spatial and temporal lens enriches traditional approaches to research. The opening macro-theoretical chapter lays the foundation for the book, rooting spatial analyses in critical commitments to studying injustice. Among the innovative methodological chapters included in this book is the re-conceptualization of mapping and space beyond the simple exploration of external spaces to considering internal geographies, highlighting how the privileged may differ in socio-spatial thinking from oppressed communities and what may be learned from both perspectives; data representations that allow the construction of varied narratives based on differences in positionality and historicity of perspectives; the application of redlining to the analysis of classroom interactions; the use of historical archives to uncover the process of marginalization; and the application of techniques such as the fotonovela and GIS to identify how spaces are defined and can be reimagined.The book demonstrates the analytical and communicative power of mapping and its potential for identifying and dismantling racial injustice in education. The editors conclude by drawing connections across sections, and elucidating the tensions and possibilities for future research.ContributorsBenjamin BlaisdellGraham S. GarlickLeigh Anna HidalgoMark C. HogrebeJoshua RadinskyDaniel G. SolórzanoWilliam F. TateVerónica N. VélezFederico R. Waitoller

							Introduction
						















Reviews & Endorsements:


							“The growth of critical race studies has prompted huge advances in our understandings of the numerous complex, shifting and often hidden ways in which racism operates in the contemporary world. This ground-breaking volume brings together cutting-edge scholarship that applies the principles and inspiration of critical race theory (CRT) to critical spatial analyses. The result is a provocative and fascinating collection that will have a lasting impact on the field.”
							

-
									David Gillborn, Director, Centre for Research in Race & Education
									, University of Birmingham
								




							"Critical Race Spatial Analysis (CRSA) is an intellectually captivating text. The use of practical, real life examples and accessible language are ideal for beginners in critical race studies, providing them conceptual and empirical anchors to develop multi-scalar investigations for diverse contexts. Theoretically rich and methodologically sound studies feature both nuanced and comprehensive complexities, compelling the more experienced to envision novel interstices. CRSA is an inspiration, an impetus to rethink and retool efforts that address educational inequities.
							

-
									Eileen R. Carlton Parsons, PhD, Professor, Science Education
									, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
								








							"The editors and chapter authors of Critical Race Spatial Analysis have taken it upon themselves to embark upon a bold challenge:  to fulfill the interdisciplinary charge of Critical Race Theory.  For now and into the distant future, their work stands as testament to the commitment to grapple with the layers of race, space and school.  In the long road towards justice, I am overly grateful to my comrades for producing this seminal volume."
							

-
									David Stovall, Ph.D., Professor of Educational Policy Studies and African-American Studies 
									, University of Illinois at Chicago
