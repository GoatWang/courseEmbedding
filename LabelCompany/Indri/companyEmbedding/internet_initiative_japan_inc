Alphabet falls after earnings beat: Live blog
              
              Alphabet Inc. is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings after the market closes Monday, and they'll be hit by a $2.74 billion fine from the European Union's antitrust regulator. Outside of the fine, analysts project a strong quarter for the company, thanks to advertising revenue from Google sites, particularly on mobile devices, and YouTube.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.
