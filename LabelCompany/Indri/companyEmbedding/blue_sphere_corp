Blue Sphere Corp. Submits Product Identification Note For One Of Its Projects In Ghana






Business Wire




Dec 2, 2010 8:30 AM EST













 


















































  Blue Sphere Corp. (OTCBB: BLSP) (the "Company" or “Blue Sphere”), a company in the Cleantech sector as an Emission Reduction project integrator, is pleased to announce that it has submitted the Project Identification Note (“PIN”) to the Ghanaian government for preliminary approval of its landfill gas mitigation clean development mechanism (“CDM”) project in Accra, Ghana.  Submission of the PIN is the first step in the project implementation and registration process. Once received by the Ghanaian government, the PIN will be reviewed by the Ghanaian Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to confirm that the project meets all applicable Ghanaian criteria for CDM project implementation. This review is expected to take up to 4 weeks. Once complete, it is expected that the Ghanaian EPA will issue to Blue Sphere a letter of endorsement, which represents the Ghanaian government’s preliminary approval of the project. The next step will be to commence the project design document (a more detailed description of the project) and to receive from the EPA a letter of approval, which represents the Ghanaian government’s final approval of the project.  The Project consists of the installation of a gas collection system and flare at the non-operational landfill sites Oblogo and Mallam, which are located within one mile of each other in Accra, Ghana.   About Blue Sphere Corp.  Blue Sphere Corp. is a company in the cleantech sector as an Emission Reduction Project Integrator. Blue Sphere develops projects for greenhouse gas emission reduction and renewable energy production. The Company aspires to become a key player in the global carbon reduction market, helping enterprises with high pollution emissions achieve their green goals. For further information please visit the Company's website www.bluespherecorporate.com.  This press release contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Among these are: (i) uncertainties regarding our ability to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis including financing for the project described in this release and other specific projects, (ii) uncertainties regarding the market for and value of carbon credits including carbon credits associated with industrial gases, as well as the duration and amount of estimated emissions from specific projects, (iii) political and governmental risks associated with the foreign countries in which we operate, (iv) unanticipated delays associated with project implementation including designing, constructing and equipping projects, as well as delays in obtaining required host country and United Nations approvals, (v) the development stage of our business and (vi) our lack of operating history. As such, there is no assurance that the initiatives described in the press release will be successfully implemented or meet expectations.

Blue Sphere Corporation (OTCQB: BLSP) is an international Independent Power Producer (IPP) that transforms millions of tons of agricultural, municipal and industrial waste into sustainable clean energy and other by-products.
 
Instead of burying organic waste, Blue Sphere transforms these harmful materials into sustainable clean energy, helping to eliminate the release of damaging greenhouse gases and replace the need for environmentally harmful landfills that pollute our soil, underground water tables and atmosphere.
 
We believe that organic waste can help supply a large and sustainable source of clean energy for growing global demands.
 
The Blue Sphere waste-to-energy facilities sell electricity, natural gas, compost and other by-products primarily through fixed-rate power purchase agreements.
 
The waste-to-energy markets provide tremendous opportunity as there is a virtually endless supply of waste and organic material that can be used to generate power and valuable by-products. In particular, the disposal of organic material to landfills in most parts of the world is a costly problem with environmentally-damaging consequences. Blue Sphere offers a cost-effective, environmentally-safe alternative.
 
The Blue Sphere team brings decades of financing, regulatory, technology, and mass-scale project expertise to the $24+ billion waste-to-energy market. Blue Sphere also partners with various investors, banks and other institutions to fund developments at the project level.
 
Help us change the world. Join our journey!

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
