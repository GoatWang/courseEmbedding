					Full Description



Cross Timbers Royalty Trust, incorporated on February 12, 1991, is an express trust. The net profits interests are the principal asset of the Trust. The net profits interests consist of approximately 90% net profits interests, which are carved from producing royalty and overriding royalty interest properties in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico, and 11.11% nonparticipating royalty interests in non-producing properties located primarily in Texas and Oklahoma. Its net profits interests consist of approximately 75% net profits interests, which are carved from working interests in over four properties in Texas and three properties in Oklahoma.All underlying royalties, underlying non-producing royalties and underlying working interest properties are owned by XTO Energy Inc. (XTO Energy). The underlying properties include over 2,900 producing properties with established production histories in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. The average reserve-to-production index for the underlying properties is approximately 10 years. Royalty and overriding royalty properties underlying over 90% net profits interests represent approximately 94% of the discounted future net cash flows from the Trust's proved reserves. Approximately 69% of the discounted future net cash flows from over 90% net profits interests are from gas reserves, totaling approximately 19.9 billion cubic feet (Bcf). Oil reserves allocated to approximately 90% net profits interests are located in West Texas and are estimated to over 428,000 barrels (Bbls).The underlying royalties are royalty and overriding royalty interests primarily located in mature producing oil and gas fields. The producing region, in which the underlying royalties are located, is the San Juan Basin in northwestern New Mexico. The Trust's estimated proved gas reserves from this region totaled over 13.5 Bcf, or approximately 82% of Trust total gas reserves. XTO Energy estimates that underlying royalties in the San Juan Basin include over 4,850 gross (approximately 47.3 net) wells, covering approximately 60,000 gross acres. Approximately half of these wells are operated by BP America Production Company or ConocoPhillips.The underlying royalties also include royalties in the Sand Hills field of Crane County, Texas. The Sand Hills field includes production from over three main intervals, the Tubb, McKnight and Judkins. The underlying royalties contain approximately 208,720 gross (approximately 38,970 net) producing acres. Underlying over 75% net profits interests are working interests in over seven oil-producing properties in Texas and Oklahoma operated primarily by established oil companies. These properties are located in mature fields undergoing secondary or tertiary recovery operations. Proved reserves from the 75% net profits interests are oil, estimated to be approximately 55,000 Bbls. Proved reserves from these interests represent over 6% of the discounted future net cash flows of the Trust's proved reserves. The underlying working interest properties consist of approximately 3,810 gross (over 2,990 net) producing acres.

Why royalties may be the best income investment on earth









Why Buy Royalties
In today’s investing landscape, investors are looking for new ways to insulate their money from unpredictable stock market fluctuations. This has led to a substantial rise in the popularity of alternative investments like royalties. Investing in royalties offers buyers the opportunity to purchase future royalty stream revenue generated by royalty assets.
At Royalty Exchange, you will now have access to purchase some of these alternative assets in an online marketplace:

Auctions
Royalty Exchange take royalty transactions out of the private, backroom deal and into the open marketplace through online public auctions. Every listing provides all the relevant rights and catalog information, financial data, media, and any other information needed to make a sound investment decision. 
Advances [beta]
Royalty Exchange’s Peer Advance platform allows you to provide advances with fixed rates and terms to royalty rightsholders, backed by their royalty income. It’s as close to a guaranteed return as you can get.

Steady Income
Royalties are generally stable investments, they pay consistent income every year. Each asset listing on our site will include historical financial data.


Longevity
Royalty streams last for the life of the copyright or patent. In many cases, with royalties generated from copyrights, those payments can last up to 75 years.


Diversification
Royalties from intellectual property, especially music royalties, are uncorrelated assets. Meaning they are not influenced by fluctuations in the stock market. This is a good way to stabilize the income your portfolio generates.


Potential Upside
Some royalties, especially in music, experience large spikes in revenue based on increased use. For example, when a song is used in a popular commercial, revenue spikes... or when a popular artist covers an older song, the owners of the copyright enjoy a major boost in royalty payments.








Why royalties could be the perfect income investment
Intellectual property assets with a strong track record of consistent earnings may be the perfect investment for those seeking income. Owners of intellectual property of any kind are paid every time their IP is used. They create an asset once, and then collect payment over and over again.
Imagine this… you’re a songwriter. You write a song for a film and this move becomes a classic; the type of film that people watch many times over a period of years. One of these films–even 20 years after its release date–still airs on TV nearly every week and is purchased or streamed on iTunes, Amazon Video, Netflix, and even on DVD.Every time one this film is bought, streamed, or aired on TV you get paid.
Billy Goodrum is one of these songwriters. He penned original music for the hit comedy Dumb and Dumber (1994), among others. Below, you can see that the royalties he earned from that movie increased at least 15% every year from 2011 through 2014, ultimately reaching a 12-month total of over $22,000 before he sold it in early 2015.


Royalties don't rust. They don't get sued by angry workers. And they don't require expensive tools or machinery to make money. Somebody creates it once and they make money for decades.
Until recently, you probably never had the opportunity to own income-producing intellectual property. That’s where Royalty Exchange comes in. We’re a marketplace where these types of royalty assets are bought and sold. We specialize in intellectual property with a documented track record of regular, consistent income.

Through our one-of-a-kind platform, investors can buy privately owned royalty rights directly from the artists, inventors and creators. In a world of negative interest rates, these income-generating royalty rights just might be the perfect investment.

Why we will get you the best deal
For too long songwriters and musicians have sold their catalogs or sought advances in backroom deals that often left them with a very bad result. But there are tens of thousands of investors outside the music industry interested in acquiring royalties willing to provide much better options.
If you've tried to leverage your catalog or raise money in the past, you know how difficult it can be to find willing investors with the capital you need. Royalty Exchange is the marketplace where this takes place. We’ve assembled and vetted all the investors on our site. So you can get instant access to a large group of investors that would be impossible to attract on your own.
That's why we've been able to get creatives much better deals than anybody else out there. And that's why, if you're looking to raise money — you're in the right place.
