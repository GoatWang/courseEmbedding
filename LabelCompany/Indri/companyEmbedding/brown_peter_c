About This BookAbout the AuthorsReviewsTable of Contents 

To most of us, learning something “the hard way” implies wasted time and effort. Good teaching, we believe, should be creatively tailored to the different learning styles of students and should use strategies that make learning easier. Make It Stick turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. Drawing on recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, the authors offer concrete techniques for becoming more productive learners.
Memory plays a central role in our ability to carry out complex cognitive tasks, such as applying knowledge to problems never before encountered and drawing inferences from facts already known. New insights into how memory is encoded, consolidated, and later retrieved have led to a better understanding of how we learn. Grappling with the impediments that make learning challenging leads both to more complex mastery and better retention of what was learned.
Many common study habits and practice routines turn out to be counterproductive. Underlining and highlighting, rereading, cramming, and single-minded repetition of new skills create the illusion of mastery, but gains fade quickly. More complex and durable learning come from self-testing, introducing certain difficulties in practice, waiting to re-study new material until a little forgetting has set in, and interleaving the practice of one skill or topic with another. Speaking most urgently to students, teachers, trainers, and athletes, Make It Stick will appeal to all those interested in the challenge of lifelong learning and self-improvement.

July 13: Liu Xiaobo and the Responsibility of Being Alive
The Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Liu Xiaobo died today, a few short weeks after the Chinese government revealed that he was suffering from cancer that had progressed beyond treatment during his political imprisonment. The course of his life was forever altered by the Tiananmen Square demonstrations of 1989, and, as Perry Link notes at NYR Daily, Liu felt haunted by the “lost souls” of Tiananmen, “the aggrieved ghosts of students and workers alike whose ages would forever be the same as on the night they died.” His widow Liu Xia reports that he dedicated his Nobel Prize to them in 2010, as he’d done in 2003 after receiving an award from the Chinese Demo…

Comfortable footwear
What makes that long walk worthy of your time and energy? It is nothing but the perfect footwear that does not let you feel the roughness of the rocky footpath. Finding the perfect footwear that fits your feet perfectly and provides you the comfort that you have been longing for is a task. A shorter footwear will make you feel like your feet are getting crushed and a bigger one just lands you in a deeper trouble with your foot coming out every step you take.
 
Apart from your apparel, your footwear has the most variation, in accordance with the occasion. Shoes range hundreds of occasions! There are shoes for marathon, different ones for your board meetings, some for your parties, and the list goes on. Different criterion need to be kept in mind while choosing your footwear accordingly.
 
Got a marathon to run for?
Do not always hover around your favourite brand. For marathons, walk-a-thons and similar events, the weight of the person running / walking makes up for the most important criteria. Consequently, the manner in which you run or walk decides how much pressure will be falling on the sole of the shoes. Therefore, to be precautious enough that your footwear does not wear out easily, do run it by someone about what will suit your foot best. The platform of the shoe is also very important. Since while running or walking, a lot of pressure falls on the platform of the shoe - so care should be taken to choose the right one because if the shoes’ soles wear out because of a low/poor quality platform, you will run yourself into unnecessary issues.
 
Dazzle up your parties
It is no new information that the comfort of your heels will decide if you have a good time at your party and do not end up walking barefoot because of those increasingly uncomfortable heels. High heels are definitely tempting, but it is not certain whether every high-heel footwear is going to suit everyone. If your shoes have a very high heel, make sure that the sole under the frontal part of your foot is high enough. A high sole / platform will elevate your foot and hence make it more comfortable than other shoes with thin soles. If you are going for stilettos, make sure the thin heels have the stability. The stability of the heels is directly proportional to the comfort that you can expect from the shoes. Choose the right shoe and dazzle up your party!
 
Think you got the right flats?
The thing that comes with choosing the right flat footwear is to choose the material that the insole is made of. Do not look for only the right look, search for what comforts you the most. It becomes difficult because the insoles come in varieties: synthetic, hard insoles, leather, cushiony, cotton, and nylon among others. The material should suit your skin so that your foot does not have blisters. Each kind of flat footwear has a different kind of ending. Some have a pointed-toe ending, low-cut toes, square cut and many others. Depending on what your feet are like, you can go for an appropriate flat shoe. For example, if you have a longer foot, a low-cut flat will make it extremely uncomfortable for you to walk on any surface even if you got your material right.
 
Therefore, choosing the right footwear, irrespective of the occasion, comes with a decision which is a combination of choosing the right insole material, the right platform and the heels!
 
Good fitting and ankle-care
This decides the fate of the rest of your day. The more uncomfortable your shoes are, the weirder your day gets. Therefore, a good-fitting footwear will be the deciding point of what your mood is going to be like. You definitely do not want your feet to be crushing in a badly chosen footwear before an important meeting or before you go for a marathon. The deal does not end with choosing the right fitting, it ends with looking for the appropriate material that is used to create the part of the footwear that provides a support base for your ankles. Your ankles tend to get tired faster than any part of your foot, so watch out for those uncomfortable ankles prepared to ruin your day. Choose your shoes wisely. You can also check for heels sandals.
 
Consider your foot size
Your footwear might be perfectly fitting your foot but the important thing is to see if, after putting on your footwear, there is room enough so that your arch has space enough to settle for longer hours. The arch in your foot should be able to take the burden for a long period of time hence the ‘spacious’ factor while choosing your shoes while online shopping is an important one to take note of before making any purchase.

Buy Shoes for Men Online at Best Prices on Snapdeal

A shoe is not merely a fashion accessory; a shoe is an integral part of your body language as the former determines how you walk. Where on one hand well-fitted shoes help one travel miles without experiencing any sort of discomfort, ill-fitted or low quality shoes on the other hand can cause uneasiness and injuries in certain cases. Walk, dance, and do whatever you want with bursting confidence and zero discomfort by choosing the right pair of shoes for men online.
 
Men, whether fashion conscious or not, are particular about their shoes. In fact, majority of men believe shoes reflect their personality and thus are concerned about what they wear on their feet.
 
Put all your concerns related to men's footwear at rest with the widest assortment of men's shoes, available at Snapdeal.  Be it sport shoes, formal shoes, casual shoes, boots, sandals, slippers, flip flops or loafers for men, you can find it all on Snapdeal. Browse through the collection of men shoes and take away your favourite picks from renowned brands like Puma, Reebok, Nike, Adidas, Lee Cooper, and many more.
 
Snapdeal: Choose Right Shoes for the Right Occasion
 
The types of men's shoes available online are quite overwhelming. From sports shoes to boots to loafers, the variety is quite extensive and you need to pick the right shoes to look your best every time.
 
Here below we have briefly described each type to help you buy shoes online with ease.
 
Formal Shoes: These shoes are perfect for office, workplace, and business meetings. Sharp lines, neat assembling, and top-notch material are a few characteristics that make formal shoes every man's favourite. Whether you want black formal shoes or ones in colours such as brown, maroon, tan, and the likes, you can find it all at Snapdeal in a jiffy.
 
Formal shoes are of different types; learn about varied styles so that you can zero on your favourite styles quickly. One of the most common formal shoe types is derby. Derby shoes feature shoelace eyelets, attached to the outside of panels on single-piece uppers. Another popular type is brogue, which is characterised by patterned perforations on the upper. Other common shoe types that you can find under formal shoes are oxfords, monk strap, tassel, and saddles.
 
Sports Shoes: Like formal shoes are essential for office, sports shoes are indispensible when playing any kind of game. Sport shoes are designed to provide utmost comfort to the wearer.  Now, when every game is different, how can your shoes be the same! So, the next time you go out to play basketball, wear shoes designed for basketball and not your pair of running shoes. At men's footwear online store on Snapdeal, shoppers can buy sports shoes designed for various sports such as football, cricket, tennis, golf, badminton, hockey, camping, and many more. Don't forget to buy sports gear along with shoes!
 
Casual Shoes: As the name suggests, casual shoes are ideal for daily wear and casual occasions. You can wear casual shoes to family get-togethers, a stroll down the lane, or just anywhere of your choice! Though every shopper has specific likes but the most popular types of casual shoes are boat shoes, sneakers, canvas shoes, espadrilles, mules, printed shoes, etc. Take a tour of the men's casual shoes assortment and buy ones that perfectly complement your personality.
 
Loafers: In a span of few years, loafers have become the hot favourite. Low and lace-less, these slip-on shoes have become a staple for every guy. If you don't own a pair of loafers yet, it is time to buy loafers for men online at Snapdeal from popular brands like Lee Cooper, Carlton London, Clarks, Alberto Torresi, and Franco Leone. These shoes look perfect with shorts or chinos paired with casual shirts and/or t-shirt.
 
Floater Sandals: Floaters or sandals are a must-have in every man's footwear collection. These sandals are lightweight, sturdy, and ensure breathability. Further, floaters can be worn with a variety of outfits, be it casual or ethnic. Majority of floaters sport Velcro closure and upper made of synthetic/faux leather, Croslite or Eva.
 
Flip Flops: Flip Flops are lightweight, airy shoes that are usually worn during summertime. Apart from wearing them at home, you can carry a pair of bright hued flip flops to your next beach vacation too. Flip flops come in various designs, prints, and colours and you must buy your favourite pairs right away to add some fun elements to your personal footwear collection.
 
Boots: Winters are always incomplete without snug boots! Be it men or women, boots become an instant favourite as soon as the temperature dips. If you are planning to buy sturdy and stylish boots for men, you have landed at the right place. Here, you can find the widest collection of boots from popular brands such as Red Chief, Numero Uno, Woodland, etc. at best prices.
 
Punjabi Jutti for Men: Ethnic attires such as sherwani or kurta pyjama look best only when paired with ethnic shoes such as Punjabi jutti. Put an end to your search for a perfect jutti with Snapdeal as here you can find a wide array of ethnic shoes for men and that too at slashed down prices.

Detailed item info
DescriptionTo most of us, learning something  the hard way  implies wasted time and effort. Good teaching, we believe, should be creatively tailored to the different learning styles of students and should use strategies that make learning easier. Make It Stick turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. Drawing on recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, the authors offer concrete techniques for becoming more productive learners.Memory plays a central role in our ability to carry out complex cognitive tasks, such as applying kwledge to problems never before encountered and drawing inferences from facts already kwn. New insights into how memory is encoded, consolidated, and later retrieved have led to a better understanding of how we learn. Grappling with the impediments that make learning challenging leads both to more complex mastery and better retention of what was learned.Many common study habits and practice routines turn out to be counterproductive. Underlining and highlighting, rereading, cramming, and single-minded repetition of new skills create the illusion of mastery, but gains fade quickly. More complex and durable learning come from self-testing, introducing certain difficulties in practice, waiting to re-study new material until a little forgetting has set in, and interleaving the practice of one skill or topic with ather. Speaking most urgently to students, teachers, trainers, and athletes, Make It Stick will appeal to all those interested in the challenge of lifelong learning and self-improvement.Key FeaturesAuthor(s)Peter C.

Hegel: Lectures on the Philosophy of World History, Volume I
Manuscripts of the Introduction and the Lectures of 1822-1823
Edited and Translated by Robert F. Brown and Peter C. Hodgson
Hegel Lectures



Description



This edition makes available an entirely new version of Hegel's lectures on the development and scope of world history. Volume I presents Hegel's surviving manuscripts of his introduction to the lectures and the full transcription of the first series of lectures (1822-23). These works treat the core of human history as the inexorable advance towards the establishment of a political state with just institutions-a state that consists of individuals with a free and fully-developed self-consciousness. Hegel interweaves major themes of spirit and culture-including social life, political systems, commerce, art and architecture, religion, and philosophy-with an historical account of peoples, dates, and events. Following spirit's quest for self-realization, the lectures presented here offer an imaginative voyage around the world, from the paternalistic, static realm of China to the cultural traditions of India; the vast but flawed political organization of the Persian Empire to Egypt and then the Orient; and the birth of freedom in the West to the Christian revelation of free political institutions emerging in the medieval and modern Germanic world. Brown and Hodgson's new translation is an essential resource for the English reader, and provides a fascinating account of the world as it was conceived by one of history's most influential philosophers. The Editorial Introduction surveys the history of the texts and provides an analytic summary of them, and editorial footnotes introduce readers to Hegel's many sources and allusions. For the first time an edition is made available that permits critical scholarly study, and translates to the needs of the general reader.
