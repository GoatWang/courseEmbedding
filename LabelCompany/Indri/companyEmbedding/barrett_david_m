JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREThe Cia & Congress: The Untold Story From Truman To Kennedyby Barrett, David M.D.B. Hardeman Prize  From its inception more than half a century ago and for decades afterward, the Central Intelligence Agency was deeply shrouded in secrecy, with little or no real oversight by Congress-or so many Americans believe. David M. Barrett reveals, however, that during the agency's first fifteen years, Congress often monitored the CIA's actions and plans, sometimes aggressively.  Drawing on a wealth of newly declassified documents, research at some two dozen archives, and interviews with former officials, Barrett provides an unprecedented and often colorful account of relations between American spymasters and Capitol Hill. He chronicles the CIA's dealings with senior legislators who were haunted by memories of our intelligence failure at Pearl Harbor and yet riddled with fears that such an organization might morph into an American Gestapo. He focuses in particular on the efforts of Congress to monitor, finance, and control the agency's activities from the creation of the national security state in 1947 through the planning for the ill-fated Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. Along the way, Barrett highlights how Congress criticized the agency for failing to predict the first Soviet atomic test, the startling appearance of Sputnik over American air space, and the overthrow of Iraq's pro-American government in 1958. He also explores how Congress viewed the CIA's handling of Senator McCarthy's charges of communist infiltration, the crisis created by the downing of a U-2 spy plane, and President Eisenhower's complaint that Congress meddled too much in CIA matters. Ironically, as Barrett shows, Congress itself often pushed the agency to expand its covert operations against other nations.  The CIA and Congress provides a much-needed historical perspective for current debates in Congress and beyond concerning the agency's recent failures and ultimate fate. In our post-9/11 era, it shows that anxieties over the challenges to democracy posed by our intelligence communities have been with us from the very beginning.20th Century, Congress, IntelligenceCondition: NewHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

      “Dr. Barrett’s years of experience in leadership roles at the nation’s 
      top medical centers, his insights as a practicing urologist and his 
      extensive business and medical experience make him an ideal candidate to

      technology,” said Rick Carlson, ProUroCare’s CEO. “Dr. Barrett is also 
      uniquely qualified to work with a developing medical products company 
      that has a broad technology platform from which numerous medical 
      products can be developed, helping us achieve our goal of transforming 
      the diagnosis, monitoring and management of prostate disease.”
    

      “ProUroCare is an exciting early stage technology company,” said Dr. 
      Barrett. “I’m looking forward to working with Rick, ProUroCare’s board 
      and its numerous medical technology advisors and key opinion leaders in 
      urology to help build a truly great company in the years ahead.”
    

      Dr. Barrett is a Clinical Professor of surgery at the Dartmouth Medical 
      School and a staff urologist at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center. 
      Dr. Barrett began working at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota) as a 
      staff physician in 1975. He was Chair of the Department of Urology of 
      Mayo Clinic, where he served on the Board of Trustees and as Vice Chair 
      of the Board of Governors. From 1970 to 1972, Dr. Barrett served as a 
      flight surgeon during the Vietnam War, and became Chief of the 
      Aeromedical Service at Cam Rahn Bay Air Base. He is a former Trustee at 
      Albion College.
    

      Dr. Barrett is an authority on urologic oncology, urinary incontinence, 
      bladder reconstruction, and genitourinary prostheses. During the course 
      of his career, he has been widely published in academic journals and has 
      received numerous research grants and contracts. Among his many 
      professional affiliations are memberships in the American College of 
      Surgeons, the American Urologic Association, and the American College of 
      Healthcare Executives. He is a past president of the American Board of 
      Urology. Dr. Barrett received his B.A. from Albion College and his M.D. 
      from Wayne State University School of Medicine.

His brother, Stanton Barrett is a NASCAR driver and Hollywood stuntman. His father, Stan Barrett, was also a Hollywood stuntman and raced in 19 Winston Cup series races between 1980 and 1990. His mother is Penny McCoy, a former World Cup alpine ski racer. He is the godson of Paul Newman
