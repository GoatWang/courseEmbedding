What is a REIT?


What is a Non-traded REIT?
















What is a REIT?









One may choose to indirectly invest in real estate by purchasing shares in a REIT. In general, a REIT is an entity that:

pools the capital of many investors to acquire or provide financing for real properties; 
enables individual investors to invest in a professionally managed portfolio of real estate assets; and

avoids the “double taxation” at the corporate and stockholder level that generally results from investments in a corporation. 




There is no assurance that these goals will be achieved.
Tax laws are subject to change.
