Background
 
Daniel Jonas started his Fashion Tech Label in New York City in collaboration with designers from New York, Miami as well as Los Angeles and garnered first attention for his special “New York” snapback at the Direct TV SuperBowl party hosted by Jay-Z at Pier 40 in New York City.
The Los Angeles edition was presented during the Academy Awards and Miami Beach at Art Basel. Daniel Jonas showed off the new snapback editions at an event by President Barack Obama and became even more inspired to support children who strive to be the first member of their family to graduate with a college degree.
Influenced by the lifestyle and vibrant nightlife culture of New York, Miami and Los Angeles, Daniel's designs capture the unique energy that can only be found in these cities.

J.T. Brady, born on June 9, 2000, is introduced as the child intended to be adopted by Abe Carver (James Reynolds) and Lexie Carver (Renée Jones). However, Lexie's father Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo) switches the infant at birth with Bo and Hope's (Peter Reckell and Kristian Alfonso) son. After years of trying for a baby the natural way, Abe and Lexie Carver decide that they will adopt a child. When Lexie's father Stefano DiMera hears about the news, he is over joyed at the prospect of finally becoming a grandfather and asks that Abe and Lexie adopt the child of one of his distant relatives. The birth mother Marlo is in fact the niece of Dr. Rolf, Stefano's longtime assistant. However none the wiser to Lexie and Abe, Stefano is planning a plot whereby Marlo's baby would be switched with the baby of Bo and Hope's who Stefano at the time thought might be his or John Black's. After the births of the babies, Stefano has Dr. Rolf switch Hope's and Marlo's babies birth tags. So, the baby is instead taken home by Bo and Hope Brady and named John Thomas, getting his names from family friend John Black (Drake Hogestyn) and Hope's late grandfather Tom Horton (MacDonald Carey).

Zack Brady was the second son and child of supercouple Hope and Bo Brady, born June 9, 2000. For the longest time, Zack is known as Isaac Theo Carver, the long-awaited and much-beloved son of Abe and Lexie Carver. For years the two had tried unsuccessfully to have a child of their own with no success, until Lexie's father, Stefano, got them in touch with Marlo, a young pregnant woman. Abe and Lexie adopt the baby that Marlo has given birth to, unaware that Stefano had switched Marlo and Hope's sons.
Zack dies on January 1, 2006, after being run over by Bo's SUV, which is driven by his daughter, Chelsea. Upon his death, his liver is donated to his niece, Claire Brady, and his corneas are donated to Abe Carver; Claire's life is saved and Abe regains his eyesight. Zack's death and the revelation of Chelsea as the SUV driver drive a wedge between Bo and Hope – as well as the rest of the Brady family for most of 2006.
In June 2016, he returns as an aged ghost (Scott Shilstone) to help his mother Hope.[1][2]

Bonnie Lockhart[edit]
Bonnie Lockhart (originally named Maureen) is the mother of Mimi Lockhart, Patrick Lockhart, and Connor Lockhart. She has been portrayed by actresses Robin Riker (July 11, 2000 to July 31, 2000), Kathy Connell (August 15, 2000 to June 7, 2002) and, most notably, Judi Evans (September 1, 2003 to March 1, 2007),[3] who also portrays Adrienne Kiriakis. Bonnie is known for making Mimi's life miserable. When Rex wanted to ask her for permission to marry Mimi, she said no, because Rex isn't rich. When Bonnie finds out Mimi is pregnant and wants to tell Rex, Bonnie convinces her to get an abortion; an unwilling Mimi gets one and doesn't tell Rex about it. Bonnie marries Mickey Horton, after his wife is murdered by a serial killer in 2003. After Maggie shows up alive, Mickey divorces her. Bonnie is also the owner of Alice's. It is revealed later that she killed her abusive husband and hid his body; she is eventually sent to prison.
Angela Moroni[edit]
Angela Moroni was portrayed by Ayda Field from late summer of 2000 until March 2001. Angela Moroni is the daughter of Vincent Moroni, an Italian mob boss. She was introduced during Brandon and Sami's quest to get the tape back with Kate forcing Roberto to confess to the murder of Franco Kelly. Angela came into possession of the tape, but she would only give it to Brandon if he married her. When Brandon and Sami went back to Salem, she came with them and kept the tape with her. When they returned to Europe, Brandon and Angela got married. When a spy from her father saw Brandon and Sami kiss, he hired two gunmen to kill Sami and Brandon at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg. This backfired however, when Angela dove in front of Brandon. Before her death, Angela finally made her father give Brandon and Sami the tape.
Vincent Moroni[edit]
Vincent Moroni was portrayed by Carl Weintraub from summer 2000 until March 2001. Vincent Moroni was an Italian mob boss with one daughter, Angela. Upon meeting Brandon and Sami, he was immediately suspicious of them. After Kate told Vincent about the tape (containing Kate telling Roberto to confess to the murder of Franco Kelly) he took it from Angela. When Brandon married Angela anyway, Vincent was convinced he loved his daughter. Kate later slept with Vincent to convince him to kill Victor and manipulated him into spying on Sami and Brandon. When his spy told him about the kiss he ordered Victor, Brandon and Sami to be murdered at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg. Chaos erupted then and Angela threw herself in front of Brandon, saving his life. Vincent was so upset at the events that he set in motion, that he committed suicide.

Other names
Marlena Evans


Hattie Adams is a woman who bore a resemblance to Marlena Evans. Under the guidance of Wilhelm Rolf, she had plastic surgery to increase this resemblance. Stefano DiMera planned to use Hattie against Marlena, but never implemented such a plan. Hattie eventually had further surgery (off-screen) to look identical to Marlena and reappeared briefly in 2004; she was suspected of being a serial killer after Marlena was supposedly witnessed committing the crimes, but it was determined that Marlena had performed the acts under hypnosis and Hattie was not involved. In 2016, an incarcerated Hope Williams Brady encounters Hattie in prison and they become allies; upset that Stefano had interfered in her life, Hattie is pleased that Hope had murdered him. Hattie explains that she had become a secretary in Chicago, but then a man she was dating stole money from her company and framed her for the theft. Hope agrees to help Hattie clear her name, and in exchange Hattie protects Hope from the prison's dominant clique.
Hattie was originally played by Andrea Hall, the real-life identical twin sister of Marlena's portrayer, Deidre Hall. From 2004 onward, after the character's final surgery and Hall-Gengler's retirement from acting, Hattie was played by Deidre Hall. In November 2016, it was confirmed that Deidre Hall would reprise her portrayal of Hattie.[4]

Harold Wentworth[edit]
Harold Wentworth, played by Ryan Scott from 2001 until 2003, was introduced during a storyline in which Jack Deveraux pretended to be gay in order to spare Greta von Amberg's feelings, as he didn't return her affection. Greta tried to set Jack up with Harold, an openly gay man. Harold worked with Greta to set up situations where he and Jack could be intimate, but Jack would always find a way to escape. Jack eventually admitted that he was not gay, which led to Harold criticizing him for his cowardice. Harold later happened to be in Las Vegas at the same time as Jack and Greta, and he helped them hide from mob hitmen by disguising themselves as showgirls. To his dismay, Jack then learned that Harold was the son of Oliver Wentworth, the owner of the Spectator. This was the local newspaper, which Jack hoped to run; Jennifer got the job instead, due in part to Harold's recommendation. Harold then worked at the Spectator, and was able to maintain a friendly, professional relationship with Jack. He last appeared during the summer of 2003, shortly before the Salem Stalker storyline started. By 2006, though not shown on-screen, Harold had become editor of the Spectator; Jack and Jennifer learned that he was offering them a job running the London bureau of the paper, which they accepted.
Eugenia Willens[edit]
Eugenia Willens, played by Daphne Bloomer from 2002 to 2006,[5] worked at Salem University Hospital as a lab tech, but she lost her job and her pension after Sami blackmailed her into looking the other way while Sami switched the results of a paternity test. She later conspired with Kate against Sami and also worked as Lucas' personal assistant at Titan. She briefly dated Lucas.

Rex Brady was portrayed by actor Eric Winter. Rex first appeared on July 8, 2002, and left town on July 26, 2005. He is the son of Roman Brady and Kate Roberts and twin brother to Cassie Brady.
Rex and his twin sister Cassie were discovered half-naked during a meteor shower and were originally suspected to be aliens. As time went on it was discovered that they were the children of Tony DiMera and Marlena Evans but this turned out to be false. In reality a sperm sample was somehow taken from Roman Brady during his years of captivity at the hands of Tony's father Stefano DiMera and combined with eggs taken from Kate Roberts who was a prostitute and associate of Stefano's.
Rex and, to a lesser extent, Cassie seemed to have super human intelligence. Rex also suffered mysterious mood swings and psychotic tendencies during Salem Stalker storyline. He dated Mimi Lockhart but they broke up when Rex discovered Mimi aborted his baby without telling him about it. Feeling hurt and betrayed, Rex left town following the abortion and has not appeared on the show since his departure.
Rex is last mentioned on March 10, 2017, when his mother, Kate, gets a bracelet from Eduardo with the initials of her six children on it.

Duck[edit]
Duck is a Vietnam War veteran who lives on the fictional island Tinda Lao with his daughter Gabby.
Gabby[edit]
Gabby, played by Joy Bisco, is a young woman who lives on the fictional island, Tinda Lao. Her father is Duck. When Shawn-Douglas Brady was in Tinda Lao, she fell in love with him, but he stuck to his fiancée, Belle Black.
Morgan Hollingsworth[edit]
Morgan Hollingsworth, portrayed by Kristen Renton, was President of Alpha Chi Theta sorority, where Chelsea and Stephanie pledged. Morgan dated Max Brady and was almost a victim of Ford Decker, the campus rapist. She and the Alpha Chi Theta girls conspired to stop Ford from raping again but their plan backfired and he fell to his death. Soon after Ford's death and the coverup was exposed, Max and Morgan broke up.
Morgan later went to work for Tony as his intern at the same time Stephanie interned for Anna's rival firm. Morgan's interests moved to Philip Kiriakis soon after her father, Paul, disappeared. John Black and Phillip were involved in a heated shipping rivalry that turned ugly when gun fire broke out. Phillip took a bullet intended for Morgan after one of Ava's goons tried to shoot her. Morgan helped Phillip with his recovery and they shared a short romance. After Paul was revealed to be alive, Phillip admitted to threatening Paul's life and was later caught kissing Chloe. Morgan left town to take a two-year internship in Chicago.
Alex North[edit]
Dr. Alex North was portrayed by Wayne Northrop from August 1, 2005, to May 24, 2006. Alex North was brought to Salem by John Black to help John's wife Marlena recover from amnesia. Marlena had memories of Alex and, after discovering they had been married (North had been presumed dead after being captured on a mission in Vietnam), she chose him instead of John because Alex was controlling her mind. It was soon discovered that he had been an abusive husband and, after a fight with John, he was presumed dead after falling over the edge of a cliff. The Alex North storyline was very unpopular with viewers.
Trent Robbins[edit]
Trent Robbins (played by Roscoe Born) was the biological father of Max Brady and the adoptive father of Melanie Layton. He abused Max as a child, causing Max to become socially isolated and mute for several years. Trent returned in 2008 as the Dean of the Physics department at Salem University. It was revealed that he was still married to Nicole Walker. He re-entered Max's life by awarding Nick Fallon a grant for his "work" on a fuel cell. Unbeknownst to Trent, Max was responsible for the majority of Nick's design. Max became short-tempered upon seeing Trent and confronted him. After Max insisted that Trent take responsibility for his abusive actions, Trent offered to pay him off in order to keep his past a secret.
Trent was murdered via a stab in the back. Among the suspects were Caroline Brady, Trent's children Max and Melanie, and his wife Nicole. It was revealed that Nick was responsible for the murder. Nick maintained that he killed Trent in Melanie's defense, and that his addiction to alcohol and painkillers played a role in his bad decision.

A little after Thanksgiving, Claire becomes sick for an unknown reason.

In a horrible twist of fate, Claire's biological uncle, Zack who was only 5 at the time, dies in a hit-and-run car accident.

Shawn got Willow a job at Chez Rouge and started dating her after he broke up with his ex-wife Mimi Lockhart.

Weeks later, EJ Wells paid her to break into the Brady home and she accidentally set fire to the place.

Glen Reiber is the biological father of J.T. Brady, who was switched at birth with Zack Brady, resulting in a complicated custody battle.
While watching TV in Chicago, Glen Reiber saw a sketch of a girl whose body had been found frozen in the ice, in the canal behind Bo and Hope Brady's house after their wedding New Year's Eve. He recognized it as Marlo, his former girlfriend, who had left town suddenly while pregnant. The couple went to Salem, identified the sketch, and Glen inquired about the baby Marlo carried.
Though given the runaround by the Carvers, he and Barb found that Marlo gave birth to a boy, in June 2000, and the Carvers had adopted him. Jennifer Deveraux had a car accident resulting in baby J.T. Brady falling into the river, while strapped in Isaac Carver's baby seat (his name was on it). Barb spotted the baby floating, like Moses in the rushes, and they rescued him. Thinking that he is Isaac, the Reibers fled to his aunt's cabin in the hills. Auntie discovered the surgery scar, and when the baby began to have breathing difficulties, Glen and Barb rushed him to the local hospital, but then returned to Salem. They already had a DNA test to prove Glen was the father of Marlo's child.
Although facing kidnapping charges, Bo and Hope only wanted J.T. back safe, and promised not to press charges. The Reibers returned J.T., and went back to Chicago, where the DNA results arrived. Barb read them secretly, realizing Glen was the father of J.T., and not Isaac's father, and went back to Salem to blackmail Lexie Carver. She succeeded in getting several thousand dollars, and then told Glen that she was pregnant with their child, hoping he will not try to search for the truth. Eventually they both returned to Salem and crashed Lexie's party. When Lexie didn't come up with the million dollars, Barb blew the whistle. Glen sought out a slick attorney, Cameron Reese, to sue for custody of J.T. In the ensuing DNA test, it was proven that Glen was J.T.'s father.
After Glen and Barb won custody of J.T., they left Salem, choosing to keep the boy's name the same. They returned to Chicago, where they prepared for the birth of their next child.

Tyler Kiriakis is the son of Philip Kiriakis and Mimi Lockhart. In July 2006, Philip Kiriakis and then-wife Belle Black were planning to have a second child, as were their friends/nephew Shawn-Douglas Brady and his then wife Mimi Lockhart were also plan to have a baby. Both couples planned to use artificial insemination. A gloved hand switched the samples so Belle ended up pregnant with Shawn's baby and Shawn and Mimi's surrogate ended up pregnant with Philip and Mimi's child. It wasn't long until both couples learned the truth that there was a switch in the petri dishes. Philip and Mimi wanted to have both babies aborted but Belle chose not to have her child aborted. Unfortunately, she later had complications and her child was lost. After Shawn and Mimi separated, Mimi signed away their rights to the child and left its fate up to the surrogate mother Lauren Chaffee. Bonnie Lockhart was paying Lauren with the intent to mother the child but Bonnie was sent to jail and Lauren was left to give birth on her own.
Philip and his sister Billie have traced Lauren's steps and now believe that "Pocket" or Ty Johnson, the baby boy being fostered by Kayla Brady and Steve Johnson, is actually Tyler.

Ciara Brady is the daughter of Bo Brady and Hope Brady.
Vivian Jovanni assumed the role of Ciara on October 30, 2015.[8] In December 2016, Jovanni left the show.[9]
While grieving over the death of their young son, Zack, Hope and Bo Brady found comfort in one another, and Ciara is conceived, although it takes several months for Hope to learn she is pregnant. When she eventually learns that she is pregnant, a classic "Who's the daddy?" storyline begins. Hope had been to Morgan Island with Patrick Lockhart where, in a moment of weakness, she had found comfort in his arms.
Tests were run and it was "determined" that Hope's unborn child was Patrick's. Unbeknownst to Hope and Bo, Patrick had paid the doctor to fix the test. Despite believing Patrick to be the father of her unborn child, Bo and Hope get back together, pushing Patrick to the point he decides he needs to kidnap Hope. Ciara was originally born on December 29, 2006 but her birthday was changed to July 16, 2004 then again to March 18, 1998. Ciara was born in a warehouse, delivered by Bo. Patrick reveals her true paternity before being arrested.
Ciara's name was selected by fans in an online poll. Out of the five original choices, narrowed down to three, Ciara Alice Brady was the winner.[10]
Ciara lives with Hope and Bo the first couple of years of her life before living with Hope, Doug and Julie after her mother and father separate for a short while. Ciara's parents have since reunited and separated again.
She has two older brothers, Shawn-Douglas and Zack Brady (deceased) and one older paternal half-sister, Chelsea Brady.

Allie Horton is the daughter of Sami Brady and Lucas Horton. She and her twin, Johnny DiMera, are born October 23, 2007, at her grandmother Marlena's house, where they are delivered by Marlena. Allie goes for several weeks without a name until the Thanksgiving Day wedding of Shawn and Belle, where Lucas announces her name as Alice Caroline Horton, and "Allie" for short. Sami is shocked because she and Lucas haven't yet reached a decision on their baby girl's name, but happily Sami loves the name. Allie is named after her great-grandmothers, Alice Horton and Caroline Brady. Her twin, Johnny DiMera, is her maternal half-brother. Allie has a big brother in Will Horton, and in 2009, she becomes big sister to her new maternal half-sister, Sydney DiMera.
In February 2011, Allie goes to live in Hong Kong with her father Lucas for a while, after the man who is masquerading as her step-father Rafe Hernandez is mean to her several times. She returns after it is revealed that the man is an imposter. Sami and the real Rafe try to help Allie understand what has happened.
In May 2013, Allie becomes an aunt to Arianna Grace Horton (Will's daughter with Gabi Hernandez), and in April 2014 when Will gets married, Allie gains a brother-in-law in Sonny Kiriakis.
In May 2014, Allie is walking into the Horton Town Square with Jordan Ridgeway when she sees her favorite cousin Nick Fallon, who has been shot multiple times and is bleeding from the chest, stumble into the square and collapse. Allie screams and is the first person to notice him. Afterwards, she cannot stop looking at him despite her parents' attempts to get her to look away; and when Nick dies shortly after, she is traumatized by his death.
In October 2014, Allie moves with Sami, Johnny and Sydney, to live in California.

Johnny DiMera is the son of EJ DiMera and Sami Brady, and the maternal half-twin of Allie Horton. Johnny has an older maternal half-brother in Will Horton, and in 2009 he gains a full sister in Sydney DiMera. In 2013, Johnny becomes an uncle to Will's daughter Arianna Horton. With a full name of John Roman DiMera, Johnny is named after his mom's dad and step-dad, Roman Brady and John Black.
Johnny is born with Allie on October 23, 2007. He is originally believed, like Allie, to be the son of Lucas Horton, but after the birth, EJ begins to suspect that the twins might have different fathers because Johnny does not look like his sister, and EJ thinks Johnny looks like himself. A second DNA test confirms EJ to be Johnny's father.
After witnessing a murder, Johnny's mom Sami is taken into protection by the federal government as a vulnerable witness. Whilst in witness protection, Sami allows Johnny to live with EJ and his wife Nicole Walker, in the DiMera mansion, with Johnny's paternal grandfather, Stefano DiMera. When Sami is released from witness protection, Johnny returns to live with Sami. However, Stefano insists that EJ raises Johnny as a DiMera, against Sami's wishes. EJ first resists this notion because he does not want to betray his ex-wife; but when he hears that Sami's youngest daughter, whom Sami says she adopted, is his daughter and that Sami gave birth to her whilst in witness protection and hid this from him, EJ is furious with Sami, and he agrees to raise Johnny as a DiMera against his ex-wife's wishes. After much heartache and drama, including Johnny suffering from eye-cancer (from which he eventually makes a full recovery), EJ and Sami become co-operative co-parents, and eventually marry again; but then Johnny's dad EJ is shot dead in a conflict with the villainous Clyde Weston.
After losing his dad, Johnny goes with his mom and sisters to live in Los Angeles.

Crawford Decker[edit]
Crawford Decker was Ford Decker's father. He used his influence with the president of Salem University to protect Ford from being punished for raping several female students. Crawford also urged the police to aggressively pursue Ford's subsequent disappearance.
Ford Decker[edit]
Ford Decker was a student at Salem University who was a serial date rapist. When his father Crawford, used his influence to protect Ford from being punished for drugging and raping numerous female students, the sisters of Alpha Chi Theta decided to take action. The women, who included three of Ford's victims or attempted victims, drugged him. When the partially incapacitated Ford then pursued Chelsea, whom he had also drugged, up the stairs of the sorority house, he lost consciousness and suffered a fatal fall down the stairs. The sisters buried his body in the basement. Subsequently, Chelsea Brady and Stephanie Johnson dug him back up and hid him in a water heater, which Max Brady removed from the premises.
Richard Baker[edit]
Richard Baker, played by John Callahan (2008–2009; 2010),[11] is a doctor Nicole blackmails into posing as her OB/GYN while she fakes pregnancy after miscarrying her baby. Though he claims to have altruistic motives in the running of his free clinic, he's involved in shady black market baby brokering in order to pay off his substantial debts, a fact Nicole uses to her advantage. He frequently goes to Nicole for money in exchange for keeping her secret until he is murdered by men Stefano DiMera hires. Stefano also attempts to frame Rafe Hernandez for the murder. In his last frugal efforts to tell Sami and Mia about the baby switch, he writes each of them a letter, both of which are destroyed by Nicole. However, it is discovered that he faked his death and later returns to Salem. He helps Hope, who under the influence of sleeping pills, mugs the men of Salem. He was caught and send to prison for helping Nicole switch babies and stealing money.

Daniel Jonas first appeared on March 4, 2008, being portrayed by actor, Shawn Christian. Christian initially signed a one-year contract, but he has since signed on for an extended stay.[12] Following a fatal car crash caused by Eric Brady's drunk-driving, the character was written into a coma on January 4, 2016. On January 6, 2016, the character was killed off after being taken off life support when his heart was donated to Brady Black. Christian reprised the role thereafter during a dream sequence with Nicole Walker on February 12, 2016, during another dream sequence months later with Chloe Lane on November 3, 2016, and yet another dream sequence with Nicole Walker on December 12, 2016 - declaring his love for her as well as his encouragement for her to move on with her life. Christian made more reprisals in 2017, once on January 27, 2017, once in May 2017, and a final appearance as an apparition to Eric Brady and Nicole Walker on June 28, 2017.
Before arriving in Salem, Dr. Jonas worked at various hospitals around the world. Many years ago, he had an affair with Carly Manning, who later introduced him to Rebecca, a cancer patient with whom Daniel fell in love. Although Rebecca's prognosis was grim, Daniel married her anyway and was determined to save her. Rebecca's cancer proved to be too advanced and she died in Daniel's arms. Upon his arrival in Salem, Daniel has romances with Chelsea Brady and her grandmother Kate Roberts. In early 2010, Carly tells Daniel that Melanie Layton is their daughter. Daniel and Melanie bond quickly, and eventually forgive Carly for keeping them apart. After a drunken one night stand with Melanie's husband, Philip Kiriakis, Daniel's fiancée Chloe Lane becomes pregnant, and is unsure if Daniel or Philip is the father. She is relieved when a paternity test shows Daniel as the child's father. Daniel and Chloe name their son Parker, after Daniel's mother. At Parker's christening, Caroline Brady reveals that she switched the paternity test to keep Melanie from leaving Philip for her granddaughter Stephanie Johnson's boyfriend Nathan Horton. Daniel ends his marriage to Chloe.
Daniel soon finds happiness with Jennifer Horton, but their happiness is short-lived as Jennifer's ex, Jack Deveraux returns to town. Eventually Jennifer reunites with Jack and Daniel finds comfort with a pregnant Nicole Walker. He also learns that Maggie Horton is his biological mother. Daniel helps Nicole fix her child's paternity test, claiming the baby is Rafe Hernandez's, even though it is EJ DiMera's. As Nicole grows attached to Daniel, Jack dies and Daniel and Jennifer reunite. Nicole loses her baby, but keeps it a secret, wanting to hold onto Daniel. When Nicole falls down the stairs after a fight with Jennifer, and gives birth to a stillborn son, she blames Jennifer. Eventually the truth comes out and Daniel and Jennifer once again reunite. EJ confronts Daniel for keeping his son away from him saying he will not retaliate because of Daniel's previous help with his other son Johnny but warns Daniel not to cross him again.
On January 7, 2013, Chloe returns to Salem with the news that Daniel is really Parker's father.
On December 31, 2015, Daniel and Brady Black are driving in car returning to the Basic Black launch of product line because Brady forgot a gift for Theresa, during this time Eric Brady decides to drive himself while being intoxicated causes a car crash which injures several major Salem Residents including, Dr. Daniel Jonas, Brady Black, Eric Brady, and Jennifer Horton.
On January 4, 2016, Daniel was pronounced dead to the injuries from the accident, as an organ donor, Kayla asks Maggie to allow for Daniel to donate his heart to either Eric or Brady. On January 6, 2016, Daniel is taken off life-support with Maggie's consent and his heart is donated to Brady Black.

Mia McCormick[edit]
Mia McCormick (played by Taylor Spreitler from January 6, 2009 – June 23, 2010), is a high school drop-out, who was introduced as a pregnant teenager. Nicole Walker bought her baby, Grace, for $10K to replace her own, secretly miscarried, baby. She then secretly swaps Grace for Sami Brady's baby, Sydney, who was born at the same time (January 28, 2009). Grace eventually dies of bacterial meningitis. Mia uses the money to fund a dancing career in Japan but when this fails she returns to Salem, determined to get her baby back. She then befriends Will Horton, moves in with Maggie Horton and takes a job at Java Cafe. Her ex-boyfriend Chad DiMera, father of Grace, also has a job at Java Cafe. After overhearing information and investigating, he discovers what had happened to his daughter, although neither Chad nor Mia initially knew about Sydney and Grace being switched. Mia eventually finds out that Grace was her biological daughter, and she and Chad mourn her. Meanwhile, Mia is attracted to, and dates, Will but is forced to break up by Chad in her efforts to keep her deal with Nicole secret. Chad, however, breaks his promise to stop looking for Grace. Will eventually learns all of this; he is surprised but thinks it all makes sense that Nicole can give the baby a better home.

Grace Brady is the biological daughter of a young teenage mother, Mia McCormick and her ex-boyfriend Chad DiMera, then Peterson-Woods, born on-screen on January 27, 2009, but she was believed to be the biological daughter of E.J. DiMera and Sami Brady. It wasn't until November 12, 2009 when Rafe Hernandez revealed the truth that Sami Brady knew she wasn't Grace's birth mother.
Sami Brady and Nicole Walker were both pregnant with E.J. DiMera's babies. Nicole miscarried but pretended to still be pregnant. She planned to adopt Mia McCormick's baby and pass it off as hers with E.J. When Mia and Sami gave birth to girls on the same day, in the same medical clinic, almost at the same time, Nicole switched Sami's baby with Mia's baby (Nicole helped deliver Mia's baby), so that she and E.J. would raise a child that was biologically his.
Sami, who was forced to enter the witness protection program during her pregnancy, decided to protect her child from the DiMeras by never telling E.J. about their baby. As a result, she left Grace at a convent orphanage. On March 30, 2009, Sami brought Grace home to Salem telling everybody she was her "adopted" daughter. The same day she made Rafe, her former bodyguard turned boyfriend, Grace's godfather. The baby was christened Grace Rafaela; Grace in honor of the convent and what Sami perceived as God's intervention in helping her to have and keep her baby, and Rafaela in honor of Rafe.
Grace died on June 9, 2009 from bacterial meningitis. Grace's parents, Sami Brady and Rafe Hernandez, were at her bedside when she died. She had also been held on that day by her biological mother, Mia. On June 11, 2009 Sami revealed to E.J. that he was "Grace's biological father," still unaware that the baby she had raised was not genetically theirs.

Sydney DiMera is the daughter of EJ DiMera and Sami Brady. Sydney is born in secret on January 28, 2009,[13] while her mother is in witness protection, and she is switched shortly after birth with the daughter of a teenage mother, Mia, who has agreed to give her baby up for adoption to Nicole Walker. Nicole, who has miscarried her fiancé E.J.'s daughter, has arranged in secret to adopt Mia's baby and pass the child off as E.J.'s, fearful that she would lose EJ without a baby.
When Nicole learns that Sami had just recently given birth to her and E.J.'s daughter the same day Mia gave birth to hers, Nicole switches the babies, preferring to have E.J.'s biological daughter over an unrelated child. Nicole instantly bonds with Sydney, and vows to always protect her no matter what happens. Sami and E.J. are none the wiser to Nicole's treachery, and Sami and Rafe bond with "Sami's" daughter, while EJ and Nicole bond with "their" daughter.
E.J. eventually learns that Nicole had a miscarriage and he kicks Nicole and Sydney out of the mansion, not knowing the truth about Sydney. Eventually, Sami also learns that Sydney is her biological daughter. Soon after, E.J. learns that Sydney is his biological child with Sami. However, the family reunion turns into a nightmare when Brady Black bails Nicole out of jail and she kidnaps Sydney. Nicole has a change of heart and decides to tell E.J. and Sami where Sydney is, but she is knocked out by Anna DiMera, who takes Sydney. It is later revealed that Anna was hired by E.J. to kidnap Sydney.
Sydney becomes the subject of many custody battles between E.J. and Sami over the next few years, with Nicole involved, as well, during the time she is married to E.J. They later come to an agreement, though, and Sydney is able to stay with her entire family, including her siblings, Johnny, Allie Horton, and Will Horton. Sydney became an aunt when Gabi Hernandez gave birth to Will's daughter, Arianna Horton.

After years of trying for a baby the natural way, Abe and Lexie Carver decide that they will adopt a child. When Lexie's father Stefano DiMera hears about the news, he is over joyed at the prospect of finally becoming a grandfather and asks that Abe and Lexie adopt the child of one of his distant relatives. The birth mother Marlo is in fact the niece of Dr. Rolf, Stefano's longtime assistant. However none the wiser to Lexie and Abe, Stefano is planning a plot whereby Marlo's baby would be switched with the baby of Bo and Hope's who Stefano at the time thought might be his or John Black's. After the births of the babies, Stefano has Dr. Rolf switch Hope's and Marlo's babies birth tags. So, the baby is instead taken home by Bo and Hope Brady and named John Thomas, getting his names from family friend John Black (Drake Hogestyn) and Hope's late grandfather Tom Horton (MacDonald Carey).

Zack Brady was the second son and child of supercouple Hope and Bo Brady, born June 9, 2000. For the longest time, Zack is known as Isaac Theo Carver, the long-awaited and much-beloved son of Abe and Lexie Carver. For years the two had tried unsuccessfully to have a child of their own with no success, until Lexie's father, Stefano, got them in touch with Marlo, a young pregnant woman. Abe and Lexie adopt the baby that Marlo has given birth to, unaware that Stefano had switched Marlo and Hope's sons.
Zack dies on January 1, 2006, after being run over by Bo's SUV, which is driven by his daughter, Chelsea. Upon his death, his liver is donated to his niece, Claire Brady, and his corneas are donated to Abe Carver; Claire's life is saved and Abe regains his eyesight. Zack's death and the revelation of Chelsea as the SUV driver drive a wedge between Bo and Hope – as well as the rest of the Brady family for most of 2006.
In June 2016, he returns as an aged ghost (Scott Shilstone) to help his mother Hope.[1][2]

Bonnie Lockhart[edit]
Bonnie Lockhart (originally named Maureen) is the mother of Mimi Lockhart, Patrick Lockhart, and Connor Lockhart. She has been portrayed by actresses Robin Riker (July 11, 2000 to July 31, 2000), Kathy Connell (August 15, 2000 to June 7, 2002) and, most notably, Judi Evans (September 1, 2003 to March 1, 2007),[3] who also portrays Adrienne Kiriakis. Bonnie is known for making Mimi's life miserable. When Rex wanted to ask her for permission to marry Mimi, she said no, because Rex isn't rich. When Bonnie finds out Mimi is pregnant and wants to tell Rex, Bonnie convinces her to get an abortion; an unwilling Mimi gets one and doesn't tell Rex about it. Bonnie marries Mickey Horton, after his wife is murdered by a serial killer in 2003. After Maggie shows up alive, Mickey divorces her. Bonnie is also the owner of Alice's. It is revealed later that she killed her abusive husband and hid his body; she is eventually sent to prison.
Angela Moroni[edit]
Angela Moroni was portrayed by Ayda Field from late summer of 2000 until March 2001. Angela Moroni is the daughter of Vincent Moroni, an Italian mob boss. She was introduced during Brandon and Sami's quest to get the tape back with Kate forcing Roberto to confess to the murder of Franco Kelly. Angela came into possession of the tape, but she would only give it to Brandon if he married her. When Brandon and Sami went back to Salem, she came with them and kept the tape with her. When they returned to Europe, Brandon and Angela got married. When a spy from her father saw Brandon and Sami kiss, he hired two gunmen to kill Sami and Brandon at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg. This backfired however, when Angela dove in front of Brandon. Before her death, Angela finally made her father give Brandon and Sami the tape.
Vincent Moroni[edit]
Vincent Moroni was portrayed by Carl Weintraub from summer 2000 until March 2001. Vincent Moroni was an Italian mob boss with one daughter, Angela. Upon meeting Brandon and Sami, he was immediately suspicious of them. After Kate told Vincent about the tape (containing Kate telling Roberto to confess to the murder of Franco Kelly) he took it from Angela. When Brandon married Angela anyway, Vincent was convinced he loved his daughter. Kate later slept with Vincent to convince him to kill Victor and manipulated him into spying on Sami and Brandon. When his spy told him about the kiss he ordered Victor, Brandon and Sami to be murdered at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg. Chaos erupted then and Angela threw herself in front of Brandon, saving his life. Vincent was so upset at the events that he set in motion, that he committed suicide.

Other names
Marlena Evans


Hattie Adams is a woman who bore a resemblance to Marlena Evans. Under the guidance of Wilhelm Rolf, she had plastic surgery to increase this resemblance. Stefano DiMera planned to use Hattie against Marlena, but never implemented such a plan. Hattie eventually had further surgery (off-screen) to look identical to Marlena and reappeared briefly in 2004; she was suspected of being a serial killer after Marlena was supposedly witnessed committing the crimes, but it was determined that Marlena had performed the acts under hypnosis and Hattie was not involved. In 2016, an incarcerated Hope Williams Brady encounters Hattie in prison and they become allies; upset that Stefano had interfered in her life, Hattie is pleased that Hope had murdered him. Hattie explains that she had become a secretary in Chicago, but then a man she was dating stole money from her company and framed her for the theft. Hope agrees to help Hattie clear her name, and in exchange Hattie protects Hope from the prison's dominant clique.
Hattie was originally played by Andrea Hall, the real-life identical twin sister of Marlena's portrayer, Deidre Hall. From 2004 onward, after the character's final surgery and Hall-Gengler's retirement from acting, Hattie was played by Deidre Hall. In November 2016, it was confirmed that Deidre Hall would reprise her portrayal of Hattie.[4]

Harold Wentworth[edit]
Harold Wentworth, played by Ryan Scott from 2001 until 2003, was introduced during a storyline in which Jack Deveraux pretended to be gay in order to spare Greta von Amberg's feelings, as he didn't return her affection. Greta tried to set Jack up with Harold, an openly gay man. Harold worked with Greta to set up situations where he and Jack could be intimate, but Jack would always find a way to escape. Jack eventually admitted that he was not gay, which led to Harold criticizing him for his cowardice. Harold later happened to be in Las Vegas at the same time as Jack and Greta, and he helped them hide from mob hitmen by disguising themselves as showgirls. To his dismay, Jack then learned that Harold was the son of Oliver Wentworth, the owner of the Spectator. This was the local newspaper, which Jack hoped to run; Jennifer got the job instead, due in part to Harold's recommendation. Harold then worked at the Spectator, and was able to maintain a friendly, professional relationship with Jack. He last appeared during the summer of 2003, shortly before the Salem Stalker storyline started. By 2006, though not shown on-screen, Harold had become editor of the Spectator; Jack and Jennifer learned that he was offering them a job running the London bureau of the paper, which they accepted.
Eugenia Willens[edit]
Eugenia Willens, played by Daphne Bloomer from 2002 to 2006,[5] worked at Salem University Hospital as a lab tech, but she lost her job and her pension after Sami blackmailed her into looking the other way while Sami switched the results of a paternity test. She later conspired with Kate against Sami and also worked as Lucas' personal assistant at Titan. She briefly dated Lucas.

Rex Brady was portrayed by actor Eric Winter. Rex first appeared on July 8, 2002, and left town on July 26, 2005. He is the son of Roman Brady and Kate Roberts and twin brother to Cassie Brady.
Rex and his twin sister Cassie were discovered half-naked during a meteor shower and were originally suspected to be aliens. As time went on it was discovered that they were the children of Tony DiMera and Marlena Evans but this turned out to be false. In reality a sperm sample was somehow taken from Roman Brady during his years of captivity at the hands of Tony's father Stefano DiMera and combined with eggs taken from Kate Roberts who was a prostitute and associate of Stefano's.
Rex and, to a lesser extent, Cassie seemed to have super human intelligence. Rex also suffered mysterious mood swings and psychotic tendencies during Salem Stalker storyline. He dated Mimi Lockhart but they broke up when Rex discovered Mimi aborted his baby without telling him about it. Feeling hurt and betrayed, Rex left town following the abortion and has not appeared on the show since his departure.
Rex is last mentioned on March 10, 2017, when his mother, Kate, gets a bracelet from Eduardo with the initials of her six children on it.

Duck[edit]
Duck is a Vietnam War veteran who lives on the fictional island Tinda Lao with his daughter Gabby.
Gabby[edit]
Gabby, played by Joy Bisco, is a young woman who lives on the fictional island, Tinda Lao. Her father is Duck. When Shawn-Douglas Brady was in Tinda Lao, she fell in love with him, but he stuck to his fiancée, Belle Black.
Morgan Hollingsworth[edit]
Morgan Hollingsworth, portrayed by Kristen Renton, was President of Alpha Chi Theta sorority, where Chelsea and Stephanie pledged. Morgan dated Max Brady and was almost a victim of Ford Decker, the campus rapist. She and the Alpha Chi Theta girls conspired to stop Ford from raping again but their plan backfired and he fell to his death. Soon after Ford's death and the coverup was exposed, Max and Morgan broke up.
Morgan later went to work for Tony as his intern at the same time Stephanie interned for Anna's rival firm. Morgan's interests moved to Philip Kiriakis soon after her father, Paul, disappeared. John Black and Phillip were involved in a heated shipping rivalry that turned ugly when gun fire broke out. Phillip took a bullet intended for Morgan after one of Ava's goons tried to shoot her. Morgan helped Phillip with his recovery and they shared a short romance. After Paul was revealed to be alive, Phillip admitted to threatening Paul's life and was later caught kissing Chloe. Morgan left town to take a two-year internship in Chicago.
Alex North[edit]
Dr. Alex North was portrayed by Wayne Northrop from August 1, 2005, to May 24, 2006. Alex North was brought to Salem by John Black to help John's wife Marlena recover from amnesia. Marlena had memories of Alex and, after discovering they had been married (North had been presumed dead after being captured on a mission in Vietnam), she chose him instead of John because Alex was controlling her mind. It was soon discovered that he had been an abusive husband and, after a fight with John, he was presumed dead after falling over the edge of a cliff. The Alex North storyline was very unpopular with viewers.
Trent Robbins[edit]
Trent Robbins (played by Roscoe Born) was the biological father of Max Brady and the adoptive father of Melanie Layton. He abused Max as a child, causing Max to become socially isolated and mute for several years. Trent returned in 2008 as the Dean of the Physics department at Salem University. It was revealed that he was still married to Nicole Walker. He re-entered Max's life by awarding Nick Fallon a grant for his "work" on a fuel cell. Unbeknownst to Trent, Max was responsible for the majority of Nick's design. Max became short-tempered upon seeing Trent and confronted him. After Max insisted that Trent take responsibility for his abusive actions, Trent offered to pay him off in order to keep his past a secret.
Trent was murdered via a stab in the back. Among the suspects were Caroline Brady, Trent's children Max and Melanie, and his wife Nicole. It was revealed that Nick was responsible for the murder. Nick maintained that he killed Trent in Melanie's defense, and that his addiction to alcohol and painkillers played a role in his bad decision.

A little after Thanksgiving, Claire becomes sick for an unknown reason.

In a horrible twist of fate, Claire's biological uncle, Zack who was only 5 at the time, dies in a hit-and-run car accident.

Glen Reiber is the biological father of J.T. Brady, who was switched at birth with Zack Brady, resulting in a complicated custody battle.
While watching TV in Chicago, Glen Reiber saw a sketch of a girl whose body had been found frozen in the ice, in the canal behind Bo and Hope Brady's house after their wedding New Year's Eve. He recognized it as Marlo, his former girlfriend, who had left town suddenly while pregnant. The couple went to Salem, identified the sketch, and Glen inquired about the baby Marlo carried.
Though given the runaround by the Carvers, he and Barb found that Marlo gave birth to a boy, in June 2000, and the Carvers had adopted him. Jennifer Deveraux had a car accident resulting in baby J.T. Brady falling into the river, while strapped in Isaac Carver's baby seat (his name was on it). Barb spotted the baby floating, like Moses in the rushes, and they rescued him. Thinking that he is Isaac, the Reibers fled to his aunt's cabin in the hills. Auntie discovered the surgery scar, and when the baby began to have breathing difficulties, Glen and Barb rushed him to the local hospital, but then returned to Salem. They already had a DNA test to prove Glen was the father of Marlo's child.
Although facing kidnapping charges, Bo and Hope only wanted J.T. back safe, and promised not to press charges. The Reibers returned J.T., and went back to Chicago, where the DNA results arrived. Barb read them secretly, realizing Glen was the father of J.T., and not Isaac's father, and went back to Salem to blackmail Lexie Carver. She succeeded in getting several thousand dollars, and then told Glen that she was pregnant with their child, hoping he will not try to search for the truth. Eventually they both returned to Salem and crashed Lexie's party. When Lexie didn't come up with the million dollars, Barb blew the whistle. Glen sought out a slick attorney, Cameron Reese, to sue for custody of J.T. In the ensuing DNA test, it was proven that Glen was J.T.'s father.
After Glen and Barb won custody of J.T., they left Salem, choosing to keep the boy's name the same. They returned to Chicago, where they prepared for the birth of their next child.

Tyler Kiriakis is the son of Philip Kiriakis and Mimi Lockhart. In July 2006, Philip Kiriakis and then-wife Belle Black were planning to have a second child, as were their friends/nephew Shawn-Douglas Brady and his then wife Mimi Lockhart were also plan to have a baby. Both couples planned to use artificial insemination. A gloved hand switched the samples so Belle ended up pregnant with Shawn's baby and Shawn and Mimi's surrogate ended up pregnant with Philip and Mimi's child. It wasn't long until both couples learned the truth that there was a switch in the petri dishes. Philip and Mimi wanted to have both babies aborted but Belle chose not to have her child aborted. Unfortunately, she later had complications and her child was lost. After Shawn and Mimi separated, Mimi signed away their rights to the child and left its fate up to the surrogate mother Lauren Chaffee. Bonnie Lockhart was paying Lauren with the intent to mother the child but Bonnie was sent to jail and Lauren was left to give birth on her own.
Philip and his sister Billie have traced Lauren's steps and now believe that "Pocket" or Ty Johnson, the baby boy being fostered by Kayla Brady and Steve Johnson, is actually Tyler.

Ciara Brady is the daughter of Bo Brady and Hope Brady.
Vivian Jovanni assumed the role of Ciara on October 30, 2015.[8] In December 2016, Jovanni left the show.[9]
While grieving over the death of their young son, Zack, Hope and Bo Brady found comfort in one another, and Ciara is conceived, although it takes several months for Hope to learn she is pregnant. When she eventually learns that she is pregnant, a classic "Who's the daddy?" storyline begins. Hope had been to Morgan Island with Patrick Lockhart where, in a moment of weakness, she had found comfort in his arms.
Tests were run and it was "determined" that Hope's unborn child was Patrick's. Unbeknownst to Hope and Bo, Patrick had paid the doctor to fix the test. Despite believing Patrick to be the father of her unborn child, Bo and Hope get back together, pushing Patrick to the point he decides he needs to kidnap Hope. Ciara was originally born on December 29, 2006 but her birthday was changed to July 16, 2004 then again to March 18, 1998. Ciara was born in a warehouse, delivered by Bo. Patrick reveals her true paternity before being arrested.
Ciara's name was selected by fans in an online poll. Out of the five original choices, narrowed down to three, Ciara Alice Brady was the winner.[10]
Ciara lives with Hope and Bo the first couple of years of her life before living with Hope, Doug and Julie after her mother and father separate for a short while. Ciara's parents have since reunited and separated again.
She has two older brothers, Shawn-Douglas and Zack Brady (deceased) and one older paternal half-sister, Chelsea Brady.

Allie Horton is the daughter of Sami Brady and Lucas Horton. She and her twin, Johnny DiMera, are born October 23, 2007, at her grandmother Marlena's house, where they are delivered by Marlena. Allie goes for several weeks without a name until the Thanksgiving Day wedding of Shawn and Belle, where Lucas announces her name as Alice Caroline Horton, and "Allie" for short. Sami is shocked because she and Lucas haven't yet reached a decision on their baby girl's name, but happily Sami loves the name. Allie is named after her great-grandmothers, Alice Horton and Caroline Brady. Her twin, Johnny DiMera, is her maternal half-brother. Allie has a big brother in Will Horton, and in 2009, she becomes big sister to her new maternal half-sister, Sydney DiMera.
In February 2011, Allie goes to live in Hong Kong with her father Lucas for a while, after the man who is masquerading as her step-father Rafe Hernandez is mean to her several times. She returns after it is revealed that the man is an imposter. Sami and the real Rafe try to help Allie understand what has happened.
In May 2013, Allie becomes an aunt to Arianna Grace Horton (Will's daughter with Gabi Hernandez), and in April 2014 when Will gets married, Allie gains a brother-in-law in Sonny Kiriakis.
In May 2014, Allie is walking into the Horton Town Square with Jordan Ridgeway when she sees her favorite cousin Nick Fallon, who has been shot multiple times and is bleeding from the chest, stumble into the square and collapse. Allie screams and is the first person to notice him. Afterwards, she cannot stop looking at him despite her parents' attempts to get her to look away; and when Nick dies shortly after, she is traumatized by his death.
In October 2014, Allie moves with Sami, Johnny and Sydney, to live in California.

Johnny has an older maternal half-brother in Will Horton, and in 2009 he gains a full sister in Sydney DiMera. In 2013, Johnny becomes an uncle to Will's daughter Arianna Horton. With a full name of John Roman DiMera, Johnny is named after his mom's dad and step-dad, Roman Brady and John Black.
Johnny is born with Allie on October 23, 2007. He is originally believed, like Allie, to be the son of Lucas Horton, but after the birth, EJ begins to suspect that the twins might have different fathers because Johnny does not look like his sister, and EJ thinks Johnny looks like himself. A second DNA test confirms EJ to be Johnny's father.
After witnessing a murder, Johnny's mom Sami is taken into protection by the federal government as a vulnerable witness. Whilst in witness protection, Sami allows Johnny to live with EJ and his wife Nicole Walker, in the DiMera mansion, with Johnny's paternal grandfather, Stefano DiMera. When Sami is released from witness protection, Johnny returns to live with Sami. However, Stefano insists that EJ raises Johnny as a DiMera, against Sami's wishes. EJ first resists this notion because he does not want to betray his ex-wife; but when he hears that Sami's youngest daughter, whom Sami says she adopted, is his daughter and that Sami gave birth to her whilst in witness protection and hid this from him, EJ is furious with Sami, and he agrees to raise Johnny as a DiMera against his ex-wife's wishes. After much heartache and drama, including Johnny suffering from eye-cancer (from which he eventually makes a full recovery), EJ and Sami become co-operative co-parents, and eventually marry again; but then Johnny's dad EJ is shot dead in a conflict with the villainous Clyde Weston.
After losing his dad, Johnny goes with his mom and sisters to live in Los Angeles.

Crawford Decker[edit]
Crawford Decker was Ford Decker's father. He used his influence with the president of Salem University to protect Ford from being punished for raping several female students. Crawford also urged the police to aggressively pursue Ford's subsequent disappearance.
Ford Decker[edit]
Ford Decker was a student at Salem University who was a serial date rapist. When his father Crawford, used his influence to protect Ford from being punished for drugging and raping numerous female students, the sisters of Alpha Chi Theta decided to take action. The women, who included three of Ford's victims or attempted victims, drugged him. When the partially incapacitated Ford then pursued Chelsea, whom he had also drugged, up the stairs of the sorority house, he lost consciousness and suffered a fatal fall down the stairs. The sisters buried his body in the basement. Subsequently, Chelsea Brady and Stephanie Johnson dug him back up and hid him in a water heater, which Max Brady removed from the premises.
Richard Baker[edit]
Richard Baker, played by John Callahan (2008–2009; 2010),[11] is a doctor Nicole blackmails into posing as her OB/GYN while she fakes pregnancy after miscarrying her baby. Though he claims to have altruistic motives in the running of his free clinic, he's involved in shady black market baby brokering in order to pay off his substantial debts, a fact Nicole uses to her advantage. He frequently goes to Nicole for money in exchange for keeping her secret until he is murdered by men Stefano DiMera hires. Stefano also attempts to frame Rafe Hernandez for the murder. In his last frugal efforts to tell Sami and Mia about the baby switch, he writes each of them a letter, both of which are destroyed by Nicole. However, it is discovered that he faked his death and later returns to Salem. He helps Hope, who under the influence of sleeping pills, mugs the men of Salem. He was caught and send to prison for helping Nicole switch babies and stealing money.

Daniel Jonas first appeared on March 4, 2008, being portrayed by actor, Shawn Christian. Christian initially signed a one-year contract, but he has since signed on for an extended stay.[12] Following a fatal car crash caused by Eric Brady's drunk-driving, the character was written into a coma on January 4, 2016. On January 6, 2016, the character was killed off after being taken off life support when his heart was donated to Brady Black. Christian reprised the role thereafter during a dream sequence with Nicole Walker on February 12, 2016, during another dream sequence months later with Chloe Lane on November 3, 2016, and yet another dream sequence with Nicole Walker on December 12, 2016 - declaring his love for her as well as his encouragement for her to move on with her life. Christian made more reprisals in 2017, once on January 27, 2017, once in May 2017, and a final appearance as an apparition to Eric Brady and Nicole Walker on June 28, 2017.
Before arriving in Salem, Dr. Jonas worked at various hospitals around the world. Many years ago, he had an affair with Carly Manning, who later introduced him to Rebecca, a cancer patient with whom Daniel fell in love. Although Rebecca's prognosis was grim, Daniel married her anyway and was determined to save her. Rebecca's cancer proved to be too advanced and she died in Daniel's arms. Upon his arrival in Salem, Daniel has romances with Chelsea Brady and her grandmother Kate Roberts. In early 2010, Carly tells Daniel that Melanie Layton is their daughter. Daniel and Melanie bond quickly, and eventually forgive Carly for keeping them apart. After a drunken one night stand with Melanie's husband, Philip Kiriakis, Daniel's fiancée Chloe Lane becomes pregnant, and is unsure if Daniel or Philip is the father. She is relieved when a paternity test shows Daniel as the child's father. Daniel and Chloe name their son Parker, after Daniel's mother. At Parker's christening, Caroline Brady reveals that she switched the paternity test to keep Melanie from leaving Philip for her granddaughter Stephanie Johnson's boyfriend Nathan Horton. Daniel ends his marriage to Chloe.
Daniel soon finds happiness with Jennifer Horton, but their happiness is short-lived as Jennifer's ex, Jack Deveraux returns to town. Eventually Jennifer reunites with Jack and Daniel finds comfort with a pregnant Nicole Walker. He also learns that Maggie Horton is his biological mother. Daniel helps Nicole fix her child's paternity test, claiming the baby is Rafe Hernandez's, even though it is EJ DiMera's. As Nicole grows attached to Daniel, Jack dies and Daniel and Jennifer reunite. Nicole loses her baby, but keeps it a secret, wanting to hold onto Daniel. When Nicole falls down the stairs after a fight with Jennifer, and gives birth to a stillborn son, she blames Jennifer. Eventually the truth comes out and Daniel and Jennifer once again reunite. EJ confronts Daniel for keeping his son away from him saying he will not retaliate because of Daniel's previous help with his other son Johnny but warns Daniel not to cross him again.
On January 7, 2013, Chloe returns to Salem with the news that Daniel is really Parker's father.
On December 31, 2015, Daniel and Brady Black are driving in car returning to the Basic Black launch of product line because Brady forgot a gift for Theresa, during this time Eric Brady decides to drive himself while being intoxicated causes a car crash which injures several major Salem Residents including, Dr. Daniel Jonas, Brady Black, Eric Brady, and Jennifer Horton.
On January 4, 2016, Daniel was pronounced dead to the injuries from the accident, as an organ donor, Kayla asks Maggie to allow for Daniel to donate his heart to either Eric or Brady. On January 6, 2016, Daniel is taken off life-support with Maggie's consent and his heart is donated to Brady Black.

Mia McCormick[edit]
Mia McCormick (played by Taylor Spreitler from January 6, 2009 – June 23, 2010), is a high school drop-out, who was introduced as a pregnant teenager. Nicole Walker bought her baby, Grace, for $10K to replace her own, secretly miscarried, baby. She then secretly swaps Grace for Sami Brady's baby, Sydney, who was born at the same time (January 28, 2009). Grace eventually dies of bacterial meningitis. Mia uses the money to fund a dancing career in Japan but when this fails she returns to Salem, determined to get her baby back. She then befriends Will Horton, moves in with Maggie Horton and takes a job at Java Cafe. Her ex-boyfriend Chad DiMera, father of Grace, also has a job at Java Cafe. After overhearing information and investigating, he discovers what had happened to his daughter, although neither Chad nor Mia initially knew about Sydney and Grace being switched. Mia eventually finds out that Grace was her biological daughter, and she and Chad mourn her. Meanwhile, Mia is attracted to, and dates, Will but is forced to break up by Chad in her efforts to keep her deal with Nicole secret. Chad, however, breaks his promise to stop looking for Grace. Will eventually learns all of this; he is surprised but thinks it all makes sense that Nicole can give the baby a better home.

Grace Brady is the biological daughter of a young teenage mother, Mia McCormick and her ex-boyfriend Chad DiMera, then Peterson-Woods, born on-screen on January 27, 2009, but she was believed to be the biological daughter of E.J. DiMera and Sami Brady. It wasn't until November 12, 2009 when Rafe Hernandez revealed the truth that Sami Brady knew she wasn't Grace's birth mother.
Sami Brady and Nicole Walker were both pregnant with E.J. DiMera's babies. Nicole miscarried but pretended to still be pregnant. She planned to adopt Mia McCormick's baby and pass it off as hers with E.J. When Mia and Sami gave birth to girls on the same day, in the same medical clinic, almost at the same time, Nicole switched Sami's baby with Mia's baby (Nicole helped deliver Mia's baby), so that she and E.J. would raise a child that was biologically his.
Sami, who was forced to enter the witness protection program during her pregnancy, decided to protect her child from the DiMeras by never telling E.J. about their baby. As a result, she left Grace at a convent orphanage. On March 30, 2009, Sami brought Grace home to Salem telling everybody she was her "adopted" daughter. The same day she made Rafe, her former bodyguard turned boyfriend, Grace's godfather. The baby was christened Grace Rafaela; Grace in honor of the convent and what Sami perceived as God's intervention in helping her to have and keep her baby, and Rafaela in honor of Rafe.
Grace died on June 9, 2009 from bacterial meningitis. Grace's parents, Sami Brady and Rafe Hernandez, were at her bedside when she died. She had also been held on that day by her biological mother, Mia. On June 11, 2009 Sami revealed to E.J. that he was "Grace's biological father," still unaware that the baby she had raised was not genetically theirs.

Sydney DiMera is the daughter of EJ DiMera and Sami Brady. Sydney is born in secret on January 28, 2009,[13] while her mother is in witness protection, and she is switched shortly after birth with the daughter of a teenage mother, Mia, who has agreed to give her baby up for adoption to Nicole Walker. Nicole, who has miscarried her fiancé E.J.'s daughter, has arranged in secret to adopt Mia's baby and pass the child off as E.J.'s, fearful that she would lose EJ without a baby.
When Nicole learns that Sami had just recently given birth to her and E.J.'s daughter the same day Mia gave birth to hers, Nicole switches the babies, preferring to have E.J.'s biological daughter over an unrelated child. Nicole instantly bonds with Sydney, and vows to always protect her no matter what happens. Sami and E.J. are none the wiser to Nicole's treachery, and Sami and Rafe bond with "Sami's" daughter, while EJ and Nicole bond with "their" daughter.
E.J. eventually learns that Nicole had a miscarriage and he kicks Nicole and Sydney out of the mansion, not knowing the truth about Sydney. Eventually, Sami also learns that Sydney is her biological daughter. Soon after, E.J. learns that Sydney is his biological child with Sami. However, the family reunion turns into a nightmare when Brady Black bails Nicole out of jail and she kidnaps Sydney. Nicole has a change of heart and decides to tell E.J. and Sami where Sydney is, but she is knocked out by Anna DiMera, who takes Sydney. It is later revealed that Anna was hired by E.J. to kidnap Sydney.
Sydney becomes the subject of many custody battles between E.J. and Sami over the next few years, with Nicole involved, as well, during the time she is married to E.J. They later come to an agreement, though, and Sydney is able to stay with her entire family, including her siblings, Johnny, Allie Horton, and Will Horton. Sydney became an aunt when Gabi Hernandez gave birth to Will's daughter, Arianna Horton.

J.T. Brady, born on June 9, 2000, is introduced as the child intended to be adopted by Abe Carver (James Reynolds) and Lexie Carver (Renée Jones). However, Lexie's father Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo) switches the infant at birth with Bo and Hope's (Peter Reckell and Kristian Alfonso) son. After years of trying for a baby the natural way, Abe and Lexie Carver decide that they will adopt a child. When Lexie's father Stefano DiMera hears about the news, he is over joyed at the prospect of finally becoming a grandfather and asks that Abe and Lexie adopt the child of one of his distant relatives. The birth mother Marlo is in fact the niece of Dr. Rolf, Stefano's longtime assistant. However none the wiser to Lexie and Abe, Stefano is planning a plot whereby Marlo's baby would be switched with the baby of Bo and Hope's who Stefano at the time thought might be his or John Black's. After the births of the babies, Stefano has Dr. Rolf switch Hope's and Marlo's babies birth tags. So, the baby is instead taken home by Bo and Hope Brady and named John Thomas, getting his names from family friend John Black (Drake Hogestyn) and Hope's late grandfather Tom Horton (MacDonald Carey).

Zack Brady was the second son and child of supercouple Hope and Bo Brady, born June 9, 2000. For the longest time, Zack is known as Isaac Theo Carver, the long-awaited and much-beloved son of Abe and Lexie Carver. For years the two had tried unsuccessfully to have a child of their own with no success, until Lexie's father, Stefano, got them in touch with Marlo, a young pregnant woman. Abe and Lexie adopt the baby that Marlo has given birth to, unaware that Stefano had switched Marlo and Hope's sons.
Zack dies on January 1, 2006, after being run over by Bo's SUV, which is driven by his daughter, Chelsea. Upon his death, his liver is donated to his niece, Claire Brady, and his corneas are donated to Abe Carver; Claire's life is saved and Abe regains his eyesight. Zack's death and the revelation of Chelsea as the SUV driver drive a wedge between Bo and Hope – as well as the rest of the Brady family for most of 2006.
In June 2016, he returns as an aged ghost (Scott Shilstone) to help his mother Hope.[1][2]

Bonnie Lockhart[edit]
Bonnie Lockhart (originally named Maureen) is the mother of Mimi Lockhart, Patrick Lockhart, and Connor Lockhart. She has been portrayed by actresses Robin Riker (July 11, 2000 to July 31, 2000), Kathy Connell (August 15, 2000 to June 7, 2002) and, most notably, Judi Evans (September 1, 2003 to March 1, 2007),[3] who also portrays Adrienne Kiriakis. Bonnie is known for making Mimi's life miserable. When Rex wanted to ask her for permission to marry Mimi, she said no, because Rex isn't rich. When Bonnie finds out Mimi is pregnant and wants to tell Rex, Bonnie convinces her to get an abortion; an unwilling Mimi gets one and doesn't tell Rex about it. Bonnie marries Mickey Horton, after his wife is murdered by a serial killer in 2003. After Maggie shows up alive, Mickey divorces her. Bonnie is also the owner of Alice's. It is revealed later that she killed her abusive husband and hid his body; she is eventually sent to prison.
Angela Moroni[edit]
Angela Moroni was portrayed by Ayda Field from late summer of 2000 until March 2001. Angela Moroni is the daughter of Vincent Moroni, an Italian mob boss. She was introduced during Brandon and Sami's quest to get the tape back with Kate forcing Roberto to confess to the murder of Franco Kelly. Angela came into possession of the tape, but she would only give it to Brandon if he married her. When Brandon and Sami went back to Salem, she came with them and kept the tape with her. When they returned to Europe, Brandon and Angela got married. When a spy from her father saw Brandon and Sami kiss, he hired two gunmen to kill Sami and Brandon at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg. This backfired however, when Angela dove in front of Brandon. Before her death, Angela finally made her father give Brandon and Sami the tape.
Vincent Moroni[edit]
Vincent Moroni was portrayed by Carl Weintraub from summer 2000 until March 2001. Vincent Moroni was an Italian mob boss with one daughter, Angela. Upon meeting Brandon and Sami, he was immediately suspicious of them. After Kate told Vincent about the tape (containing Kate telling Roberto to confess to the murder of Franco Kelly) he took it from Angela. When Brandon married Angela anyway, Vincent was convinced he loved his daughter. Kate later slept with Vincent to convince him to kill Victor and manipulated him into spying on Sami and Brandon. When his spy told him about the kiss he ordered Victor, Brandon and Sami to be murdered at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg. Chaos erupted then and Angela threw herself in front of Brandon, saving his life. Vincent was so upset at the events that he set in motion, that he committed suicide.

Other names
Marlena Evans


Hattie Adams is a woman who bore a resemblance to Marlena Evans. Under the guidance of Wilhelm Rolf, she had plastic surgery to increase this resemblance. Stefano DiMera planned to use Hattie against Marlena, but never implemented such a plan. Hattie eventually had further surgery (off-screen) to look identical to Marlena and reappeared briefly in 2004; she was suspected of being a serial killer after Marlena was supposedly witnessed committing the crimes, but it was determined that Marlena had performed the acts under hypnosis and Hattie was not involved. In 2016, an incarcerated Hope Williams Brady encounters Hattie in prison and they become allies; upset that Stefano had interfered in her life, Hattie is pleased that Hope had murdered him. Hattie explains that she had become a secretary in Chicago, but then a man she was dating stole money from her company and framed her for the theft. Hope agrees to help Hattie clear her name, and in exchange Hattie protects Hope from the prison's dominant clique.
Hattie was originally played by Andrea Hall, the real-life identical twin sister of Marlena's portrayer, Deidre Hall. From 2004 onward, after the character's final surgery and Hall-Gengler's retirement from acting, Hattie was played by Deidre Hall. In November 2016, it was confirmed that Deidre Hall would reprise her portrayal of Hattie.[4]

Harold Wentworth[edit]
Harold Wentworth, played by Ryan Scott from 2001 until 2003, was introduced during a storyline in which Jack Deveraux pretended to be gay in order to spare Greta von Amberg's feelings, as he didn't return her affection. Greta tried to set Jack up with Harold, an openly gay man. Harold worked with Greta to set up situations where he and Jack could be intimate, but Jack would always find a way to escape. Jack eventually admitted that he was not gay, which led to Harold criticizing him for his cowardice. Harold later happened to be in Las Vegas at the same time as Jack and Greta, and he helped them hide from mob hitmen by disguising themselves as showgirls. To his dismay, Jack then learned that Harold was the son of Oliver Wentworth, the owner of the Spectator. This was the local newspaper, which Jack hoped to run; Jennifer got the job instead, due in part to Harold's recommendation. Harold then worked at the Spectator, and was able to maintain a friendly, professional relationship with Jack. He last appeared during the summer of 2003, shortly before the Salem Stalker storyline started. By 2006, though not shown on-screen, Harold had become editor of the Spectator; Jack and Jennifer learned that he was offering them a job running the London bureau of the paper, which they accepted.
Eugenia Willens[edit]
Eugenia Willens, played by Daphne Bloomer from 2002 to 2006,[5] worked at Salem University Hospital as a lab tech, but she lost her job and her pension after Sami blackmailed her into looking the other way while Sami switched the results of a paternity test. She later conspired with Kate against Sami and also worked as Lucas' personal assistant at Titan. She briefly dated Lucas.

Rex Brady was portrayed by actor Eric Winter. Rex first appeared on July 8, 2002, and left town on July 26, 2005. He is the son of Roman Brady and Kate Roberts and twin brother to Cassie Brady.
Rex and his twin sister Cassie were discovered half-naked during a meteor shower and were originally suspected to be aliens. As time went on it was discovered that they were the children of Tony DiMera and Marlena Evans but this turned out to be false. In reality a sperm sample was somehow taken from Roman Brady during his years of captivity at the hands of Tony's father Stefano DiMera and combined with eggs taken from Kate Roberts who was a prostitute and associate of Stefano's.
Rex and, to a lesser extent, Cassie seemed to have super human intelligence. Rex also suffered mysterious mood swings and psychotic tendencies during Salem Stalker storyline. He dated Mimi Lockhart but they broke up when Rex discovered Mimi aborted his baby without telling him about it. Feeling hurt and betrayed, Rex left town following the abortion and has not appeared on the show since his departure.
Rex is last mentioned on March 10, 2017, when his mother, Kate, gets a bracelet from Eduardo with the initials of her six children on it.

Duck[edit]
Duck is a Vietnam War veteran who lives on the fictional island Tinda Lao with his daughter Gabby.
Gabby[edit]
Gabby, played by Joy Bisco, is a young woman who lives on the fictional island, Tinda Lao. Her father is Duck. When Shawn-Douglas Brady was in Tinda Lao, she fell in love with him, but he stuck to his fiancée, Belle Black.
Morgan Hollingsworth[edit]
Morgan Hollingsworth, portrayed by Kristen Renton, was President of Alpha Chi Theta sorority, where Chelsea and Stephanie pledged. Morgan dated Max Brady and was almost a victim of Ford Decker, the campus rapist. She and the Alpha Chi Theta girls conspired to stop Ford from raping again but their plan backfired and he fell to his death. Soon after Ford's death and the coverup was exposed, Max and Morgan broke up.
Morgan later went to work for Tony as his intern at the same time Stephanie interned for Anna's rival firm. Morgan's interests moved to Philip Kiriakis soon after her father, Paul, disappeared. John Black and Phillip were involved in a heated shipping rivalry that turned ugly when gun fire broke out. Phillip took a bullet intended for Morgan after one of Ava's goons tried to shoot her. Morgan helped Phillip with his recovery and they shared a short romance. After Paul was revealed to be alive, Phillip admitted to threatening Paul's life and was later caught kissing Chloe. Morgan left town to take a two-year internship in Chicago.
Alex North[edit]
Dr. Alex North was portrayed by Wayne Northrop from August 1, 2005, to May 24, 2006. Alex North was brought to Salem by John Black to help John's wife Marlena recover from amnesia. Marlena had memories of Alex and, after discovering they had been married (North had been presumed dead after being captured on a mission in Vietnam), she chose him instead of John because Alex was controlling her mind. It was soon discovered that he had been an abusive husband and, after a fight with John, he was presumed dead after falling over the edge of a cliff. The Alex North storyline was very unpopular with viewers.
Trent Robbins[edit]
Trent Robbins (played by Roscoe Born) was the biological father of Max Brady and the adoptive father of Melanie Layton. He abused Max as a child, causing Max to become socially isolated and mute for several years. Trent returned in 2008 as the Dean of the Physics department at Salem University. It was revealed that he was still married to Nicole Walker. He re-entered Max's life by awarding Nick Fallon a grant for his "work" on a fuel cell. Unbeknownst to Trent, Max was responsible for the majority of Nick's design. Max became short-tempered upon seeing Trent and confronted him. After Max insisted that Trent take responsibility for his abusive actions, Trent offered to pay him off in order to keep his past a secret.
Trent was murdered via a stab in the back. Among the suspects were Caroline Brady, Trent's children Max and Melanie, and his wife Nicole. It was revealed that Nick was responsible for the murder. Nick maintained that he killed Trent in Melanie's defense, and that his addiction to alcohol and painkillers played a role in his bad decision.

A little after Thanksgiving, Claire becomes sick for an unknown reason.

In a horrible twist of fate, Claire's biological uncle, Zack who was only 5 at the time, dies in a hit-and-run car accident.

Weeks later, EJ Wells paid her to break into the Brady home and she accidentally set fire to the place.

Glen Reiber is the biological father of J.T. Brady, who was switched at birth with Zack Brady, resulting in a complicated custody battle.
While watching TV in Chicago, Glen Reiber saw a sketch of a girl whose body had been found frozen in the ice, in the canal behind Bo and Hope Brady's house after their wedding New Year's Eve. He recognized it as Marlo, his former girlfriend, who had left town suddenly while pregnant. The couple went to Salem, identified the sketch, and Glen inquired about the baby Marlo carried.
Though given the runaround by the Carvers, he and Barb found that Marlo gave birth to a boy, in June 2000, and the Carvers had adopted him. Jennifer Deveraux had a car accident resulting in baby J.T. Brady falling into the river, while strapped in Isaac Carver's baby seat (his name was on it). Barb spotted the baby floating, like Moses in the rushes, and they rescued him. Thinking that he is Isaac, the Reibers fled to his aunt's cabin in the hills. Auntie discovered the surgery scar, and when the baby began to have breathing difficulties, Glen and Barb rushed him to the local hospital, but then returned to Salem. They already had a DNA test to prove Glen was the father of Marlo's child.
Although facing kidnapping charges, Bo and Hope only wanted J.T. back safe, and promised not to press charges. The Reibers returned J.T., and went back to Chicago, where the DNA results arrived. Barb read them secretly, realizing Glen was the father of J.T., and not Isaac's father, and went back to Salem to blackmail Lexie Carver. She succeeded in getting several thousand dollars, and then told Glen that she was pregnant with their child, hoping he will not try to search for the truth. Eventually they both returned to Salem and crashed Lexie's party. When Lexie didn't come up with the million dollars, Barb blew the whistle. Glen sought out a slick attorney, Cameron Reese, to sue for custody of J.T. In the ensuing DNA test, it was proven that Glen was J.T.'s father.
After Glen and Barb won custody of J.T., they left Salem, choosing to keep the boy's name the same. They returned to Chicago, where they prepared for the birth of their next child.

Tyler Kiriakis is the son of Philip Kiriakis and Mimi Lockhart. In July 2006, Philip Kiriakis and then-wife Belle Black were planning to have a second child, as were their friends/nephew Shawn-Douglas Brady and his then wife Mimi Lockhart were also plan to have a baby. Both couples planned to use artificial insemination. A gloved hand switched the samples so Belle ended up pregnant with Shawn's baby and Shawn and Mimi's surrogate ended up pregnant with Philip and Mimi's child. It wasn't long until both couples learned the truth that there was a switch in the petri dishes. Philip and Mimi wanted to have both babies aborted but Belle chose not to have her child aborted. Unfortunately, she later had complications and her child was lost. After Shawn and Mimi separated, Mimi signed away their rights to the child and left its fate up to the surrogate mother Lauren Chaffee. Bonnie Lockhart was paying Lauren with the intent to mother the child but Bonnie was sent to jail and Lauren was left to give birth on her own.
Philip and his sister Billie have traced Lauren's steps and now believe that "Pocket" or Ty Johnson, the baby boy being fostered by Kayla Brady and Steve Johnson, is actually Tyler.

Ciara Brady is the daughter of Bo Brady and Hope Brady.
Vivian Jovanni assumed the role of Ciara on October 30, 2015.[8] In December 2016, Jovanni left the show.[9]
While grieving over the death of their young son, Zack, Hope and Bo Brady found comfort in one another, and Ciara is conceived, although it takes several months for Hope to learn she is pregnant. When she eventually learns that she is pregnant, a classic "Who's the daddy?" storyline begins. Hope had been to Morgan Island with Patrick Lockhart where, in a moment of weakness, she had found comfort in his arms.
Tests were run and it was "determined" that Hope's unborn child was Patrick's. Unbeknownst to Hope and Bo, Patrick had paid the doctor to fix the test. Despite believing Patrick to be the father of her unborn child, Bo and Hope get back together, pushing Patrick to the point he decides he needs to kidnap Hope. Ciara was originally born on December 29, 2006 but her birthday was changed to July 16, 2004 then again to March 18, 1998. Ciara was born in a warehouse, delivered by Bo. Patrick reveals her true paternity before being arrested.
Ciara's name was selected by fans in an online poll. Out of the five original choices, narrowed down to three, Ciara Alice Brady was the winner.[10]
Ciara lives with Hope and Bo the first couple of years of her life before living with Hope, Doug and Julie after her mother and father separate for a short while. Ciara's parents have since reunited and separated again.
She has two older brothers, Shawn-Douglas and Zack Brady (deceased) and one older paternal half-sister, Chelsea Brady.

Allie Horton is the daughter of Sami Brady and Lucas Horton. She and her twin, Johnny DiMera, are born October 23, 2007, at her grandmother Marlena's house, where they are delivered by Marlena. Allie goes for several weeks without a name until the Thanksgiving Day wedding of Shawn and Belle, where Lucas announces her name as Alice Caroline Horton, and "Allie" for short. Sami is shocked because she and Lucas haven't yet reached a decision on their baby girl's name, but happily Sami loves the name. Allie is named after her great-grandmothers, Alice Horton and Caroline Brady. Her twin, Johnny DiMera, is her maternal half-brother. Allie has a big brother in Will Horton, and in 2009, she becomes big sister to her new maternal half-sister, Sydney DiMera.
In February 2011, Allie goes to live in Hong Kong with her father Lucas for a while, after the man who is masquerading as her step-father Rafe Hernandez is mean to her several times. She returns after it is revealed that the man is an imposter. Sami and the real Rafe try to help Allie understand what has happened.
In May 2013, Allie becomes an aunt to Arianna Grace Horton (Will's daughter with Gabi Hernandez), and in April 2014 when Will gets married, Allie gains a brother-in-law in Sonny Kiriakis.
In May 2014, Allie is walking into the Horton Town Square with Jordan Ridgeway when she sees her favorite cousin Nick Fallon, who has been shot multiple times and is bleeding from the chest, stumble into the square and collapse. Allie screams and is the first person to notice him. Afterwards, she cannot stop looking at him despite her parents' attempts to get her to look away; and when Nick dies shortly after, she is traumatized by his death.
In October 2014, Allie moves with Sami, Johnny and Sydney, to live in California.

He is originally believed, like Allie, to be the son of Lucas Horton, but after the birth, EJ begins to suspect that the twins might have different fathers because Johnny does not look like his sister, and EJ thinks Johnny looks like himself. A second DNA test confirms EJ to be Johnny's father.
After witnessing a murder, Johnny's mom Sami is taken into protection by the federal government as a vulnerable witness. Whilst in witness protection, Sami allows Johnny to live with EJ and his wife Nicole Walker, in the DiMera mansion, with Johnny's paternal grandfather, Stefano DiMera. When Sami is released from witness protection, Johnny returns to live with Sami. However, Stefano insists that EJ raises Johnny as a DiMera, against Sami's wishes. EJ first resists this notion because he does not want to betray his ex-wife; but when he hears that Sami's youngest daughter, whom Sami says she adopted, is his daughter and that Sami gave birth to her whilst in witness protection and hid this from him, EJ is furious with Sami, and he agrees to raise Johnny as a DiMera against his ex-wife's wishes. After much heartache and drama, including Johnny suffering from eye-cancer (from which he eventually makes a full recovery), EJ and Sami become co-operative co-parents, and eventually marry again; but then Johnny's dad EJ is shot dead in a conflict with the villainous Clyde Weston.
After losing his dad, Johnny goes with his mom and sisters to live in Los Angeles.

Crawford Decker[edit]
Crawford Decker was Ford Decker's father. He used his influence with the president of Salem University to protect Ford from being punished for raping several female students. Crawford also urged the police to aggressively pursue Ford's subsequent disappearance.
Ford Decker[edit]
Ford Decker was a student at Salem University who was a serial date rapist. When his father Crawford, used his influence to protect Ford from being punished for drugging and raping numerous female students, the sisters of Alpha Chi Theta decided to take action. The women, who included three of Ford's victims or attempted victims, drugged him. When the partially incapacitated Ford then pursued Chelsea, whom he had also drugged, up the stairs of the sorority house, he lost consciousness and suffered a fatal fall down the stairs. The sisters buried his body in the basement. Subsequently, Chelsea Brady and Stephanie Johnson dug him back up and hid him in a water heater, which Max Brady removed from the premises.
Richard Baker[edit]
Richard Baker, played by John Callahan (2008–2009; 2010),[11] is a doctor Nicole blackmails into posing as her OB/GYN while she fakes pregnancy after miscarrying her baby. Though he claims to have altruistic motives in the running of his free clinic, he's involved in shady black market baby brokering in order to pay off his substantial debts, a fact Nicole uses to her advantage. He frequently goes to Nicole for money in exchange for keeping her secret until he is murdered by men Stefano DiMera hires. Stefano also attempts to frame Rafe Hernandez for the murder. In his last frugal efforts to tell Sami and Mia about the baby switch, he writes each of them a letter, both of which are destroyed by Nicole. However, it is discovered that he faked his death and later returns to Salem. He helps Hope, who under the influence of sleeping pills, mugs the men of Salem. He was caught and send to prison for helping Nicole switch babies and stealing money.

Daniel Jonas first appeared on March 4, 2008, being portrayed by actor, Shawn Christian. Christian initially signed a one-year contract, but he has since signed on for an extended stay.[12] Following a fatal car crash caused by Eric Brady's drunk-driving, the character was written into a coma on January 4, 2016. On January 6, 2016, the character was killed off after being taken off life support when his heart was donated to Brady Black. Christian reprised the role thereafter during a dream sequence with Nicole Walker on February 12, 2016, during another dream sequence months later with Chloe Lane on November 3, 2016, and yet another dream sequence with Nicole Walker on December 12, 2016 - declaring his love for her as well as his encouragement for her to move on with her life. Christian made more reprisals in 2017, once on January 27, 2017, once in May 2017, and a final appearance as an apparition to Eric Brady and Nicole Walker on June 28, 2017.
Before arriving in Salem, Dr. Jonas worked at various hospitals around the world. Many years ago, he had an affair with Carly Manning, who later introduced him to Rebecca, a cancer patient with whom Daniel fell in love. Although Rebecca's prognosis was grim, Daniel married her anyway and was determined to save her. Rebecca's cancer proved to be too advanced and she died in Daniel's arms. Upon his arrival in Salem, Daniel has romances with Chelsea Brady and her grandmother Kate Roberts. In early 2010, Carly tells Daniel that Melanie Layton is their daughter. Daniel and Melanie bond quickly, and eventually forgive Carly for keeping them apart. After a drunken one night stand with Melanie's husband, Philip Kiriakis, Daniel's fiancée Chloe Lane becomes pregnant, and is unsure if Daniel or Philip is the father. She is relieved when a paternity test shows Daniel as the child's father. Daniel and Chloe name their son Parker, after Daniel's mother. At Parker's christening, Caroline Brady reveals that she switched the paternity test to keep Melanie from leaving Philip for her granddaughter Stephanie Johnson's boyfriend Nathan Horton. Daniel ends his marriage to Chloe.
Daniel soon finds happiness with Jennifer Horton, but their happiness is short-lived as Jennifer's ex, Jack Deveraux returns to town. Eventually Jennifer reunites with Jack and Daniel finds comfort with a pregnant Nicole Walker. He also learns that Maggie Horton is his biological mother. Daniel helps Nicole fix her child's paternity test, claiming the baby is Rafe Hernandez's, even though it is EJ DiMera's. As Nicole grows attached to Daniel, Jack dies and Daniel and Jennifer reunite. Nicole loses her baby, but keeps it a secret, wanting to hold onto Daniel. When Nicole falls down the stairs after a fight with Jennifer, and gives birth to a stillborn son, she blames Jennifer. Eventually the truth comes out and Daniel and Jennifer once again reunite. EJ confronts Daniel for keeping his son away from him saying he will not retaliate because of Daniel's previous help with his other son Johnny but warns Daniel not to cross him again.
On January 7, 2013, Chloe returns to Salem with the news that Daniel is really Parker's father.
On December 31, 2015, Daniel and Brady Black are driving in car returning to the Basic Black launch of product line because Brady forgot a gift for Theresa, during this time Eric Brady decides to drive himself while being intoxicated causes a car crash which injures several major Salem Residents including, Dr. Daniel Jonas, Brady Black, Eric Brady, and Jennifer Horton.
On January 4, 2016, Daniel was pronounced dead to the injuries from the accident, as an organ donor, Kayla asks Maggie to allow for Daniel to donate his heart to either Eric or Brady. On January 6, 2016, Daniel is taken off life-support with Maggie's consent and his heart is donated to Brady Black.

Mia McCormick[edit]
Mia McCormick (played by Taylor Spreitler from January 6, 2009 – June 23, 2010), is a high school drop-out, who was introduced as a pregnant teenager. Nicole Walker bought her baby, Grace, for $10K to replace her own, secretly miscarried, baby. She then secretly swaps Grace for Sami Brady's baby, Sydney, who was born at the same time (January 28, 2009). Grace eventually dies of bacterial meningitis. Mia uses the money to fund a dancing career in Japan but when this fails she returns to Salem, determined to get her baby back. She then befriends Will Horton, moves in with Maggie Horton and takes a job at Java Cafe. Her ex-boyfriend Chad DiMera, father of Grace, also has a job at Java Cafe. After overhearing information and investigating, he discovers what had happened to his daughter, although neither Chad nor Mia initially knew about Sydney and Grace being switched. Mia eventually finds out that Grace was her biological daughter, and she and Chad mourn her. Meanwhile, Mia is attracted to, and dates, Will but is forced to break up by Chad in her efforts to keep her deal with Nicole secret. Chad, however, breaks his promise to stop looking for Grace. Will eventually learns all of this; he is surprised but thinks it all makes sense that Nicole can give the baby a better home.

Grace Brady is the biological daughter of a young teenage mother, Mia McCormick and her ex-boyfriend Chad DiMera, then Peterson-Woods, born on-screen on January 27, 2009, but she was believed to be the biological daughter of E.J. DiMera and Sami Brady. It wasn't until November 12, 2009 when Rafe Hernandez revealed the truth that Sami Brady knew she wasn't Grace's birth mother.
Sami Brady and Nicole Walker were both pregnant with E.J. DiMera's babies. Nicole miscarried but pretended to still be pregnant. She planned to adopt Mia McCormick's baby and pass it off as hers with E.J. When Mia and Sami gave birth to girls on the same day, in the same medical clinic, almost at the same time, Nicole switched Sami's baby with Mia's baby (Nicole helped deliver Mia's baby), so that she and E.J. would raise a child that was biologically his.
Sami, who was forced to enter the witness protection program during her pregnancy, decided to protect her child from the DiMeras by never telling E.J. about their baby. As a result, she left Grace at a convent orphanage. On March 30, 2009, Sami brought Grace home to Salem telling everybody she was her "adopted" daughter. The same day she made Rafe, her former bodyguard turned boyfriend, Grace's godfather. The baby was christened Grace Rafaela; Grace in honor of the convent and what Sami perceived as God's intervention in helping her to have and keep her baby, and Rafaela in honor of Rafe.
Grace died on June 9, 2009 from bacterial meningitis. Grace's parents, Sami Brady and Rafe Hernandez, were at her bedside when she died. She had also been held on that day by her biological mother, Mia. On June 11, 2009 Sami revealed to E.J. that he was "Grace's biological father," still unaware that the baby she had raised was not genetically theirs.

Sydney DiMera is the daughter of EJ DiMera and Sami Brady. Sydney is born in secret on January 28, 2009,[13] while her mother is in witness protection, and she is switched shortly after birth with the daughter of a teenage mother, Mia, who has agreed to give her baby up for adoption to Nicole Walker. Nicole, who has miscarried her fiancé E.J.'s daughter, has arranged in secret to adopt Mia's baby and pass the child off as E.J.'s, fearful that she would lose EJ without a baby.
When Nicole learns that Sami had just recently given birth to her and E.J.'s daughter the same day Mia gave birth to hers, Nicole switches the babies, preferring to have E.J.'s biological daughter over an unrelated child. Nicole instantly bonds with Sydney, and vows to always protect her no matter what happens. Sami and E.J. are none the wiser to Nicole's treachery, and Sami and Rafe bond with "Sami's" daughter, while EJ and Nicole bond with "their" daughter.
E.J. eventually learns that Nicole had a miscarriage and he kicks Nicole and Sydney out of the mansion, not knowing the truth about Sydney. Eventually, Sami also learns that Sydney is her biological daughter. Soon after, E.J. learns that Sydney is his biological child with Sami. However, the family reunion turns into a nightmare when Brady Black bails Nicole out of jail and she kidnaps Sydney. Nicole has a change of heart and decides to tell E.J. and Sami where Sydney is, but she is knocked out by Anna DiMera, who takes Sydney. It is later revealed that Anna was hired by E.J. to kidnap Sydney.
Sydney becomes the subject of many custody battles between E.J. and Sami over the next few years, with Nicole involved, as well, during the time she is married to E.J. They later come to an agreement, though, and Sydney is able to stay with her entire family, including her siblings, Johnny, Allie Horton, and Will Horton. Sydney became an aunt when Gabi Hernandez gave birth to Will's daughter, Arianna Horton.

J.T. Brady, born on June 9, 2000, is introduced as the child intended to be adopted by Abe Carver (James Reynolds) and Lexie Carver (Renée Jones). However, Lexie's father Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo) switches the infant at birth with Bo and Hope's (Peter Reckell and Kristian Alfonso) son. After years of trying for a baby the natural way, Abe and Lexie Carver decide that they will adopt a child. When Lexie's father Stefano DiMera hears about the news, he is over joyed at the prospect of finally becoming a grandfather and asks that Abe and Lexie adopt the child of one of his distant relatives. The birth mother Marlo is in fact the niece of Dr. Rolf, Stefano's longtime assistant. However none the wiser to Lexie and Abe, Stefano is planning a plot whereby Marlo's baby would be switched with the baby of Bo and Hope's who Stefano at the time thought might be his or John Black's. After the births of the babies, Stefano has Dr. Rolf switch Hope's and Marlo's babies birth tags. So, the baby is instead taken home by Bo and Hope Brady and named John Thomas, getting his names from family friend John Black (Drake Hogestyn) and Hope's late grandfather Tom Horton (MacDonald Carey).

Zack Brady was the second son and child of supercouple Hope and Bo Brady, born June 9, 2000. For the longest time, Zack is known as Isaac Theo Carver, the long-awaited and much-beloved son of Abe and Lexie Carver. For years the two had tried unsuccessfully to have a child of their own with no success, until Lexie's father, Stefano, got them in touch with Marlo, a young pregnant woman. Abe and Lexie adopt the baby that Marlo has given birth to, unaware that Stefano had switched Marlo and Hope's sons.
Zack dies on January 1, 2006, after being run over by Bo's SUV, which is driven by his daughter, Chelsea. Upon his death, his liver is donated to his niece, Claire Brady, and his corneas are donated to Abe Carver; Claire's life is saved and Abe regains his eyesight. Zack's death and the revelation of Chelsea as the SUV driver drive a wedge between Bo and Hope – as well as the rest of the Brady family for most of 2006.
In June 2016, he returns as an aged ghost (Scott Shilstone) to help his mother Hope.[1][2]

Bonnie Lockhart[edit]
Bonnie Lockhart (originally named Maureen) is the mother of Mimi Lockhart, Patrick Lockhart, and Connor Lockhart. She has been portrayed by actresses Robin Riker (July 11, 2000 to July 31, 2000), Kathy Connell (August 15, 2000 to June 7, 2002) and, most notably, Judi Evans (September 1, 2003 to March 1, 2007),[3] who also portrays Adrienne Kiriakis. Bonnie is known for making Mimi's life miserable. When Rex wanted to ask her for permission to marry Mimi, she said no, because Rex isn't rich. When Bonnie finds out Mimi is pregnant and wants to tell Rex, Bonnie convinces her to get an abortion; an unwilling Mimi gets one and doesn't tell Rex about it. Bonnie marries Mickey Horton, after his wife is murdered by a serial killer in 2003. After Maggie shows up alive, Mickey divorces her. Bonnie is also the owner of Alice's. It is revealed later that she killed her abusive husband and hid his body; she is eventually sent to prison.
Angela Moroni[edit]
Angela Moroni was portrayed by Ayda Field from late summer of 2000 until March 2001. Angela Moroni is the daughter of Vincent Moroni, an Italian mob boss. She was introduced during Brandon and Sami's quest to get the tape back with Kate forcing Roberto to confess to the murder of Franco Kelly. Angela came into possession of the tape, but she would only give it to Brandon if he married her. When Brandon and Sami went back to Salem, she came with them and kept the tape with her. When they returned to Europe, Brandon and Angela got married. When a spy from her father saw Brandon and Sami kiss, he hired two gunmen to kill Sami and Brandon at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg. This backfired however, when Angela dove in front of Brandon. Before her death, Angela finally made her father give Brandon and Sami the tape.
Vincent Moroni[edit]
Vincent Moroni was portrayed by Carl Weintraub from summer 2000 until March 2001. Vincent Moroni was an Italian mob boss with one daughter, Angela. Upon meeting Brandon and Sami, he was immediately suspicious of them. After Kate told Vincent about the tape (containing Kate telling Roberto to confess to the murder of Franco Kelly) he took it from Angela. When Brandon married Angela anyway, Vincent was convinced he loved his daughter. Kate later slept with Vincent to convince him to kill Victor and manipulated him into spying on Sami and Brandon. When his spy told him about the kiss he ordered Victor, Brandon and Sami to be murdered at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg. Chaos erupted then and Angela threw herself in front of Brandon, saving his life. Vincent was so upset at the events that he set in motion, that he committed suicide.

Other names
Marlena Evans


Hattie Adams is a woman who bore a resemblance to Marlena Evans. Under the guidance of Wilhelm Rolf, she had plastic surgery to increase this resemblance. Stefano DiMera planned to use Hattie against Marlena, but never implemented such a plan. Hattie eventually had further surgery (off-screen) to look identical to Marlena and reappeared briefly in 2004; she was suspected of being a serial killer after Marlena was supposedly witnessed committing the crimes, but it was determined that Marlena had performed the acts under hypnosis and Hattie was not involved. In 2016, an incarcerated Hope Williams Brady encounters Hattie in prison and they become allies; upset that Stefano had interfered in her life, Hattie is pleased that Hope had murdered him. Hattie explains that she had become a secretary in Chicago, but then a man she was dating stole money from her company and framed her for the theft. Hope agrees to help Hattie clear her name, and in exchange Hattie protects Hope from the prison's dominant clique.
Hattie was originally played by Andrea Hall, the real-life identical twin sister of Marlena's portrayer, Deidre Hall. From 2004 onward, after the character's final surgery and Hall-Gengler's retirement from acting, Hattie was played by Deidre Hall. In November 2016, it was confirmed that Deidre Hall would reprise her portrayal of Hattie.[4]

Harold Wentworth[edit]
Harold Wentworth, played by Ryan Scott from 2001 until 2003, was introduced during a storyline in which Jack Deveraux pretended to be gay in order to spare Greta von Amberg's feelings, as he didn't return her affection. Greta tried to set Jack up with Harold, an openly gay man. Harold worked with Greta to set up situations where he and Jack could be intimate, but Jack would always find a way to escape. Jack eventually admitted that he was not gay, which led to Harold criticizing him for his cowardice. Harold later happened to be in Las Vegas at the same time as Jack and Greta, and he helped them hide from mob hitmen by disguising themselves as showgirls. To his dismay, Jack then learned that Harold was the son of Oliver Wentworth, the owner of the Spectator. This was the local newspaper, which Jack hoped to run; Jennifer got the job instead, due in part to Harold's recommendation. Harold then worked at the Spectator, and was able to maintain a friendly, professional relationship with Jack. He last appeared during the summer of 2003, shortly before the Salem Stalker storyline started. By 2006, though not shown on-screen, Harold had become editor of the Spectator; Jack and Jennifer learned that he was offering them a job running the London bureau of the paper, which they accepted.
Eugenia Willens[edit]
Eugenia Willens, played by Daphne Bloomer from 2002 to 2006,[5] worked at Salem University Hospital as a lab tech, but she lost her job and her pension after Sami blackmailed her into looking the other way while Sami switched the results of a paternity test. She later conspired with Kate against Sami and also worked as Lucas' personal assistant at Titan. She briefly dated Lucas.

Rex Brady was portrayed by actor Eric Winter. Rex first appeared on July 8, 2002, and left town on July 26, 2005. He is the son of Roman Brady and Kate Roberts and twin brother to Cassie Brady.
Rex and his twin sister Cassie were discovered half-naked during a meteor shower and were originally suspected to be aliens. As time went on it was discovered that they were the children of Tony DiMera and Marlena Evans but this turned out to be false. In reality a sperm sample was somehow taken from Roman Brady during his years of captivity at the hands of Tony's father Stefano DiMera and combined with eggs taken from Kate Roberts who was a prostitute and associate of Stefano's.
Rex and, to a lesser extent, Cassie seemed to have super human intelligence. Rex also suffered mysterious mood swings and psychotic tendencies during Salem Stalker storyline. He dated Mimi Lockhart but they broke up when Rex discovered Mimi aborted his baby without telling him about it. Feeling hurt and betrayed, Rex left town following the abortion and has not appeared on the show since his departure.
Rex is last mentioned on March 10, 2017, when his mother, Kate, gets a bracelet from Eduardo with the initials of her six children on it.

Duck[edit]
Duck is a Vietnam War veteran who lives on the fictional island Tinda Lao with his daughter Gabby.
Gabby[edit]
Gabby, played by Joy Bisco, is a young woman who lives on the fictional island, Tinda Lao. Her father is Duck. When Shawn-Douglas Brady was in Tinda Lao, she fell in love with him, but he stuck to his fiancée, Belle Black.
Morgan Hollingsworth[edit]
Morgan Hollingsworth, portrayed by Kristen Renton, was President of Alpha Chi Theta sorority, where Chelsea and Stephanie pledged. Morgan dated Max Brady and was almost a victim of Ford Decker, the campus rapist. She and the Alpha Chi Theta girls conspired to stop Ford from raping again but their plan backfired and he fell to his death. Soon after Ford's death and the coverup was exposed, Max and Morgan broke up.
Morgan later went to work for Tony as his intern at the same time Stephanie interned for Anna's rival firm. Morgan's interests moved to Philip Kiriakis soon after her father, Paul, disappeared. John Black and Phillip were involved in a heated shipping rivalry that turned ugly when gun fire broke out. Phillip took a bullet intended for Morgan after one of Ava's goons tried to shoot her. Morgan helped Phillip with his recovery and they shared a short romance. After Paul was revealed to be alive, Phillip admitted to threatening Paul's life and was later caught kissing Chloe. Morgan left town to take a two-year internship in Chicago.
Alex North[edit]
Dr. Alex North was portrayed by Wayne Northrop from August 1, 2005, to May 24, 2006. Alex North was brought to Salem by John Black to help John's wife Marlena recover from amnesia. Marlena had memories of Alex and, after discovering they had been married (North had been presumed dead after being captured on a mission in Vietnam), she chose him instead of John because Alex was controlling her mind. It was soon discovered that he had been an abusive husband and, after a fight with John, he was presumed dead after falling over the edge of a cliff. The Alex North storyline was very unpopular with viewers.
Trent Robbins[edit]
Trent Robbins (played by Roscoe Born) was the biological father of Max Brady and the adoptive father of Melanie Layton. He abused Max as a child, causing Max to become socially isolated and mute for several years. Trent returned in 2008 as the Dean of the Physics department at Salem University. It was revealed that he was still married to Nicole Walker. He re-entered Max's life by awarding Nick Fallon a grant for his "work" on a fuel cell. Unbeknownst to Trent, Max was responsible for the majority of Nick's design. Max became short-tempered upon seeing Trent and confronted him. After Max insisted that Trent take responsibility for his abusive actions, Trent offered to pay him off in order to keep his past a secret.
Trent was murdered via a stab in the back. Among the suspects were Caroline Brady, Trent's children Max and Melanie, and his wife Nicole. It was revealed that Nick was responsible for the murder. Nick maintained that he killed Trent in Melanie's defense, and that his addiction to alcohol and painkillers played a role in his bad decision.

A little after Thanksgiving, Claire becomes sick for an unknown reason.

In a horrible twist of fate, Claire's biological uncle, Zack who was only 5 at the time, dies in a hit-and-run car accident.

Shawn got Willow a job at Chez Rouge and started dating her after he broke up with his ex-wife Mimi Lockhart.

Weeks later, EJ Wells paid her to break into the Brady home and she accidentally set fire to the place.

Glen Reiber is the biological father of J.T. Brady, who was switched at birth with Zack Brady, resulting in a complicated custody battle.
While watching TV in Chicago, Glen Reiber saw a sketch of a girl whose body had been found frozen in the ice, in the canal behind Bo and Hope Brady's house after their wedding New Year's Eve. He recognized it as Marlo, his former girlfriend, who had left town suddenly while pregnant. The couple went to Salem, identified the sketch, and Glen inquired about the baby Marlo carried.
Though given the runaround by the Carvers, he and Barb found that Marlo gave birth to a boy, in June 2000, and the Carvers had adopted him. Jennifer Deveraux had a car accident resulting in baby J.T. Brady falling into the river, while strapped in Isaac Carver's baby seat (his name was on it). Barb spotted the baby floating, like Moses in the rushes, and they rescued him. Thinking that he is Isaac, the Reibers fled to his aunt's cabin in the hills. Auntie discovered the surgery scar, and when the baby began to have breathing difficulties, Glen and Barb rushed him to the local hospital, but then returned to Salem. They already had a DNA test to prove Glen was the father of Marlo's child.
Although facing kidnapping charges, Bo and Hope only wanted J.T. back safe, and promised not to press charges. The Reibers returned J.T., and went back to Chicago, where the DNA results arrived. Barb read them secretly, realizing Glen was the father of J.T., and not Isaac's father, and went back to Salem to blackmail Lexie Carver. She succeeded in getting several thousand dollars, and then told Glen that she was pregnant with their child, hoping he will not try to search for the truth. Eventually they both returned to Salem and crashed Lexie's party. When Lexie didn't come up with the million dollars, Barb blew the whistle. Glen sought out a slick attorney, Cameron Reese, to sue for custody of J.T. In the ensuing DNA test, it was proven that Glen was J.T.'s father.
After Glen and Barb won custody of J.T., they left Salem, choosing to keep the boy's name the same. They returned to Chicago, where they prepared for the birth of their next child.

Tyler Kiriakis is the son of Philip Kiriakis and Mimi Lockhart. In July 2006, Philip Kiriakis and then-wife Belle Black were planning to have a second child, as were their friends/nephew Shawn-Douglas Brady and his then wife Mimi Lockhart were also plan to have a baby. Both couples planned to use artificial insemination. A gloved hand switched the samples so Belle ended up pregnant with Shawn's baby and Shawn and Mimi's surrogate ended up pregnant with Philip and Mimi's child. It wasn't long until both couples learned the truth that there was a switch in the petri dishes. Philip and Mimi wanted to have both babies aborted but Belle chose not to have her child aborted. Unfortunately, she later had complications and her child was lost. After Shawn and Mimi separated, Mimi signed away their rights to the child and left its fate up to the surrogate mother Lauren Chaffee. Bonnie Lockhart was paying Lauren with the intent to mother the child but Bonnie was sent to jail and Lauren was left to give birth on her own.
Philip and his sister Billie have traced Lauren's steps and now believe that "Pocket" or Ty Johnson, the baby boy being fostered by Kayla Brady and Steve Johnson, is actually Tyler.

Ciara Brady is the daughter of Bo Brady and Hope Brady.
Vivian Jovanni assumed the role of Ciara on October 30, 2015.[8] In December 2016, Jovanni left the show.[9]
While grieving over the death of their young son, Zack, Hope and Bo Brady found comfort in one another, and Ciara is conceived, although it takes several months for Hope to learn she is pregnant. When she eventually learns that she is pregnant, a classic "Who's the daddy?" storyline begins. Hope had been to Morgan Island with Patrick Lockhart where, in a moment of weakness, she had found comfort in his arms.
Tests were run and it was "determined" that Hope's unborn child was Patrick's. Unbeknownst to Hope and Bo, Patrick had paid the doctor to fix the test. Despite believing Patrick to be the father of her unborn child, Bo and Hope get back together, pushing Patrick to the point he decides he needs to kidnap Hope. Ciara was originally born on December 29, 2006 but her birthday was changed to July 16, 2004 then again to March 18, 1998. Ciara was born in a warehouse, delivered by Bo. Patrick reveals her true paternity before being arrested.
Ciara's name was selected by fans in an online poll. Out of the five original choices, narrowed down to three, Ciara Alice Brady was the winner.[10]
Ciara lives with Hope and Bo the first couple of years of her life before living with Hope, Doug and Julie after her mother and father separate for a short while. Ciara's parents have since reunited and separated again.
She has two older brothers, Shawn-Douglas and Zack Brady (deceased) and one older paternal half-sister, Chelsea Brady.

Allie Horton is the daughter of Sami Brady and Lucas Horton. She and her twin, Johnny DiMera, are born October 23, 2007, at her grandmother Marlena's house, where they are delivered by Marlena. Allie goes for several weeks without a name until the Thanksgiving Day wedding of Shawn and Belle, where Lucas announces her name as Alice Caroline Horton, and "Allie" for short. Sami is shocked because she and Lucas haven't yet reached a decision on their baby girl's name, but happily Sami loves the name. Allie is named after her great-grandmothers, Alice Horton and Caroline Brady. Her twin, Johnny DiMera, is her maternal half-brother. Allie has a big brother in Will Horton, and in 2009, she becomes big sister to her new maternal half-sister, Sydney DiMera.
In February 2011, Allie goes to live in Hong Kong with her father Lucas for a while, after the man who is masquerading as her step-father Rafe Hernandez is mean to her several times. She returns after it is revealed that the man is an imposter. Sami and the real Rafe try to help Allie understand what has happened.
In May 2013, Allie becomes an aunt to Arianna Grace Horton (Will's daughter with Gabi Hernandez), and in April 2014 when Will gets married, Allie gains a brother-in-law in Sonny Kiriakis.
In May 2014, Allie is walking into the Horton Town Square with Jordan Ridgeway when she sees her favorite cousin Nick Fallon, who has been shot multiple times and is bleeding from the chest, stumble into the square and collapse. Allie screams and is the first person to notice him. Afterwards, she cannot stop looking at him despite her parents' attempts to get her to look away; and when Nick dies shortly after, she is traumatized by his death.
In October 2014, Allie moves with Sami, Johnny and Sydney, to live in California.

Johnny DiMera is the son of EJ DiMera and Sami Brady, and the maternal half-twin of Allie Horton. Johnny has an older maternal half-brother in Will Horton, and in 2009 he gains a full sister in Sydney DiMera. In 2013, Johnny becomes an uncle to Will's daughter Arianna Horton. With a full name of John Roman DiMera, Johnny is named after his mom's dad and step-dad, Roman Brady and John Black.
Johnny is born with Allie on October 23, 2007. He is originally believed, like Allie, to be the son of Lucas Horton, but after the birth, EJ begins to suspect that the twins might have different fathers because Johnny does not look like his sister, and EJ thinks Johnny looks like himself. A second DNA test confirms EJ to be Johnny's father.
After witnessing a murder, Johnny's mom Sami is taken into protection by the federal government as a vulnerable witness. Whilst in witness protection, Sami allows Johnny to live with EJ and his wife Nicole Walker, in the DiMera mansion, with Johnny's paternal grandfather, Stefano DiMera. When Sami is released from witness protection, Johnny returns to live with Sami. However, Stefano insists that EJ raises Johnny as a DiMera, against Sami's wishes. EJ first resists this notion because he does not want to betray his ex-wife; but when he hears that Sami's youngest daughter, whom Sami says she adopted, is his daughter and that Sami gave birth to her whilst in witness protection and hid this from him, EJ is furious with Sami, and he agrees to raise Johnny as a DiMera against his ex-wife's wishes. After much heartache and drama, including Johnny suffering from eye-cancer (from which he eventually makes a full recovery), EJ and Sami become co-operative co-parents, and eventually marry again; but then Johnny's dad EJ is shot dead in a conflict with the villainous Clyde Weston.
After losing his dad, Johnny goes with his mom and sisters to live in Los Angeles.

Crawford Decker[edit]
Crawford Decker was Ford Decker's father. He used his influence with the president of Salem University to protect Ford from being punished for raping several female students. Crawford also urged the police to aggressively pursue Ford's subsequent disappearance.
Ford Decker[edit]
Ford Decker was a student at Salem University who was a serial date rapist. When his father Crawford, used his influence to protect Ford from being punished for drugging and raping numerous female students, the sisters of Alpha Chi Theta decided to take action. The women, who included three of Ford's victims or attempted victims, drugged him. When the partially incapacitated Ford then pursued Chelsea, whom he had also drugged, up the stairs of the sorority house, he lost consciousness and suffered a fatal fall down the stairs. The sisters buried his body in the basement. Subsequently, Chelsea Brady and Stephanie Johnson dug him back up and hid him in a water heater, which Max Brady removed from the premises.
Richard Baker[edit]
Richard Baker, played by John Callahan (2008–2009; 2010),[11] is a doctor Nicole blackmails into posing as her OB/GYN while she fakes pregnancy after miscarrying her baby. Though he claims to have altruistic motives in the running of his free clinic, he's involved in shady black market baby brokering in order to pay off his substantial debts, a fact Nicole uses to her advantage. He frequently goes to Nicole for money in exchange for keeping her secret until he is murdered by men Stefano DiMera hires. Stefano also attempts to frame Rafe Hernandez for the murder. In his last frugal efforts to tell Sami and Mia about the baby switch, he writes each of them a letter, both of which are destroyed by Nicole. However, it is discovered that he faked his death and later returns to Salem. He helps Hope, who under the influence of sleeping pills, mugs the men of Salem. He was caught and send to prison for helping Nicole switch babies and stealing money.

Daniel Jonas first appeared on March 4, 2008, being portrayed by actor, Shawn Christian. Christian initially signed a one-year contract, but he has since signed on for an extended stay.[12] Following a fatal car crash caused by Eric Brady's drunk-driving, the character was written into a coma on January 4, 2016. On January 6, 2016, the character was killed off after being taken off life support when his heart was donated to Brady Black. Christian reprised the role thereafter during a dream sequence with Nicole Walker on February 12, 2016, during another dream sequence months later with Chloe Lane on November 3, 2016, and yet another dream sequence with Nicole Walker on December 12, 2016 - declaring his love for her as well as his encouragement for her to move on with her life. Christian made more reprisals in 2017, once on January 27, 2017, once in May 2017, and a final appearance as an apparition to Eric Brady and Nicole Walker on June 28, 2017.
Before arriving in Salem, Dr. Jonas worked at various hospitals around the world. Many years ago, he had an affair with Carly Manning, who later introduced him to Rebecca, a cancer patient with whom Daniel fell in love. Although Rebecca's prognosis was grim, Daniel married her anyway and was determined to save her. Rebecca's cancer proved to be too advanced and she died in Daniel's arms. Upon his arrival in Salem, Daniel has romances with Chelsea Brady and her grandmother Kate Roberts. In early 2010, Carly tells Daniel that Melanie Layton is their daughter. Daniel and Melanie bond quickly, and eventually forgive Carly for keeping them apart. After a drunken one night stand with Melanie's husband, Philip Kiriakis, Daniel's fiancée Chloe Lane becomes pregnant, and is unsure if Daniel or Philip is the father. She is relieved when a paternity test shows Daniel as the child's father. Daniel and Chloe name their son Parker, after Daniel's mother. At Parker's christening, Caroline Brady reveals that she switched the paternity test to keep Melanie from leaving Philip for her granddaughter Stephanie Johnson's boyfriend Nathan Horton. Daniel ends his marriage to Chloe.
Daniel soon finds happiness with Jennifer Horton, but their happiness is short-lived as Jennifer's ex, Jack Deveraux returns to town. Eventually Jennifer reunites with Jack and Daniel finds comfort with a pregnant Nicole Walker. He also learns that Maggie Horton is his biological mother. Daniel helps Nicole fix her child's paternity test, claiming the baby is Rafe Hernandez's, even though it is EJ DiMera's. As Nicole grows attached to Daniel, Jack dies and Daniel and Jennifer reunite. Nicole loses her baby, but keeps it a secret, wanting to hold onto Daniel. When Nicole falls down the stairs after a fight with Jennifer, and gives birth to a stillborn son, she blames Jennifer. Eventually the truth comes out and Daniel and Jennifer once again reunite. EJ confronts Daniel for keeping his son away from him saying he will not retaliate because of Daniel's previous help with his other son Johnny but warns Daniel not to cross him again.
On January 7, 2013, Chloe returns to Salem with the news that Daniel is really Parker's father.
On December 31, 2015, Daniel and Brady Black are driving in car returning to the Basic Black launch of product line because Brady forgot a gift for Theresa, during this time Eric Brady decides to drive himself while being intoxicated causes a car crash which injures several major Salem Residents including, Dr. Daniel Jonas, Brady Black, Eric Brady, and Jennifer Horton.
On January 4, 2016, Daniel was pronounced dead to the injuries from the accident, as an organ donor, Kayla asks Maggie to allow for Daniel to donate his heart to either Eric or Brady. On January 6, 2016, Daniel is taken off life-support with Maggie's consent and his heart is donated to Brady Black.

Mia McCormick[edit]
Mia McCormick (played by Taylor Spreitler from January 6, 2009 – June 23, 2010), is a high school drop-out, who was introduced as a pregnant teenager. Nicole Walker bought her baby, Grace, for $10K to replace her own, secretly miscarried, baby. She then secretly swaps Grace for Sami Brady's baby, Sydney, who was born at the same time (January 28, 2009). Grace eventually dies of bacterial meningitis. Mia uses the money to fund a dancing career in Japan but when this fails she returns to Salem, determined to get her baby back. She then befriends Will Horton, moves in with Maggie Horton and takes a job at Java Cafe. Her ex-boyfriend Chad DiMera, father of Grace, also has a job at Java Cafe. After overhearing information and investigating, he discovers what had happened to his daughter, although neither Chad nor Mia initially knew about Sydney and Grace being switched. Mia eventually finds out that Grace was her biological daughter, and she and Chad mourn her. Meanwhile, Mia is attracted to, and dates, Will but is forced to break up by Chad in her efforts to keep her deal with Nicole secret. Chad, however, breaks his promise to stop looking for Grace. Will eventually learns all of this; he is surprised but thinks it all makes sense that Nicole can give the baby a better home.

Grace Brady is the biological daughter of a young teenage mother, Mia McCormick and her ex-boyfriend Chad DiMera, then Peterson-Woods, born on-screen on January 27, 2009, but she was believed to be the biological daughter of E.J. DiMera and Sami Brady. It wasn't until November 12, 2009 when Rafe Hernandez revealed the truth that Sami Brady knew she wasn't Grace's birth mother.
Sami Brady and Nicole Walker were both pregnant with E.J. DiMera's babies. Nicole miscarried but pretended to still be pregnant. She planned to adopt Mia McCormick's baby and pass it off as hers with E.J. When Mia and Sami gave birth to girls on the same day, in the same medical clinic, almost at the same time, Nicole switched Sami's baby with Mia's baby (Nicole helped deliver Mia's baby), so that she and E.J. would raise a child that was biologically his.
Sami, who was forced to enter the witness protection program during her pregnancy, decided to protect her child from the DiMeras by never telling E.J. about their baby. As a result, she left Grace at a convent orphanage. On March 30, 2009, Sami brought Grace home to Salem telling everybody she was her "adopted" daughter. The same day she made Rafe, her former bodyguard turned boyfriend, Grace's godfather. The baby was christened Grace Rafaela; Grace in honor of the convent and what Sami perceived as God's intervention in helping her to have and keep her baby, and Rafaela in honor of Rafe.
Grace died on June 9, 2009 from bacterial meningitis. Grace's parents, Sami Brady and Rafe Hernandez, were at her bedside when she died. She had also been held on that day by her biological mother, Mia. On June 11, 2009 Sami revealed to E.J. that he was "Grace's biological father," still unaware that the baby she had raised was not genetically theirs.

Sydney DiMera is the daughter of EJ DiMera and Sami Brady. Sydney is born in secret on January 28, 2009,[13] while her mother is in witness protection, and she is switched shortly after birth with the daughter of a teenage mother, Mia, who has agreed to give her baby up for adoption to Nicole Walker. Nicole, who has miscarried her fiancé E.J.'s daughter, has arranged in secret to adopt Mia's baby and pass the child off as E.J.'s, fearful that she would lose EJ without a baby.
When Nicole learns that Sami had just recently given birth to her and E.J.'s daughter the same day Mia gave birth to hers, Nicole switches the babies, preferring to have E.J.'s biological daughter over an unrelated child. Nicole instantly bonds with Sydney, and vows to always protect her no matter what happens. Sami and E.J. are none the wiser to Nicole's treachery, and Sami and Rafe bond with "Sami's" daughter, while EJ and Nicole bond with "their" daughter.
E.J. eventually learns that Nicole had a miscarriage and he kicks Nicole and Sydney out of the mansion, not knowing the truth about Sydney. Eventually, Sami also learns that Sydney is her biological daughter. Soon after, E.J. learns that Sydney is his biological child with Sami. However, the family reunion turns into a nightmare when Brady Black bails Nicole out of jail and she kidnaps Sydney. Nicole has a change of heart and decides to tell E.J. and Sami where Sydney is, but she is knocked out by Anna DiMera, who takes Sydney. It is later revealed that Anna was hired by E.J. to kidnap Sydney.
Sydney becomes the subject of many custody battles between E.J. and Sami over the next few years, with Nicole involved, as well, during the time she is married to E.J. They later come to an agreement, though, and Sydney is able to stay with her entire family, including her siblings, Johnny, Allie Horton, and Will Horton. Sydney became an aunt when Gabi Hernandez gave birth to Will's daughter, Arianna Horton.

J.T. Brady, born on June 9, 2000, is introduced as the child intended to be adopted by Abe Carver (James Reynolds) and Lexie Carver (Renée Jones). However, Lexie's father Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo) switches the infant at birth with Bo and Hope's (Peter Reckell and Kristian Alfonso) son. After years of trying for a baby the natural way, Abe and Lexie Carver decide that they will adopt a child. When Lexie's father Stefano DiMera hears about the news, he is over joyed at the prospect of finally becoming a grandfather and asks that Abe and Lexie adopt the child of one of his distant relatives. The birth mother Marlo is in fact the niece of Dr. Rolf, Stefano's longtime assistant. However none the wiser to Lexie and Abe, Stefano is planning a plot whereby Marlo's baby would be switched with the baby of Bo and Hope's who Stefano at the time thought might be his or John Black's. After the births of the babies, Stefano has Dr. Rolf switch Hope's and Marlo's babies birth tags. So, the baby is instead taken home by Bo and Hope Brady and named John Thomas, getting his names from family friend John Black (Drake Hogestyn) and Hope's late grandfather Tom Horton (MacDonald Carey).

Zack Brady was the second son and child of supercouple Hope and Bo Brady, born June 9, 2000. For the longest time, Zack is known as Isaac Theo Carver, the long-awaited and much-beloved son of Abe and Lexie Carver. For years the two had tried unsuccessfully to have a child of their own with no success, until Lexie's father, Stefano, got them in touch with Marlo, a young pregnant woman. Abe and Lexie adopt the baby that Marlo has given birth to, unaware that Stefano had switched Marlo and Hope's sons.
Zack dies on January 1, 2006, after being run over by Bo's SUV, which is driven by his daughter, Chelsea. Upon his death, his liver is donated to his niece, Claire Brady, and his corneas are donated to Abe Carver; Claire's life is saved and Abe regains his eyesight. Zack's death and the revelation of Chelsea as the SUV driver drive a wedge between Bo and Hope – as well as the rest of the Brady family for most of 2006.
In June 2016, he returns as an aged ghost (Scott Shilstone) to help his mother Hope.[1][2]

Bonnie Lockhart[edit]
Bonnie Lockhart (originally named Maureen) is the mother of Mimi Lockhart, Patrick Lockhart, and Connor Lockhart. She has been portrayed by actresses Robin Riker (July 11, 2000 to July 31, 2000), Kathy Connell (August 15, 2000 to June 7, 2002) and, most notably, Judi Evans (September 1, 2003 to March 1, 2007),[3] who also portrays Adrienne Kiriakis. Bonnie is known for making Mimi's life miserable. When Rex wanted to ask her for permission to marry Mimi, she said no, because Rex isn't rich. When Bonnie finds out Mimi is pregnant and wants to tell Rex, Bonnie convinces her to get an abortion; an unwilling Mimi gets one and doesn't tell Rex about it. Bonnie marries Mickey Horton, after his wife is murdered by a serial killer in 2003. After Maggie shows up alive, Mickey divorces her. Bonnie is also the owner of Alice's. It is revealed later that she killed her abusive husband and hid his body; she is eventually sent to prison.
Angela Moroni[edit]
Angela Moroni was portrayed by Ayda Field from late summer of 2000 until March 2001. Angela Moroni is the daughter of Vincent Moroni, an Italian mob boss. She was introduced during Brandon and Sami's quest to get the tape back with Kate forcing Roberto to confess to the murder of Franco Kelly. Angela came into possession of the tape, but she would only give it to Brandon if he married her. When Brandon and Sami went back to Salem, she came with them and kept the tape with her. When they returned to Europe, Brandon and Angela got married. When a spy from her father saw Brandon and Sami kiss, he hired two gunmen to kill Sami and Brandon at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg. This backfired however, when Angela dove in front of Brandon. Before her death, Angela finally made her father give Brandon and Sami the tape.
Vincent Moroni[edit]
Vincent Moroni was portrayed by Carl Weintraub from summer 2000 until March 2001. Vincent Moroni was an Italian mob boss with one daughter, Angela. Upon meeting Brandon and Sami, he was immediately suspicious of them. After Kate told Vincent about the tape (containing Kate telling Roberto to confess to the murder of Franco Kelly) he took it from Angela. When Brandon married Angela anyway, Vincent was convinced he loved his daughter. Kate later slept with Vincent to convince him to kill Victor and manipulated him into spying on Sami and Brandon. When his spy told him about the kiss he ordered Victor, Brandon and Sami to be murdered at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg. Chaos erupted then and Angela threw herself in front of Brandon, saving his life. Vincent was so upset at the events that he set in motion, that he committed suicide.

Profile


Other names
Marlena Evans


Hattie Adams is a woman who bore a resemblance to Marlena Evans. Under the guidance of Wilhelm Rolf, she had plastic surgery to increase this resemblance. Stefano DiMera planned to use Hattie against Marlena, but never implemented such a plan. Hattie eventually had further surgery (off-screen) to look identical to Marlena and reappeared briefly in 2004; she was suspected of being a serial killer after Marlena was supposedly witnessed committing the crimes, but it was determined that Marlena had performed the acts under hypnosis and Hattie was not involved. In 2016, an incarcerated Hope Williams Brady encounters Hattie in prison and they become allies; upset that Stefano had interfered in her life, Hattie is pleased that Hope had murdered him. Hattie explains that she had become a secretary in Chicago, but then a man she was dating stole money from her company and framed her for the theft. Hope agrees to help Hattie clear her name, and in exchange Hattie protects Hope from the prison's dominant clique.
Hattie was originally played by Andrea Hall, the real-life identical twin sister of Marlena's portrayer, Deidre Hall. From 2004 onward, after the character's final surgery and Hall-Gengler's retirement from acting, Hattie was played by Deidre Hall. In November 2016, it was confirmed that Deidre Hall would reprise her portrayal of Hattie.[4]

Harold Wentworth[edit]
Harold Wentworth, played by Ryan Scott from 2001 until 2003, was introduced during a storyline in which Jack Deveraux pretended to be gay in order to spare Greta von Amberg's feelings, as he didn't return her affection. Greta tried to set Jack up with Harold, an openly gay man. Harold worked with Greta to set up situations where he and Jack could be intimate, but Jack would always find a way to escape. Jack eventually admitted that he was not gay, which led to Harold criticizing him for his cowardice. Harold later happened to be in Las Vegas at the same time as Jack and Greta, and he helped them hide from mob hitmen by disguising themselves as showgirls. To his dismay, Jack then learned that Harold was the son of Oliver Wentworth, the owner of the Spectator. This was the local newspaper, which Jack hoped to run; Jennifer got the job instead, due in part to Harold's recommendation. Harold then worked at the Spectator, and was able to maintain a friendly, professional relationship with Jack. He last appeared during the summer of 2003, shortly before the Salem Stalker storyline started. By 2006, though not shown on-screen, Harold had become editor of the Spectator; Jack and Jennifer learned that he was offering them a job running the London bureau of the paper, which they accepted.
Eugenia Willens[edit]
Eugenia Willens, played by Daphne Bloomer from 2002 to 2006,[5] worked at Salem University Hospital as a lab tech, but she lost her job and her pension after Sami blackmailed her into looking the other way while Sami switched the results of a paternity test. She later conspired with Kate against Sami and also worked as Lucas' personal assistant at Titan. She briefly dated Lucas.

Rex Brady was portrayed by actor Eric Winter. Rex first appeared on July 8, 2002, and left town on July 26, 2005. He is the son of Roman Brady and Kate Roberts and twin brother to Cassie Brady.
Rex and his twin sister Cassie were discovered half-naked during a meteor shower and were originally suspected to be aliens. As time went on it was discovered that they were the children of Tony DiMera and Marlena Evans but this turned out to be false. In reality a sperm sample was somehow taken from Roman Brady during his years of captivity at the hands of Tony's father Stefano DiMera and combined with eggs taken from Kate Roberts who was a prostitute and associate of Stefano's.
Rex and, to a lesser extent, Cassie seemed to have super human intelligence. Rex also suffered mysterious mood swings and psychotic tendencies during Salem Stalker storyline. He dated Mimi Lockhart but they broke up when Rex discovered Mimi aborted his baby without telling him about it. Feeling hurt and betrayed, Rex left town following the abortion and has not appeared on the show since his departure.
Rex is last mentioned on March 10, 2017, when his mother, Kate, gets a bracelet from Eduardo with the initials of her six children on it.

Duck[edit]
Duck is a Vietnam War veteran who lives on the fictional island Tinda Lao with his daughter Gabby.
Gabby[edit]
Gabby, played by Joy Bisco, is a young woman who lives on the fictional island, Tinda Lao. Her father is Duck. When Shawn-Douglas Brady was in Tinda Lao, she fell in love with him, but he stuck to his fiancée, Belle Black.
Morgan Hollingsworth[edit]
Morgan Hollingsworth, portrayed by Kristen Renton, was President of Alpha Chi Theta sorority, where Chelsea and Stephanie pledged. Morgan dated Max Brady and was almost a victim of Ford Decker, the campus rapist. She and the Alpha Chi Theta girls conspired to stop Ford from raping again but their plan backfired and he fell to his death. Soon after Ford's death and the coverup was exposed, Max and Morgan broke up.
Morgan later went to work for Tony as his intern at the same time Stephanie interned for Anna's rival firm. Morgan's interests moved to Philip Kiriakis soon after her father, Paul, disappeared. John Black and Phillip were involved in a heated shipping rivalry that turned ugly when gun fire broke out. Phillip took a bullet intended for Morgan after one of Ava's goons tried to shoot her. Morgan helped Phillip with his recovery and they shared a short romance. After Paul was revealed to be alive, Phillip admitted to threatening Paul's life and was later caught kissing Chloe. Morgan left town to take a two-year internship in Chicago.
Alex North[edit]
Dr. Alex North was portrayed by Wayne Northrop from August 1, 2005, to May 24, 2006. Alex North was brought to Salem by John Black to help John's wife Marlena recover from amnesia. Marlena had memories of Alex and, after discovering they had been married (North had been presumed dead after being captured on a mission in Vietnam), she chose him instead of John because Alex was controlling her mind. It was soon discovered that he had been an abusive husband and, after a fight with John, he was presumed dead after falling over the edge of a cliff. The Alex North storyline was very unpopular with viewers.
Trent Robbins[edit]
Trent Robbins (played by Roscoe Born) was the biological father of Max Brady and the adoptive father of Melanie Layton. He abused Max as a child, causing Max to become socially isolated and mute for several years. Trent returned in 2008 as the Dean of the Physics department at Salem University. It was revealed that he was still married to Nicole Walker. He re-entered Max's life by awarding Nick Fallon a grant for his "work" on a fuel cell. Unbeknownst to Trent, Max was responsible for the majority of Nick's design. Max became short-tempered upon seeing Trent and confronted him. After Max insisted that Trent take responsibility for his abusive actions, Trent offered to pay him off in order to keep his past a secret.
Trent was murdered via a stab in the back. Among the suspects were Caroline Brady, Trent's children Max and Melanie, and his wife Nicole. It was revealed that Nick was responsible for the murder. Nick maintained that he killed Trent in Melanie's defense, and that his addiction to alcohol and painkillers played a role in his bad decision.

She is the daughter of Shawn and Belle Brady and the granddaughter of supercouples Bo and Hope Brady and John and Marlena Black At the time of her birth, it is not known that Shawn was her father. A little after Thanksgiving, Claire becomes sick for an unknown reason.

In a horrible twist of fate, Claire's biological uncle, Zack who was only 5 at the time, dies in a hit-and-run car accident. Zack's liver is a perfect match for little Claire and she receives his liver when he dies. Near her first birthday, the truth about her paternity is revealed.

Willow Stark[edit]

Shawn got Willow a job at Chez Rouge and started dating her after he broke up with his ex-wife Mimi Lockhart.

Weeks later, EJ Wells paid her to break into the Brady home and she accidentally set fire to the place. She planted Chelsea Brady's brush at the scene, but Nick Fallon hid the brush, so she was sent to jail. Once Nick bailed her out, he helped her find a place to live. Willow attempted to blackmail Nick and eventually fell to her death on an episode that aired June 5, 2007. She has a younger brother named Jed Stark who attended Salem University.

Glen Reiber is the biological father of J.T. Brady, who was switched at birth with Zack Brady, resulting in a complicated custody battle.
While watching TV in Chicago, Glen Reiber saw a sketch of a girl whose body had been found frozen in the ice, in the canal behind Bo and Hope Brady's house after their wedding New Year's Eve. He recognized it as Marlo, his former girlfriend, who had left town suddenly while pregnant. The couple went to Salem, identified the sketch, and Glen inquired about the baby Marlo carried.
Though given the runaround by the Carvers, he and Barb found that Marlo gave birth to a boy, in June 2000, and the Carvers had adopted him. Jennifer Deveraux had a car accident resulting in baby J.T. Brady falling into the river, while strapped in Isaac Carver's baby seat (his name was on it). Barb spotted the baby floating, like Moses in the rushes, and they rescued him. Thinking that he is Isaac, the Reibers fled to his aunt's cabin in the hills. Auntie discovered the surgery scar, and when the baby began to have breathing difficulties, Glen and Barb rushed him to the local hospital, but then returned to Salem. They already had a DNA test to prove Glen was the father of Marlo's child.
Although facing kidnapping charges, Bo and Hope only wanted J.T. back safe, and promised not to press charges. The Reibers returned J.T., and went back to Chicago, where the DNA results arrived. Barb read them secretly, realizing Glen was the father of J.T., and not Isaac's father, and went back to Salem to blackmail Lexie Carver. She succeeded in getting several thousand dollars, and then told Glen that she was pregnant with their child, hoping he will not try to search for the truth. Eventually they both returned to Salem and crashed Lexie's party. When Lexie didn't come up with the million dollars, Barb blew the whistle. Glen sought out a slick attorney, Cameron Reese, to sue for custody of J.T. In the ensuing DNA test, it was proven that Glen was J.T.'s father.
After Glen and Barb won custody of J.T., they left Salem, choosing to keep the boy's name the same. They returned to Chicago, where they prepared for the birth of their next child.

Tyler Kiriakis is the son of Philip Kiriakis and Mimi Lockhart. In July 2006, Philip Kiriakis and then-wife Belle Black were planning to have a second child, as were their friends/nephew Shawn-Douglas Brady and his then wife Mimi Lockhart were also plan to have a baby. Both couples planned to use artificial insemination. A gloved hand switched the samples so Belle ended up pregnant with Shawn's baby and Shawn and Mimi's surrogate ended up pregnant with Philip and Mimi's child. It wasn't long until both couples learned the truth that there was a switch in the petri dishes. Philip and Mimi wanted to have both babies aborted but Belle chose not to have her child aborted. Unfortunately, she later had complications and her child was lost. After Shawn and Mimi separated, Mimi signed away their rights to the child and left its fate up to the surrogate mother Lauren Chaffee. Bonnie Lockhart was paying Lauren with the intent to mother the child but Bonnie was sent to jail and Lauren was left to give birth on her own.
Philip and his sister Billie have traced Lauren's steps and now believe that "Pocket" or Ty Johnson, the baby boy being fostered by Kayla Brady and Steve Johnson, is actually Tyler.

Ciara Brady is the daughter of Bo Brady and Hope Brady.
Vivian Jovanni assumed the role of Ciara on October 30, 2015.[8] In December 2016, Jovanni left the show.[9]
While grieving over the death of their young son, Zack, Hope and Bo Brady found comfort in one another, and Ciara is conceived, although it takes several months for Hope to learn she is pregnant. When she eventually learns that she is pregnant, a classic "Who's the daddy?" storyline begins. Hope had been to Morgan Island with Patrick Lockhart where, in a moment of weakness, she had found comfort in his arms.
Tests were run and it was "determined" that Hope's unborn child was Patrick's. Unbeknownst to Hope and Bo, Patrick had paid the doctor to fix the test. Despite believing Patrick to be the father of her unborn child, Bo and Hope get back together, pushing Patrick to the point he decides he needs to kidnap Hope. Ciara was originally born on December 29, 2006 but her birthday was changed to July 16, 2004 then again to March 18, 1998. Ciara was born in a warehouse, delivered by Bo. Patrick reveals her true paternity before being arrested.
Ciara's name was selected by fans in an online poll. Out of the five original choices, narrowed down to three, Ciara Alice Brady was the winner.[10]
Ciara lives with Hope and Bo the first couple of years of her life before living with Hope, Doug and Julie after her mother and father separate for a short while. Ciara's parents have since reunited and separated again.
She has two older brothers, Shawn-Douglas and Zack Brady (deceased) and one older paternal half-sister, Chelsea Brady.

Allie Horton is the daughter of Sami Brady and Lucas Horton. She and her twin, Johnny DiMera, are born October 23, 2007, at her grandmother Marlena's house, where they are delivered by Marlena. Allie goes for several weeks without a name until the Thanksgiving Day wedding of Shawn and Belle, where Lucas announces her name as Alice Caroline Horton, and "Allie" for short. Sami is shocked because she and Lucas haven't yet reached a decision on their baby girl's name, but happily Sami loves the name. Allie is named after her great-grandmothers, Alice Horton and Caroline Brady. Her twin, Johnny DiMera, is her maternal half-brother. Allie has a big brother in Will Horton, and in 2009, she becomes big sister to her new maternal half-sister, Sydney DiMera.
In February 2011, Allie goes to live in Hong Kong with her father Lucas for a while, after the man who is masquerading as her step-father Rafe Hernandez is mean to her several times. She returns after it is revealed that the man is an imposter. Sami and the real Rafe try to help Allie understand what has happened.
In May 2013, Allie becomes an aunt to Arianna Grace Horton (Will's daughter with Gabi Hernandez), and in April 2014 when Will gets married, Allie gains a brother-in-law in Sonny Kiriakis.
In May 2014, Allie is walking into the Horton Town Square with Jordan Ridgeway when she sees her favorite cousin Nick Fallon, who has been shot multiple times and is bleeding from the chest, stumble into the square and collapse. Allie screams and is the first person to notice him. Afterwards, she cannot stop looking at him despite her parents' attempts to get her to look away; and when Nick dies shortly after, she is traumatized by his death.
In October 2014, Allie moves with Sami, Johnny and Sydney, to live in California.

Johnny DiMera is the son of EJ DiMera and Sami Brady, and the maternal half-twin of Allie Horton. Johnny has an older maternal half-brother in Will Horton, and in 2009 he gains a full sister in Sydney DiMera. In 2013, Johnny becomes an uncle to Will's daughter Arianna Horton. With a full name of John Roman DiMera, Johnny is named after his mom's dad and step-dad, Roman Brady and John Black.
Johnny is born with Allie on October 23, 2007. He is originally believed, like Allie, to be the son of Lucas Horton, but after the birth, EJ begins to suspect that the twins might have different fathers because Johnny does not look like his sister, and EJ thinks Johnny looks like himself. A second DNA test confirms EJ to be Johnny's father.
After witnessing a murder, Johnny's mom Sami is taken into protection by the federal government as a vulnerable witness. Whilst in witness protection, Sami allows Johnny to live with EJ and his wife Nicole Walker, in the DiMera mansion, with Johnny's paternal grandfather, Stefano DiMera. When Sami is released from witness protection, Johnny returns to live with Sami. However, Stefano insists that EJ raises Johnny as a DiMera, against Sami's wishes. EJ first resists this notion because he does not want to betray his ex-wife; but when he hears that Sami's youngest daughter, whom Sami says she adopted, is his daughter and that Sami gave birth to her whilst in witness protection and hid this from him, EJ is furious with Sami, and he agrees to raise Johnny as a DiMera against his ex-wife's wishes. After much heartache and drama, including Johnny suffering from eye-cancer (from which he eventually makes a full recovery), EJ and Sami become co-operative co-parents, and eventually marry again; but then Johnny's dad EJ is shot dead in a conflict with the villainous Clyde Weston.
After losing his dad, Johnny goes with his mom and sisters to live in Los Angeles.

Crawford Decker[edit]
Crawford Decker was Ford Decker's father. He used his influence with the president of Salem University to protect Ford from being punished for raping several female students. Crawford also urged the police to aggressively pursue Ford's subsequent disappearance.
Ford Decker[edit]
Ford Decker was a student at Salem University who was a serial date rapist. When his father Crawford, used his influence to protect Ford from being punished for drugging and raping numerous female students, the sisters of Alpha Chi Theta decided to take action. The women, who included three of Ford's victims or attempted victims, drugged him. When the partially incapacitated Ford then pursued Chelsea, whom he had also drugged, up the stairs of the sorority house, he lost consciousness and suffered a fatal fall down the stairs. The sisters buried his body in the basement. Subsequently, Chelsea Brady and Stephanie Johnson dug him back up and hid him in a water heater, which Max Brady removed from the premises.
Richard Baker[edit]
Richard Baker, played by John Callahan (2008–2009; 2010),[11] is a doctor Nicole blackmails into posing as her OB/GYN while she fakes pregnancy after miscarrying her baby. Though he claims to have altruistic motives in the running of his free clinic, he's involved in shady black market baby brokering in order to pay off his substantial debts, a fact Nicole uses to her advantage. He frequently goes to Nicole for money in exchange for keeping her secret until he is murdered by men Stefano DiMera hires. Stefano also attempts to frame Rafe Hernandez for the murder. In his last frugal efforts to tell Sami and Mia about the baby switch, he writes each of them a letter, both of which are destroyed by Nicole. However, it is discovered that he faked his death and later returns to Salem. He helps Hope, who under the influence of sleeping pills, mugs the men of Salem. He was caught and send to prison for helping Nicole switch babies and stealing money.

Daniel Jonas first appeared on March 4, 2008, being portrayed by actor, Shawn Christian. Christian initially signed a one-year contract, but he has since signed on for an extended stay.[12] Following a fatal car crash caused by Eric Brady's drunk-driving, the character was written into a coma on January 4, 2016. On January 6, 2016, the character was killed off after being taken off life support when his heart was donated to Brady Black. Christian reprised the role thereafter during a dream sequence with Nicole Walker on February 12, 2016, during another dream sequence months later with Chloe Lane on November 3, 2016, and yet another dream sequence with Nicole Walker on December 12, 2016 - declaring his love for her as well as his encouragement for her to move on with her life. Christian made more reprisals in 2017, once on January 27, 2017, once in May 2017, and a final appearance as an apparition to Eric Brady and Nicole Walker on June 28, 2017.
Before arriving in Salem, Dr. Jonas worked at various hospitals around the world. Many years ago, he had an affair with Carly Manning, who later introduced him to Rebecca, a cancer patient with whom Daniel fell in love. Although Rebecca's prognosis was grim, Daniel married her anyway and was determined to save her. Rebecca's cancer proved to be too advanced and she died in Daniel's arms. Upon his arrival in Salem, Daniel has romances with Chelsea Brady and her grandmother Kate Roberts. In early 2010, Carly tells Daniel that Melanie Layton is their daughter. Daniel and Melanie bond quickly, and eventually forgive Carly for keeping them apart. After a drunken one night stand with Melanie's husband, Philip Kiriakis, Daniel's fiancée Chloe Lane becomes pregnant, and is unsure if Daniel or Philip is the father. She is relieved when a paternity test shows Daniel as the child's father. Daniel and Chloe name their son Parker, after Daniel's mother. At Parker's christening, Caroline Brady reveals that she switched the paternity test to keep Melanie from leaving Philip for her granddaughter Stephanie Johnson's boyfriend Nathan Horton. Daniel ends his marriage to Chloe.
Daniel soon finds happiness with Jennifer Horton, but their happiness is short-lived as Jennifer's ex, Jack Deveraux returns to town. Eventually Jennifer reunites with Jack and Daniel finds comfort with a pregnant Nicole Walker. He also learns that Maggie Horton is his biological mother. Daniel helps Nicole fix her child's paternity test, claiming the baby is Rafe Hernandez's, even though it is EJ DiMera's. As Nicole grows attached to Daniel, Jack dies and Daniel and Jennifer reunite. Nicole loses her baby, but keeps it a secret, wanting to hold onto Daniel. When Nicole falls down the stairs after a fight with Jennifer, and gives birth to a stillborn son, she blames Jennifer. Eventually the truth comes out and Daniel and Jennifer once again reunite. EJ confronts Daniel for keeping his son away from him saying he will not retaliate because of Daniel's previous help with his other son Johnny but warns Daniel not to cross him again.
On January 7, 2013, Chloe returns to Salem with the news that Daniel is really Parker's father.
On December 31, 2015, Daniel and Brady Black are driving in car returning to the Basic Black launch of product line because Brady forgot a gift for Theresa, during this time Eric Brady decides to drive himself while being intoxicated causes a car crash which injures several major Salem Residents including, Dr. Daniel Jonas, Brady Black, Eric Brady, and Jennifer Horton.
On January 4, 2016, Daniel was pronounced dead to the injuries from the accident, as an organ donor, Kayla asks Maggie to allow for Daniel to donate his heart to either Eric or Brady. On January 6, 2016, Daniel is taken off life-support with Maggie's consent and his heart is donated to Brady Black.

Mia McCormick[edit]
Mia McCormick (played by Taylor Spreitler from January 6, 2009 – June 23, 2010), is a high school drop-out, who was introduced as a pregnant teenager. Nicole Walker bought her baby, Grace, for $10K to replace her own, secretly miscarried, baby. She then secretly swaps Grace for Sami Brady's baby, Sydney, who was born at the same time (January 28, 2009). Grace eventually dies of bacterial meningitis. Mia uses the money to fund a dancing career in Japan but when this fails she returns to Salem, determined to get her baby back. She then befriends Will Horton, moves in with Maggie Horton and takes a job at Java Cafe. Her ex-boyfriend Chad DiMera, father of Grace, also has a job at Java Cafe. After overhearing information and investigating, he discovers what had happened to his daughter, although neither Chad nor Mia initially knew about Sydney and Grace being switched. Mia eventually finds out that Grace was her biological daughter, and she and Chad mourn her. Meanwhile, Mia is attracted to, and dates, Will but is forced to break up by Chad in her efforts to keep her deal with Nicole secret. Chad, however, breaks his promise to stop looking for Grace. Will eventually learns all of this; he is surprised but thinks it all makes sense that Nicole can give the baby a better home.

Grace Brady is the biological daughter of a young teenage mother, Mia McCormick and her ex-boyfriend Chad DiMera, then Peterson-Woods, born on-screen on January 27, 2009, but she was believed to be the biological daughter of E.J. DiMera and Sami Brady. It wasn't until November 12, 2009 when Rafe Hernandez revealed the truth that Sami Brady knew she wasn't Grace's birth mother.
Sami Brady and Nicole Walker were both pregnant with E.J. DiMera's babies. Nicole miscarried but pretended to still be pregnant. She planned to adopt Mia McCormick's baby and pass it off as hers with E.J. When Mia and Sami gave birth to girls on the same day, in the same medical clinic, almost at the same time, Nicole switched Sami's baby with Mia's baby (Nicole helped deliver Mia's baby), so that she and E.J. would raise a child that was biologically his.
Sami, who was forced to enter the witness protection program during her pregnancy, decided to protect her child from the DiMeras by never telling E.J. about their baby. As a result, she left Grace at a convent orphanage. On March 30, 2009, Sami brought Grace home to Salem telling everybody she was her "adopted" daughter. The same day she made Rafe, her former bodyguard turned boyfriend, Grace's godfather. The baby was christened Grace Rafaela; Grace in honor of the convent and what Sami perceived as God's intervention in helping her to have and keep her baby, and Rafaela in honor of Rafe.
Grace died on June 9, 2009 from bacterial meningitis. Grace's parents, Sami Brady and Rafe Hernandez, were at her bedside when she died. She had also been held on that day by her biological mother, Mia. On June 11, 2009 Sami revealed to E.J. that he was "Grace's biological father," still unaware that the baby she had raised was not genetically theirs.

Sydney DiMera is the daughter of EJ DiMera and Sami Brady. Sydney is born in secret on January 28, 2009,[13] while her mother is in witness protection, and she is switched shortly after birth with the daughter of a teenage mother, Mia, who has agreed to give her baby up for adoption to Nicole Walker. Nicole, who has miscarried her fiancé E.J.'s daughter, has arranged in secret to adopt Mia's baby and pass the child off as E.J.'s, fearful that she would lose EJ without a baby.
When Nicole learns that Sami had just recently given birth to her and E.J.'s daughter the same day Mia gave birth to hers, Nicole switches the babies, preferring to have E.J.'s biological daughter over an unrelated child. Nicole instantly bonds with Sydney, and vows to always protect her no matter what happens. Sami and E.J. are none the wiser to Nicole's treachery, and Sami and Rafe bond with "Sami's" daughter, while EJ and Nicole bond with "their" daughter.
E.J. eventually learns that Nicole had a miscarriage and he kicks Nicole and Sydney out of the mansion, not knowing the truth about Sydney. Eventually, Sami also learns that Sydney is her biological daughter. Soon after, E.J. learns that Sydney is his biological child with Sami. However, the family reunion turns into a nightmare when Brady Black bails Nicole out of jail and she kidnaps Sydney. Nicole has a change of heart and decides to tell E.J. and Sami where Sydney is, but she is knocked out by Anna DiMera, who takes Sydney. It is later revealed that Anna was hired by E.J. to kidnap Sydney.
Sydney becomes the subject of many custody battles between E.J. and Sami over the next few years, with Nicole involved, as well, during the time she is married to E.J. They later come to an agreement, though, and Sydney is able to stay with her entire family, including her siblings, Johnny, Allie Horton, and Will Horton. Sydney became an aunt when Gabi Hernandez gave birth to Will's daughter, Arianna Horton.

J.T. Brady, born on June 9, 2000, is introduced as the child intended to be adopted by Abe Carver (James Reynolds) and Lexie Carver (Renée Jones). However, Lexie's father Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo) switches the infant at birth with Bo and Hope's (Peter Reckell and Kristian Alfonso) son. After years of trying for a baby the natural way, Abe and Lexie Carver decide that they will adopt a child. When Lexie's father Stefano DiMera hears about the news, he is over joyed at the prospect of finally becoming a grandfather and asks that Abe and Lexie adopt the child of one of his distant relatives. The birth mother Marlo is in fact the niece of Dr. Rolf, Stefano's longtime assistant. However none the wiser to Lexie and Abe, Stefano is planning a plot whereby Marlo's baby would be switched with the baby of Bo and Hope's who Stefano at the time thought might be his or John Black's. After the births of the babies, Stefano has Dr. Rolf switch Hope's and Marlo's babies birth tags. So, the baby is instead taken home by Bo and Hope Brady and named John Thomas, getting his names from family friend John Black (Drake Hogestyn) and Hope's late grandfather Tom Horton (MacDonald Carey).

Zack Brady was the second son and child of supercouple Hope and Bo Brady, born June 9, 2000. For the longest time, Zack is known as Isaac Theo Carver, the long-awaited and much-beloved son of Abe and Lexie Carver. For years the two had tried unsuccessfully to have a child of their own with no success, until Lexie's father, Stefano, got them in touch with Marlo, a young pregnant woman. Abe and Lexie adopt the baby that Marlo has given birth to, unaware that Stefano had switched Marlo and Hope's sons.
Zack dies on January 1, 2006, after being run over by Bo's SUV, which is driven by his daughter, Chelsea. Upon his death, his liver is donated to his niece, Claire Brady, and his corneas are donated to Abe Carver; Claire's life is saved and Abe regains his eyesight. Zack's death and the revelation of Chelsea as the SUV driver drive a wedge between Bo and Hope – as well as the rest of the Brady family for most of 2006.
In June 2016, he returns as an aged ghost (Scott Shilstone) to help his mother Hope.[1][2]

Bonnie Lockhart[edit]
Bonnie Lockhart (originally named Maureen) is the mother of Mimi Lockhart, Patrick Lockhart, and Connor Lockhart. She has been portrayed by actresses Robin Riker (July 11, 2000 to July 31, 2000), Kathy Connell (August 15, 2000 to June 7, 2002) and, most notably, Judi Evans (September 1, 2003 to March 1, 2007),[3] who also portrays Adrienne Kiriakis. Bonnie is known for making Mimi's life miserable. When Rex wanted to ask her for permission to marry Mimi, she said no, because Rex isn't rich. When Bonnie finds out Mimi is pregnant and wants to tell Rex, Bonnie convinces her to get an abortion; an unwilling Mimi gets one and doesn't tell Rex about it. Bonnie marries Mickey Horton, after his wife is murdered by a serial killer in 2003. After Maggie shows up alive, Mickey divorces her. Bonnie is also the owner of Alice's. It is revealed later that she killed her abusive husband and hid his body; she is eventually sent to prison.
Angela Moroni[edit]
Angela Moroni was portrayed by Ayda Field from late summer of 2000 until March 2001. Angela Moroni is the daughter of Vincent Moroni, an Italian mob boss. She was introduced during Brandon and Sami's quest to get the tape back with Kate forcing Roberto to confess to the murder of Franco Kelly. Angela came into possession of the tape, but she would only give it to Brandon if he married her. When Brandon and Sami went back to Salem, she came with them and kept the tape with her. When they returned to Europe, Brandon and Angela got married. When a spy from her father saw Brandon and Sami kiss, he hired two gunmen to kill Sami and Brandon at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg. This backfired however, when Angela dove in front of Brandon. Before her death, Angela finally made her father give Brandon and Sami the tape.
Vincent Moroni[edit]
Vincent Moroni was portrayed by Carl Weintraub from summer 2000 until March 2001. Vincent Moroni was an Italian mob boss with one daughter, Angela. Upon meeting Brandon and Sami, he was immediately suspicious of them. After Kate told Vincent about the tape (containing Kate telling Roberto to confess to the murder of Franco Kelly) he took it from Angela. When Brandon married Angela anyway, Vincent was convinced he loved his daughter. Kate later slept with Vincent to convince him to kill Victor and manipulated him into spying on Sami and Brandon. When his spy told him about the kiss he ordered Victor, Brandon and Sami to be murdered at the coronation of Greta Von Amberg. Chaos erupted then and Angela threw herself in front of Brandon, saving his life. Vincent was so upset at the events that he set in motion, that he committed suicide.

Other names
Marlena Evans


Hattie Adams is a woman who bore a resemblance to Marlena Evans. Under the guidance of Wilhelm Rolf, she had plastic surgery to increase this resemblance. Stefano DiMera planned to use Hattie against Marlena, but never implemented such a plan. Hattie eventually had further surgery (off-screen) to look identical to Marlena and reappeared briefly in 2004; she was suspected of being a serial killer after Marlena was supposedly witnessed committing the crimes, but it was determined that Marlena had performed the acts under hypnosis and Hattie was not involved. In 2016, an incarcerated Hope Williams Brady encounters Hattie in prison and they become allies; upset that Stefano had interfered in her life, Hattie is pleased that Hope had murdered him. Hattie explains that she had become a secretary in Chicago, but then a man she was dating stole money from her company and framed her for the theft. Hope agrees to help Hattie clear her name, and in exchange Hattie protects Hope from the prison's dominant clique.
Hattie was originally played by Andrea Hall, the real-life identical twin sister of Marlena's portrayer, Deidre Hall. From 2004 onward, after the character's final surgery and Hall-Gengler's retirement from acting, Hattie was played by Deidre Hall. In November 2016, it was confirmed that Deidre Hall would reprise her portrayal of Hattie.[4]

Harold Wentworth[edit]
Harold Wentworth, played by Ryan Scott from 2001 until 2003, was introduced during a storyline in which Jack Deveraux pretended to be gay in order to spare Greta von Amberg's feelings, as he didn't return her affection. Greta tried to set Jack up with Harold, an openly gay man. Harold worked with Greta to set up situations where he and Jack could be intimate, but Jack would always find a way to escape. Jack eventually admitted that he was not gay, which led to Harold criticizing him for his cowardice. Harold later happened to be in Las Vegas at the same time as Jack and Greta, and he helped them hide from mob hitmen by disguising themselves as showgirls. To his dismay, Jack then learned that Harold was the son of Oliver Wentworth, the owner of the Spectator. This was the local newspaper, which Jack hoped to run; Jennifer got the job instead, due in part to Harold's recommendation. Harold then worked at the Spectator, and was able to maintain a friendly, professional relationship with Jack. He last appeared during the summer of 2003, shortly before the Salem Stalker storyline started. By 2006, though not shown on-screen, Harold had become editor of the Spectator; Jack and Jennifer learned that he was offering them a job running the London bureau of the paper, which they accepted.
Eugenia Willens[edit]
Eugenia Willens, played by Daphne Bloomer from 2002 to 2006,[5] worked at Salem University Hospital as a lab tech, but she lost her job and her pension after Sami blackmailed her into looking the other way while Sami switched the results of a paternity test. She later conspired with Kate against Sami and also worked as Lucas' personal assistant at Titan. She briefly dated Lucas.

Rex Brady was portrayed by actor Eric Winter. Rex first appeared on July 8, 2002, and left town on July 26, 2005. He is the son of Roman Brady and Kate Roberts and twin brother to Cassie Brady.
Rex and his twin sister Cassie were discovered half-naked during a meteor shower and were originally suspected to be aliens. As time went on it was discovered that they were the children of Tony DiMera and Marlena Evans but this turned out to be false. In reality a sperm sample was somehow taken from Roman Brady during his years of captivity at the hands of Tony's father Stefano DiMera and combined with eggs taken from Kate Roberts who was a prostitute and associate of Stefano's.
Rex and, to a lesser extent, Cassie seemed to have super human intelligence. Rex also suffered mysterious mood swings and psychotic tendencies during Salem Stalker storyline. He dated Mimi Lockhart but they broke up when Rex discovered Mimi aborted his baby without telling him about it. Feeling hurt and betrayed, Rex left town following the abortion and has not appeared on the show since his departure.
Rex is last mentioned on March 10, 2017, when his mother, Kate, gets a bracelet from Eduardo with the initials of her six children on it.

Duck[edit]
Duck is a Vietnam War veteran who lives on the fictional island Tinda Lao with his daughter Gabby.
Gabby[edit]
Gabby, played by Joy Bisco, is a young woman who lives on the fictional island, Tinda Lao. Her father is Duck. When Shawn-Douglas Brady was in Tinda Lao, she fell in love with him, but he stuck to his fiancée, Belle Black.
Morgan Hollingsworth[edit]
Morgan Hollingsworth, portrayed by Kristen Renton, was President of Alpha Chi Theta sorority, where Chelsea and Stephanie pledged. Morgan dated Max Brady and was almost a victim of Ford Decker, the campus rapist. She and the Alpha Chi Theta girls conspired to stop Ford from raping again but their plan backfired and he fell to his death. Soon after Ford's death and the coverup was exposed, Max and Morgan broke up.
Morgan later went to work for Tony as his intern at the same time Stephanie interned for Anna's rival firm. Morgan's interests moved to Philip Kiriakis soon after her father, Paul, disappeared. John Black and Phillip were involved in a heated shipping rivalry that turned ugly when gun fire broke out. Phillip took a bullet intended for Morgan after one of Ava's goons tried to shoot her. Morgan helped Phillip with his recovery and they shared a short romance. After Paul was revealed to be alive, Phillip admitted to threatening Paul's life and was later caught kissing Chloe. Morgan left town to take a two-year internship in Chicago.
Alex North[edit]
Dr. Alex North was portrayed by Wayne Northrop from August 1, 2005, to May 24, 2006. Alex North was brought to Salem by John Black to help John's wife Marlena recover from amnesia. Marlena had memories of Alex and, after discovering they had been married (North had been presumed dead after being captured on a mission in Vietnam), she chose him instead of John because Alex was controlling her mind. It was soon discovered that he had been an abusive husband and, after a fight with John, he was presumed dead after falling over the edge of a cliff. The Alex North storyline was very unpopular with viewers.
Trent Robbins[edit]
Trent Robbins (played by Roscoe Born) was the biological father of Max Brady and the adoptive father of Melanie Layton. He abused Max as a child, causing Max to become socially isolated and mute for several years. Trent returned in 2008 as the Dean of the Physics department at Salem University. It was revealed that he was still married to Nicole Walker. He re-entered Max's life by awarding Nick Fallon a grant for his "work" on a fuel cell. Unbeknownst to Trent, Max was responsible for the majority of Nick's design. Max became short-tempered upon seeing Trent and confronted him. After Max insisted that Trent take responsibility for his abusive actions, Trent offered to pay him off in order to keep his past a secret.
Trent was murdered via a stab in the back. Among the suspects were Caroline Brady, Trent's children Max and Melanie, and his wife Nicole. It was revealed that Nick was responsible for the murder. Nick maintained that he killed Trent in Melanie's defense, and that his addiction to alcohol and painkillers played a role in his bad decision.

She is the daughter of Shawn and Belle Brady and the granddaughter of supercouples Bo and Hope Brady and John and Marlena Black At the time of her birth, it is not known that Shawn was her father. A little after Thanksgiving, Claire becomes sick for an unknown reason.

In a horrible twist of fate, Claire's biological uncle, Zack who was only 5 at the time, dies in a hit-and-run car accident. Zack's liver is a perfect match for little Claire and she receives his liver when he dies. Near her first birthday, the truth about her paternity is revealed.

Willow Stark[edit]

Shawn got Willow a job at Chez Rouge and started dating her after he broke up with his ex-wife Mimi Lockhart.

Weeks later, EJ Wells paid her to break into the Brady home and she accidentally set fire to the place. She planted Chelsea Brady's brush at the scene, but Nick Fallon hid the brush, so she was sent to jail. Once Nick bailed her out, he helped her find a place to live.

Glen Reiber is the biological father of J.T. Brady, who was switched at birth with Zack Brady, resulting in a complicated custody battle.
While watching TV in Chicago, Glen Reiber saw a sketch of a girl whose body had been found frozen in the ice, in the canal behind Bo and Hope Brady's house after their wedding New Year's Eve. He recognized it as Marlo, his former girlfriend, who had left town suddenly while pregnant. The couple went to Salem, identified the sketch, and Glen inquired about the baby Marlo carried.
Though given the runaround by the Carvers, he and Barb found that Marlo gave birth to a boy, in June 2000, and the Carvers had adopted him. Jennifer Deveraux had a car accident resulting in baby J.T. Brady falling into the river, while strapped in Isaac Carver's baby seat (his name was on it). Barb spotted the baby floating, like Moses in the rushes, and they rescued him. Thinking that he is Isaac, the Reibers fled to his aunt's cabin in the hills. Auntie discovered the surgery scar, and when the baby began to have breathing difficulties, Glen and Barb rushed him to the local hospital, but then returned to Salem. They already had a DNA test to prove Glen was the father of Marlo's child.
Although facing kidnapping charges, Bo and Hope only wanted J.T. back safe, and promised not to press charges. The Reibers returned J.T., and went back to Chicago, where the DNA results arrived. Barb read them secretly, realizing Glen was the father of J.T., and not Isaac's father, and went back to Salem to blackmail Lexie Carver. She succeeded in getting several thousand dollars, and then told Glen that she was pregnant with their child, hoping he will not try to search for the truth. Eventually they both returned to Salem and crashed Lexie's party. When Lexie didn't come up with the million dollars, Barb blew the whistle. Glen sought out a slick attorney, Cameron Reese, to sue for custody of J.T. In the ensuing DNA test, it was proven that Glen was J.T.'s father.
After Glen and Barb won custody of J.T., they left Salem, choosing to keep the boy's name the same. They returned to Chicago, where they prepared for the birth of their next child.

Tyler Kiriakis is the son of Philip Kiriakis and Mimi Lockhart. In July 2006, Philip Kiriakis and then-wife Belle Black were planning to have a second child, as were their friends/nephew Shawn-Douglas Brady and his then wife Mimi Lockhart were also plan to have a baby. Both couples planned to use artificial insemination. A gloved hand switched the samples so Belle ended up pregnant with Shawn's baby and Shawn and Mimi's surrogate ended up pregnant with Philip and Mimi's child. It wasn't long until both couples learned the truth that there was a switch in the petri dishes. Philip and Mimi wanted to have both babies aborted but Belle chose not to have her child aborted. Unfortunately, she later had complications and her child was lost. After Shawn and Mimi separated, Mimi signed away their rights to the child and left its fate up to the surrogate mother Lauren Chaffee. Bonnie Lockhart was paying Lauren with the intent to mother the child but Bonnie was sent to jail and Lauren was left to give birth on her own.
Philip and his sister Billie have traced Lauren's steps and now believe that "Pocket" or Ty Johnson, the baby boy being fostered by Kayla Brady and Steve Johnson, is actually Tyler.

Ciara Brady is the daughter of Bo Brady and Hope Brady.
Vivian Jovanni assumed the role of Ciara on October 30, 2015.[8] In December 2016, Jovanni left the show.[9]
While grieving over the death of their young son, Zack, Hope and Bo Brady found comfort in one another, and Ciara is conceived, although it takes several months for Hope to learn she is pregnant. When she eventually learns that she is pregnant, a classic "Who's the daddy?" storyline begins. Hope had been to Morgan Island with Patrick Lockhart where, in a moment of weakness, she had found comfort in his arms.
Tests were run and it was "determined" that Hope's unborn child was Patrick's. Unbeknownst to Hope and Bo, Patrick had paid the doctor to fix the test. Despite believing Patrick to be the father of her unborn child, Bo and Hope get back together, pushing Patrick to the point he decides he needs to kidnap Hope. Ciara was originally born on December 29, 2006 but her birthday was changed to July 16, 2004 then again to March 18, 1998. Ciara was born in a warehouse, delivered by Bo. Patrick reveals her true paternity before being arrested.
Ciara's name was selected by fans in an online poll. Out of the five original choices, narrowed down to three, Ciara Alice Brady was the winner.[10]
Ciara lives with Hope and Bo the first couple of years of her life before living with Hope, Doug and Julie after her mother and father separate for a short while. Ciara's parents have since reunited and separated again.
She has two older brothers, Shawn-Douglas and Zack Brady (deceased) and one older paternal half-sister, Chelsea Brady.

Allie Horton is the daughter of Sami Brady and Lucas Horton. She and her twin, Johnny DiMera, are born October 23, 2007, at her grandmother Marlena's house, where they are delivered by Marlena. Allie goes for several weeks without a name until the Thanksgiving Day wedding of Shawn and Belle, where Lucas announces her name as Alice Caroline Horton, and "Allie" for short. Sami is shocked because she and Lucas haven't yet reached a decision on their baby girl's name, but happily Sami loves the name. Allie is named after her great-grandmothers, Alice Horton and Caroline Brady. Her twin, Johnny DiMera, is her maternal half-brother. Allie has a big brother in Will Horton, and in 2009, she becomes big sister to her new maternal half-sister, Sydney DiMera.
In February 2011, Allie goes to live in Hong Kong with her father Lucas for a while, after the man who is masquerading as her step-father Rafe Hernandez is mean to her several times. She returns after it is revealed that the man is an imposter. Sami and the real Rafe try to help Allie understand what has happened.
In May 2013, Allie becomes an aunt to Arianna Grace Horton (Will's daughter with Gabi Hernandez), and in April 2014 when Will gets married, Allie gains a brother-in-law in Sonny Kiriakis.
In May 2014, Allie is walking into the Horton Town Square with Jordan Ridgeway when she sees her favorite cousin Nick Fallon, who has been shot multiple times and is bleeding from the chest, stumble into the square and collapse. Allie screams and is the first person to notice him. Afterwards, she cannot stop looking at him despite her parents' attempts to get her to look away; and when Nick dies shortly after, she is traumatized by his death.
In October 2014, Allie moves with Sami, Johnny and Sydney, to live in California.

Johnny DiMera is the son of EJ DiMera and Sami Brady, and the maternal half-twin of Allie Horton. Johnny has an older maternal half-brother in Will Horton, and in 2009 he gains a full sister in Sydney DiMera. In 2013, Johnny becomes an uncle to Will's daughter Arianna Horton. With a full name of John Roman DiMera, Johnny is named after his mom's dad and step-dad, Roman Brady and John Black.
Johnny is born with Allie on October 23, 2007. He is originally believed, like Allie, to be the son of Lucas Horton, but after the birth, EJ begins to suspect that the twins might have different fathers because Johnny does not look like his sister, and EJ thinks Johnny looks like himself. A second DNA test confirms EJ to be Johnny's father.
After witnessing a murder, Johnny's mom Sami is taken into protection by the federal government as a vulnerable witness. Whilst in witness protection, Sami allows Johnny to live with EJ and his wife Nicole Walker, in the DiMera mansion, with Johnny's paternal grandfather, Stefano DiMera. When Sami is released from witness protection, Johnny returns to live with Sami. However, Stefano insists that EJ raises Johnny as a DiMera, against Sami's wishes. EJ first resists this notion because he does not want to betray his ex-wife; but when he hears that Sami's youngest daughter, whom Sami says she adopted, is his daughter and that Sami gave birth to her whilst in witness protection and hid this from him, EJ is furious with Sami, and he agrees to raise Johnny as a DiMera against his ex-wife's wishes. After much heartache and drama, including Johnny suffering from eye-cancer (from which he eventually makes a full recovery), EJ and Sami become co-operative co-parents, and eventually marry again; but then Johnny's dad EJ is shot dead in a conflict with the villainous Clyde Weston.
After losing his dad, Johnny goes with his mom and sisters to live in Los Angeles.

Ford Decker[edit]
Ford Decker was a student at Salem University who was a serial date rapist. When his father Crawford, used his influence to protect Ford from being punished for drugging and raping numerous female students, the sisters of Alpha Chi Theta decided to take action. The women, who included three of Ford's victims or attempted victims, drugged him. When the partially incapacitated Ford then pursued Chelsea, whom he had also drugged, up the stairs of the sorority house, he lost consciousness and suffered a fatal fall down the stairs. The sisters buried his body in the basement. Subsequently, Chelsea Brady and Stephanie Johnson dug him back up and hid him in a water heater, which Max Brady removed from the premises.
Richard Baker[edit]
Richard Baker, played by John Callahan (2008–2009; 2010),[11] is a doctor Nicole blackmails into posing as her OB/GYN while she fakes pregnancy after miscarrying her baby. Though he claims to have altruistic motives in the running of his free clinic, he's involved in shady black market baby brokering in order to pay off his substantial debts, a fact Nicole uses to her advantage. He frequently goes to Nicole for money in exchange for keeping her secret until he is murdered by men Stefano DiMera hires. Stefano also attempts to frame Rafe Hernandez for the murder. In his last frugal efforts to tell Sami and Mia about the baby switch, he writes each of them a letter, both of which are destroyed by Nicole. However, it is discovered that he faked his death and later returns to Salem. He helps Hope, who under the influence of sleeping pills, mugs the men of Salem. He was caught and send to prison for helping Nicole switch babies and stealing money.

Daniel Jonas first appeared on March 4, 2008, being portrayed by actor, Shawn Christian. Christian initially signed a one-year contract, but he has since signed on for an extended stay.[12] Following a fatal car crash caused by Eric Brady's drunk-driving, the character was written into a coma on January 4, 2016. On January 6, 2016, the character was killed off after being taken off life support when his heart was donated to Brady Black. Christian reprised the role thereafter during a dream sequence with Nicole Walker on February 12, 2016, during another dream sequence months later with Chloe Lane on November 3, 2016, and yet another dream sequence with Nicole Walker on December 12, 2016 - declaring his love for her as well as his encouragement for her to move on with her life. Christian made more reprisals in 2017, once on January 27, 2017, once in May 2017, and a final appearance as an apparition to Eric Brady and Nicole Walker on June 28, 2017.
Before arriving in Salem, Dr. Jonas worked at various hospitals around the world. Many years ago, he had an affair with Carly Manning, who later introduced him to Rebecca, a cancer patient with whom Daniel fell in love. Although Rebecca's prognosis was grim, Daniel married her anyway and was determined to save her. Rebecca's cancer proved to be too advanced and she died in Daniel's arms. Upon his arrival in Salem, Daniel has romances with Chelsea Brady and her grandmother Kate Roberts. In early 2010, Carly tells Daniel that Melanie Layton is their daughter. Daniel and Melanie bond quickly, and eventually forgive Carly for keeping them apart. After a drunken one night stand with Melanie's husband, Philip Kiriakis, Daniel's fiancée Chloe Lane becomes pregnant, and is unsure if Daniel or Philip is the father. She is relieved when a paternity test shows Daniel as the child's father. Daniel and Chloe name their son Parker, after Daniel's mother. At Parker's christening, Caroline Brady reveals that she switched the paternity test to keep Melanie from leaving Philip for her granddaughter Stephanie Johnson's boyfriend Nathan Horton. Daniel ends his marriage to Chloe.
Daniel soon finds happiness with Jennifer Horton, but their happiness is short-lived as Jennifer's ex, Jack Deveraux returns to town. Eventually Jennifer reunites with Jack and Daniel finds comfort with a pregnant Nicole Walker. He also learns that Maggie Horton is his biological mother. Daniel helps Nicole fix her child's paternity test, claiming the baby is Rafe Hernandez's, even though it is EJ DiMera's. As Nicole grows attached to Daniel, Jack dies and Daniel and Jennifer reunite. Nicole loses her baby, but keeps it a secret, wanting to hold onto Daniel. When Nicole falls down the stairs after a fight with Jennifer, and gives birth to a stillborn son, she blames Jennifer. Eventually the truth comes out and Daniel and Jennifer once again reunite. EJ confronts Daniel for keeping his son away from him saying he will not retaliate because of Daniel's previous help with his other son Johnny but warns Daniel not to cross him again.
On January 7, 2013, Chloe returns to Salem with the news that Daniel is really Parker's father.
On December 31, 2015, Daniel and Brady Black are driving in car returning to the Basic Black launch of product line because Brady forgot a gift for Theresa, during this time Eric Brady decides to drive himself while being intoxicated causes a car crash which injures several major Salem Residents including, Dr. Daniel Jonas, Brady Black, Eric Brady, and Jennifer Horton.
On January 4, 2016, Daniel was pronounced dead to the injuries from the accident, as an organ donor, Kayla asks Maggie to allow for Daniel to donate his heart to either Eric or Brady. On January 6, 2016, Daniel is taken off life-support with Maggie's consent and his heart is donated to Brady Black.

Mia McCormick[edit]
Mia McCormick (played by Taylor Spreitler from January 6, 2009 – June 23, 2010), is a high school drop-out, who was introduced as a pregnant teenager. Nicole Walker bought her baby, Grace, for $10K to replace her own, secretly miscarried, baby. She then secretly swaps Grace for Sami Brady's baby, Sydney, who was born at the same time (January 28, 2009). Grace eventually dies of bacterial meningitis. Mia uses the money to fund a dancing career in Japan but when this fails she returns to Salem, determined to get her baby back. She then befriends Will Horton, moves in with Maggie Horton and takes a job at Java Cafe. Her ex-boyfriend Chad DiMera, father of Grace, also has a job at Java Cafe. After overhearing information and investigating, he discovers what had happened to his daughter, although neither Chad nor Mia initially knew about Sydney and Grace being switched. Mia eventually finds out that Grace was her biological daughter, and she and Chad mourn her. Meanwhile, Mia is attracted to, and dates, Will but is forced to break up by Chad in her efforts to keep her deal with Nicole secret. Chad, however, breaks his promise to stop looking for Grace. Will eventually learns all of this; he is surprised but thinks it all makes sense that Nicole can give the baby a better home.

Grace Brady is the biological daughter of a young teenage mother, Mia McCormick and her ex-boyfriend Chad DiMera, then Peterson-Woods, born on-screen on January 27, 2009, but she was believed to be the biological daughter of E.J. DiMera and Sami Brady. It wasn't until November 12, 2009 when Rafe Hernandez revealed the truth that Sami Brady knew she wasn't Grace's birth mother.
Sami Brady and Nicole Walker were both pregnant with E.J. DiMera's babies. Nicole miscarried but pretended to still be pregnant. She planned to adopt Mia McCormick's baby and pass it off as hers with E.J. When Mia and Sami gave birth to girls on the same day, in the same medical clinic, almost at the same time, Nicole switched Sami's baby with Mia's baby (Nicole helped deliver Mia's baby), so that she and E.J. would raise a child that was biologically his.
Sami, who was forced to enter the witness protection program during her pregnancy, decided to protect her child from the DiMeras by never telling E.J. about their baby. As a result, she left Grace at a convent orphanage. On March 30, 2009, Sami brought Grace home to Salem telling everybody she was her "adopted" daughter. The same day she made Rafe, her former bodyguard turned boyfriend, Grace's godfather. The baby was christened Grace Rafaela; Grace in honor of the convent and what Sami perceived as God's intervention in helping her to have and keep her baby, and Rafaela in honor of Rafe.
Grace died on June 9, 2009 from bacterial meningitis. Grace's parents, Sami Brady and Rafe Hernandez, were at her bedside when she died. She had also been held on that day by her biological mother, Mia. On June 11, 2009 Sami revealed to E.J. that he was "Grace's biological father," still unaware that the baby she had raised was not genetically theirs.

Sydney DiMera is the daughter of EJ DiMera and Sami Brady. Sydney is born in secret on January 28, 2009,[13] while her mother is in witness protection, and she is switched shortly after birth with the daughter of a teenage mother, Mia, who has agreed to give her baby up for adoption to Nicole Walker. Nicole, who has miscarried her fiancé E.J.'s daughter, has arranged in secret to adopt Mia's baby and pass the child off as E.J.'s, fearful that she would lose EJ without a baby.
When Nicole learns that Sami had just recently given birth to her and E.J.'s daughter the same day Mia gave birth to hers, Nicole switches the babies, preferring to have E.J.'s biological daughter over an unrelated child. Nicole instantly bonds with Sydney, and vows to always protect her no matter what happens. Sami and E.J. are none the wiser to Nicole's treachery, and Sami and Rafe bond with "Sami's" daughter, while EJ and Nicole bond with "their" daughter.
E.J. eventually learns that Nicole had a miscarriage and he kicks Nicole and Sydney out of the mansion, not knowing the truth about Sydney. Eventually, Sami also learns that Sydney is her biological daughter. Soon after, E.J. learns that Sydney is his biological child with Sami. However, the family reunion turns into a nightmare when Brady Black bails Nicole out of jail and she kidnaps Sydney. Nicole has a change of heart and decides to tell E.J. and Sami where Sydney is, but she is knocked out by Anna DiMera, who takes Sydney. It is later revealed that Anna was hired by E.J. to kidnap Sydney.
Sydney becomes the subject of many custody battles between E.J. and Sami over the next few years, with Nicole involved, as well, during the time she is married to E.J. They later come to an agreement, though, and Sydney is able to stay with her entire family, including her siblings, Johnny, Allie Horton, and Will Horton. Sydney became an aunt when Gabi Hernandez gave birth to Will's daughter, Arianna Horton.

Jonas Daniel Meijer - Wikipedia






















 






Jonas Daniel Meijer

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





J.D. Meijer in 1830 by Louis Moritz, Rijksmuseum






Jonas Daniël Meijerplein (nl) in Amsterdam


Jonas Daniel Meijer (15 September 1780 – 6 December 1834) was the first Jewish lawyer in the Netherlands. He has had a significant impact on Dutch law, and is also known for his battle for (legal) emancipation of the Dutch Jews.
The Jonas Daniel Meijerplein, a square in Amsterdam (where Meijer died), was named after him. Bordering the square are the Esnoga and four former synagogues, now together home of the Joods Historisch Museum (Jewish Historical Museum). The Dokwerker monument on Jonas Daniel Meijerplein commemorates the February strike of 1941, a general strike by many (non-Jewish) people of Amsterdam and surrounding cities after the arrest and deportation of 425 Jewish men from Amsterdam to Mauthausen and Buchenwald following a clash between Nazi police and two Jewish men a couple of days earlier.
Early life[edit]
Jonas Daniel Meijer was born into a well-to-do Jewish family at Arnhem. His maternal grandfather was Benjamin Cohen (July or August 1725 – 10 February 1800), a well-known businessman and Jewish teacher, and a friend and supporter of stadtholder Willem V. The Cohen family were tobacco traders, and had connections to prominent European Jewish families. Meijer's father was a German Jew, who hailed from the city of Hamburg. Jonas Daniel Meijer had one brother and one sister, Abraham David (8 October 1781 – 17 March 1864) and Eva (15 October 1782 – 18 December 1850).
At a startling young age, Jonas learned to read and was taught French and English by a private teacher. Although he was brought up with Hebrew as the liturgical language of his religion, Jonas also managed to learn Latin at the age of 5. After completing his school quite early, Meijer started to study Law in Amsterdam, where he moved with his mother and siblings after the death of his father in 1790. On 15 November 1796, at the age of just 16, Jonas Daniel Meijer took the lawyer's oath, becoming the first Jewish lawyer and one of the youngest lawyers in the history of the Netherlands. Despite his talents, he received only few customers, as many Christians avoided him. The small practice however gave Meijer ample chance of increasing his law expertise, specifically by studying the law of many countries, earning him fame across the European continent.
Publications[edit]
Meijer received international fame through his publication Kan de zedelijke waardering van een handeling in aanmerking komen bij de vaststelling en toepassing van een strafwet en zo ja, in hoeverre (1803). In this work, Meijer is one of the first to question the extent to the which living conditions and mental well-being of a criminal cause his felony. Meijer researched the possibility of such outcome because of his acquaintance with financial and social positions of his fellow Jews, that made him understand why some of them would, for example, steal a bread.
Jonas Daniel Meijer died on 6 December 1834 at the age of 54, in Amsterdam.

J.D. Meijer in 1830 by Louis Moritz, Rijksmuseum






Jonas Daniël Meijerplein (nl) in Amsterdam


Jonas Daniel Meijer (15 September 1780 – 6 December 1834) was the first Jewish lawyer in the Netherlands. He has had a significant impact on Dutch law, and is also known for his battle for (legal) emancipation of the Dutch Jews.
The Jonas Daniel Meijerplein, a square in Amsterdam (where Meijer died), was named after him. Bordering the square are the Esnoga and four former synagogues, now together home of the Joods Historisch Museum (Jewish Historical Museum). The Dokwerker monument on Jonas Daniel Meijerplein commemorates the February strike of 1941, a general strike by many (non-Jewish) people of Amsterdam and surrounding cities after the arrest and deportation of 425 Jewish men from Amsterdam to Mauthausen and Buchenwald following a clash between Nazi police and two Jewish men a couple of days earlier.
Early life[edit]
Jonas Daniel Meijer was born into a well-to-do Jewish family at Arnhem. His maternal grandfather was Benjamin Cohen (July or August 1725 – 10 February 1800), a well-known businessman and Jewish teacher, and a friend and supporter of stadtholder Willem V. The Cohen family were tobacco traders, and had connections to prominent European Jewish families. Meijer's father was a German Jew, who hailed from the city of Hamburg. Jonas Daniel Meijer had one brother and one sister, Abraham David (8 October 1781 – 17 March 1864) and Eva (15 October 1782 – 18 December 1850).
At a startling young age, Jonas learned to read and was taught French and English by a private teacher. Although he was brought up with Hebrew as the liturgical language of his religion, Jonas also managed to learn Latin at the age of 5. After completing his school quite early, Meijer started to study Law in Amsterdam, where he moved with his mother and siblings after the death of his father in 1790. On 15 November 1796, at the age of just 16, Jonas Daniel Meijer took the lawyer's oath, becoming the first Jewish lawyer and one of the youngest lawyers in the history of the Netherlands. Despite his talents, he received only few customers, as many Christians avoided him. The small practice however gave Meijer ample chance of increasing his law expertise, specifically by studying the law of many countries, earning him fame across the European continent.
Publications[edit]
Meijer received international fame through his publication Kan de zedelijke waardering van een handeling in aanmerking komen bij de vaststelling en toepassing van een strafwet en zo ja, in hoeverre (1803). In this work, Meijer is one of the first to question the extent to the which living conditions and mental well-being of a criminal cause his felony. Meijer researched the possibility of such outcome because of his acquaintance with financial and social positions of his fellow Jews, that made him understand why some of them would, for example, steal a bread.
Jonas Daniel Meijer died on 6 December 1834 at the age of 54, in Amsterdam.
