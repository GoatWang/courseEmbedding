Ugh, where to start with this scumbag company?! How about just the most recent debacle. I was buying a new condo and let them know the date I needed my service switched. The closing date ended up being pushed back by the mortgage company, and we were left homeless for over a month - bouncing from hotel to hotel while dealing with busy times for both of us at work. The then-owner of the condo let LG&E know when the actual, final closing date was approaching that they needed to switch the service from her name on that date. Instead, they have decided for months now to leave her final month of service on my bill, and refuse (despite complaints to the PWC, Attorney General, etc) to remove it and bill it to the correct party. And now they are threatening disconnection because I have not paid (and will not pay) the previous owner's bill. Completely and totally rude (and incompetent and illegal) scumbags.

Ugh, where to start with this scumbag company?! How about just the most recent debacle. I was buying a new condo and let them know the date I needed my service switched. The closing date ended up being pushed back by the mortgage company, and we were left homeless for over a month - bouncing from hotel to hotel while dealing with busy times for both of us at work. The then-owner of the condo let LG&E know when the actual, final closing date was approaching that they needed to switch the service from her name on that date. Instead, they have decided for months now to leave her final month of service on my bill, and refuse (despite complaints to the PWC, Attorney General, etc) to remove it and bill it to the correct party. And now they are threatening disconnection because I have not paid (and will not pay) the previous owner's bill. Completely and totally rude (and incompetent and illegal) scumbags.

Ugh, where to start with this scumbag company?! How about just the most recent debacle. I was buying a new condo and let them know the date I needed my service switched. The closing date ended up being pushed back by the mortgage company, and we were left homeless for over a month - bouncing from hotel to hotel while dealing with busy times for both of us at work. The then-owner of the condo let LG&E know when the actual, final closing date was approaching that they needed to switch the service from her name on that date. Instead, they have decided for months now to leave her final month of service on my bill, and refuse (despite complaints to the PWC, Attorney General, etc) to remove it and bill it to the correct party. And now they are threatening disconnection because I have not paid (and will not pay) the previous owner's bill. Completely and totally rude (and incompetent and illegal) scumbags.

Ugh, where to start with this scumbag company?! How about just the most recent debacle. I was buying a new condo and let them know the date I needed my service switched. The closing date ended up being pushed back by the mortgage company, and we were left homeless for over a month - bouncing from hotel to hotel while dealing with busy times for both of us at work. The then-owner of the condo let LG&E know when the actual, final closing date was approaching that they needed to switch the service from her name on that date. Instead, they have decided for months now to leave her final month of service on my bill, and refuse (despite complaints to the PWC, Attorney General, etc) to remove it and bill it to the correct party. And now they are threatening disconnection because I have not paid (and will not pay) the previous owner's bill. Completely and totally rude (and incompetent and illegal) scumbags.

Ugh, where to start with this scumbag company?! How about just the most recent debacle. I was buying a new condo and let them know the date I needed my service switched. The closing date ended up being pushed back by the mortgage company, and we were left homeless for over a month - bouncing from hotel to hotel while dealing with busy times for both of us at work. The then-owner of the condo let LG&E know when the actual, final closing date was approaching that they needed to switch the service from her name on that date. Instead, they have decided for months now to leave her final month of service on my bill, and refuse (despite complaints to the PWC, Attorney General, etc) to remove it and bill it to the correct party. And now they are threatening disconnection because I have not paid (and will not pay) the previous owner's bill. Completely and totally rude (and incompetent and illegal) scumbags.

Ugh, where to start with this scumbag company?! How about just the most recent debacle. I was buying a new condo and let them know the date I needed my service switched. The closing date ended up being pushed back by the mortgage company, and we were left homeless for over a month - bouncing from hotel to hotel while dealing with busy times for both of us at work. The then-owner of the condo let LG&E know when the actual, final closing date was approaching that they needed to switch the service from her name on that date. Instead, they have decided for months now to leave her final month of service on my bill, and refuse (despite complaints to the PWC, Attorney General, etc) to remove it and bill it to the correct party. And now they are threatening disconnection because I have not paid (and will not pay) the previous owner's bill. Completely and totally rude (and incompetent and illegal) scumbags.

Ugh, where to start with this scumbag company?! How about just the most recent debacle. I was buying a new condo and let them know the date I needed my service switched. The closing date ended up being pushed back by the mortgage company, and we were left homeless for over a month - bouncing from hotel to hotel while dealing with busy times for both of us at work. The then-owner of the condo let LG&E know when the actual, final closing date was approaching that they needed to switch the service from her name on that date. Instead, they have decided for months now to leave her final month of service on my bill, and refuse (despite complaints to the PWC, Attorney General, etc) to remove it and bill it to the correct party. And now they are threatening disconnection because I have not paid (and will not pay) the previous owner's bill. Completely and totally rude (and incompetent and illegal) scumbags.

Ugh, where to start with this scumbag company?! How about just the most recent debacle. I was buying a new condo and let them know the date I needed my service switched. The closing date ended up being pushed back by the mortgage company, and we were left homeless for over a month - bouncing from hotel to hotel while dealing with busy times for both of us at work. The then-owner of the condo let LG&E know when the actual, final closing date was approaching that they needed to switch the service from her name on that date. Instead, they have decided for months now to leave her final month of service on my bill, and refuse (despite complaints to the PWC, Attorney General, etc) to remove it and bill it to the correct party. And now they are threatening disconnection because I have not paid (and will not pay) the previous owner's bill. Completely and totally rude (and incompetent and illegal) scumbags.
