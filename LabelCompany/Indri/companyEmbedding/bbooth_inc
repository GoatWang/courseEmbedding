The digital advertising industry is forecast to see substantial growth over the next several years, thanks to continued growth in mobile computing and social media usage. According to Statista.com, the entire U.S. digital advertising market is forecast to see total revenue of $80.18 billion in 2016. By 2021, Statista analysts predict the U.S. digital advertising market will be pulling in $116.1 billion in total revenue.
Source: Statista.com
The analysts still see search advertising making-up the bulk of digital advertising revenues from 2016 through 2021. However, search advertising represents the least amount of revenue growth during that time period. The highest revenue growth over this period can be found in video and social media advertising methods.
Furthermore, the Statista report on the U.S. digital advertising industry forecasts that digital advertising revenue from mobile platforms will top advertising revenues from desktop/laptop platforms for the first time ever in 2017. By 2021, Statista forecasts digital ad revenue from mobile will account for $71.46 billion, compared to desktop/laptop ad revenue of $44.62 billion.
Source: Statista.com
One company that stands to not only benefit from this industry growth, but also from taking a niche entertainment approach, is bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH).
Overview: bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH)
Hollywood, California-based bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH) is an entertainment technology company. Through the company’s bNotifi technology, bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH) is the first company able to deliver direct “push-to-screen,” interactive video messaging and advertising content to mobile and desktop screens world-wide. This technology is great for consumer brands looking for more effective ways to engage their customers, or for music artists seeking to interact with their fans and promote their latest tracks or upcoming concerts.
Due to the interactive nature of the technology, brands, artists, and sales pros can now push ecommerce opportunities directly to their consumers’ screens assertively – instead of waiting passively for consumers to visit a website or click on a social media ad. Aside from consumer brands and music artists, celebrities, corporations, governments, schools, health care providers, and even Presidential Candidates, could find bNotifi to be the most effective messaging, brand activation, lead generation, and consumer engagement tool available today.

bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH) is effectively creating a niche “push” advertising company that can increase user engagement for consumer branding and activation initiatives. The bNotifi platform also serves as an effective sales lead generation tool for clients that utilize the technology. Unlike most app companies that need to wait for users to download their app, the company is deploying a brilliant marketing strategy. The company offers bNotifi as a white-labeled product, which is compatible with all mobile devices and desktop computers. The technology is easily integrated into the applications and platforms of clients that already have a large user/consumer or fan base. In other words, experiencing the bNotifi service is simple: the next time you download an update for some of your favorite apps and programs, bNotifi may be embedded in it. And with its licensing and per user monthly subscription-based pricing models, bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH) is well positioned for impressive revenue growth.
“Experiencing” bNotifi technology is really the operative word. Imagine browsing for sunglasses on Amazon (not yet a client) and then seeing Nick Cannon come walking-out onto your screen, in a 3D-like image, and telling you about the hottest styles, trying them on and modeling them for you (all without interrupting your browsing). Nick then tells you to click on the glasses he’s wearing – and bam – you just purchased them. In fact, how about if Nick Cannon, or any other artist or celebrity walked-out onto your screen, without your browser being open. Then the celebrity opens your browser to take you to a website for the latest news or information you opted-in to bNotified about. THAT is what’s so exciting about this technology. That’s assertive technology.
And by the way, Nick Cannon is actually part of the management team: Chief Strategy Officer and Global Brand Ambassador and a major shareholder of bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH).
“bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB:BBTH)’s groundbreaking bNotifi push-to-screen technology literally brings a person (celebrity, music artist, brand spokesperson, etc.) or a product to life, directly on the screens of fans’ computers, tablets and mobile devices around the globe. bBooth’s unprecedented, interactive technology is the new platform for content creation and distribution, artist promotion, fan engagement and brand activation. With an increasing list of clientele including major consumer brands, corporations, music artists and celebrities, bBooth is positioned to become Hollywood’s thriving, elite entertainment technology company.”
Source: bBooth.com
Aside from its bNotifi video advertising platform, bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH) also offers its bBooth kiosks. The bBooth kiosk is a unique form of “experiential entertainment” for truly interactive, in-your-face brand activations. The kiosks are shaped like a giant smartphone and have built-in cameras and mics. This allows users to record themselves singing karaoke or interacting with a brand right in a store or at the mall. Then with a tap on its huge touchscreen display, users can share their videos (and stills or GIFs) across their favorite social media, with an advertiser’s branding embedded. The kiosks are so cool and engaging that AMERICAN IDOL deployed bBooth’s kiosks in shopping malls to handle the auditions for the show’s farewell season. You’ll see them on other TV shows this fall.
Through its bNotifi technology and its bBooth kiosks, bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH) is positioned for strong growth over the coming years. Management is forecasting full-year 2017 gross revenues of $49.69 million, full-year 2018 gross revenues of $143.62 million, and full-year 2019 gross revenues of $282.75 million. 
BBTH Star Power: Nick Cannon and Frank Thomas
bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH) is not only well-positioned within the high-growth market of digital advertising, but the company has added an important entertainment factor that will help the company break-out from the rest of the pack. The platform is impressive and its ability to deliver higher levels of user-engagement makes it a must-have for businesses that are interested in advertising services that break through the noise.
In addition to producer, writer, director, actor, entrepreneur, and shareholder Nick Cannon, the company’s Chief Strategy Officer and Global Brand Ambassador, bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH) has also attracted Major League Baseball Hall of Famer, Frank Thomas, who serves on the company’s advisory board.
Source: pbs.twimg.com
The star power that Nick Cannon and Frank Thomas bring to bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH) is enormous. bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH)’s technology is already impressive, innovative and state-of-the-art, but with two big celebrities on-board, it only adds to the potential. The connections to the entertainment, music, and sports industries that Nick Cannon and Frank Thomas bring, not only opens the door to greater brand awareness and recognition for bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH), but also to greater revenue opportunities.
For instance, imagine Peyton Manning walking-out on your screen with a “chicken parm” and advertising Nationwide Insurance services – and then walking-you through filling-out the application right there on your screen! Another example could be Taylor Swift coming out onto your screen thanking you for being a fan and promoting her upcoming concerts, just after you listened to one of her songs on a streaming music service. Maybe even Adam Sandler walking-out onto your computer screen while browsing movies on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) and having him promote his next Netflix Original. The possibilities and examples for how bNotifi can be used effectively to engage – not just reach – fans, followers, and target audiences, are endless.
“Imagine being able to communicate your message directly to the screens of your customers, distributors, team members, fans, and followers – in a media-rich interactive video format, where the message is delivered by someone who appears to walk right out onto the desktop and mobile screens of your recipients – all without your recipients having to open a web browser or other mobile or desktop program,” – Nick Cannon, bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH)’s Chief Strategy Officer.
This…  is bNotifi!

BBTH: Industry and Financial Analysis
Now we will take a look at bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH)’s financial and industry analysis. This new entertainment technology company already has a market cap of more than $12 million, as of September 19, 2016. Furthermore, bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH) has a share structure consisting of 200 million authorized shares, 78.7 million shares issued and outstanding, and a float consisting of only 17.63 million shares, as of July 2016.
bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH) also boasts margin efficiency, with projected EBITDA margins near 72%, and no toxic debt on its balance sheet. With its bNotifi product launch just underway, and a full sales-pipeline of high-margin recurring revenue opportunities, the company is well-positioned for a strong 2017, with management forecasting full-year gross revenues of nearly $49.69 million.

While there are no direct competitors to bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH) able to deliver bNotifi’s level of “engaging, direct-to-user, interactive experience,” there are other companies that engage in web advertising and marketing. Constant Contact is a major email marketing company that was founded in 1998 and was a big player in internet marketing and advertising. In November 2015, Endurance International Group Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: EIGI) purchased Constant Contact for $1.1 billion. Email marketing is an older technology that certainly is effective, but bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH)’s software-as-a-service platform is the next generation of internet advertising, marketing, and brand awareness. Here are five companies that are engaged in web advertising, software-as-a-service, or music streaming, all of whom could benefit from bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH)’s technology:
Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: EIGI) engages in small and medium-size business solutions, ranging from search engine marketing and email marketing, to cloud solutions and productivity tools. As previously mentioned, Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: EIGI) purchased Constant Contact in 2015 for $1.1 billion. As of September 2016, Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: EIGI) has a market cap value of $1.16 billion, 133.57 million shares outstanding, and a float of 80.83 million shares. During the second quarter of 2016, the company reported total revenue of $290.71 million, but a net loss of $28.04 million.
Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE: OMC) is a holding company that provides advertising services, marketing and enterprise communications solutions. The company operates four main businesses: advertising, customer relationship management (CRM), specialty communications, and public relations. Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE: OMC) has a market cap of just over $20 billion, 236.54 million shares outstanding, and a float consisting of 235.2 million shares, as of September 2016. During the second quarter 2016, Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE: OMC) reported total revenue of $3.88 billion and net income of $326.1 million.
Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE: CRM) is engaged in enterprise cloud computing services and provides an extensive cloud software product line that helps businesses manage customer relationships, sales automation, customer service, support, analytics, application development, Internet of Things (IoT) integration, enterprise services, and more. The software-as-a-service company has a market cap value of $50.13 billion, shares outstanding of 677.5 million, and a float consisting of 646.44 million shares. During Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE: CRM)’s fiscal second quarter ending on July 31st, the cloud company reported total revenue of $2.04 billion and net income of $229.62 million.
Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a holding company that houses Google Inc. and its vast network of subsidiaries. Google’s rise to fame and original roots are firmly in internet search and advertising. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has since expanded vastly into other areas such as virtual reality, venture capital, Nest, Android, etc. Search and internet advertising still remain a vital part of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL)’s overall earnings, but its portfolio of advertising solutions has since expanded to YouTube, Android, and Google Play. As of September 2016, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has a market cap value of $550.7 billion, 294.84 million shares outstanding, and a float consisting of 294.05 million shares. During the second quarter 2016, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) reported total revenue of $21.5 billion and net income of $4.9 billion.
Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) engages in the design, manufacture, distribution, programming, and marketing of personal computers, media devices, software, cloud services, music streaming and downloading, etc. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)’s Apple Music streaming platform is finally beginning to see popularity increase, after a very slow start. However, Spotify continues to be the leader of the music streaming industry. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), among others on this list, would be a perfect candidate to utilize bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH)’s advertising and direct-to-user solutions. Imagine after listening to a Taylor Swift song on Apple Music, Taylor walks-out onto your device’s screen and thanks you for listening to her music. In addition, Taylor could say “Click here to purchase tickets for my upcoming concert in your hometown,” or “Click here to purchase, or for information about my new line of make-up,” providing a level of fan engagement and merchandising capabilities no other streaming service could offer. This direct-to-user approach allows for more engaging and effective marketing to fans, and substantially greater revenue opportunities not only for Apple, but for the artists as well.
As of September 2016, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has a market cap value of $622.7 billion, 5.4 billion shares outstanding, and a float consisting of 5.37 billion shares. During Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)’s fiscal second quarter, ending on June 25th, the technology company reported total revenue of $42.36 billion and net income of $7.8 billion.
In our view, bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH) is the next generation of direct-to-consumer marketing and advertising. No other company has technology that comes close to bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH)’s proprietary bNotifi technology, which combines entertainment and powerful branding, merchandising, and lead generation capabilities. With Nick Cannon as bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH)’s Chief Strategy Officer, and Baseball Hall of Famer, Frank Thomas on the company’s Advisory Board, this entertainment technology company carries heavy celebrity firepower that will help it expand further into the entertainment and sports verticals. This all translates to strong earnings growth forecasts. Management is forecasting full-year 2017 gross revenue of $49.7 million, full-year 2018 gross revenue of $143.62 million, and full-year 2019 gross revenue of $282.8 million.
The bottom line is that bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH) is a unique, niche marketing and advertising company with a disruptive just-launched next-generation technology that may indeed be the most effective messaging, brand activation, consumer engagement, and lead generation tool for years to come. www.bbooth.com

bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH) This Disruptive CRM Company can Dominate its $37 Billion Industry   April 20, 2017   http://emerginggrowth.com/bbooth-inc-otcqb-bbth-this-disruptive-crm-company-can-dominate-its-37-billion-industry/   If You could go Back and Buy SalesForce.com at $3.00, would You?   Customer relationship management or “CRM” refers to the practice, strategy and ultimately the technology that both corporations, and individuals use to manage and analyze interactions with prospective customers, with the goal of not only converting them to, but also maintaining them as clients.   There are many companies providing CRM software, and while they all tend to do things a little bit different, they’re all designed to compile data across different channels, ranging from managing basic contact information, to tracking social media posts which is designed to give the sales person an ice breaker to a conversation with a prospect or client. Some of the players in the space such as Zendesk, Inc. (NYSE: ZEN) and Pegasystems, Inc. (NASDAQ: PEGA), offer free trials, with services running upwards of $200.00 per month per user. Starting at that rate, you’ll find HubSpot, Inc.’s (NYSE: HUBS) basic services while SalesForce.com, Inc.’s (NYSE: CRM) “Unlimited Edition” will take you up to $300.00 per month.   In the end, they are all great tracking tools. The help management keep track of their sales people, and their sales people keep track of their prospects and clients. For the most part however, they focus more on sales team management and reporting, like email and phone call activity, and when to follow up, than actual selling.   Enter bBooth, Inc. (OTCQB: BBTH). bBooth has reinvented what a CRM, Lead-Generation tool should be in today’s video-centric social environment. Their service is built around their proprietary “Video-First” bNotifi technology, which places interactive video front and center in all customer and prospect communications. This is the missing piece to the CRM puzzle and bBooth is capitalizing on it.   During its incubation, bBooth CEO, Rory J. Cutaia didn’t set out to create another CRM product. He set out to re-invent what a CRM product should be, and has been recently named CEO of the Month by CIO Review, while bBooth, Inc. was named among the 20 most promising CRM solution providers for 2017 alongside the major, multi-billion dollar names in the industry mentioned above. But bBooth has something that none of the others have; bNotify.   bNotify is a land grab, but for the real estate on the screens of computers and mobile devices. In the battle for engagement of customers, consumers, members, and followers, bNotify is a powerful weapon. It is the first of its kind, “push to screen” technology which allows its users to push content of any kind, including text, graphics, photos, videos, and bBooth’s own propriety walk out style videos of which you can see examples of here. Most importantly, bNotify is interactive. You can now embed ecommerce capability, forms and documents that need completion, and so much more, right inside the videos, eliminating the need to open an attachment, complete, save, re-attach and send.   Are you hosting an event in your area? Select the audience and push it to their screen. They can RSVP, and even choose their main course with one click in the video.   Are you announcing a new product? Or entire product line? Push it to all your customers’ screens! Weather on mobile or desktop, there is no longer a need for a browser.

	Cutaia Media Group, LLC ("CMG") was a limited liability company formed on December 12, 2012 under the laws of the State of Nevada.  On May 19, 2014, bBooth, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada.  On May 19, 2014, CMG was merged into bBooth, Inc. pursuant to a Plan of Merger unanimously approved by the members of CMG.  On October 17, 2014, bBooth, Inc. changed the name of its operating company to bBooth (USA), Inc. ("bBooth").  The operations of CMG and bBooth are collectively referred to as the "Company".





	On October 16, 2014, the Company completed a Share Exchange Agreement with Global System Designs, Inc. ("GSD").  In connection with the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, all of GSD's prior management resigned and were replaced by management nominated by the Company, and shareholders of the Company were issued shares of GSD common stock that constituted approximately 83% of GSD's issued and outstanding shares at the closing date. As a result, the Share Exchange Agreement has been treated as a reverse merger transaction, with the Company as the acquirer for accounting purposes. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that are reflected in these financial statements for periods ended prior to the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement are those of bBooth.





	In connection with the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, GSD changed its name to bBooth, Inc.


	 


	Nature of Business


	 


	The Company is engaged in the manufacture and operation of Internet connected, broadcast-quality portable recording studios, branded and marketed as "bBooth," which are integrated into a social media, messaging, gaming, music streaming and video sharing app. The bBooth portable television studios are in the process of being deployed to shopping malls and other high-traffic venues in the United States.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES








	Basis of Presentation





	The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014, which has been derived from the Company's audited financial statements as of that date, and the unaudited condensed consolidated financial information of the Company as of June 30, 2015 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8-03 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, such financial information includes all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's financial position at such date and the operating results and cash flows for such periods. Operating results for the interim period ended September 30, 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.





	Certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in financial statements in accordance with GAAP have been omitted pursuant to the rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, as filed with the SEC on March 31, 2015.

	Principles of Consolidation





	The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of bBooth, Inc. and Songstagram, Inc. ("Songstagram"). All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.





	Going Concern





	The Company has incurred operating losses since inception and has negative cash flows from operations. It also has an accumulated deficit of $15,175,969 (unaudited) as of September 30, 2015.  As a result, the Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing until it can generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations. Management intends to continue to seek additional debt or equity financing to continue its operations. Management also intends to look at mergers with, or acquisitions of, other related entities to grow its business and customer base. 


	 


	These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to meet its obligations and continue its operations for the next fiscal year. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain necessary debt or equity financing to continue operations until it begins generating positive cash flow.





	There is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.





	Use of Estimates


	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Significant estimates include the value of share based payments. Amounts could materially change in the future.


	 


	Cash and Cash Equivalents


	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid holdings with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.





	Property and Equipment


	 


	Property and equipment are recorded at historical cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of approximately five years once the individual assets are placed in service.  





	Deposit for Booth Equipment


	 


	Deposit for booth equipment represents amounts paid as a down payment on a purchase order for ten booths during 2014. Booth equipment costs are recorded at historical cost and represent costs to acquire the Company's bBooth portable recording studios, which will be used by the Company for revenue producing activities. Once the bBooth studios are completed and placed in service, the Company will depreciate the amounts over the estimated useful lives of the equipment.



	7










	Long-Lived Assets


	 


	The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value, based on market value when available, or discounted expected cash flows, of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. As of September 30, 2015, the Company made this analysis and determined there were no reliable predictors of future cash flows in connection with the intangible assets. Accordingly, the Company concluded that impairment of this asset was appropriate and recorded an impairment charge of $1,104,327.





	Income Taxes


	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740 "Income Taxes."  Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The deferred tax assets of the Company relate primarily to operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes. A full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has been provided because the Company believes it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. 





	The Company periodically evaluates its tax positions to determine whether it is more likely than not that such positions would be sustained upon examination by a tax authority for all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, based on their technical merits. The Company accrues interest and penalties, if incurred, on unrecognized tax benefits as components of the income tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company has not established a liability for uncertain tax positions.


	 


	Share Based Payment


	 


	The Company issues stock options, common stock, and equity interests as share-based compensation to employees and non-employees.


	 


	The Company accounts for its share-based compensation to employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718 "Compensation – Stock Compensation." Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. 





	The Company accounts for share-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC 505-50

	"

	Equity - Based Payments to Non-Employees

	."

	Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (

	a

	) the goods or services received; or (

	b

	) the equity instruments issued. The final fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the performance completion date. For interim periods, the fair value is estimated and the percentage of completion is applied to that estimate to determine the cumulative expense recorded.





	The Company values stock compensation based on the market price on the measurement date. As described above, for employees this is the date of grant, and for non-employees, this is the date of performance completion.



	8










	The Company values stock options and warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  Assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model to value options and warrants issued during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 are as follows:

	Research and Development Costs





	Research and development costs consist of expenditures for the research and development of new products and technology. These costs are primarily expenses to vendors contracted to perform research projects and develop technology for the Company's bBooth recording studios and integrated app.  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.





	Net Loss Per Share





	Basic net loss per share is computed by using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of incremental common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options. No dilutive potential common shares were included in the computation of diluted net loss per share because their impact was anti-dilutive. As of September 30, 2015, the Company had a total of 9,075,000 options and 648,000 warrants outstanding, which were excluded from the computation of net loss per share because they are anti-dilutive.  There were no options or warrants outstanding as of September 30, 2014.





	Fair Value of Financial Instruments


	 


	The Company's financial instruments include cash and notes payable. The principal balance of the notes payable approximates fair value because the current interest rates and terms offered to the Company for similar debt are substantially the same.


	 


	Recent Accounting Pronouncements





	There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that the Company has yet to adopt that are expected to have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Pursuant to the Promissory Notes, Songstagram promised to pay the Company the principal sum of $475,000, together with interest at a rate equal to 8% per annum, and Wright promised to pay the Company the principal sum of $386,435, together with interest at a rate equal to 8% per annum. All unpaid principal, which totaled an aggregate of $861,435, together with any then unpaid and accrued interest and other amounts payable under the Promissory Notes, were to be due and payable on the earlier of (i) the Company's demand for payment; or (ii) when, upon or after the occurrence of an event of default, the Company declared such amounts due and payable or such amounts were made automatically due and payable under the terms of the Promissory Notes. During any period in which an event of default had occurred and was continuing, Songstagram and Wright, as applicable, were to pay interest on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of 13% per annum.

	11

	Effective March 5, 2015, the Company entered into a settlement and release agreement with Songstagram and Art Malone Jr., pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue 320,000 shares of common stock to Mr. Malone in full settlement and release of a claim he had on certain assets the Company acquired from Songstagram.  The shares of common stock issued to Mr. Malone were valued at $160,000 and were included as part of the acquisition price of Songstagram.  The 320,000 shares of common stock were issued to Mr. Malone on April 29, 2015.





	In July 2015, the Company issued an aggregate of 240,000 shares to two individuals pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement as payment for claims they had on certain assets acquired from Songstagram.  The shares of common stock issued were valued at $120,000 and were included as part of the acquisition price of Songstagram.   





	As a result, the total consideration paid by the Company for the acquisition of Songstagram amounted to $1,435,335.  Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The fair values of identifiable intangible assets were based on valuations using the income approach.

	Forward-Looking Statements


	 


	This quarterly report contains "forward-looking statements". All statements other than statements of historical fact are "forward-looking statements" for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including, but not limited to, any projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objections of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed new services, products or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance; any statements of belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing.

These forward-looking statements present our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this quarterly report. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward‑looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results or events expressed or implied therein will not be realized.  You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make in future public filings, statements and press releases.





	Forward‑looking statements in this quarterly report include express or implied statements concerning our future revenues, expenditures, capital and funding requirements; the adequacy of our current cash and working capital to fund present and planned operations and financing needs; our proposed expansion of, and demand for, product offerings; the growth of our business and operations through acquisitions or otherwise; and future economic and other conditions both generally and in our specific geographic and product markets.  These statements are based on currently available operating, financial and competitive information and are subject to various risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward‑looking statements due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, those set forth below in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in this quarterly report, which you should carefully read.  Given those risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, you should not place undue reliance on these forward‑looking statements. You should be prepared to accept any and all of the risks associated with purchasing any securities of our company, including the possible loss of all of your investment.





	In this quarterly report, unless otherwise specified, all references to "common shares" refer to the common shares in our capital stock.

	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and judgments, including those described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

	The following discussion should be read together with the information contained in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 1 – Financial Statements, in this Form 10‑Q.





	Overview





	We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 27, 2012.





	On October 16, 2014, we completed the acquisition of bBooth (USA), Inc., a private Nevada corporation ("bBooth USA"), pursuant to the terms of a share exchange agreement dated August 11, 2014, as amended, among our company, bBooth USA and the shareholders of bBooth USA (the "Exchange Agreement").





	bBooth USA was formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name "Cutaia Media Group, LLC" on December 12, 2012.  On May 19, 2014, Cutaia Media Group, LLC effected a merger under the laws of the State of Nevada with its affiliate, bBooth, Inc., a Nevada corporation, with bBooth, Inc. as the surviving corporation, in order to convert from a limited liability company into a corporation. On October 17, 2014, we changed the name of the private Nevada corporation to "bBooth (USA), Inc.".





	The Company is engaged in the manufacture and operation of Internet connected, broadcast-quality portable recording studios, branded and marketed as "bBooth," which are integrated into a social media, messaging, gaming, music streaming and video sharing app. The bBooth portable television studios are in the process of being deployed to shopping malls and other high-traffic venues in the United States.





	Our business has evolved from one based primarily on our bBooth kiosks, to an integrated platform comprised of the bBooth kiosks and a mobile app we have branded "kord".  We are promoting our kord mobile app combined with our bBooth kiosks as a new platform for content creation and distribution, artist promotion, fan engagement and talent discovery.

	Revenues


	 


	We did not generate any revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2015 or 2014.





	Operating Expenses


	 


	Research and development expenses were $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014.  The expense has decreased as the majority of the technological development and design of our booths was incurred during 2013.





	General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 increased by $414,777 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2014.  The increase in general and administrative expenses is due primarily to amortization expense of $137,312 relating to our acquisition of the assets of Songstagram Inc. ("Songstagram") in January 2015 and share based compensation expense of $661,463.  We did not have any of these expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2014.   These increases to general and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2015 were offset by decreases in salary and related payroll expenses as compared to the same period in 2014 due to the decrease in headcount, as well as a decrease in other operating expenses such as rent expense, consulting expense and professional fees incurred associated with our reverse merger transaction in 2014.  As of September 30, 2015, we performed an impairment analysis on our intangible assets and determined there were no reliable predictors of future cash flows in connection with the assets. Accordingly, we concluded that impairment of this asset was appropriate and recorded an impairment charge of $1,104,327 as of September 30, 2015.  There was no such charge during 2014.





	Interest expense, net, for the three months ended September 30, 2015 amounted to $25,961.  This represented interest expense on outstanding notes payable during this timeframe.  The amount of interest expense for the same period in 2014 was higher due to the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with convertible notes payable issued during 2014.





	Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 as Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014.

	Revenues


	 


	We did not generate any revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 or 2014.





	Operating Expenses


	 


	Research and development expenses are primarily expenses to vendors contracted to perform research projects and develop technology for our booths and our mobile app.  Research and development expenses increased slightly during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to increased spending relating to the mobile app.  We do not expect research and development expenses to be significant going forward as the technological development and design of our booths was incurred during 2013.





	General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 increased by $2,141,697 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2014.  The increase in general and administrative expenses is due primarily to amortization expense of $331,008 relating to the acquisition of the Songstagram assets in January 2015 and share based compensation expense of $914,505.  We did not have any of these expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2014.  Our general and administrative expenses also increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to 2014 due to increases in consulting expenses, rent expense for display of our bBooth units, and salary related expenses.  These expenses were not significant during the nine months ended September 30, 2014, as our operations had not significantly started for much of the period.  As of September 30, 2015, we performed an impairment analysis on our intangible assets and determined there were no reliable predictors of future cash flows in connection with the assets. Accordingly, we concluded that impairment of this asset was appropriate and recorded an impairment charge of $1,104,327 as of September 30, 2015.  There was no such charge during 2014.





	Interest expense, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 amounted to $68,975.  This represented interest expense on outstanding notes payable during this timeframe.  The amount of interest expense for the same period in 2014 was higher due to the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with convertible notes payable issued during 2014.

	For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our cash flows used in operating activities amounted to $2,452,183, compared to cash used in 2014 of $2,032,623.  The primary reason for the change relates to higher spending in 2015 relating to consulting, professional fees and salary related costs in order to execute our business plan. 





	Our cash used in investing activities amounted to $105,929 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as compared to $279,380 for 2014.  Our cash used in investing activities in 2015 consisted of $62,029 paid for the acquisition of property and equipment and $43,900 paid for the acquisition of Songstagram.  Cash used in investing activities in 2014 was higher primarily due to a deposit made of $199,428 as a down payment on a purchase order for ten booths.





	Our cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 amounted to $1,400,942 from net proceeds received from additional notes payable borrowings.  Cash provided by financing activities in 2014 amounted to $2,205,062 and resulted primarily from capital contributions from stockholders of $595,000 and proceeds from convertible notes payable of $1,500,000, offset by repayments of notes payable to related parties of $74,938.





	As of September 30, 2015, we had cash of $14,947 and a working capital deficit of $2,011,070.  We estimate our operating expenses for the next 12 months will continue to exceed any revenues we generate, and we will need to raise capital through either debt or equity offerings to continue operations.





	We are in the early stages of our business. We are required to fund growth from financing activities, and we intend to rely on a combination of equity and debt financings.  Due to market conditions and the early stage of our operations, there is considerable risk that our company will not be able to raise such financings at all, or on terms that are not overly dilutive to our existing shareholders.  We can offer no assurance that we will be able to raise such funds.





	Going Concern





	We have incurred operating losses since inception and have negative cash flows from operations. We also have an accumulated deficit of $15,175,969 as of September 30, 2015.  As a result, our continuation as a going concern is dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing until we can generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our obligations. Management intends to continue to seek additional debt or equity financing to continue our company's operations. Management also intends to look at mergers with, or acquisitions of, other related entities to grow our company's business and customer base. 





	These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that we will continue to meet our obligations and continue our operations for the next fiscal year. The continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain necessary debt or equity financing to continue operations until we begin generating positive cash flow.





	There is no assurance that we will ever be profitable. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

	On various dates during the quarter ended September 30, 2015, the Company entered into additional unsecured loan agreements with its majority shareholder for total aggregate borrowings of $475,000.  The amounts are due on demand and bear interest at 12% per annum.

Mr. Fleyshman, the youngest proprietor of a publicly-traded company, brings to the table an astute awareness of today's contemporary marketplace. By the age of 23, following the sales of over $15 million worth of clothing in 6 department store chains and surpassing expectations with his $9.5 million licensing deal with STARTER apparel, Mr. Fleyshman launched the "Who's Your Daddy" energy drink into 55,000 retail stores and military bases. 10 years after starting his licensing company in high school, he proceeded to launch Victory Poker in 2010, building the third largest team of professional players out of the 550 poker sites on the market. His addition to the advisory board is expected to be an invaluable contribution, empowering the Company to quickly scale in accordance with core strategies, further enhancing shareholder value.
Mr. Fleyshman is a very active Angel Investor and advisor to over 20 companies that range from mobile app and tech companies, to successful monthly box subscription sites like "DollarBeardClub" and consumer products like Uwheels, both of which exceeded $5,000,000 in sales in less than 8 months.
Mr. Hampton, one of the largest independent social media publishers in the world, brings a wealth of experience from his successful career in Social Media Marketing. He co-founded California-based First Slice Media a content site that has done over 300,000,000 page views since its launch in April of 2015.

The company counts over 32 million followers from the accounts that it owns and manages, and assists its clients with Social Media, Engagement, Influence, Impressions, Ad Serving, Content, Trending Topics, Analytics, Demographic targeting, and the Building of Followers.
Mr. Hampton personally supervises 24 Twitter accounts, representing in excess of 12 million followers in total. One example of his effective strategies is the project "@Notebook", also known as "Notebook of Love". In February 2011, over 30,000 followers were acquired in only three weeks, making it a striking illustration of the power of modern marketing. Today @Notebook is one of Twitter's most active brands exceeding 5.6 million followers. Influential Media Group also provides assistance to celebrities, prominent athletes, music artists and bands, supporting with the development of strategies to effectively engage with followers.
