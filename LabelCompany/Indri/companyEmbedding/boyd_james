Kevin Boyd & James Murphy Lecture #102$6.00

Various centers worldwide are now analyzing and measuring crania from different ages in history, and the outcomes are suggesting that a noticeable change to the facial and oropharyngeal structures and functions happened in the last few thousand years, with a significant acceleration during and after the industrial revolution. Some results from these multicenter studies and implications for patient's care will be discussed.
Kevin Boyd, DDS MSc is a graduate of Loyola University’s College of Dentistry and board-certified pediatric dentist practicing in Chicago. He is an instructor in the residency-training program in Pediatric Dentistry at Lurie Children’s Hospital and member of Lurie’s Craniofacial Anomalies and Sleep Medicine teams. He has an advanced degree (M.Sc.) in Human Nutrition and Dietetic. Kevin has a Consulting Scholar position at the U Penn Museum's section of Anthropology.
James G. Murphy, MD, is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the F. Edward Hébert School of Medicine, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland. He served 25 years on active duty as a physician with the US Navy, 12 years as a contract pediatrician with the US Navy and 6 years as a Government Service Medical Officer with the Navy in San Diego, CA, until retiring from government service on 9-30-13. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics, a Fellow of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, President of the San Diego County Breastfeeding Coalition, a former Governing Council member of the International Affiliation of Tongue Tie Professionals, a member of the International Lactation Consultants Association  and, since 2009, an Internationally Board Certified Lactation Consultant.  Dr Murphy began performing lingual frenulotomies in Oct 2003 and has performed over 3000 of these procedures to date including posterior sub-mucosal fibrous bands.  He has also performed over 600 upper lip frenotomies using sterile scissors.  He is the owner of Breastfeeding Fixers, in Solana Beach, CA, which opened its doors on 14 April 2014.
Learning Outcomes:
– Examine the impact of breast feeding (suction) and chewing on the orofacial and nasopharyngeal structures and functions.
– Compare measurements obtained from various crania in various epochs as it relates to orofacial and nasopharyngeal fuctions.
– Examine the implications of food preparation on changes in the orofacial complex.
