Balanced Program


Check Capital Management's Balanced Program complements its equity programs.  For many investors, especially those who are retired, incorporating the stability of bonds is important.  Bonds can provide dependable cashflow for purposes ranging from living expenses to funding a child's or grandchild's college education.
In addition to the bonds, and similar to Equity-Income Program accounts, covered call option positions may be employed.   Balanced Program Portfolios are tailored for each individual.

Stocks Mean Ownership


Of the many stock investors we've met, most, in their own estimation, have done poorly in the markets.   The reason often is emotion.   After all, it's only human to want to buy stocks when they're going up (and possibly overpriced), and sell them when they're heading down (and maybe a bargain).   While "human", these impulses are a recipe for failure.
How does one control one's emotions when investing in stocks?   By adhering to an investment philosophy based on the fact that "stock" means ownership of a business. 
Another way to banish emotion is by incorporating into your philosophy the wisdom of Benjamin Graham and his book, The Intelligent Investor.   Its truths are simple and obvious.   Investors must have the right temperament.   Common sense is more important than intelligence.
At Check Capital, we focus on buying high-quality companies at attractive prices.   These firms have business models generating high profits nowthat we feel are likely to continue doing so in the future.   Being an owner of such firms (i.e., holding their stock) is a strategy for profit.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
