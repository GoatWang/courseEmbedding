				A Message from Jon Gray, Global Head of Real Estate
			






















 $104b of

Total Assets Under Management




“ “By investing in real estate assets around the globe, we’re helping to build a secure financial future for millions of employees, retirees, schools, non-profit organizations and others. We’re enhancing the value of properties that anchor communities and create good jobs.”   - Jonathan D. Gray Global Head of Real Estate   








 
 
Opportunistic 
 Buy it, Fix it, Sell it. Our opportunistic platform employs a straightforward investment strategy. We seek to acquire high quality, well located assets at discounts to replacement cost, address any property or business issues through aggressive asset management, and sell the assets once Blackstone Real Estate’s objectives are accomplished.


 




 
 
Core+

Blackstone Real Estate’s Core+ business seeks to leverage Blackstone’s “buy it, fix it” strategy to deliver compelling risk-adjusted returns in the core+ space. We target high quality assets in gateway cities with a more modest risk profile, longer hold periods, and a significant current income component. 
 




 
 
Debt 

With over $41 billion of loans made or acquired since its inception in 2008, Blackstone Real Estate’s debt strategies group has established itself as a leading platform providing creative lending solutions.

Stuyvesant Town / Peter Cooper Village is an irreplaceable apartment community totaling 11,200 units in 56 buildings on 80 acres in Manhattan’s East Village. The community was developed to provide affordable housing for returning World War II veterans and has been an important part of New York City ever since. Blackstone Real Estate leveraged its relationships and ability to transact in scale with speed and certainty to acquire the property at a highly compelling basis. The most important aspect of the transaction was Blackstone’s partnership with the City of New York to protect 5,000 affordable apartments for 20 years – the most units preserved for affordability ever at one time in the city’s history. Our agreement also limited rent increases on an additional 1,400 units that otherwise would have lost rent protection in 2020.
