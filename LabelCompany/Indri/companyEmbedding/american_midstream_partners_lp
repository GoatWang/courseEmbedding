Forward Looking Statements        



This press release includes forward-looking statements. These 
      statements relate to, among other things, projections of operational 
      volumetrics and improvements, growth projects, cash flows and capital 
      expenditures. We have used the words "anticipate,” "believe," "could," 
      "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "predict," "project," 
      "should," "will," "potential," and similar terms and phrases to identify 
      forward-looking statements in this press release. Although we believe 
      the assumptions upon which these forward-looking statements are based 
      are reasonable, any of these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate 
      and the forward-looking statements based on these assumptions could be 
      incorrect.        



Actual results and trends in the future may differ materially from 
      those suggested or implied by the forward-looking statements depending 
      on a variety of factors, which are described in greater detail in our 
      filings with the SEC. Please see “Risk Factors” and other disclosures 
      included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 
      31, 2016 filed on March 28, 2017 and our other filings with the SEC. All 
      future written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or 
      persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety 
      by the previous statements. The forward-looking statements herein speak 
      as of the date of this press release. We undertake no obligation to 
      update any information contained herein or to publicly release the 
      results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements that may be 
      made to reflect events or circumstances that occur, or that we become 
      aware of, after the date of this press release.        



This release serves as qualified notice to nominees as provided for 
      under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b)(4) and (d).        

Please 
      note that 100 percent of American Midstream Partners, LP’s distributions 
      to foreign investors are attributable to income that is effectively 
      connected with a United States trade or business.        

Accordingly, 
      all of American Midstream Partners, LP 's distributions to foreign 
      investors are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest 
      effective tax rate for individuals or corporations, as applicable.        

Nominees, 
      and not American Midstream Partners, LP, are treated as withholding 
      agents responsible for withholding distributions received by them on 
      behalf of foreign investors.

American Midstream Inks Deal to Sell Propane Related Assets

Tuesday, July 25, 2017 Zacks Equity Research News, stream 



Houston-based pipeline partnership, American Midstream Partners, LP AMID recently inked an agreement to divest its propane marketing and services business to a Netherlands-based, family owned energy supplying company, SHV Energy N.V. for $170 million.
Deal Details
With the all-cash transaction, American Midstream will sell its 100% interest in Pinnacle Propane’s 40 service locations, several other assets, which include Pinnacle Propane Express’ cylinder exchange business and related logistic assets and the Alliant Gas utility system. American Midstream expects the deal to be completed by the third quarter of 2017.
Reasons for the Divestiture
The sale of its propane marketing and services business is in line with American Midstream’s strategy to simplify its business profile and generate capital.  The partnership is preparing to grow its distributable cash flow and create balance sheet flexibility.
The proceeds from the transaction will be deployed in its core operating areas of East Texas, Gulf of Mexico and Permian Basin. American Midstream is shifting its focus to its core assets because it believes reallocation of its capital to areas with greater long-term value will help the partnership to achieve competitive advantage and increase its unit value.
For the same reason, the partnership acquired the Viosca Knoll system in the Gulf of Mexico for approximately $32 million from Genesis Energy, L.P. GEL in Jun 2017. American Midstream funded the Viosca Knoll initially with borrowings under its senior secured credit facility. The amount will be repaid from the proceeds of the SHV Energy transaction.
We would like to remind investors that American Midstream closed an all-stock merger deal with JP Energy Partners LP in Mar 2017 worth $2 billion to increase its core assets.
About the Partnership
American Midstream is a growth-oriented limited partnership formed to provide critical midstream infrastructure that links producers of natural gas, crude oil, NGLs, condensate and specialty chemicals to end-use markets. American Midstream’s assets are strategically located in some of the most prolific onshore and offshore basins in the Permian, Eagle Ford, East Texas, Bakken and Gulf Coast.
The partnership’s earnings are expected to plunge 222.9% in the second quarter of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate declined from earnings of 25 cents per unit to a loss of 29 cents per unit for the second quarter in the last 60 days.
Price Performance
American Midstream has lost 24.5% of its value year to date versus 5.8% growth of its industry.

Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider
American Midstream presently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). 
Some better-ranked stocks in the oil and energy sector include Braskem S.A. BAK and Enbridge Energy, L.P. EEP. Both these companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Braskem’s sales for 2017 are expected to increase 11% year over year. The company’s earnings for the second quarter of 2017 are expected to increase 197%.
Enbridge Energy’s sales for the second quarter of 2017 are expected to increase 13.2% year over year. The partnership delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 38.22% in the last four quarters.
