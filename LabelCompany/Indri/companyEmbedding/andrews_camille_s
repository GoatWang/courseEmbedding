Academic career[edit]
Camille Andrews is an Associate Dean with expertise in Antitrust, Evidence, Complex Litigation, Professional Responsibility, Baseball Arbitration, Sports Law and Entertainment Law. Andrews served as a faculty advisor to the Rutgers Law Journal and was the Associate Dean of Enrollment and Projects of the Rutgers School of Law in Camden, New Jersey for 20 years.[2] Prior to joining the law school, Camille Andrews was a Corporate Litigation partner with Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish& Kauffman firm, specializing in derivative shareholder litigation, corporate counseling of special litigation committees, antitrust, trademark law, and other complex commercial litigation matters. Andrews’ team won high profile cases and was a long-time lawyer for clients such as Armand Hammer. [3] For five years, she served as general counsel to a private equity fund.[4]
Andrews is a member of the U.S. Supreme Court bar. She served as co-chair of the American Bar Association's law school administration committee in 2001-2002. She has also served on a number of charitable boards.[5]
Andrews earned her B.A. magna cum laude in 1980 at the University of Pittsburgh, where she completed a four-year program in three years. She earned her J.D. with honors in 1986 at Rutgers School of Law–Camden, where she was a member of the law review and the National Moot Court team.[6]
Politics[edit]
Andrews is the wife of Rob Andrews, who served as the district's Representative from 1990 to 2014. In 2008, when Rob Andrews ran against Lautenberg, Camille Andrews was asked to be the Democratic primary nominee. Democratic Party leaders, under pressure to find a replacement before the filing deadline for the primary, picked Camille Andrews as a placeholder while acknowledging they had not yet decided who to run in November. She said she truly wants to be elected but also wants to respond to the party's needs.[7] Andrews was endorsed by Philadelphia and New Jersey newspapers. “Camille Andrews actually would make an ideal candidate. The Philadelphia Inquire said, "An attorney, she has an impeccable resume as a commercial litigator, investment firm manager, and former associate dean at Rutgers-Camden Law School."[8] . Andrews easily won the primary June 3, 2008. In September, Camille withdrew her candidacy. After losing to Lautenberg, Rob Andrews originally considered leaving office having received lucrative job offers in the private sector. Andrews had notified the House in his plan to take a position at the Wall Street Investment firm Goldman Sachs but ultimately decided to seek re-election in September 2008. [9] In November 2008, Andrews won re-elcection, beating his opponent with 73% of the vote.[10]
Awards[edit]

Distinguished Service Award for Excellence in Continuing Legal Education, New Jersey Bar Association
Social Justice Award, Black Law Students Association
Excellence in Service Award, awarded by the President of Rutgers University[11]

Personal life[edit]
Andrews and her husband reside in South Jersey and have two daughters.[2]
