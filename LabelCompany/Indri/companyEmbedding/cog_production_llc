	Case Study #1

	Dramatic simplification and improved collaboration liberates innovation for a consumer goods leader.

	The Problem: 

	The supply chain organization (Chart A.) responsible for the development of in-store promotional/POP materials for a leading consumer packaged-goods company is inefficient, costly, and hinders innovation.

	 

	Specific “pain” areas include:


		The number of external stakeholders in the supply chain results in increased time in the production schedule.

		Innovation, both in creative development and production, is undermined due to stakeholders each being assigned a narrow focus of responsibility and having neither the time nor the incentive to propose ideas or perspective to each other.

		Outsourced project management provider lacks inter-stakeholder project management and communication tools. While they oversee initiatives from creative development-through-production, they use project management software that only provides access to the customer.

		Outsourced project management provider has limited experience in the in-store promotion industry. As a result, disputes are managed with limited perspective, and opportunities for innovation are stifled in favor of process adherence.




Chart A: Current organization with pattern of interaction between internal & external stakeholders. Key workflow operations and stakeholder functions are also illustrated.


	The Cog Solution: 

	A simplified, integrated supply chain (Chart B.) that consolidates all of the current graphics production roles (project management, production art, pre-press, printing, and fulfillment), creating a single-source graphics production provider. In addition, we offered a streamlined and interactive workflow process that integrated production capabilities with marketing, creative and design, sales, and retailer efforts, restoring innovation and increasing collaboration and responsiveness.

	 

	Projected results of this model include:


		38% reduction of program development time after providing a 15% increase in Creative/Design time.

		20% reduction of program costs due to the reduction of redundant operational steps and headcount from multiple single-task suppliers.




Chart B: Proposed organization with pattern of interaction between internal & external stakeholders and workflow and stakeholders functions.





Chart C: Proposed simplified supply chain results in the following savings due to reductions of key workflow operations and stakeholder functions:
