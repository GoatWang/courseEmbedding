Men's Shaving & Personal Care
 With creative solutions, Braun helps millions of modern men be well-shaved and well-groomed at all times. Braun men’s grooming shavers feature the rotating styler and have two distinct sizes; a wide shaper and a narrow shaper. The wide shaper evenly cuts and trims large areas and the narrow shaper accurately defines lines and edges. Some Braun men’s electric shavers feature the patented ActiveLift, a distinct oscillating middle trimmer between the two foils, which lift and cuts flat lying hairs. It also gives you the certainty of an absolute and close shave even in sensitive areas. The extremely wide and thin ultra flexing foil easily adapts to the facial contours, providing you with an extra close and comfortable shave.

      Best Braun Electric Shavers




      Updated July 2017    

      Best Braun Electric Shavers    







            Best of the Best          


 




            Braun          

            Series 9 Cordless Electric Foil Shaver          



                          Check Price
                      





            Bottom Line          

            The top of the line Braun electric razor. It is not cheap, but if you want the absolute best, this is the one to get.          



            Pros          

            Boasts 4 effective cutting elements including a powerful motor with impressive 40,000 per minute cross-cutting action.           



            Cons          

            Some testers noted that the shaver head has a bulkier design than the Series 7. It's also the most expensive model on our shortlist.           






            Best Bang for the Buck          


 




            Braun          

            Series 7 Cordless Electric Foil Shaver          



                          Check Price
                      





            Bottom Line          

            Its performance, design, price, and features make it the best value Braun electric shaver available.           



            Pros          

            A popular Braun shaver that combines a streamlined shaving head and automatic power adjusting technology for a comfortable yet close shave at a mid-range price.            



            Cons          

            Not quite as powerful as its Series 9 cousin, but this doesn't seem to affect the quality of the shave it provides.           







 




            Braun          

            Series 3 ProSkin Wet & Dry Electric Shaver          



                          Check Price
                      





            Bottom Line          

            This shaver will give you a decent shave, but the battery life may be an issue for some users.          



            Pros          

            Offers similar qualities as other Braun shavers at a fraction of the price. Provides straight stroke performance for an exceptional value.           



            Cons          

            Its charged battery life is about half that of more expensive models.          







 




            Braun          

            Series 5 Cordless Electric Foil Shaver          



                          Check Price
                      





            Bottom Line          

            We recommend the Series 7 instead – it's only a little more expensive and offers a better shave.           



            Pros          

            Has similar features to other models, including a waterproof and rechargeable design and pivoting shaver head.           



            Cons          

            Seems to miss whiskers here and there. Doesn't provide an extra-close shave.           







 




            Braun          

            Waterflex Wet and Dry Shaver          



                          Check Price
                      





            Bottom Line          

            A good choice is you want an alternative design to the Series models. Otherwise, choose the Series 7 if value is your top concern.           



            Pros          

            A basic waterproof electric shaver with an ergonomic, slip-free handle. Only takes around an hour to charge for 45 minutes of shave time.            



            Cons          

            Doesn't have a docking station or offer cleaning and lubricating capabilities like the Series models.

YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. Braun Dental Associates3430 W State Road 66Rockport, IN 47635(812) 649-4416DentistsOral & Maxillofacial SurgeryWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. Braun, Carol J DDS2816 Veach RdOwensboro, KY 42303(270) 683-7114DentistsPediatric DentistryDirectionsMore InfoAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Braun Carol Dr Dentistry For Children2816 Veach Rd Ste 201Owensboro, KY 42303(270) 683-7114Pediatric DentistryDentistsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection4. Braun Hashemi, Clare A, MD1301 Pleasant Valley RdOwensboro, KY 42303(270) 417-7830Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection5. Shovers, Alan N501 Main StEvansville, IN 47708(812) 423-3183AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection6. Johnson, Alan H, MD533 W Columbia StEvansville, IN 47710(812) 424-9291Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection7. Guhlke, Alan D, MD3700 Washington AveEvansville, IN 47714(812) 485-4335Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection8. Toy, Alan, MD5401 Vogel RdEvansville, IN 47715(812) 471-4591Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection9. Alan H Johnson5828 Pearl DrEvansville, IN 47712(812) 424-9291Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection10. Penzias, Alan S4199 Gateway BlvdNewburgh, IN 47630(812) 842-4200Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection11. Tripp, Alan M1413 N Elm StHenderson, KY 42420(270) 827-0064Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection12. Alan P Mullins MD FACS2801 New Hartford RdOwensboro, KY 42303(270) 683-3720Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteSponsored LinksShowing1-12

Men's Shaving & Personal Care
 With creative solutions, Braun helps millions of modern men be well-shaved and well-groomed at all times. Braun men’s grooming shavers feature the rotating styler and have two distinct sizes; a wide shaper and a narrow shaper. The wide shaper evenly cuts and trims large areas and the narrow shaper accurately defines lines and edges. Some Braun men’s electric shavers feature the patented ActiveLift, a distinct oscillating middle trimmer between the two foils, which lift and cuts flat lying hairs. It also gives you the certainty of an absolute and close shave even in sensitive areas. The extremely wide and thin ultra flexing foil easily adapts to the facial contours, providing you with an extra close and comfortable shave.

      Best Braun Electric Shavers




      Updated July 2017    

      Best Braun Electric Shavers    







            Best of the Best          


 




            Braun          

            Series 9 Cordless Electric Foil Shaver          



                          Check Price
                      





            Bottom Line          

            The top of the line Braun electric razor. It is not cheap, but if you want the absolute best, this is the one to get.          



            Pros          

            Boasts 4 effective cutting elements including a powerful motor with impressive 40,000 per minute cross-cutting action.           



            Cons          

            Some testers noted that the shaver head has a bulkier design than the Series 7. It's also the most expensive model on our shortlist.           






            Best Bang for the Buck          


 




            Braun          

            Series 7 Cordless Electric Foil Shaver          



                          Check Price
                      





            Bottom Line          

            Its performance, design, price, and features make it the best value Braun electric shaver available.           



            Pros          

            A popular Braun shaver that combines a streamlined shaving head and automatic power adjusting technology for a comfortable yet close shave at a mid-range price.            



            Cons          

            Not quite as powerful as its Series 9 cousin, but this doesn't seem to affect the quality of the shave it provides.           







 




            Braun          

            Series 3 ProSkin Wet & Dry Electric Shaver          



                          Check Price
                      





            Bottom Line          

            This shaver will give you a decent shave, but the battery life may be an issue for some users.          



            Pros          

            Offers similar qualities as other Braun shavers at a fraction of the price. Provides straight stroke performance for an exceptional value.           



            Cons          

            Its charged battery life is about half that of more expensive models.          







 




            Braun          

            Series 5 Cordless Electric Foil Shaver          



                          Check Price
                      





            Bottom Line          

            We recommend the Series 7 instead – it's only a little more expensive and offers a better shave.           



            Pros          

            Has similar features to other models, including a waterproof and rechargeable design and pivoting shaver head.           



            Cons          

            Seems to miss whiskers here and there. Doesn't provide an extra-close shave.           







 




            Braun          

            Waterflex Wet and Dry Shaver          



                          Check Price
                      





            Bottom Line          

            A good choice is you want an alternative design to the Series models. Otherwise, choose the Series 7 if value is your top concern.           



            Pros          

            A basic waterproof electric shaver with an ergonomic, slip-free handle. Only takes around an hour to charge for 45 minutes of shave time.            



            Cons          

            Doesn't have a docking station or offer cleaning and lubricating capabilities like the Series models.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
