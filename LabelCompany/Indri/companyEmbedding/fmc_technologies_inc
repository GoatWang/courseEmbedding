ProductsWe install products from manufacturers that adhere to open–protocol standards as their primary communications protocol.  LonWorks and BACnet are the two most popular open-protocols used in the HVAC industry today. 
 
FMC Technologies is an advocate of open standards for control systems.  Open protocols allow for everyday devices to be smart, completely open, able to communicate with one another and compatible with the Internet.  Open protocols allow flexibility to meet the requirements of all industries, and all manufacturers within the industries.  By choosing an open system, customers have the flexibility to choose products from various manufacturers when upgrading.  This results in lower costs because they are not locked into one system.

History[edit]




FMC Commander Aircraft cargo loader


FMC Technologies was a provider of systems and solutions to the oil and gas industry. The company was divided into three business areas: Subsea Technologies, Surface Technologies and Energy Infrastructures. FMC Technologies designed, manufactured and serviced systems and products such as subsea production and processing systems, surface wellhead systems, high pressure pumps and fluid control equipment, measurement solutions and marine loading systems.
The company was founded in 2000, when FMC announced plans to restructure itself into two separate, publicly traded companies - a machinery business (FMC Technologies) and a chemicals business (FMC Corporation). FMC Technologies, Inc. began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June 14, 2001.[1] In 2008, FMC Technologies spun off its FoodTech and Airport businesses into a new, independent, publicly-traded company called JBT Corporation.[2] In 2009, the company acquired Multi Phase Meters (MPM), a Norwegian technology company that provides advanced instrumentation for the oil industry.
Globally, FMC Technologies had approximately 17,400 employees by 2015, consisting of approximately 5,700 in the United States and 11,700 in non-U.S. locations.[3] The company had a total of 30 locations in 16 countries, including the United States, Norway, Brazil, Scotland, Singapore, Australia, Angola and Nigeria. Its headquarters were located in northern Houston, Texas.[4] In Norway there were about 3800 employees, working at locations in Kongsberg, Asker, Bergen, Stavanger, Kristiansund, Floro and Notodden. On October 1, 2012, the company acquired Pure Energy Services.[5] In the same year, FMC Technologies was named by Fortune (magazine) as the World's Most Admired Oil and Gas Equipment, Service Company.[6]
On May 19, 2016, it was announced that FMC Technologies would team up with French Technip to create a new company called TechnipFMC. After the approval of regulatory authorities, TechnipFMC began operating as a unified company in Jan 17, 2017. The all-share deal resulted in a company with a market value of about $13 billion.[7]
Leadership[edit]
Douglas Pferdehirt was Chairman and CEO of FMC Technologies, Inc.[8]

FMC Technologies, Inc. was a North American company that produced equipment for exploration and production of hydrocarbons. FMC Technologies was incorporated in 2000 when FMC Corporation divested its machinery businesses. It exists today as a part of TechnipFMC, after a merge with Technip in 2017.

History[edit]




FMC Commander Aircraft cargo loader


FMC Technologies was a provider of systems and solutions to the oil and gas industry. The company was divided into three business areas: Subsea Technologies, Surface Technologies and Energy Infrastructures. FMC Technologies designed, manufactured and serviced systems and products such as subsea production and processing systems, surface wellhead systems, high pressure pumps and fluid control equipment, measurement solutions and marine loading systems.
The company was founded in 2000, when FMC announced plans to restructure itself into two separate, publicly traded companies - a machinery business (FMC Technologies) and a chemicals business (FMC Corporation). FMC Technologies, Inc. began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June 14, 2001.[1] In 2008, FMC Technologies spun off its FoodTech and Airport businesses into a new, independent, publicly-traded company called JBT Corporation.[2] In 2009, the company acquired Multi Phase Meters (MPM), a Norwegian technology company that provides advanced instrumentation for the oil industry.
Globally, FMC Technologies had approximately 17,400 employees by 2015, consisting of approximately 5,700 in the United States and 11,700 in non-U.S. locations.[3] The company had a total of 30 locations in 16 countries, including the United States, Norway, Brazil, Scotland, Singapore, Australia, Angola and Nigeria. Its headquarters were located in northern Houston, Texas.[4] In Norway there were about 3800 employees, working at locations in Kongsberg, Asker, Bergen, Stavanger, Kristiansund, Floro and Notodden. On October 1, 2012, the company acquired Pure Energy Services.[5] In the same year, FMC Technologies was named by Fortune (magazine) as the World's Most Admired Oil and Gas Equipment, Service Company.[6]
On May 19, 2016, it was announced that FMC Technologies would team up with French Technip to create a new company called TechnipFMC. After the approval of regulatory authorities, TechnipFMC began operating as a unified company in Jan 17, 2017. The all-share deal resulted in a company with a market value of about $13 billion.[7]
Leadership[edit]
Douglas Pferdehirt was Chairman and CEO of FMC Technologies, Inc.[8]

History[edit]




FMC Commander Aircraft cargo loader


FMC Technologies was a provider of systems and solutions to the oil and gas industry. The company was divided into three business areas: Subsea Technologies, Surface Technologies and Energy Infrastructures. FMC Technologies designed, manufactured and serviced systems and products such as subsea production and processing systems, surface wellhead systems, high pressure pumps and fluid control equipment, measurement solutions and marine loading systems.
The company was founded in 2000, when FMC announced plans to restructure itself into two separate, publicly traded companies - a machinery business (FMC Technologies) and a chemicals business (FMC Corporation). FMC Technologies, Inc. began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June 14, 2001.[1] In 2008, FMC Technologies spun off its FoodTech and Airport businesses into a new, independent, publicly-traded company called JBT Corporation.[2] In 2009, the company acquired Multi Phase Meters (MPM), a Norwegian technology company that provides advanced instrumentation for the oil industry.
Globally, FMC Technologies had approximately 17,400 employees by 2015, consisting of approximately 5,700 in the United States and 11,700 in non-U.S. locations.[3] The company had a total of 30 locations in 16 countries, including the United States, Norway, Brazil, Scotland, Singapore, Australia, Angola and Nigeria. Its headquarters were located in northern Houston, Texas.[4] In Norway there were about 3800 employees, working at locations in Kongsberg, Asker, Bergen, Stavanger, Kristiansund, Floro and Notodden. On October 1, 2012, the company acquired Pure Energy Services.[5] In the same year, FMC Technologies was named by Fortune (magazine) as the World's Most Admired Oil and Gas Equipment, Service Company.[6]
On May 19, 2016, it was announced that FMC Technologies would team up with French Technip to create a new company called TechnipFMC. After the approval of regulatory authorities, TechnipFMC began operating as a unified company in Jan 17, 2017. The all-share deal resulted in a company with a market value of about $13 billion.[7]
Leadership[edit]
Douglas Pferdehirt was Chairman and CEO of FMC Technologies, Inc.[8]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
