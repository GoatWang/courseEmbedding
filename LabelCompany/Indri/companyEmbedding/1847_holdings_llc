You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Acquisition Criteria — 1847 Holdings LLC



































Menu



A Uniquely Diversified Public Holding Company




















Parameters1847’s mission is to generate superior risk-adjusted returns through the majority ownership of a curated portfolio of lower, middle market companies that are led by strong managers.  Ultimately, 1847 seeks to derive value creation through prudently distributing annual income while growing its operating subsidiaries - versus financial engineering fostered by extreme leverage. As a result, we seek to own companies with founder-operators and management teams at the critical inflection point in their growth cycle. By focusing on acquiring companies with an underlying blueprint for growth, 1847 selects companies that present the greatest opportunities for long-term value creation underpinned by a defensible value proposition and perpetual reason to exist.Company CharacteristicsBusinesses headquartered in North AmericaRevenues of at least $5 millionHistorical revenue growth rate of at least 10%Current year EBITDA of at least $1.5 millionTransaction TypesMajority Recapitalizations: Providing owner-operators with significant liquidity while enabling them to retain significant minority ownership and operating control of their businessBuyouts: Acquisitions of lower middle-market companies or divisions of larger companies that will benefit from an energized financial partnerAcquisition Size and StructureTotal enterprise value range of $10 - $150 millionControl, Majority Investments ONLYFlexible structures and securities to fit the needs of the company and its owners

In the event of raising $30,000 or less from the offering the costs for legal
and professional fees and public company reporting are planned to be covered
from loans made by our Chief Executive Officer and not from the moneys raised
from the offering. However, we do not have any written agreement from our Chief
Executive Officer regarding the making of any such loans.

Except for fixed costs, the amounts actually spent by us for any specific
purpose may vary and will depend on a number of factors. Non-fixed costs and
general and administrative costs may vary depending on the business progress and
development efforts, general business conditions and market reception to our
services. Notwithstanding the foregoing expectations, our management will have
broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending
the corporate uses noted above, we expect to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in cash, cash-equivalents, money market funds, or short-term
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.


We have been formed to acquire and manage small to middle market businesses. In 
pursuing such acquisitions, we expect to face strong competition from a wide 
range of other potential purchasers. Although the pool of potential purchasers 
for such businesses is typically smaller than for larger businesses, those 
potential purchasers can be aggressive in their approach to acquiring such 
businesses. Furthermore, we expect that we may need to use third-party 
financing in order to fund some or all of these potential acquisitions, thereby 
increasing our acquisition costs. To the extent that other potential purchasers 
do not need to obtain third-party financing or are able to obtain such 
financing on more favorable terms, they may be in a position to be more 
aggressive with their acquisition proposals. As a result, in order to be 
competitive, our acquisition proposals may need to be aggressively priced, 
including at price levels that exceed what we originally determined to be fair 
or appropriate in order to remain competitive. Alternatively, we may determine 
that we cannot pursue on a cost effective basis what would otherwise be an 
attractive acquisition opportunity.


Company Description
We are a development stage company currently operating a consulting and advisory
services business with plans to acquire additional small to medium size
businesses in a variety of different industries. Through our structure, we plan
to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the ownership


 and growth of
a portfolio of businesses that traditionally have been owned and managed by
private equity firms, private individuals or families, financial institutions or
large conglomerates. We believe that our management and acquisition strategies
will allow us to achieve our goals of growing distributions to our shareholders
and increasing shareholder value over time.

We will seek to acquire controlling interests in businesses that we believe
operate in industries with long-term macroeconomic growth opportunities, and
that have positive and stable earnings and cash flows, face minimal threats of
technological or competitive obsolescence and have strong management teams
largely in place. We believe that private company operators and corporate
parents looking to sell their businesses will consider us an attractive
purchaser of their businesses. We will also seek to acquire under-managed or
under-performing businesses that we believe can be improved under the guidance
of our management team and the management teams of the businesses that we will
acquire in the future. We intend to make these businesses our majority-owned
subsidiaries and intend to actively manage and grow such businesses. We expect
to improve our businesses over the long term through organic growth
opportunities, add-on acquisitions and operational improvements.

As an initial step in our plan to acquire small to medium size businesses in a
variety of different industries our newly formed subsidiary, 1847 Management
Services, Inc., or 1847 Management, acquired a 50% interest in each of PPI
Management Group, LLC, or PPI Management, and Christals Management LLC, or
Christals Management from our Chief Executive Officer and controlling
shareholder, Ellery W. Roberts. In connection with the acquisition of such
equity interests from Mr. Roberts, we issued to Mr. Roberts 875,000 of our
common shares pursuant to a securities purchase agreement, dated September 15,
2013, between our company and Mr. Roberts. Each of PPI Management and Christals
Management are management consulting and advisory firms.

As a result of the acquisition by 1847 Management of 50% of the equity interests
in each of PPI Management and Christals Management from Mr. Roberts, we operate
a consulting and advisory services business focused on providing management
consulting, finance, marketing, operational and strategic planning, relationship
access, corporate development and merger and acquisition analysis services. We
refer to the management consulting business operated by 1847 Management and its
subsidiaries, PPI Management and Christals Management, as our management
consulting business.

PPI Management acts as an advisor to PPI Acquisition Holdings, LLC, or PPI
Acquisition, pursuant to an advisory agreement with PPI Acquisition. Under the
advisory agreement, PPI Management provides PPI Acquisition and its subsidiary,
Pawn Plus, Inc., or Pawn Plus, with management and consulting services in
consideration for an advisory fee. Similarly, Christals Management acts as an
advisor to Peekay Acquisition, LLC, or Peekay, pursuant to an advisory agreement
with Peekay. The Christals advisory agreement is very similar to the PPI
Management advisory agreement. Under the Christals advisory agreement, Christals
Management provides Peekay and its subsidiaries with the same kind of management
and consulting services that PPI Management provides to PPI Acquisition and Pawn
Plus and Christals Management also receives fees for providing these services.
To date, our management consulting business has not generated significant
revenues.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  The following management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report.  Overview  We were formed to acquire and manage a group of small and middle-market businesses headquartered in North America. Through our subsidiaries, we currently operate a consulting and advisory services business and provide products and services to the agriculture, construction, lawn and garden industries. We have plans to acquire additional small to medium size businesses in a variety of different industries. Through our structure, we plan to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the ownership and growth of a portfolio of businesses that traditionally have been owned and managed by private equity firms, private individuals or families, financial institutions or large conglomerates. We believe that our management and acquisition strategies will allow us to achieve our goals of growing distributions to our shareholders and increasing shareholder value over time.  As an initial step in our plan to acquire small to medium size businesses in a variety of different industries our newly formed subsidiary, 1847 Management, acquired a 50% interest in each of PPI Management and Christals Management from our Chief Executive Officer and controlling shareholder, Ellery W. Roberts. Each of PPI Management and Christals Management are management consulting and advisory firms.  Although we expect to continue to operate our management consulting business and generate revenues therefrom, we do not intend to expand our management consulting business by seeking new clients at this time. Instead, we plan to focus all of our efforts (other than efforts necessary to operate PPI Management and Christals Management) on identifying a platform acquisition, raising capital necessary to consummate a platform acquisition after it is identified, and completing a platform acquisition after the necessary capital is raised.  Under our advisory agreement with Peekay, Christals Management generates annual revenues of $250,000 per year payable quarterly. Since 1847 Management owns 50% of Christals Management, 1847 Management is entitled to 50% of the aggregate $250,000 in compensation under the Christals advisory agreement, or $125,000 per year. This amount is paid to Christals Management in quarterly installments. Under our advisory agreement with PPI Acquisition, PPI Management is entitled to a fee equal to 5.75% of PPI Acquisition's EBITDA, payable as follows: (i) 3.75% of EBITDA for any fiscal quarter is payable quarterly in advance and (ii) the difference between 5.75% of EBITDA for any fiscal year and the aggregate quarterly payments previously paid with respect to fiscal quarters in such fiscal year, payable yearly in arrears.  Our cash balance was $0 as of December 31, 2016, as compared to $415 as of December 31, 2015. Our current cash balance will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months if we are unable to successfully borrow money from our affiliates or raise money from third parties. We will need funding from third parties or from our affiliates in order to achieve our business plan goals. The minimum amount of financing that we need in the next 12 months to continue operations is estimated to be $150,000. Our current operations are solely dependent on personal loans and capital contributions from our principal executive officer. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Ellery W. Roberts, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to cover our expenses pending our initial platform acquisition. There is no a maximum amount of funds that Mr. Roberts has agreed to advance. Mr. Roberts has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to our company. In order to achieve our business plan goals, we will need to raise additional capital.  Recent Developments - Neese Acquisition  Stock Purchase Agreement  We recently completed our first acquisition of Neese, Inc., which we refer to as Neese. The Neese acquisition is described below. Neese, specializes in providing a wide range of products and services for the agriculture, construction, lawn and garden industries. Neese's revenue mix is composed of waste disposal and a variety of land application services, wholesaling of agricultural equipment and parts, local trucking services, various shop services, and other products and services. Services to the local agricultural and farming communities include manure spreading, land rolling, bin whipping, cleaning of bulk storage bins and silos, equipment rental, trucking, vacuuming, building erection, and others.  Table of Contents  On March 3, 2017, our wholly-owned subsidiary 1847 Neese Inc., or 1847 Neese, entered into a stock purchase agreement with Neese, and Alan Neese and Katherine Neese, pursuant to which 1847 Neese acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Neese, which we refer to as the Neese acquisition, for an aggregate purchase price of (i) $2,225,000 in cash (subject to certain adjustments), (ii) 450 shares of the common stock of 1847 Neese, constituting 45% of its capital stock, which we refer to as the purchase price shares, (iii) the issuance of a vesting promissory note in the principal amount of $1,875,000, and (iv) the issuance of a short term promissory note in the principal amount of $1,025,000.  The cash portion of the purchase price will be adjusted upward if Neese's final certified balance sheet, as of a date on or about the closing date does not reflect a cash balance of at least $200,000. In the event of such a deficiency, the sellers are required to pay 1847 Neese an amount in cash equal to the deficiency.  The stock purchase agreement contained customary representations, warranties and covenants, including a covenant that the sellers will not compete with the business of Neese for a period of three (3) years following closing. In addition, 1847 Neese agreed that for so long as the sellers beneficially own the purchase price shares, 1847 Neese and Neese shall not do any of the following without the written consent or affirmative vote of the sellers: (i) liquidate, dissolve or wind-up their business and affairs; (ii) effect any merger or consolidation; (iii) sell substantially all of their assets; (iv) amend, alter or repeal any provision of their articles of incorporation or bylaws; (v) create or issue shares of any additional class or series of capital stock, or increase the authorized number of shares of capital stock; (vi) reclassify, alter or amend any existing security that is pari passu with the purchase price shares in respect of the distribution of assets on the liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the payment of dividends or rights of redemption, if such reclassification, alteration or amendment would render such other security senior to the purchase price shares in respect of any such right, preference, or privilege; (vii) purchase or redeem any shares of capital stock other than repurchases of stock from former employees, officers, directors, consultants or other persons who performed services; (viii) incur any aggregate indebtedness in excess of $6 million, other than trade credit incurred in the ordinary course of business;  The stock purchase agreement also contained mutual indemnification for breaches of representations or warranties and failure to perform covenants or obligations contained in the stock purchase agreement. In the case of the indemnification provided by the sellers with respect to breaches of certain non-fundamental representations and warranties, the sellers will only become liable for indemnified losses if the amount exceeds $50,000, whereupon they will be liable for all losses relating back to the first dollar. Furthermore, the liability of the sellers for breaches of certain non-fundamental representations and warranties shall not exceed the cash portion of the purchase price payable under the stock purchase agreement.  Pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, on March 3, 2017, Neese entered into a lease with K&H Holdings, LLC, a limited liability company that is wholly-owned by the sellers. The lease is for a term of ten (10) years and provides for a base rent of $8,333.33 per month. In the event of late payment, interest shall accrue on the unpaid amount at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum. The lease contains customary events of default, including if Neese shall fail to pay rent within five (5) days after the due date, or if Neese shall fail to perform any other terms, covenants or conditions under the Lease, and other customary representations, warranties and covenants.  Purchase Price  The cash portion of the purchase price was financed under a capital lease transaction for Neese's equipment with Utica Leaseco, LLC, or Utica, pursuant to a master lease agreement, dated March 3, 2017, between Utica, and 1847 Neese and Neese, which we refer to collectively as the lessee. Under the master lease agreement, Utica loaned an aggregate of $3,240,000 for certain of Neese's equipment, which it leases to the lessee. The term of the master lease agreement is 51 months.  The lessee is required to pay a monthly rent of $53,000 for the first three months, with such amount increasing to $85,321.63 for the remaining 48 months. A later charge of 10% will be assessed for any rent that not received by the Utica within five (5) calendar days of the due date. In addition, upon demand, a 5% charge will be assessed to any payment not processed or returned on the basis of insufficient funds. The lessee is also required to pay an annual administration fee of $3,000. Upon the expiration of the term of the master lease agreement, the lessee is required to pay, together with all other amounts then due and payable, in cash, an end of term buyout price equal to the lesser of (a) $162,000 (five (5%) percent of the Total Invoice Cost (as defined in the master lease agreement)) or (b) the fair market value of the equipment, as determined by Utica.  Table of Contents  The master lease agreement contains customary events of default, including non-payment of rent or other payment within five (5) days of the due date, failure to maintain, use or operate the equipment in compliance with applicable law, or failure to perform any other terms, covenants or conditions under the master lease agreement.  Provided that no default has occurred and is continuing beyond any applicable grace or cure period, the lessee has an early buy-out option with respect to all but not less than all of the equipment, upon the payment of any outstanding rental payments or other fees then due, plus an additional amount set forth in the master lease agreement, which represents the anticipated fair market value of the equipment.  In connection with the master lease agreement, the lessee granted a security interest on all of its right, title and interest in and to (i) the equipment, together with all related software (embedded therein or otherwise) and general intangibles, all additions, attachments, accessories and accessions thereto whether or not furnished by the supplier; (ii) all accounts, chattel paper, deposit accounts, documents, other equipment, general intangibles, instruments, inventory, investment property, letter of credit rights and any supporting obligations related to any of the foregoing; (iii) all books and records pertaining to the foregoing; (iv) all property of such lessee held by Utica, including all property of every description, in the custody of or in transit to Utica for any purpose, including safekeeping, collection or pledge, for the account of such lessee or as to which such lessee may have any right or power, including but not limited to cash and (v) to the extent not otherwise included, all insurance, substitutions, replacements, exchanges, accessions, proceeds and products of the foregoing.  As noted above, a portion of the purchase price under the stock purchase agreement was paid by the issuance of a vesting promissory note in the principal amount of $1,875,000 by 1847 Neese and Neese to the sellers. Payment of the principal and accrued interest on the vesting note is subject to vesting. The vesting note bears interest on the vested portion of the principal amount at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum and is due and payable in full on June 30, 2020. The principal of the vesting note vests in accordance with an adjusted EBITDA formula contained in the vesting note.  The vesting note contains customary events of default, including in the event of  As noted above, a portion of the purchase price under the stock purchase agreement was paid by the issuance of a short-term promissory note in the principal amount of $1,025,000 by 1847 Neese and Neese to the sellers. The short-term note bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum and is due and payable in full on March 3, 2018; provided, however, that the unpaid principal, and all accrued, but unpaid, interest thereon shall be prepaid if at any time, and from time to time, the cash on hand of 1847 Neese and Neese exceeds $250,000 and, then, the prepayment shall be equal to the amount of cash in excess of $200,000 until the unpaid principal and accrued, but unpaid, interest thereon is fully prepaid. The short-term note contains the same events of default as the vesting note.  Offsetting Management Services Agreement  On March 3, 2017, in connection with the Neese acquisition, our subsidiary 1847 Neese entered into an offsetting management services agreement with our manager.  Pursuant to the offsetting management services agreement, 1847 Neese appointed the manager to provide certain services to it for a quarterly management fee equal to $62,500 per quarter; provided, however, that (i) pro rated payments shall be made in the first quarter and the last quarter of the term, (ii) if the aggregate amount of management fees paid or to be paid by 1847 Neese, together with all other management fees paid or to be paid by all other subsidiaries of the company to the manager, in each case, with respect to any fiscal year exceeds, or is expected to exceed, 9.5% of the company's gross income with respect to such fiscal year, then the management fee to be paid by 1847 Neese for any remaining fiscal quarters in such fiscal year shall be reduced, on a pro rata basis determined by reference to the management fees to be paid to the manager by all of the subsidiaries of the company, until the aggregate amount of the management fee paid or to be paid by 1847 Neese, together with all other management fees paid or to be paid by all other subsidiaries of the company to the manager, in each case, with respect to such fiscal year, does not exceed 9.5% of the company's gross income with respect to such fiscal year, and (iv) if the aggregate amount the management fee paid or to be paid by 1847 Neese, together with all other management fees paid or to be paid by all other subsidiaries of the company to the manager, in each case, with respect to any fiscal quarter exceeds, or is expected to exceed, the aggregate amount of the management fee (before any adjustment thereto) calculated and payable under the management services agreement, which we refer to as the parent management fee, with respect to such fiscal quarter, then the management fee to be paid by 1847 Neese for such fiscal quarter shall be reduced, on a pro rata basis, until the aggregate amount of the management fee paid or to be paid by 1847 Neese, together with all other management fees paid or to be paid by all other subsidiaries of the company to the manager, in each case, with respect to such fiscal quarter, does not exceed the parent management fee calculated and payable with respect to such fiscal quarter.  Table of Contents  1847 Neese shall also reimburse the manager for all costs and expenses of 1847 Neese which are specifically approved by the board of directors of 1847 Neese, including all out-of-pocket costs and expenses, that are actually incurred by the manager or its affiliates on behalf of 1847 Neese in connection with performing services under the offsetting management services agreement.  The services provided by the manager include: conducting general and administrative supervision and oversight of 1847 Neese's day-to-day business and operations, including, but not limited to, recruiting and hiring of personnel, administration of personnel and personnel benefits, development of administrative policies and procedures, establishment and management of banking services, managing and arranging for the maintaining of liability insurance, arranging for equipment rental, maintenance of all necessary permits and licenses, acquisition of any additional licenses and permits that become necessary, participation in risk management policies and procedures; and overseeing and consulting with respect to 1847 Neese's business and operational strategies, the implementation of such strategies and the evaluation of such strategies, including, but not limited to, strategies with respect to capital expenditure and expansion programs, acquisitions or dispositions and product or service lines.  Going Concern Opinion  Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated significant revenues and will incur additional expenses as a result of being a public reporting company. If we are unable to obtain additional working capital our business may fail. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than operations. Historically, our only source for cash has been revenues generated by our indirect subsidiaries PPI Management and Christals Management and investments by our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman in our company. We must raise cash to implement our projected plan of operations.  Emerging Growth Company  We qualify as an "emerging growth company" under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:  � have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;  � comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);  � submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as "say-on-pay" and "say-on-frequency;" and  � disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO's compensation to median employee compensation.  In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.  We will remain an "emerging growth company" for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations  Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue our operation.  We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.  Revenues  We did not generate management fee revenues from our indirect subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $131,250 during the year ended December 31, 2015.  We do not plan to generate revenues apart from those generated by our management consulting business, Neese, and those other businesses that we may acquire in the future. However, we plan on generating interest income on the investment of available funds. The amount of investment income will be dependent upon the available funds and may vary significantly from period to period. Our investment in our management consulting business and in future businesses that we may acquire will be in the form of loans from our company to our management consulting business, as well as equity contributions to that business. Cash flow coming to us will be the result of interest and principal payments on those loans and potentially dividends. However, these loans will be eliminated in consolidation in accordance with GAAP.  Operating Expenses  Our operating expenses primarily consist of cost of professional services and for other fees, costs and expenses. These other expenses will include the cost of audits, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs, directors and officers insurance premiums paid, and tax preparation services.  General and administrative expenses amounted to $269,844 and $342,573 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the years end December 31, 2016 and 2015, quarterly fees equal to $0 and $131,250, respectively, were due and payable to our manager under the management services agreement. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, corporate expenses of $269,844 and $211,323, respectively, were primarily related to office and professional fees. In the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company determined the outstanding receivables are not likely to be collected and consequently wrote-off the balance of $100,000 to bad debt expense.  In addition to the operating expenses discussed above, pursuant to the management services agreement, our company will pay our manager a quarterly management fee equal to 0.5% (2.0% annualized) of our adjusted net assets, which is defined in the management services agreement. By amendment to the management services agreement, in lieu of paying a quarterly management fee under the management services agreement based upon the adjusted net assets of our management consulting business, we will pay our manager a flat quarterly fee equal to $43,750. This amendment only applies to our management consulting business and does not apply to the Neese acquisition and will not apply to any businesses that we acquire in the future. We no longer expect to generate sufficient revenues from our management consulting business to pay our manager a flat quarterly fee of $43,750. We do not expect that our management consulting business will generate sufficient fees to cover the manager's quarterly flat fee, and our manager has agreed verbally that such fee will accrue until sufficient revenues are generated. We also expect that until we begin making acquisitions, all revenues generated from our management consulting business will be used to cover operating expenses, including management fees. The amount of the management fee payable will be reduced by the aggregate amount of any offsetting management fees, if any, received by our manager from any of the businesses that we may acquire in the future. As part of its business strategy, our company intends to acquire additional businesses. We intend to finance our acquisition strategy primarily through a combination of using the funds raised in our public offering, issuing new equity and incurring debt as well as cash generated by operations. Therefore, the net adjusted assets, and the management fee, may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to acquisitions or dispositions of our businesses and performance of our businesses. The growth in the adjusted net assets as defined in the management services agreement will, most likely, increase due to these acquisitions and will increase the management fee regardless of whether such acquisitions contribute positively to our net income. As a result, we anticipate that the management fee will represent a significant percentage of our net income following the acquisition by us of businesses in the future. See the section entitled "Item 1. Business-Our Manager-Our Manager as a Service Provider-Management Fee" for more information about the calculation, an example of such calculation and payment of the management fee and the specific definitions of the terms used in such calculation.  Table of Contents  Operating loss  Our loss amounted to $269,844 and $211,323 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our loss since attributable to the administrative costs and professional fees incurred as there is currently no gross margin generated from our management fee revenue. We have not meaningfully commenced our proposed business operations and will not do so until we have generated sufficient cash from financing.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of December 31, 2016, we had cash of $0 and our current assets were comprised of other assets of $369 and our liabilities were $670,256 comprising $108,878 owed to Ellery W. Roberts, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and accounts payable of $561,378.  Our auditors have issued a "going concern" opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we are successful in acquiring a platform business that has sufficient cash flows or we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from one or more future public or private offerings and implemented our plan of operations.  We intend to raise funds for additional acquisitions primarily through debt financing at our company level, additional equity offerings, the sale of all or a part of our businesses or by undertaking a combination of any of the above. In addition to acquiring businesses, we expect to sell businesses that we own from time to time when attractive opportunities arise.  Our primary use of funds will be for public company expenses including cash . . .  Apr 17, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements  In addition to historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such forward-looking statements. We cannot give any guarantee that the plans, intentions or expectations described in the forward-looking statements will be achieved. All forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those factors described in Item 1A "Risk Factors" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Readers should carefully review such risk factors as well as factors described in other documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "guidance," "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "projects," "potential," "proposed," "intended," or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should read statements that contain these words carefully, because they discuss our expectations about our future operating results or our future financial condition or state other "forward-looking" information. There may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control. You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in our risk factors and other disclosures could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our securities could decline. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, growth rates, and levels of activity, performance or achievements.

Table of Contents  Overview  We currently operate a small consulting and advisory services business with plans to acquire additional small to medium size businesses in a variety of different industries. Through our structure, we plan to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the ownership and growth of a portfolio of businesses that traditionally have been owned and managed by private equity firms, private individuals or families, financial institutions or large conglomerates. We believe that our management and acquisition strategies will allow us to achieve our goals of growing distributions to our shareholders and increasing shareholder value over time.  On September 15, 2013, our subsidiary, 1847 Management, acquired a 50% interest in each of PPI Management and Christals Management from our Chief Executive Officer and controlling shareholder, Ellery W. Roberts. In connection with the acquisition of such equity interests from Mr. Roberts, we issued to Mr. Roberts 65,625,000 of our common shares pursuant to a securities purchase agreement, dated September 15, 2013, between our company and Mr. Roberts. Each of PPI Management and Christals Management are management consulting and advisory firms. Mr. Roberts is a manager of each of PPI Management and Christals Management and is responsible for providing consulting and advisory services to the clients of PPI Management and Christals Management. We also acquired these business interests in an attempt to minimize future conflicts of interest involving the splitting of Mr. Roberts's business time. Mr. Roberts and the board of directors of our company determined that it would be in the best interests of our company to acquire such interests in PPI Management and Christals Management so that our company can operate such management consulting and advisory businesses and so Mr. Roberts's business time will not be diverted away from the business and affairs of our company.  Although we expect to continue to operate our management consulting business and generate revenues therefrom, we do not intend to expand our management consulting business by seeking new clients at this time. Instead, we plan to focus all of our efforts (other than efforts necessary to operate PPI Management and Christals Management) on identifying a platform acquisition, raising capital necessary to consummate a platform acquisition after it is identified, and completing a platform acquisition after the necessary capital is raised.  PPI Management acts as an advisor to PPI Acquisition Holdings, LLC, or PPI Acquisition, pursuant to an advisory agreement with PPI Acquisition. Under the advisory agreement, PPI Management provides PPI Acquisition and its subsidiary, Pawn Plus, Inc., or Pawn Plus, with management and consulting services in consideration for an advisory fee. Similarly, Christals Management acts as an advisor to Peekay Acquisition, LLC, or Peekay, pursuant to an advisory agreement with Peekay. The Christals advisory agreement is very similar to the PPI Management advisory agreement. Under the Christals advisory agreement, Christals Management provides Peekay and its subsidiaries with the same kind of management and consulting services that PPI Management provides to PPI Acquisition and Pawn Plus and Christals Management also receives fees for providing these services.  Under our advisory agreement with Peekay, Christals Management generates annual revenues of $250,000 per year payable quarterly. Since 1847 Management owns 50% of Christals Management, 1847 Management is entitled to 50% of the aggregate $250,000 in compensation under the Christals advisory agreement, or $125,000 per year. This amount is paid to Christals Management in quarterly installments. Under our advisory agreement with PPI Acquisition, PPI Management is entitled to a fee equal to 5.75% of PPI Acquisition's EBITDA, payable as follows: (i) 3.75% of EBITDA for any fiscal quarter is payable quarterly in advance and (ii) the difference between 5.75% of EBITDA for any fiscal year and the aggregate quarterly payments previously paid with respect to fiscal quarters in such fiscal year, payable yearly in arrears.  On November 19, 2015, Christals Management entered into a termination agreement with Peekay and CP IV, the other consultant that is party to the advisory agreement with Peekay. The termination agreement terminates the advisory agreement between Christals Management, CP IV and Peekay effective as of the closing of Peekay's public offering, which is currently ongoing. Upon the closing of such offering, the termination agreement obligates Peekay to pay Christals Management and CP IV all accrued, but unpaid, fees then owed under the advisory agreement and to reimburse Christals Management and CP IV for any unreimbursed expenses through the date of the closing of Peekay's public offering. After the closing of Peekay's public offering, neither Christals Management nor Peekay will have any further obligations under the advisory agreement. After entering into the termination agreement with Peekay in order to accommodate Peekay so that it could satisfy the requirements of its senior lender Christals Management agreed that it would further postpone receipt of any remaining accrued fees or unreimbursed expenses through the date that Peekay repays amounts owed to its senior lenders under its senior credit facility. As of June 30, 2016, the Company is due accrued fees in the amount of $100,000 from Peekay and Christals Management.  Table of Contents  We expect to generate revenues through the provision by our indirect subsidiaries, PPI Management and Christals Management, of management consulting services to two clients under separate advisory agreements. Since we only hold a 50% interest in each of PPI Management and Christals Management, we will be entitled to 50% of the revenues and net income of PPI Management and Christals Management.  Our cash balance is $85 as of June 30, 2016. Our current cash balance will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months if we are unable to successfully borrow money from our affiliates or raise money from third parties. We will need funding from third parties or from our affiliates in order to achieve our business plan goals. The minimum amount of financing that we need in the next 12 months to continue operations is estimated to be $150,000. Our current operations are solely dependent on personal loans and capital contributions from our principal executive officer. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Ellery W. Roberts, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to cover our expenses pending our initial platform acquisition. There is no a maximum amount of funds that Mr. Roberts has agreed to advance. Mr. Roberts has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to our company. In order to achieve our business plan goals, we will need to raise additional capital.  Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated significant revenues and will incur additional expenses as a result of being a public reporting company. If we are unable to obtain additional working capital our business may fail. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources other than operations. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman in our company. We must raise cash to implement our projected plan of operations.  We qualify as an "emerging growth company" under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:  � have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;  � comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);  � submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as "say-on-pay" and "say-on-frequency;" and  � disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO's compensation to median employee compensation.  In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.  We will remain an "emerging growth company" for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.  Table of Contents  Option Agreement and Servicing Agreement  On September 11, 2015, we entered into an option agreement with Jarrod Clarke and Jarrod Clarke Holdings, Inc. (collectively referred to herein as the Money Train Members) and Money Train Title Loans, LLC, or Money Train, and On Track LLC (collectively referred to herein as the Money Train Companies), pursuant to which the Money Train Members and the Money Train Companies agreed to grant us or any designee an option to purchase either, but not both, of (i) all of the equity of the Money Train Companies or (ii) up to all the assets of each of the Money Train Companies together with certain liabilities of each of the Companies, to be more fully defined based upon mutual agreement of the parties. The option may be exercised until the one-year anniversary of the servicing agreement described below. The option exercise price will be equal to either (i) four (4) times the aggregate six-month trailing EBITDA of the Money Train Companies (on an annualized basis) as of the date of determination, subject to adjustment for purposes of the option agreement to add back to earnings the amount of salary paid to Jarrod Clarke during the applicable period, or (ii) $6 million, whichever is greater, unless the Money Train Members and Money Train Companies consent otherwise.  In addition, on September 11, 2015, Monrovia Auto Finance and Money Train entered into a broker services and loan administration and servicing Agreement, which we refer to herein as the servicing agreement. The purpose of the servicing agreement is to set forth the terms and conditions which will govern certain business activities and transactions to be provided by Money Train, as broker-servicer, and Monrovia Auto Finance, as lender, to borrowers and prospective borrowers seeking loans. Money Train has developed a broker services program pursuant to applicable New Mexico consumer credit laws and regulations under which Money Train may provide broker services including but not limited to assisting borrowers in obtaining loans. Monrovia Auto Finance may make installment loans to borrowers secured by a first lien in the borrowers' motor vehicle in accordance with applicable New Mexico consumer credit laws and regulations. Money Train desires to offer its broker-servicer program to borrowers who may be interested in the loan program.  Under the servicing agreement, the parties agreed that the loan program shall consist of the origination, funding, and collection of loans in accordance with program guidelines to borrowers at such locations in the State of New Mexico as Money Train, as broker-servicer, may designate from time to time. The parties agreed that Monrovia Auto Finance will act as lender under the loan program and shall have sole responsibility for establishing credit and underwriting criteria for the loans, making the decisions as to whether or not to make loans to prospective borrowers, funding the loans, and, subject to the timely performance of Money Train's broker-servicer obligations, managing the loan program in accordance with Monrovia Auto Finance's express obligations under the servicing agreement and the program guidelines. Except as expressly provided in the servicing agreement, (a) nothing therein will be deemed to commit Monrovia Auto Finance to originate or fund any particular level or number of loans, and (b) Monrovia Auto Finance made no representation as to the amount of funding it will be able to raise for the loans. In the event defaulted loans are equal to or greater than twenty-two percent (22%) of the outstanding principal balance of the loan portfolio from time to time, Monrovia Auto Finance has the option, in its sole discretion, to immediately suspend the origination and funding of loans without notice.  Under the servicing agreement, Money Train's responsibility will be to act as a "loan broker and loan servicer" on behalf of consumers and Monrovia Auto Finance in accordance with the laws of the State of New Mexico. Money Train's sole compensation under the servicing agreement broker program will be the fee paid to it by Monrovia Auto Finance to be defined in the program guidelines. Money Train will enter into separate broker agreements with borrowers. It will have the sole discretion to determine whether to offer any consumer the opportunity to apply for a loan. Money Train has no obligation to submit a minimum number of loan applications from borrowers to Monrovia Auto Finance or broker any level or number of applicants, and has sole discretion to approve or deny broker services to any prospective borrower.  The parties to the servicing agreement will generally be responsible for their own costs and expenses and for preparing their own respective program materials and advertising materials. However, Monrovia Auto Finance will be responsible for the cost of any radio or television advertisements that the parties mutually agree upon.  The servicing agreement loan and broker programs were to commence on October 1, 2015, subject to the parties having requisite licensing, software and systems in place by this date. As of the date of this report, we have not obtained the required license and as a result the servicing agreement loan and broker programs have not yet been initiated. Either party may terminate the agreement upon default by the other party. Each party may also terminate immediately if it determines that the servicing agreement or programs under it are illegal, a regulatory authority requires termination, the party determines in its reasonable discretion that the servicing agreement programs may materially adversely affect its operations or relationship with a regulatory authority. In addition, each party may terminate the servicing agreement upon ninety (90) days' prior written notice. However, the parties' obligations with respect to outstanding loans will remain in effect for so long as such loans remain outstanding, notwithstanding termination. In addition, if Money Train terminates the servicing agreement without cause, it will continue to service outstanding loans for up to one year after termination so that Monrovia Auto Finance may engage a replacement servicer for the loans.  Table of Contents  Critical Accounting Policies  The following discussion relates to critical accounting policies for our company and our management consulting business. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, will require us to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and judgments and uncertainties, and potentially could result in materially different results under different conditions. Our critical accounting policies are discussed below. These policies are generally consistent with the accounting policies followed by our management consulting business. Our board of directors will review these critical accounting policies.  Supplemental Put Provision  Our operating agreement contains a supplemental put provision pursuant to which our manager has the right to cause our company to purchase the allocation shares then owned by our manager upon termination of the management services agreement with our manager for a price to be determined in accordance with and subject to the conditions provided in the put provision. The allocation shares will be recorded at their redemption value as a result of the allocation shareholder's ability to require our company to purchase the allocation shares upon exercise of the supplemental put. The allocation shares will be reflected outside of permanent equity in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet at the closing of our public offering. The change in value of the allocation shares will be recorded through the income statement as a dividend between net income and net income available to common shareholders. The redemption value of the allocation shares is largely related to the fair value of the profit allocation that our manager, as holder of the allocation shares, will receive. The valuation of the allocation shares requires the use of complex models, which are produced based on highly sensitive assumptions and estimates. The impact of over-estimating or under-estimating the redemption value of the allocation shares could have a material adverse effect on future operating results. In addition, the value of the allocation shares will be subject to the volatility of our company's operations, which may result in significant period-to-period fluctuations in the amount recorded for the allocation shares.  Manager's Profit Allocation  We are obligated to pay our manager, as holder of the allocation shares, a profit allocation, which will be paid as a distribution on the allocation shares. The profit allocation to be paid to our manager is intended to reflect a sharing of the distributions we make to our shareholders in excess of an annual hurdle rate.  The profit allocation will be accounted for as a dividend recorded through equity and not as an expense through the statement of operations. However, the dividend will be recorded between net income and net income available to common shareholders. The profit allocation will be recorded quarterly based on the change in the amount payable to the allocation shareholder.  Revenue Recognition  Our company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. Our company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the product has been shipped or the services, including installation services, have been provided to the customer, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Provisions for customer returns and other allowances based on historical experience are recognized at the time the related sale is recognized.  Business Combinations  The acquisition of our management consulting business and any future acquisitions of controlling interest in other businesses will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting as provided under GAAP. The amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in connection with each acquisition will be based on their respective estimated fair values as of the date of acquisitions with the remainder, if any, to be recorded as goodwill. The fair values will be determined by our management team, taking into consideration information supplied by our manager's operating partners, the management of the acquired entities and other relevant information. The determination of fair values requires significant judgment by our management team, which may consult with outside consultants on future acquisitions to assist in the process. This judgment could result in either higher or lower value being assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets, which could result in either higher or lower amortization or depreciation expense.  Table of Contents  Goodwill and Intangible Assets  Significant intangible assets that will be acquired in connection with the future acquisition by us of businesses will likely include customer relationships, trade names, trademarks and goodwill.  Trade names and trademarks acquired in the contemplated acquisition are amortized over their respective lives or, in some cases, may be considered indefinite life intangibles, which are not amortizable pursuant to GAAP. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization. The intangibles acquired in the contemplated transaction that will be subject to amortization are customer relationships and will be amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets, which we will determine based on the consideration of several factors including historical customer turnover rates. Intangible assets are required to be assessed for impairment annually, or more often in certain circumstances, in accordance with ASC 350 Intangible Goodwill and Other Assets.  The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process, which will require management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value . . .  Aug 22, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
