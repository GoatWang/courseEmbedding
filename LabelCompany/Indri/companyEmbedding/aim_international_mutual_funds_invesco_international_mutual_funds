		Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. 


Performance shown at NAV does not include applicable front-end or CDSC sales charges, which would have reduced the performance.


		
		Performance figures reflect reinvested distributions and changes in net asset value (NAV) and the effect of the maximum sales charge unless otherwise stated.


		
		YTD returns are cumulative.

			As of 06/30/2017 the Fund had an overall rating of 3 stars out of 576 funds and was rated 2 stars out of 576 funds, 3 stars out of 502 funds and 3 stars out of 370 funds for the 3-, 5- and 10- year periods, respectively.
		

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

Fact Sheet








 About risk
			 


Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund's foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always successful.
Growth Investing Risk. Growth stocks tend to be more expensive relative to the issuing company's earnings or assets compared with other types of stock. As a result, they tend to be more sensitive to changes in, or investors' expectations of, the issuing company's earnings and can be more volatile.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.
Mid-Capitalization Risk. Mid-capitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions and may have more limited product lines and markets, less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies. These companies' securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies, and their returns may vary, sometimes significantly, from the overall securities market.

Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc.

The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower.

 About risk
			 


Depositary Receipts Risk. Investing in depositary receipts involves the same risks as direct investments in foreign securities. In addition, the underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts are under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications or pass through any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities to the holders of such receipts. The Fund may therefore receive less timely information or have less control than if it invested directly in the foreign issuer.
Derivatives Risk. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on (and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency, commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, including counterparty, leverage and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the Fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract. Derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative. As a result, an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the Fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative, which may make the Fund's returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss. Derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the Fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price. This risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions, during which the Fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions. Derivatives may also be harder to value, less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the Fund's ability to use certain derivatives or their cost. Also, derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits, particularly during adverse market conditions.
Emerging Markets Securities Risk. Emerging markets (also referred to as developing markets) are generally subject to greater market volatility, political, social and economic instability, uncertain trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed markets. In addition, emerging markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than companies in more developed markets. Securities law and the enforcement of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change quickly and unpredictably. In addition, investments in emerging markets securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs, delays in settlement procedures, and lack of timely information.
Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund's foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always successful.
Geographic Focus Risk. The Fund may from time to time invest a substantial amount of its assets in securities of issuers located in a single country or a limited number of countries. Adverse economic, political or social conditions in those countries may therefore have a significant negative impact on the Fund's investment performance.
Growth Investing Risk. Growth stocks tend to be more expensive relative to the issuing company's earnings or assets compared with other types of stock. As a result, they tend to be more sensitive to changes in, or investors' expectations of, the issuing company's earnings and can be more volatile.
Investing in the European Union Risk. Investments in certain countries in the European Union are susceptible to high economic risks associated with high levels of debt, such as investments in sovereign debt of Greece, Italy and Spain. Separately, the European Union faces issues involving its membership, structure, procedures and policies. The exit of one or more member states from the European Union would place its currency and banking system in jeopardy. Efforts of the member states to further unify their economic and monetary policies may increase the potential for the downward movement of one member state's market to cause a similar effect on other member states' markets.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.
Mid-Capitalization Companies Risk. Mid-capitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions and may have more limited product lines and markets, less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies. These companies' securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies, and their returns may vary, sometimes significantly, from the overall securities market.
Preferred Securities Risk. Preferred securities are subject to issuer-specific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities. Preferred securities also may be subordinated to bonds or other debt instruments, subjecting them to a greater risk of non-payment, may be less liquid than many other securities, such as common stocks, and generally offer no voting rights with respect to the issuer.

 Executive Remuneration




































Our equity investment philosophy is centered on generating capital appreciation for the investor. The primary emphasis is on providing the investor with a degree of capital appreciation, superior to that of the returns from the equity class as represented by a market index over the longer term. Our core investment premise is that the equity markets are not completely efficient. A well-organized and thorough research effort combined with a disciplined portfolio management approach will enable out performance of the market index over time.  A key pillar of our disciplined approach is to stay true to the mandate of the specific fund as specified in the offer document under all circumstances. This is key to generating superior performance over time even though there could be times when staying true to the mandate may result in short-term underperformance. Our investment philosophy is a matrix framework of Company, Industry, Economic and Technical analysis. The equity team will provide many of the inputs for this framework, but we will also use inputs from external sources as and when required. This open framework is combined with an environment that encourages regular and constant debate; which we believe leads to superior decision making.      Stock categorization system The objective of our stock categorization system is to enable us to identify stocks that are likely to be the best investments from within our universe. Each category of stock has a description of fundamental attributes that we expect the company to possess. The categorizations are as follows:     Stock 
            Category Descriptions 
            (eg.) Growth
            Prospects (eg.) Company Attribute

            efficiency, globally
            competitive Profit leverage   *  P2P - Path to Profit, ROE - Return on Equity   Stocks that fit into one of these categories typically display superior return profiles, but more importantly this enables fund managers to focus on the attributes that drive stock price performance and keep a watch for red flags.     








 The philosophy for managing fixed income portfolios revolves around optimizing risk adjusted returns for the investor by investing in high quality credit assets, managing interest rate risk and minimizing liquidity risk.  Our fixed income investment philosophy is based on a top down research oriented model with focus on economic data analysis. We strive to generate optimized risk adjusted returns by providing for safety of capital, liquidity of funds and investment income for the investors. The portfolios are actively managed for both the interest rate risk, credit and  liquidity risk. The interest rate risk is managed across duration buckets and portfolio composition is managed through active asset allocation across credits and the liquidity risk through a well-diversified portfolio.  The investment team follows a disciplined research oriented investment process to meet fund-specific investment objectives on a long-term investment horizon. The fund manager strives for outperforming the benchmark by selecting
superior credits, based on the in-house analytical credit research and interest rate direction calls without compromising
on the liquidity risk.  The credit risk assessment constitutes an integral part of the investment process and is carried out across sectors covering manufacturing, finance and services. By applying the credit model, we determine and monitor the credit worthiness of an issuer and assess the credit exposure limit. Our internal credit rating acts as a powerful risk containment tool that allow the fund manager to narrow down select credits to match the credit strategies of individual funds.

                                    SEBI vide its circular reference no. SEBI/IMD/Cir No.18/198647/2010 dated March
                                    15, 2010 has stated that mutual fund should play an active role in ensuring better
                                    corporate governance of listed companies. The said circular stated that the AMCs
                                    should disclose their general policies and procedures for exercising the voting
                                    rights in respect of shares held by them.

                                    Subsequently, SEBI vide its circular ref. no. CIR/IMD/DF/05/2014 dated March 24,
                                    2014 and SEBI/HO/IMD/DF2/CIR/P/2016/68 dated August 10, 2016 have amended certain
                                    provisions of above mentioned circular specifying additional compliance / disclosure
                                    requirements with respect to exercise of voting rights by mutual funds.

                                    This policy is drafted in pursuance of SEBI circular dated March 15, 2010 read with
                                    March 24, 2014 and August 10, 2016 and provides general philosophy, broad guidelines
                                    and procedures for exercising voting rights.

                                    Invesco Asset Management (India) Limited (“IAMI”) is an Investment Manager to the
                                    scheme(s) of Invesco Mutual Fund (“the Fund”). As an investment manager, IAMI has
                                    fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interest of unit-holders of the Fund.
                                    This responsibility includes exercising voting rights attached to the securities
                                    of the companies in which the schemes of the Fund invest. It will be IAMI’s endeavor
                                    to participate in the voting process (i.e. exercise voting rights) based on the
                                    philosophy enunciated in this policy.


                                 











                                        Philosophy of Voting Policy

                                         




                             









                                    Good corporate governance ensures that a corporation is managed keeping in mind
                                    the long-term interest of shareholders. Promoting good corporate governance standards
                                    forms an integral part of corporate ownership responsibilities.
                                

                                    With this in the forefront, IAMI expects all corporations, in which it invests in,
                                    to comply with high corporate governance standards. Accordingly, as the decision
                                    to invest is generally an endorsement of sound management practices, IAMI may generally
                                    vote with the management of these corporations. However, when IAMI is of the view
                                    that the unit holders will be prejudiced by any such proposal, then it may vote
                                    against such proposal to protect the interest of unit holders. Also in case of resolutions
                                    moved by the shareholders of the company, IAMI will exercise its voting rights in
                                    the best interest of its unit holders. In certain circumstances, IAMI may also decide
                                    to refrain from voting where it has insufficient information or there is conflict
                                    of interest or it does not have a clear stance on the proposal under consideration.
                                

                                    IAMI, as an investment manager, will generally vote in accordance with the Voting
                                    Policy. However, it may deviate from the policy if there are particular facts and/or
                                    circumstances that warrant for such deviation to protect the interests of unit-holders
                                    of the Fund.
                                


                                 











                                        Conflict of Interest in Exercising Voting Rights

                                         




                             









                                    IAMI, under schemes, may invest in the securities of associate/group companies (to
                                    the extent permitted under SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996). Further, IAMI
                                    is an affiliate of a diverse financial services organization consisting of many
                                    affiliates. Moreover IAMI under schemes may invest in securities of companies which
                                    have invested in schemes of Invesco Mutual Fund. Such scenarios may lead to a situation
                                    creating conflict of interest.
                                

                                    In a situation where an investee company, an affiliate or associate/group company
                                    were to approach IAMI with regard to a particular voting decision then such matter
                                    will be referred to the Voting Committee.
                                

                                    IAMI will attempt to avoid conflict of interest and will exercise its voting rights
                                    in the best interest of the unit-holders. Voting decisions in such cases will be
                                    based on merits without any bias and the same parameters will be applied for taking
                                    voting decisions as are applied for other companies.
                                


                                 











                                        Voting Policy Guidelines
                                    

                                         




                             










                                    The matters regarding, but not limited to, which the IAMI may exercise the voting
                                    rights in the Annual General Meeting (AGMs) /Extra Ordinary General Meeting (EGMs)/
                                    Through Postal Ballots/Electronic voting of the investee companies are as follows:
                                


Corporate governance matters, including changes in the state of incorporation, merger
                                            and other corporate restructuring and anti- takeover provisions.
Changes to capital structure, including increase and decrease of capital and preferred
                                            stock issuances.
Stock option plans and other management compensation issues.
Social and corporate responsibility issues.
Appointment and Removal of Directors.
Any other issue that may affect the interest of the shareholders in general and
                                            interest of the unit-holders in particular.


                                    IAMI will exercise voting rights keeping in mind the need to improve economic value
                                    of the companies and importance of protecting the interests of unit holders of its
                                    schemes but subject to importance of the matter and cost/time implications. The
                                    analysts in equity team will make recommendations on key voting issues and same
                                    will be approved by the Head of Equity or in his absence by the Fund Manager. In
                                    case of conflicts or need for a clearer direction, the matter may be referred to
                                    the Voting Committee for its guidance.

                                    As a guiding principle, IAMI shall exercise voting rights solely in the interest
                                    of unit holders of the Fund. IAMI has constituted a Voting Committee (VC). The Committee
                                    is empowered to provide guidance on the voting matters referred to it, establish
                                    voting guidelines and procedures as it may consider necessary and is responsible
                                    to ensure that these guidelines and procedures are adhered to and also make changes
                                    in the Policy as may be required from time to time. The members of this Committee
                                    are as follows:

Head of Fixed Income and/ or Fund Managers (fixed income) 
Any other representative as the Committee may co-opt from time to time 


                                    Broad Guidelines for functioning of Voting Committee are:
                                


Voting Committee may record its decisions by circulation including decisions/guidance
                                            on voting matters that have been referred to it. 
Voting Committee may consult with outside experts and other investors on issues
                                            as it may deem fit 
Decisions of Voting Committee should be maintained by compliance 
Details of voting decisions taken by the Fund Management team will be presented
                                            to the Voting Committee/Investment Committee. 
Voting Committee may review this policy from time to time. 



                                 











                                        Steps (Procedure) in Exercising Voting Rights
                                    

                                         




                             










                                    The following points outline the key steps in exercising Voting rights:


Notification of company AGMs / EGMs and relevant voting items to Fund Management
                                            Team.
The IAMI shall endeavor to vote for all holdings of the Fund, aggregated for all
                                            its schemes, but subject to the importance of the matter and the cost/time implications.
                                            The voting will cover all equity holding across all schemes of Invesco Mutual Fund.
Custodian will send ballots and or other relevant papers (notice of meeting, proxy
                                            form, attendance slips etc.) to IAMI relating to AGM/EGM as soon as it receives.
The fund management team is authorized to decide on voting decisions but may refer
                                            decisions to the Voting Committee for its guidance/direction.
Based on internal discussion within the fund management team, a decision would be
                                            arrived at as to whether IAMI should vote on the proposed resolution. Routine matters
                                            and ordinary resolutions like adoption of financials (unless there are significant
                                            auditor qualifications), dividend declaration, general updating/corrective amendments
                                            to the Articles of Association would also be considered for voting purpose. However
                                            IAMI may on a case to case basis, not vote on such resolutions, if it deems fit
                                            to do so.
Proposed resolutions would be discussed within the fund management team and decision
                                            would be taken on whether to vote (“for”/”against”) or “abstain” from voting. IAMI
                                            may abstain from voting on proposals that do not have a readily determinable financial
                                            impact on shareholder value and/or matters for which disclosure is inadequate. For
                                            the remaining proposals, IAMI would vote either “for” or “against” based on overall
                                            merits and demerits of the proposed resolution. IAMI will generally support and
                                            vote “for” proposals which are likely to result in maximizing long-term investment
                                            returns for unit holders. IAMI would not support and will vote “against” proposals
                                            that appear to be detrimental to the company financials / interest of the minority
                                            shareholders or which would adversely impact shareholders’ value.
IAMI may exercise its voting rights by authorising its own executives/authorized
                                            representative to attend the AGM/EGM or may instruct the Custodian to exercise voting
                                            rights in accordance with the instructions of IAMI.
IAMI may exercise its voting rights through Postal Ballot or may use Electronic
                                            voting mechanism, wherever available, either through its own executives or by authorizing
                                            the Custodian. The records of voting exercised through Postal Ballot will be maintained
                                            by IAMI.
IAMI may utilize the services of third party professional agencies for getting in-depth
                                            analyses of proposals and vote recommendations. However, the recommendations of
                                            the third party agencies will be non-binding in nature. IAMI will perform due diligence
                                            on proxy voting advisory firms at the time of initial selection as well as at the
                                            time of renewal of services of the proxy voting. The due diligence will be carried
                                            out on parameters viz. resource strength, Companies under coverage, extent of institutional
                                            ownership, depth of analysis, quality of advice / recommendations, analyst access
                                            & support, timely availability of reports, composition of board of directors, advisory
                                            board and top management, web-based interface platform and clientele. 
The rationale supporting each voting decision (For, Against and Abstain) will be
                                            recorded and such records will be retained for number of years (currently 8 years)
                                            as may be required under the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 from time to
                                            time.

Notification of company AGMs / EGMs and relevant voting items to Fund Management
                                            Team.
The IAMI shall endeavor to vote for all holdings of the Fund, aggregated for all
                                            its schemes, but subject to the importance of the matter and the cost/time implications.
                                            The voting will cover all equity holding across all schemes of Invesco Mutual Fund.
Custodian will send ballots and or other relevant papers (notice of meeting, proxy
                                            form, attendance slips etc.) to IAMI relating to AGM/EGM as soon as it receives.
The fund management team is authorized to decide on voting decisions but may refer
                                            decisions to the voting committee for its guidance/direction.
Based on internal discussion within the fund management team, a decision would be
                                            arrived at as to whether IAMI should attend the meeting and/or vote on the proposed
                                            resolution. IAMI would not vote for resolutions/matters pertaining to its equity
                                            holdings in quant based funds (arbitrage and Agile). Moreover routine matters and
                                            ordinary resolutions like adoption of financials (unless there are significant auditor
                                            qualifications), dividend declaration, general updating/corrective amendments to
                                            the Articles of Association would be ignored for voting purpose. However IAMI may
                                            on a case to case basis, vote on such resolutions, if it deems fit to do so.
Proposed resolutions which screen through the above criteria would be discussed
                                            within the fund management team and decision would be taken on whether to vote (“for“/“against“)
                                            or “abstain“ from voting. IAMI may abstain from voting on proposals
                                            that do not have a readily determinable financial impact on shareholder value and/or
                                            matters for which disclosure is inadequate. For the remaining proposals, IAMI would
                                            vote either “for“ or “against“ based on overall merits and
                                            demerits of the proposed resolution. IAMI will generally support and vote “for“
                                            proposals which are likely to result in maximizing long-term investment returns
                                            for unit holders. IAMI would not support and vote “against“ proposals
                                            that appear to be detrimental to the company financials / interest of the minority
                                            shareholders, which would adversely impact shareholders value.
IAMI may authorize either its own executives/authorized representative to attend
                                            the AGM/EGM to exercise the voting rights or may instruct the Custodian to exercise
                                            voting rights in accordance with the instructions of IAMI. Proof of such authorization
                                            will be maintained by the Deutsche Bank.
Record of matters on which voting rights were exercised will be maintained by Deutsche
                                            Bank and will be subject to internal audit.
Requisite disclosure will be placed before the Board of Religare Invesco AMC and
                                            Religare Invesco Trustee Company on a quarterly basis or such other frequency as
                                            the VC may consider appropriate.
Report on actual exercise of voting rights will be placed on the website of the
                                            Fund (www.invescomutualfund.com)
                                            and also in the annual report sent to the unit holders on an annual basis.

Vanguard international funds


Give your money a passport to overseas markets.




Expand your investment opportunities



International mutual funds add diversification to a U.S.-focused portfolio by giving you access to hundreds—sometimes thousands—of foreign securities, which spreads out risk more than owning just domestic stocks.In general, we suggest that at least 20% of your portfolio be invested in international stocks and bonds.

Get broad exposure to international markets



You can use just a few funds to invest overseas. Each of these funds gives you access to a wide variety of international securities in a single, diversified fund.

Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund holds more than 5,500 non-U.S. stocks.

Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund holds about 3,000 non-U.S. bonds.

How to choose an international mutual fund



There are a few ways you can invest in foreign markets:

International funds invest only in foreign markets, excluding the United States.

Global or world funds combine investments in foreign markets and the United States.

Regional funds focus primarily on a specific part of the world, like Europe or the Pacific region.

Developed markets funds invest in foreign countries considered to have proven economies, like Japan, France, and the United Kingdom.

Emerging markets funds target countries with "developing" economies, like India, Brazil, and Taiwan.

Would you prefer index or active funds?



Do you feel more comfortable tracking the market, or would you rather try to beat it?

Index funds try to track the performance of a specific market benchmark.

Actively managed funds are steered by our expert portfolio managers who select specific securities for the fund. While these funds give you a chance to beat the benchmark, they can also underperform.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

Past performance cannot be used to predict future returns. Fund share prices will fluctuate, so investors could lose money if they sell when prices have fallen.
You must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares through a broker like Vanguard Brokerage Services (we offer them commission-free) or through another broker (you may incur commissions). See the Vanguard Brokerage Services commission and fee schedules for limits. Vanguard ETF Shares aren't redeemable directly with the issuing fund other than very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Like stocks, ETFs are subject to market volatility. When buying or selling an ETF, you'll pay or receive the current market price, which may be more or less than net asset value.
