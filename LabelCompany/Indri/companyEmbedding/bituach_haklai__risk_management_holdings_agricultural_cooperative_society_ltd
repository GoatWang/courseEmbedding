Agriculture co-operative societies
An agricultural cooperative, also known as a farmers' co-op, is a cooperative where farmers pool their resources in certain areas of activity.
 A broad typology of agricultural cooperatives distinguishes between agricultural service cooperatives, which provide various services to their individually farming members, and agricultural production cooperatives, where production resources (land, machinery) are pooled and members farm jointly. Agricultural production cooperatives are relatively rare in the world, and known examples are limited to collective farms in former socialist countries and the kibbutzim in Israel. Worker cooperatives provide an example of production cooperatives outside agriculture.
 The default meaning of agricultural cooperative in English is usually an agricultural service cooperative, which is the numerically dominant form in the world. There are two primary types of agricultural service cooperatives, supply cooperative and marketing cooperative. Supply cooperatives supply their members with inputs for agricultural production, including seeds, fertilizers, fuel, and machinery services. Marketing cooperatives are established by farmers to undertake transformation, packaging, distribution, and marketing of farm products (both crop and livestock). Farmers also widely rely on credit cooperatives as a source of financing for both working capital and investments.
Why farmers form cooperatives
Cooperatives as a form of business organization are distinct from the more common investor-owned firms (IOFs). Both are organized as corporations, but IOFs pursue profit maximization objectives, whereas cooperatives strive to maximize the benefits they generate for their members (which usually involves zero-profit operation). Agricultural cooperatives are therefore created in situations where farmers cannot obtain essential services from IOFs (because the provision of these services is judged to be unprofitable by the IOFs), or when IOFs provide the services at disadvantageous terms to the farmers (i.e., the services are available, but the profit-motivated prices are too high for the farmers). The former situations are characterized in economic theory as market failure or missing services motive. The latter drive the creation of cooperatives as a competitive yardstick or as a means of allowing farmers to build countervailing market power to oppose the IOFs. The concept of competitive yardstick implies that farmers, faced with unsatisfactory performance by IOFs, may form a cooperative firm whose purpose is to force the IOFs, through competition, to improve their service to farmers.
 A practical motivation for the creation of agricultural cooperatives is sometimes described as "overcoming the curse of smallness". A cooperative, being an association of a large number of small farmers, acts as a large business entity in the market, reaping the significant advantages of economies of scale that are not available to its members individually. Three typical examples are a machinery pool, a marketing cooperative, and a credit union. A family farm may be too small to justify the purchase of a tractor or another piece of farm machinery for its own use; a machinery pool is a cooperative that purchases the necessary equipment for the joint use of all its members as needed. A small farm does not always have the means of transportation necessary for delivering its produce to the market, or else the small volume of its production may put it in an unfavorable negotiating position with respect to intermediaries and wholesalers; a cooperative will act as an integrator, collecting the output of its small members and delivering it in large aggregated quantities downstream through the marketing channels. A small farmer may be charged relatively high interest rates by commercial banks, which are mindful of high transaction costs on small loans, or may be refused credit altogether due to lack of collateral; a farmers' credit union will be able to raise loan funds at advantageous rates from commercial banks because of its large associative size and will then distribute loans to its members on the strength of mutual or peer-pressure guarantees for repayment.
 An Integrated Automation Solution for Primary Agricultural Co-operative Societies (PACS) 
 One of the major concerns in any developing economy is the efficacy of the rural financing systems that advances credit to its large population of rural poor. Such operations are plagued by small size of the loans, inadequate risk profiling of loanee, large volume of transactions, non-standardized operations, and difficulty in monitoring credit disbursal and collection.
 Nelito's MFin brings the benefit of computerization into the field of micro-finance that helps to achieve the following: - 




Reduction in operational cost

Agriculture cooperatives 

 Various development activities in agriculture, small industry marketing and processing, distribution and supplies are now carried on through co-operatives. the co-operatives in the State have made an all-round progress and their role in, and contribution to agricultural progress has particularly been significant. The schemes regarding the construction of godowns and the conversion of villages into model villages.
 The Co-operative Movement was introduced into India by the Government as the only method by which the farmers could overcome their burden of debt and keep them away from the clutches of the money-lenders. The Co-operative Credit Societies Act, 1904 was passed by the Government of India and rural credit societies were formed . Through the appointment of registrars and through vigorous propaganda, the Government attempted to popularize the Movement in the rural areas. Within a short period, the Government realized some of the shortcomings of the 1904 Act and, therefore, passed a more comprehensive Act, known as the Co-operative Societies Act of 1912. 
The primary agriculture credit societies
The agricultural co-operative credit structure in the Punjab State is broadly divided into two sectors, one dealing with the short-terms and medium-terms finance and the other with the long-term credit. In the State, the short-term and medium-term credit structure is based on a three-tier system, i.e., the Apex Co-operative Bank at the State level, the Central Co-Coperative Bank at the district/tehsil level and the Primary Agricultural Credit Societies at the village level. The major objectives of the primary agricultural credit service societies are to supply agricultural credit to meet the requirements of funds for agricultural production, the distribution of essential consumer commodities, the provision of storage and marketing facilities.
 Owing to an increasing emphasis on the development of land and agriculture, long-term co-operative credit has assumed great importance. There is the Punjab State Land Mortgage Bank at the Apex and the Punjab Mortgage Bank at the district/tehsil level. 
 At the operational level, there exists a primary co-operative to extend credit to the farmer. This unit epitomizes the vitality and service potential of the Co-operative Movement in India. The organization of these societies dates back to 1904, when the first Co-operative Societies Act was passed. These societies were started with the object of providing cheap credit to the agriculturists in order to free them from the clutches of the rapacious money-lenders. the agricultural primary credit society is the foundation-stone on which the whole co-operative edifice is built. 
 The first Agricultural Credit Society in the Firozpur District was registered on 4 October 1911, at the Village of Khalchi Kadim in the Firozpur Tehsil. Originally, the movement was confined to the credit societies only and, thus, credit dominated till the partition (1947). After the partition, the Co-operative Movement began to spread to other field, viz labour, construction and farming.
Agriculture non-credit societies 
While credit is and must remain for some time the chief concern of the Co-operative Movement relatively slow, since 1912, when the non-credit societies were brought officially under the aegis of the Movement. the World War II (1939-45) came as a God send boon with respect to the development of the Co-operative Movement. Prices of agricultural goods began to rise and touched new peaks. The repayment of loans was accelerated and deposits began to pour in. The number of societies also rose. Another interesting development in co-operative during the War wast the extension of the Movement to non-credit activities, viz. 
Agriculture co-operative marketing societies
Marketing has occupied a far smaller place in the co-operative picture in India than in many countries, notably Denmark and the USA, but not other non-credit line of co-operation, with the possible exception of the consolidation of land holdings and joint farming enterprises, seems to hold greater possibilities of help to the agricultural population of India. The development of co-operative marketing in India is closely bound up with the problem of credit-the claims of the money-lenders commonly inhibiting the cultivator's freedom of action in disposing of his crop.
 The full utilization of loans advanced depends upon the arrangements for the marketing of surplus produce. For this purpose, there the Punjab State Marketing Federation at the State Level, wholesale societies at the district level and marketing societies at the market level. These societies also provide other agricultural facilities and make arrangements for the supply of domestic items in the rural areas.
 At the State level, the Punjab State co-operative Supply and Marketing Federation (MARKFED) is playing an important role in building up an integrated structure for remunerative marketing and storing of agricultural produce. it has played an important role in hastening the Green Revolution in the State by arranging ready supplies of essential farm inputs needed by the cultivators.
 Co-operative farming societies
 The Royal Commission on Agriculture in 1928 observed that it co-operation failed, there would fail the hope of the Indian agriculturist. Co-operative farming is a compromise between collective farming and the peasant proprietorship and gives all merits of large-scale farming without abolishing private property. It implies an organization of the farmers on the basis of common efforts for common interests. Under this system, all landowners in a village form a co-operativesociety for tilling the land. The land is pooled, but each farmer retains the right of property. The produce is distributed by each. They are allowed to withdraw fromthe co-operative farm whenever they de3sire. In India, the exceedingly small size of holdings is perhaps the most serious defect in our agriculture. If agriculture has to be improved, the size of the holdings must be enlarged.

The IndianCo-operative Movement has earned distinction of being the largest in the world.This is true in terms of membership and Co-operative network which spread over almost all the villages in the country and the number of Co-operative Societies. In our country, there are about 5.5 lakhs of cooperative Societies with membership of more than 22crores. It covers a wide range of commercial activities and nearly 50% of them are engaged in agriculture and agriculture related matters. Nearly 70% of the Indian population beingdependant on agriculture, is thus, connected with agricultural Co-operatives. Co-operatives have covered 100% of villages and 67% of rural households. Co-operative sectorcontributes 50% of total agricultural credit and distributes 35% of total fertilizer consumption in the Country. They are procuring 60% of total sugar-cane. They are also playing crucial role in the agro-processing sector i.e. processing of sugar-cane, milk, cotton and oil seeds etc.Dairy Co-operatives have excelled in their area of operation and have enabled India to attain top position in milk production in the world. Edible oil marketed through Co-operative channel is estimated at 50% and handloom Co-operatives account for 55% of the total out-put.
 But in spite of being largest movement in the world and strongest link, it faces number of challenges like lack of internal resources and poor mobilization of external resources, inadequate infrastructure, competitive tier structure, apathy of members towards management, lack of accountability increasing sickness, dormancy, low level professionalism, excessive government control, political interference, dominance of vested interest over the management, lack of human resources development, education and training.Despite all challenges, Co-operatives have to be sustainable over a period of time for which professionalism is a must. Co-operatives have been looking for Governmental help. But they have been paying of it like official domination and interference in their day-to-day working etc. Dr. Kuriyan, an eminent co-operator in the country said recently that the Co-operatives have undergone a crisis of identity being neither government nor private. He further said that Co-operatives need to be more efficient and competitive, but at the same time they cannot sacrifice the basictenets of co-operation. Inefficient Co-operatives will have to either pull up their socks or down their shutters. Co-operatives have many advantages in tackling problem poverty alleviation, employment generation and food security. They also have the potential to deliver goods and services in areas where both the State and Private sectors have failed. Over the past few years, steps like the enactment of mutually aided Co-operative Societies Act by some States and the Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act have been taken to give the Co-operative sector a boost. But I am aware that the Co-operatives registered under the Mutual Aided Act have certain constraints and deficiencies, which may be - 

Lack of supervision and inspection by Registrar of Co-operative Societies resulting into financial misuse and disproportion institutional development. 
Government is hesitating to entrust any important government work since it does not have any participation. 
These Co-operatives are away from the mainstream. The Co-operative Banks and other important institutions are not prepared to admit them as members. 
NABARD and RBI are not agreeing for conversion of Central and Urban Co-operative Banks. 
R.B.I. has also objection about the use of word "Co-operative" since Banking Regulation Act uses the word "Co-operative Society". 
Perhaps we are not prepared or educated or sensitized enough to work without control and supervision. 
Mischievous persons may take advantage of the situation to cheat the general public. 
When the Government are exploring the possibility of regulating the Non-governmental organizations having vast experience, it is doubtful as to whether the mutually aided Co-operatives in various field can give desired result. 

The circumstances and the situation give rise to the Co-operative Movement in the Country are still prevalent. The market is still not accessible to small and marginal farmers. Supply of agricultural credit is not adequate. About 50% of our rural and tribal household still have no facility for institutional credit. The Co-operatives are today at the cross road at their existence, particularly in view of the fast emerging economic liberalization and globalization. The Co-operatives still continued to function in a traditional way with poor governance and management, poor resource mobilization, outside interference, dependence on Government and lack of professionalization. The Co-operatives are neither member-driven nor functioned professionally in a transparent manner with accountability to members. In spite of all these, no doubt, the Co-operatives have contributed a lot to the agriculture development of the Country. We cannot afford to see that these institutions wither away. It needs reform. It is not-worthy to say that in the National Common Minimum Programme of present UPA Government it has been mentioned to bring constitutional amendment to ensure the democratic autonomous and professional functioning of Co-operatives. The constitutional amendment may limit itself with -

timely conduct of elections 
timely conduct of audit, 
uniform tenure of managing committee 
conduct of general body meetings 
right of a member for access to informations and 
the accountability of the management. 

In this context our strategies may be as follows. -

Co-operatives need be member-driven; stakeholders should have a command over its affairs and activities. There is need for more transparency, more of interaction and confidence -building measures. 
Aggressive marketing strategy be adopted for sensitizing members and general public about the service and quality rendered by the Co-operatives. Commitment to best 
service and pursuit for excellence should be the hallmark of Co-operative. Every society should adopt their customers' or members' charter and should meticulously adhere to this charter. 
Co-operative should compete with other players in prevailing market forces without any protectionist or discriminator approach. 
In respect of short-term, medium-term, long-term sector and Urban Bank sectors, restrictions have been stipulated by Reserve Bank of India, NABARD in respect of finance. These restrictions need be liberalized which would help Co-operative to optimize its lendable resources and provide finance to members. 
Strengthening information and database of Co-operatives if of utmost importance. MIS need be adopted by the process of computerization and inter-connectivity to provide best services to members and customers with anytime and anywhere service. 
Professionalization of management is one of the basic prerequisites of Co-operatives. Both the personnel as well as directors of committee of management should be exposed to regular training, interaction and orientation. 
Adoption of scientific planning for deployment of human resources on the principle of 'right man for the right post at right time' would help Co-operatives to accelerate the pace of reforms. Human resources need be proactive. Motivation, recognition for good work and leadership be inculcated for augmenting productivity. 
Basic tenets corporate governance be adopted like fair play, transparency and accountability. 
The PACS, as the foundation of the Co-operative system are meeting the development needs of the farmers by providing credit, inputs and storage and processing and marketing facilities. The Co-operative federated at the district and State level constitutes the Co-operative system. But it is found that the Apex institutions have grown stronger whereas the primaries and in some cases, Central Co-operatives have gone weaker. The situation has to be changed and the primaries have to grow stronger. The business of the Primary Societies have to be diversified.

Cooperative Credit in Agriculture Development
(Role of agriculture co-operative societies in agriculture) 
 Now-a-days credit serves as an elevator. It has been recognized as the life blood of all economic activities. Like all other producers,agriculturists also need credit. According to an old proverb, "credit supports the farmers as the hangman's rope supports the hanged." This Statement is fully true in the context of Indian farmers. Thus, for stimulating the tempo of agricultural production, an adequate and timely credit is most essential. The Co-operative Societies Act, 1904 gave concretized shape for establishing primary co-operative societies to meet both the short and medium-term loan needs of farmers. The provision of these loans did not make any improvement and did not have any impact on the farmmer's socio-economic status and consequently, they were head and ears indebt. In order to solve this problem and make the farmers free from the cruel clutches of money lenders, the idea of co-operative long-term credit institutions called Co-operative Agricultural and Rural Development Banks/Co-operative Gram Vikas Banks (earlier called Cooperative Land Development/Mortgage Banks) was mooted.
Role of agriculture co-operative societies:

An agricultural co-operative society which is authorised by its rules to borrow money may at any time, subject to the provisions of this section and with such consent of the Minister as is mentioned in this Act and whether the issue of debentures is or is not authorised, or is or is not forbidden by the rules of such society, issue debentures to any authorised lender for the purpose of securing to such lender the repayment, with or without interest, of any capital sum of money lent by such lender to such society before the issue of such debentures (whether before or after the passing of this Act) or intended to be so lent at or after such issue, or partly so lent and partly so intended to be lent.
An issue of debentures shall not be made by an agricultural co-operative society under this section unless either the committee of such society has power under the rules of such society to borrow money and the amount to be borrowed on the security of such debentures is within such borrowing power or a resolution approving of the making of such issue has been passed by a special meeting of the shareholders of such society convened expressly for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, passing such resolution.
The following provisions shall apply to debentures issued by an agricultural co-operative society under this section, that is to say:—

such debentures may be expressed to charge the money secured thereby in either or both of the following ways, that is to say, by way of fixed charge on any specified property (including uncalled capital) of such society or by way of floating charge on the assets, property, and undertaking (either with or without specified exceptions) for the time being and from time to time belonging to such society;
such debentures may contain all or any such provisions for enforcing or making effective the security thereby afforded as are usually contained in debentures issued by a limited company;
such debentures shall operate and have effect in accordance with the terms thereof so far as such terms are authorised by this Act.

An issue of debentures made by an agricultural co-operative society under this section may consist either of a single debenture to secure the whole amount of the sum of money for the securing of which such issue is made or of a series of debentures for separate sums ranking pari passu and amounting in the aggregate to the full amount of the said sum of money, and in any event shall rank in priority to any issue of debentures subsequently made by such society under this section.
An issue of debentures made by an agricultural co-operative society under this section may be accompanied and collaterally secured by a trust deed of the general character usual in respect of trust deeds entered into for similar purposes in relation to an issue of debentures or debenture stock by a limited company.
Whenever an issue of debentures is made under this section by an agricultural co-operative society, the authorised lender to whom such debentures are issued shall, within twenty one days after the issue thereof, apply in the prescribed form and manner to the Minister for the registration of such issue in the register, and if such authorised lender fails so to apply for such registration every debenture comprised in such issue shall, upon the expiration of the said period of twenty-one days, become and be null and void.

FUTURE PERSPECTIVE
Cooperatives are not unaffected by structural adjustments and globalization of commodity market. As a result, Cooperative Banks are required to redesign their strategies for sustainability and growth. The economic reforms initiated by the government of India in 1991 have affected the Financial Institutions including the Cooperative Financial Institutions. These reforms aim at liberalization and deregulation of Indian economy.
The Cooperative Banks of Punjab have accepted the reforms in Indian economy, especially, the financial reforms in right spirit. Since these Banks have mainly been providing credit to agriculture sector, changes in agricultural economy affect them more closely. The Banks envisage following scenario as a result of liberalized agricultural policy :
Liberalization of agricultural policy would result in greater capital intensity and borrowed capital requirements of agriculturists. In order to induce diversification and produce quality products for international market. For this purpose, Punjab farmers would need greater credit support for improved technology, seeds and agro-inputs.
Liberalized agricultural policy would reverse the process of fragmentation of land holdings and would result in exodus of employment opportunities from agricultural sector to other sectors of economy. Such as small business enterprises, services and industrial sector.
Liberalization of agriculture would professionalize and modernize agriculture, thereby earning a status of industry attracting high skilled professionals in agriculture sector.
Liberalized agricultural economy would lead to a greater role of private research and development institutions in improving the productivity and quality of agricultural operations.
The liberalized agricultural policy would result in greater thrust on value addition in agriculture. Therefore, a great deal of thrust would be on agro-processing units.
The liberalized agricultural policy would lead to contract forming for ensuring marketing of agricultural produce at better prices.
The liberalized agricultural policy would bring greater thrust on export of raw and value added agro-products.
The liberalized agricultural economy would lead to sowing/planting of new crops. Leading to a great deal of crop diversification.

Abstract

Agriculture has long been an important sector to Thailand's economy and will continue to be in the near future. Agricultural cooperatives, with the concept of self reliance and cooperation, have played an important role in raising the socioeconomic status of their farmer members. At present, the agricultural cooperative movement of Thailand is facing challenges from changes in various external and internal environment. To survive in such an evolving situation, the agricultural cooperative movement has adjusted its structure and business approach to sustain its operation and business growth. These changes could be observed at the agricultural cooperatives as well as policy levels. The Tha-Yang Agricultural Cooperatives is a good example of the successful adaptation to such changing environment.




Key words: agricultural cooperatives, Thailand, Tha-Yang Agricultural Cooperative

Roles of Agriculture Cooperatives in the Thai Economy 
Agricultural Structure and Its Development 
Thailand is regarded as an agricultural country. The agricultural sector has played an important role in contributing to the economy of Thailand throughout history. However, as the nonagricultural sector has been growing at a rapid rate during the past decade, agriculture has gradually declined in importance in terms of its share in economic growth. 
Table 1(746) shows that the share of the agricultural sector to GDP has declined steadily from 25% in 1972-1976 to less than 10% in 2002-2005.
Within the agricultural sector itself, there has been no significant change in structure. The Agriculture, Livestock, and Forestry sub-sector is the largest component of GDP. During 2001-2004, the value-added generated from this sub-sector was about 84% while that from the Fisheries sub-sector was only about 16%. Considering the composition of the Agriculture, Livestock, and Forestry sub-sector, cereals and field crops is the most important group. This group's share to GDP was about 53%
(
 Table 2(658)).
Although the contribution of the agricultural sector to the Thai economy is decreasing, agriculture is still important, with 41% of the total land area or 21 million hectares devoted to agriculture. Agriculture is the main occupation of the Thai people employing about one-third of the labor force.
Historical Background of Agricultural Cooperatives 
The history of agricultural cooperatives in Thailand can be traced back to 1914, when the Thai economy opened to international trade during the reign of King Rama V. Rice production was becoming commercialized, but farmers could not benefit from the situation. Moreover, national disasters such as drought and flood forced farmers into chronic and severe indebtedness due to their inability to repay their loans. Consequently, they were losing their farmlands, turned into hired laborers, and thus left their debts unpaid. Based on the recommendation of Sir Bernard Hunter, the head of the Madras Bank of India, the concept of cooperatives was introduced to Thailand through a special assistance program. It was believed that this would help the farmers to pay their debts and improve their livelihood.
In 1916, the Thai government created the first cooperative society, as a trial, among small paddy farmers named "Wat Chan Cooperative" in Phitsanulok Province. It was known as a "village credit cooperative" with unlimited liability, following the Raiffesen credit cooperative type with a single purpose of providing farm credit to help the severely indebted farmers. Sixteen most indebted farmers in the province were chosen as the founding members. Although with a start up capital of only 3,000 baht, the cooperatives operated very successfully. Within the first 13 months, its members were able to repay 50% of their debts. The success of this cooperative led to the increase of small village credit cooperatives all over the country. The small credit cooperatives prevailed in the country until 1983. After that, other types of cooperatives were established in response to the people's need.
With a view to facilitate financing support to cooperatives and their members, the government set up the "Bank for Cooperative" in 1947. Credit cooperatives were urged to hold share capital in the bank with the hope that they would, in the future, be owners of the bank which would be their own financing center. In 1952 and 1953, two provincial cooperative banks were established in Chiangmai and Uttaradit provinces, respectively. Unfortunately, the enactment of a new "Commercial Bank Law" in 1962 limited the services on deposit on current accounts to be provided only by commercial banks. The two existing provincial cooperative banks were reorganized as credit cooperative federations and a program to set up new cooperative banks was dropped. In 1966, the "Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperative (BAAC)", a state enterprise, was established to be a financial center for agricultural cooperatives as well as individual farmers.
In 1968, the government enacted the "Cooperative Act B.E.2511" to facilitate the expansion and improvement of the cooperatives. This legislation embodied two important features, the amalgamation of credit cooperatives at village level to district level and the establishment of the Cooperative League of Thailand (CLT) to function as the apex organization of the cooperative movement. The amalgamation was the most important one, as it enhanced the economies of scale of the business operation. The credit cooperatives were officially categorized as "agricultural cooperatives". In 1969, the government changed the status of agricultural cooperatives from unlimited societies to limited ones. This year, the Agricultural Cooperative Federation of Thailand was also established as the apex agricultural cooperative of the country.
At present, the cooperatives in Thailand are officially categorized into seven types namely: 

1) Agricultural Cooperative
2) Land Settlement Cooperative
3) Fisheries Cooperative
4) Consumer Cooperative
5) Thrift and Credit Cooperative
6) Service Cooperative
7) Credit Union Cooperative
Legal Framework for Agricultural Cooperatives 
The first cooperative law in Thailand called the "Amended Associations Act" was enacted in 1916 to register farmer cooperatives in order to help paddy growers. This Act remained until 1928, and it was replaced by the Act which allowed other types of cooperatives to be organized. The latter Act was amended many times and finally replaced in 1999 by the "Cooperative Act B.E.2542". The amendment of this Act was done through consultation between government and nongovernment institutions. This Act was intended to govern all types of cooperatives.
The Act has 138 sections and divided into 10 parts: 

Part I: General Provisions
Part II: Supervision and Promotion of
Cooperatives
Chapter 1: Board of National Cooperative
Development
Chapter 2: Registrar of Cooperatives
Chapter 3: Supervision of Cooperatives
Chapter 4: Cooperative Development Fund
Part III: Cooperatives
Chapter 1: Formation and Registration of
Cooperatives
Chapter 2: By-Laws and Amendment of
By-Laws
Chapter 3: Operations of Cooperatives
Chapter 4: Audit
Chapter 5: Dissolution of Cooperatives
Part IV: Liquidation
Part V: Amalgamation of Cooperatives
Part VI: Division of Cooperatives

This Act was a result of several changes and revisions. However, for greater flexibility, a new draft was developed and is now in the process of review and approval of the parliament.
Current Situation of Agricultural Cooperatives 
Institutional Arrangement 

Membership. As of January 2006, the Cooperative Movement of Thailand was composed of 6,712 primary cooperatives with an individual membership of 9,684,508 or about 14% of the total population of the country. The cooperatives in the agricultural sector occupied the largest. It had a total of 4,137 primary cooperatives with 5,950,809 individual members. These represented more than 60% of the total primary societies as well as the total individual membership of the cooperatives of the country (
 Table 3(816)).
Members of primary agricultural cooperatives engage in various economic activities. To provide an idea of the activities covered, 
Table 4(900) shows categories, numbers of various cooperatives, and their members. These cooperatives, in addition to their services as agricultural cooperatives, also have specific activities or common interest as indicated by their categories. For instance, the Animal Raiser Cooperatives and Dairy Cooperatives are formed by farmers whose main occupation is raising livestock. The Water Users Cooperatives are formed by farmers living in areas along the same canal. Members of this cooperative share irrigation water and jointly maintain the system.
Regarding the membership of primary agricultural cooperatives, report from the Cooperative Auditing Department (CAD)1 shows that during 2001-2005 there had been a gradual rise in membership of the audited agricultural cooperatives. The increase, however, was due to an increase in the number of cooperatives and not to the expansion of the societies themselves. In this period, the number of individual members increased from around 4.7 to 5.4 million persons, but the average members per cooperative during 2001-2003 decreased from 1,516 to 1,431 persons and rebounded slightly to 1,570 persons in 2005. It appears that once registered, the societies made little effort to increase their members (
 Table 5(579)).

Organizational structure of cooperatives in the agricultural sector. Agricultural cooperatives in Thailand are vertically organized in a three-tier system; primary cooperative at district level, provincial federation at provincial level, and national federation at national level. The primary cooperatives consist of individual members while members of provincial and national federations are cooperatives. At the provincial level, five or more primary cooperatives can together form a provincial federation which undertakes joint activities on behalf of their primary affiliates such as processing and trading of agricultural produce.
At the national level, there is the Agricultural Cooperative Federation of Thailand (ACFT) of which all provincial agricultural cooperative federations are affiliates. Note that there are also other national federations formed by specific types of agricultural cooperatives such as the Sugarcane Growers Cooperative Federation of Thailand, Swine Raiser Cooperative Federation of Thailand, Dairy Cooperative Federation of Thailand, and Onion Growers' Cooperative Federation of Thailand.
All types of cooperatives at all levels in Thailand are affiliated to the Cooperative League of Thailand (CLT), the top national apex organization which was established in 1968. The CLT is not involved in any business but operates as a cooperative education promoter of the country. Cooperatives have to pay 5% of their profit to CLT, as a fee for services. Primary cooperatives at the district level are the foundation of the cooperative movement. They consist of individual members who are divided into groups at the village level. Members are directly involved in the affairs of the cooperative. Usually, the general assembly consists of the total members. According to the present Cooperative Act, the general assembly of members will elect the board of directors (BOD) with a maximum number of not greater than 15 persons with a two-year term. The BOD formulates the policy of the cooperative, and appoints a manager and staff to run the business of the cooperative (
 Fig. 1(589)).
Business Scope and Performances 

Business activities and scopes of agricultural cooperatives. In order to achieve the economic and social interest of the members, agricultural cooperatives carry out various activities such as: 

1) Provide production and consumption loans to members at reasonable rate of interest;
2) Encourage savings among members by promoting savings deposits;
3) Provide agricultural equipment such as tractors, water pumps, and agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, seeds as well as consumption goods to members at reasonable prices; and
4) Assist members to market their products at good prices and to maintain fairness in terms of weight and measurement.
Agricultural cooperatives engage in a wide range of business activities in responding to their members' needs. Their main business may differ from one area to another but they are mostly involved in four businesses which are credit business, savings and deposit, marketing business, and purchasing business. 


1) Credit Business
One of the main functions of agricultural cooperatives is to provide credit facilities to their members. Credit facilities provided by cooperatives cover a variety of activities, such as paddy farming, animal husbandry, debt redemption, and household consumption. The sources of funds for agricultural cooperatives are their own capital (share capital), deposit from members, and loans from financial institutions especially the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperative (BAAC) and onward lending to their members for short-, medium-, and long-term periods. The short-term loans are only for emergency needs with a repayment period of two months. The medium-term loans are given for cultivation expenses, including purchase of fertilizers, and for other expenses during planting and harvesting. The repayment period of medium-term loans is 18 months. The long-term loans are given for the purpose of purchase of agricultural equipment, building or repairing houses, purchase of property especially land, and also repaying debts. The period of repayment is more than five years. 


2. Savings and Deposit Business
Agricultural cooperatives promote savings among members. Savings can also be used to invest and generate profit to both cooperatives and their members. Members of agricultural cooperatives can open Savings Deposit accounts, Special Savings Deposit accounts, or Fixed Deposit accounts with their cooperatives. They are encouraged to deposit a part of the income they receive from selling their produces to the cooperatives in their accounts. 


3) Marketing Business
One of the important activities of agricultural cooperatives is marketing of agricultural products especially those produced by the members. Farmer-members can obtain good prices, while fair weights and measures are guaranteed. In some agricultural cooperatives, food processing such as milled rice and canned fruits were introduced to generate more income for their members. Some have also become centers for marketing of members' products. 


4) Purchasing Business
The business of selling major agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, seeds, gasoline etc., and farm supplies and equipment also benefits members because it reduces production costs as well as household expenses. Farmers are assured of fair prices when they buy through cooperatives.

Business of agricultural cooperatives. During 2001-2005, the total volume of agricultural cooperative business increased by more than 60%, from 71,602 to 118,225 million baht. The average business volume per member increased by about 40%, from 15,352 to 21,872 baht/member, and the average business volume per cooperative increased by about 20%, from 22.87 to 33.94 million baht/coop. By activity, marketing business was the most successful one with an increasing rate of about 30%, from 14.9 billion baht in 2001 to 32.43 billion baht in 2005, followed by credit business which had an increasing rate of about 16%, from 21.3 billion baht in 2001 to 32.0 billion baht in 2005 (
 Table 6(615)).
The successful marketing business of agricultural cooperatives also contributed positively to the national agricultural market value. 
Table 7(817) shows an increase in percentage share of this business to GDP during 2002-2005. Their market share had grown gradually. The aggregate market transactions of cooperatives increased from about 5% of the gross value of the domestic agricultural market in 2002 to about 10% in 2005. The important commodities marketed by cooperatives were para-rubber and paddy.

Financial performances of agricultural cooperatives. During 2001-2005, the total assets of agricultural cooperatives in Thailand increased from 61.7 to 82.4 billion baht. Liabilities also increased, from 39.9 to 53.1 billion baht. While members' equity rose from 21.7 to 29.2 million baht, reserve fund also rose from 5.0 to 6.9 billion baht during the same period.
Revenues increased by about 90%, from 34.6 billion baht in 2001 to 65.4 billion baht in 2005, while expenditures increased by about 95% from 32.6 billion baht in 2001 to 63.7 billion baht in 2005. Consequently, their net profit dropped to 1.7 billion baht in 2005 from 1.9 billion baht in 2001. This amounts to about 11% decline (
 Table 8(626)).
Governance System and Management Performance 

Management and control system. The management and control system of agricultural cooperatives are basically similar to those of different types of cooperatives. They all maintain a uniform management and control structure. For instance, a General Assembly of Members is the supreme authority, which elects a Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is empowered to appoint manager and staff to run the business of the cooperative. The chain of command in a cooperative is in 
Fig. 2(614).
The General Assembly is required to meet at least once a year within 150 days after the closure of its fiscal year. It also has the power and responsibility to elect an Internal Auditor, to consider the annual report of the cooperative, to approve the annual budget of the cooperative, to consider annual statement of accounts of the cooperative, etc.
Under the General Assembly is the Board of Directors which is responsible for the formulation of policies, plans, and programs for the cooperative and supervision of management. The members of the Board of Directors are elected from outstanding members who are willing to serve the society. Under the Thai laws, the Board of Directors shall consist of a chairman and not more than 14 other members with the term of two years (not more than two consecutive terms).
The Manager of the cooperative is the most important position in cooperative administration. He/she is the Chief Executive Officer of all employees in the society that implements plans, programs, and policies of the cooperative which are designed by the Board and approved by the General Assembly. The manager may recommend to the Board for appointment of management staff needed.


Government supporting system. The cooperative movement in Thailand is regarded as an important factor for economic and social development, especially in the rural sector. Hence, its activities receive both technical and financial support from the government. In order to provide such support, the government has established three organizations in charge of cooperatives as follows: 

Office of the Registrar of Cooperative Societies
Cooperative Promotion Department (CPD)
Cooperative Auditing Department (CAD)

Office of the Registrar of Cooperative Societies
Under the "Cooperative Act, B.E.2542", every cooperative society in Thailand has to register with the registrar prior to its business operation. The law designates the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives as the Registrar of Cooperatives with the following mandates: 

1) To register, promote, assist, advise, and supervise a cooperative;
2) To prescribe the system of accounting, standard of audit, books and forms which the cooperatives have to submit to the registrar;
3) To appoint an auditor, a cooperative inspector, and a liquidator;
4) To order inspections or investigations of cooperatives on matters relating to the formation, operations, or financial conditions of the cooperative;
5) To suspend, or to order the dissolution of a cooperative in consideration of whether its action or non-action may cause any damage to the cooperative or its members;
6) To make an annual progress report for submission to the Board of National Cooperative Development; and
7) To make regulations or orders to benefit the operation of cooperative.

Cooperative Promotion Department (CPD)
CPD is the government agency responsible in promoting, supporting, and strengthening the cooperative system in Thailand. In 2005, CPD had about 2,300 permanent employees working at both central and provincial level of the country. An annual budget for CPD is about 3,600 million baht.
According to the responsibilities of CPD, its important activities to support agricultural cooperatives in Thailand are as follows: 

1) Conducting training courses for cooperatives through 10 training centers all over the country;
2) Providing financial assistance to the cooperatives through the Cooperative Development Fund; and
3) Studying and conducting research for cooperative development and proposing the guidelines for cooperative development to the National Development Board.
The following are some of the cooperative development schemes currently undertaken by CPD: 

1) Establishment of "Tambon (subdistrict) Agricultural Product Central Market of Cooperatives". This project was initiated by CPD in 1993 to promote market places for direct trading between producers and traders. CPD allocates grants to the potential cooperatives for establishment of Agricultural Product Central Market and necessary equipment such as drying yards, paddy warehouses, dryer machines, and scales.
2) Improvement of Effectiveness and Quality of Agricultural Products. The project provides paddy and soybean foundation seeds for seed multiplication to cooperative members. The seeds will be bought back to be graded and cleaned at the cooperatives' plants established by CPD's grants. The high quality multiplication seeds will be distributed to the farmers for better qualities of farm products.
3) Provision of low interest rate loan for fertilizer and seed procurement through farmer organizations.
4) Conduct of training courses on processing and marketing topics and provision of support for marketing channels and finance to farmer groups to develop farm products.

Cooperative Auditing Department (CAD)
CAD is a government organization responsible for cooperative audit in Thailand. The audit shall be conducted at least once a year in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Registrar. It is the only institution that has the right to audit all types of cooperative societies in Thailand. As of June 2006, CPD had a total number of 1,257 officials and about 900 employees. The duties include: 

1) To advise the staff of cooperatives especially bookkeepers and accountants to record correctly and to be able to prepare their own financial statement.
2) To conduct interim auditing during the financial year of the cooperatives, to check the correctness of bookkeeping, observe whether the internal control is efficient and to assist and guide the cooperative to update and complete their book of account. Usually, interim auditing is provided to the agricultural cooperatives that have no access to advisory service.
3) To audit the financial status of the cooperatives annually. The activities cover both financial and management audits. These services are free of charge, except for cooperatives with capital of more than 100 million baht.
4) To organize training programs in finance and accounting for members, staff, and board of directors of cooperatives in order to improve their management performance.


Financing agricultural cooperatives. Like in any other country, the sources of funds of agricultural cooperatives in Thailand include: member shares, member deposits, profit from business activities, external loans, and external subsidies.

Sources of loans and subsidies
The major sources of loans and subsidies for agricultural cooperatives are: 

1. Cooperative Development Fund (CDF)
The Cooperative Development Fund (CDF) was established under the Cooperative Act, B.E.2542, for the purpose of promoting the affairs of cooperatives. This fund is administered by the Executive Board of CDF which is comprised of both government officers and representatives of all types of cooperatives. The sources of this fund which are prescribed in section 28 of the Act, includes: 

a. Subsidies from the national budget;
b. Donations of money or properties;
c. Money and properties becoming the ownership of CDF;
d. Proceeds from sales of properties acquired under b and c; and
e. Interest, income or any other benefits belonging to CDF.
In 2005, CDF provided a loan of 2 billion baht to 1,318 cooperatives. The average loan size was approximately 1.5 million baht per cooperative. The interest rate ranged from 1% to 6% per annum depending on the qualities of the cooperatives.
2. Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC)
The Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC), was established in 1966 as a state enterprise under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. The bank functions as a financing center of agricultural cooperatives as well as of individual farmers. To have access to these loans, cooperatives shall have at least 100 members and have existed for at least two years. In 2004, BAAC extended a total of 28.6 billion baht of loans to 844 agricultural cooperative societies. The loan interest rate ranged from 5.5% to 10.5% depending on the classification of the cooperatives. 

3. Loans provided by other cooperatives
Agricultural cooperatives can also receive loans from other cooperatives. The rate of interest and the duration of the loan depend on the policy of each cooperative.


Taxation policy. In Thailand, the system for tax collection is based on the assumption that a cooperative is a user organization with no interest in making profit and hence exempted from corporate income tax but subject to value-added tax. Likewise, dividend or profits that members receive from the cooperatives are also exempted from personal income tax.
Recent Developments in Agricultural Cooperatives in Thailand 
Like those of other countries in Asia, agricultural cooperatives in Thailand are now confronting new emerging needs and challenges from farmer-members and markets caused by national and global changes in the 21
 st century. Farmer-members want not only to sell their products as fast as possible but also with high economic returns. Thus, it becomes the responsibility of the cooperatives to assist their members not only in selling their products but also at good prices. Furthermore, the new market economy in which agricultural cooperatives operate bring about new types of consumers who demand high-quality products at reasonable prices, and prefer healthy and chemical-free food at international standards. They want to know the origin of the foods they buy, and whether they are grown through socially acceptable and environment-friendly methods. These phenomena offer both new opportunities and also threats to agricultural cooperatives.
Although most of Thai agricultural cooperatives in the rural area remain confined to their main functions like distribution of credit and fertilizers, and procurement of farm products, some agricultural cooperatives have tried to transform themselves and implemented new strategies in this new economic environment. The innovative practices as a new direction of agricultural cooperatives in Thailand are as follows:


Collaboration with the private sector. This concept is implemented not only in the agricultural cooperatives but also in other types of cooperatives. For agricultural cooperatives, the main aim of this strategy is to gain some advantages from private enterprises such as strong marketing channel, popular brand companies, etc. An example is the collaboration between 12 agricultural cooperatives in the northeastern part of Thailand and Amway corporation (Thailand), a global direct-sale company, in producing "Amway Hom Mali Rice" for consumers in the premium market segment.


High quality of products and traceability. A major development in some agricultural cooperatives is their attempt to satisfy consumer demand by offering high quality products and introducing product traceability. The Tha-yang Agricultural Cooperative Ltd. in Phetchaburi province is a successful example of agricultural cooperatives that took such initiatives. This cooperative has successfully delivered the chemical-free Hom Thong bananas to TOTO consumer cooperatives in Japan. Farmer-members are advised to use organic fertilizers and avoid farm chemicals. Transport of products from Thailand to Japan is fully temperature controlled. This good practice enhances the quality and safety of farm products. Moreover, the producers and consumers work closely. They prepare production plan together twice a year. Tha-yang Agricultural Cooperative keeps detailed records on inputs, weather conditions, and yield information. Similarly, TOTO consumer cooperatives provide consumer needs information so that they both can improve product quality that meets market specifications.
This business has generated an income to Tha-yang Agricultural Cooperative members of more than 30,000 baht per family per year. This concept has been extended to other agricultural cooperatives, e.g., Ban-lat Agricultural Cooperative Ltd., in Phetchaburi province, and Thung-Ka-Wat Farmers' Group in Chumporn province. They both now can export high quality bananas to consumer cooperatives in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan.


Electronic commerce and use of Internet. E-commerce is a new way of commercializing products. It offers marketing of products and services via the Internet. CPD has promoted and supported agricultural cooperatives to set up their web sites for e-commerce of their products. However, the development so far is limited. Only few agricultural cooperatives have their own websites.


Cooperative women's group. Under the guidance of the agricultural cooperatives, the Cooperative Women's Groups (CWG) are formed among cooperative members and their family to run micro activities by using indigenous knowledge. Each group has between 20-50 woman-members and conducting various activities relevant to member's needs and skill. Generally, the CWG has three major roles: economic development, family health care improvement, and moral activity. Nowadays, CWG can generate supplementary nonfarm income to family by selling their products such as processed food and handicraft. Throughout the country, about 1,300 CWG have been formed with more than 100 quality certified products marketed under the One Tambon One Product (OTOP) program.
T

he concept of cooperative company. Because of some limitations of agricultural cooperatives to carry out business quickly, some have created subsidiary companies which are owned and controlled by them. An example in this case is the Thai Agri-Business Co., Ltd. (TABCO). TABCO is a company owned by 74 primary agricultural cooperatives in the country. It serves its cooperative members by purchasing and distributing fertilizers and equipment for agricultural production, and collecting and marketing farm products, such as paddy, coffee, corn, para-rubber or fruits for their cooperative members to domestic and export market.


Associate members. By law, agricultural cooperatives are permitted to admit associate members. However, associate members have no right to vote. In terms of business, this permission will make agricultural cooperatives to become a more community-based cooperative. They can work with young people who are not qualified to be regular members. Ban Lat Agricultural Cooperative, Ltd. is a good example of this case. It has more than 4,000 associated members. Most of them are non-farmers but town residents and, therefore, are not eligible to certain services such as credit and marketing of farm products. However, they are eligible for savings services. This cooperative is able to tie up different groups of people in the community together.


Value-addition. Some agricultural coop-eratives in Thailand undertake value-added operation through processing, grading, packaging, and branding products in order to gain market competitive advantages. Examples of these are Kaset-Visai agricultural cooperative Ltd. in Roi-Ed province and Tap-Pratan Farmers' Group in Ang-Thong province. The former created its own brand for Hom-Mali 105 Rice to distinguish its products from others while the latter changed conventional rice to herb-coating one in responding to high demand.
In addition, in the macro view, the two significant observable features in the agricultural cooperative movement are: 

1. Cooperative Policy Development
In 2003, the cooperative movement in Thailand had its first master plan _ "Cooperative Development Plan 2003-2006". This plan was regarded as a "road map" for development of cooperative movement. It was the outcome of joint efforts of those in the cooperative movement and the general public. As a result of the six strategies clearly outlined in the master plan, significant progress has already been noted. Because of this master plan, the Cooperative Act has been amended to allow for greater flexibility. The Act is now being reviewed by the parliament. 

2. Support from the government
The Thai government, through Cooperative Promotion Department (CPD), has continuously invested a large amount of resources, through various programs, for agricultural cooperative development. The important development schemes, among others, are the establishment of central markets for agricultural products in 870 villages and 20 bigger product distribution centers throughout the country. Moreover, the CPD has launched a mini-MBA program for management staff of the cooperatives throughout the country.
Implications and Emerging Needs 
There are two important challenges for agricultural cooperatives in all countries in the liberalized global economy. One is the open market economy in which cooperatives have to compete by offering high quality goods and services at competitive prices, and the other is the well-being of their farmer-members which cooperatives have to create by offering services to them (Rodriguez 1998). Agricultural cooperatives are business enterprises that need to cope with challenges on their own in the future. They need a strong identity and at the same time an innovative ability compatible with the changing needs in the new market. Cooperatives should know how to change along with market changes while maintaining the fundamental cooperative values.
However, in the new global market, the challenges are more difficult and more complex. In the case of Thai agricultural cooperatives, these challenges need the following measures from both the movement and the government:
Strengthening of the National Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives 
Due to the ineffectiveness of the Agricultural Cooperative Federation of Thailand Ltd. (ACFT) which functions as a National Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives in the country, the primary agricultural cooperatives have no support from the movement at the national level. The ACFT currently has limited functions and does not provide the desired backup support to primary cooperatives. It has 76 provincial cooperative federation affiliates with over 2,000 primary agricultural cooperatives throughout the country but has invested only around US$3 million in its operations, and sold only about US$22 million worth of products. The ACFT should have performed as the Apex Agricultural Cooperative and engaged in marketing functions such as agro-processing and market information, trade in both local and foreign market, human resource development, consulting services for cooperative management, cooperation with overseas cooperatives, and protection of the interest of primary cooperatives.
Restructuring of Agricultural Cooperatives Organization 
Thailand agricultural cooperatives are structured in a three-tier system: primary cooperatives at district level, provincial federation at provincial level, and national federation at national level. Under the existing system, the provincial federations may or may not operate business activities. These allowances created ambiguous roles of the federations and hindered rather than enhanced the efficiency of cooperative movement. The movement should seriously re-conceptualize the system such as reducing the three-tier into two-tier system by eliminating the second level. This concept has been proven remarkably successful in Japan and Korea. The two-tier system increases efficiency in management and provision of services of the primary cooperatives (Lee 1999, Prakash 2000). It is shown that under the two-tier system, farmer-members of the primary cooperatives are better off in terms of direct services from the national federation. However, the tier restructuring is not an easy task due to its sophisticated, highly diplomatic, and time consuming process. It requires the commitment of the leaders and the support of the government and the public.
The Tha-Yang Agricultural Cooperative, LTD.: A Success Story 
The story of the Tha-yang Agricultural Cooperative, Ltd. (TAC) is a case study of successful innovation practices in the export of chemical-free Hom Tong Banana to TOTO Consumer Cooperative (TCC) in Japan. Through improved product quality that meets market specifications, and through value chain innovations, TAC's product was awarded in 2003 as the "Outstanding Product to Consumer". This section aims to describe the operation and management of TAC in banana export business and to find out the key factors of the success of the cooperative in this business.
Tac General Information 
The Tha-yang Agricultural Cooperative, Ltd. (TAC) is located in Petchaburi province, approximately 200 kilometers from Bangkok. Established in 1974, TAC is one of the biggest multipurpose agricultural cooperatives in the country. Its main businesses are credit, deposit, banana export, and central market service. As of March 2006, there were 2,145 members. In order to provide a better service, the members are divided into 63 groups according to geographical locations. The working capital of TAC is about 130 million baht of which share capital is about 23.6 million baht. The TAC operation is described in 
Table 9(623). 



Banana exporting business. The banana export of TAC began in 1991 when TCC of Japan became interested in high quality and chemical-free banana from Thailand. With the support and assistance from the government, in that year, TAC exported high quality banana as a pilot phase. At this early stage, the export encountered various problems and constraints ranging from quality standard, freight damages, etc. With high determination and cooperation, the two cooperatives worked closely to improve production and postharvest process as well as freight control. This resulted in banana with qualities that satisfy the TCC consumers.
In addition, the two cooperatives also worked closely to arrange supply schedules and exchange production and marketing information in a transparent manner. Business based on trust between the two cooperatives increased the banana export from 6 tons per month in the first year to more than 30 tons per month currently. The business adds price margins of banana of about 20% above those of market. It also reduces the risk from pesticides of 250 growers of TAC while the TCC consumers maximize their utilities by consuming high quality banana at appropriate prices.


Business operation. To produce chemical-free banana for export, TAC has to control the production that meets the standards required by TCC consumers, i.e., no chemicals used in the production process, each banana should not be less than 100 grams, free of pest or diseases, and remains raw prior to export. TAC has the following measures: 

1. Select the members with potentials to comply with the production quality requirements of the project.
2. Provide training for crop production and maintenance to all project members. The training is under technical support from the government.
3. Cooperate with TCC to prepare the monthly supply/export schedules.
4. Harvest the crop at 70% ripeness and control postharvest quality.
5. Transport to destination under full temperature-controlled storage facilities.
In general, TAC and TCC make purchase agreements annually. In 2006, TCC specified their demand at 400 tons to be distributed evenly with supply of twice a month. For its 250 project members with a total area of 2,000 rai (6.25 rai = 1 ha), TAC allocated about 2-5 rai for each member to produce, following the schedules provided. It was expected that each member could earn about 31,500 baht/rai while the cost of production was about 20,106 baht/rai. The net profit of about 11,400 baht/rai of a project member is about 7,000 baht more than that of non-project banana growers in Thailand.
Factors to Success 
The main factors contributing to the success story of banana export to Japan of TAC are:

C
 ooperation among cooperatives. It can be said that this successful business is mainly due to the cooperation between the cooperatives. With a common objective to produce chemical-free banana to fulfill demand of the consumers, both cooperatives have patiently and energetically resolved technical and management problems encountered since the start of the cooperation.


Trust
 . This business has been built around "trust" with each other. The two cooperatives closely cooperate in production control, transparent information exchange, and consultation on production and marketing plan. For instance, when TCC conducted market promotion, TAC offered special prices; when TAC production was damaged from flood and they could not deliver the products timely, TCC informed their member consumers. Instead of fining for not compliance with agreement, TCC members donated money to help TAC producers.


Product traceability. One important factor to this success is the confidence given to the consumers. Each banana, can be traced back by the consumers to the producers. TAC records all information about producers, location, and date of harvest on each product while TCC provides all information to the consumers. The transparent information flow benefits both producers and consumers. While consumers can provide feedback on product problems, if any, producers can improve their weakness to satisfy the consumers.


Technical support. Part of this successful business could be attributed to the technical support of the government. In the pilot phase of the banana export to Japan in 2001, the Department of Agriculture closely provided technical support in production, cleaning, standardization, packaging, and transportation. This led to the successful pilot phase of the technology which has now been developed into a complete technology package.
