(AMD), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Intel Corporation (INTC)support@smarteranalyst.com (Ben Mahaney)SmarterAnalystJune 12, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareHedge fund manager George Estes Hall has demonstrated a bullish outlook towards three key tech stocks in Q1 2017 according to 13F forms filed by Clinton Group with the SEC. He ramped up the $1.72 billion fund’s holdings of volatile semiconductor stock Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), as well as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).George Estes Hall holds three of the fund’s major positions; he is President, CEO and Chief Investment Officer at Clinton Group. As a result, Hall has the final say on the firm’s investment and trading decisions, risk management and quantitative analysis. Hall’s expertise comes from his time as CEO of ROIC Acquisition Holdings and CIO of ROI Acquisition Corp. Previous to this Hall owned Axiom Bank and working in mortgage securities at CitiCorp. Hall, who graduated from the Wharton School of Business, takes a long-term approach towards hedge funds: “It’s easy to forget about the bear markets we’ve had, and how terrible they’ve been. In terms of the typical retail investor, I think with hedge funds the market needs more time to shake out some of the people who are not going to be successful.”In terms of the fund, Clinton Group has a specific investing philosophy that involves both a fundamental and quantitative approach. Intriguingly, the fund has developed its own data-intensive quantitative equity strategy based on ten years of actual “time-tested” trading. The method uses statistical arbitrage and adaptive systems to find patterns that it believes can identify return-drivers for specific stocks and sectors. On the fundamental side the fund says it has a “unique macro vantage point” from which to source attractive opportunities. In particular, the fund tries to use “deep research” and opportunistic trading to optimize the portfolio without incurring too much risk.Now let’s see how this strategy and these ambitions played out in three of the fund’s key Q1 moves:Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.In Q1, Hall upped the fund’s holding in AMD by 15%, which is about 22,800 shares. The fund’s holding now stands at close to 180,000 shares with a value of $2,616,556.AMD has just received a boost from giant Apple in its fight against fellow chipmaker Nvidia. Apple is using AMD’s Radeon cards AMD’s for its latest iMac computers including the 4K and 5K Retina iMac. The biggest news however is that the new iMac Pro out in December will feature AMD’s Radeon Pro Vega graphics card. This is a real coup for AMD because Apple is touting the $4,999 Pro as its most powerful computer yet, and this is also its much-hyped offering for creative professionals. On the news- announced at Apple’s recent WWDC 2017 conference- shares in AMD surged by over 7%. Shares are also up due to rumored product sellouts and increased demand from a booming cryptocurrency market.The stock has a hold analyst consensus rating. TipRanks reveals that in the last three months, the stock has received 6 buy, 9 hold and 3 sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $11.70 now stands at close to 5% below the current share price of $12.28.View photosRead MoreNVIDIA CorporationHall also displayed a bullish outlook towards AMD rival Nvidia, increasing the fund’s holding in the stock by a whopping 1597% (about 45,447 shares) to a $5,260,556 position, which makes up about 0.3% of the total portfolio.An opposing view has just been revealed by famous blogger Andrew Left of Citron Research. He surprised the market by publishing a bearish call on the stock on June 9. He believes shares will fall back to $130- approximately $20 below their current price. Shares in Nvidia more than tripled last year, which has led to an undercurrent of concern that the stock is overvalued.On the news shares fell by 8%. Left- who is personally short Nvidia- wrote that although Nvidia is a “wonderful” company it has now become a “casino stock” with tough competition ignored and the market over optimistic that gains can continue especially as gaming growth decelerates (down 24%- gaming makes up 55% of NVDA’s revenue). His move is at odds with most of the major banks which have been busy upping their price targets on the stock- for example Merrill Lynch’s Vivek Arya just raised his price target from $155 to an incredible $185 (the Street’s highest price target).  Left recommends leaving Nvidia for a stock like Alphabet which has similar exposure to tech stocks but without the risk due to its much higher core value.Citron Research has a strong track record according to TipRanks which places the financial blogger at #569 out of 6,005 bloggers tracked by the financial accountability engine. Indeed, Citron- which correctly predicted the demise of healthcare calamity Valeant- has a 63% success rate and 11.6% average return per recommendation. Interestingly, the vast majority of the tech-focused blogger’s ratings are a sell- 90% to just 2% buy ratings.Nvidia has a moderate buy analyst consensus rating on TipRanks based on the 13 buy, 8 hold and 2 sell ratings the stock has received over the last three months. At the same time, the average analyst price target of nearly $137 stands at a considerable -5.58% from the current share price.View photosIntel CorporationHall completed the trio by initiating a new holding in Intel with the purchase of 65,000 shares worth $2,368,068. Intel has just released its new Skylake Core X-series processor family at the Computex conference in Taipei. The new processor is intended for high-end gamers and is based on 2nd-generation 14nm Skylake architecture. Five-star Canaccord Genuity analyst Matt Ramsay reiterated his hold rating on the stock 12 days ago with a $38 price target (6.4% upside) due to stagnating gross margins. Ramsay says the processor is impressive but predicts Intel’s “PC revenue will remain in a modest secular decline” of around 3%. He says declines would be faster but Intel has a strong portfolio lineup.Smaller rival AMD could also provide competition. Ramsay says AMD's new 14nm Ryzen processor lineup offers “both competitive performance metrics and aggressive pricing and could take incremental share from Intel starting in Q3/17”. He is now looking for Intel to deliver returns not from just PCs and servers. Ramsay is the #39 analyst out of 4,560 analysts tracked by TipRanks.Like Nvidia, Intel has a moderate buy analyst consensus rating on TipRanks. In the last three months, the stock has received 11 buy, 7 hold and 2 sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $40.50 paints a more positive picture than for the other two stocks with potential upside of 13% from the current share price of $36.View photos More recent articles about AMD: Company Update (NASDAQ:AMD): Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

                    The ratings are by Standard & Poor's. A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO), 
                    of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) 
                    to D (lowest). Investment grade is defined as those issuers that have a long-term credit rating of BBB- or higher. Sub-investment grade ratings 
                    are those rated BB+ or lower.  "NR" indicates no rating. The credit ratings shown relate to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the 
                    underlying securities in the fund, and not to the fund or its shares. U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency and U.S. Agency mortgage-backed securities 
                    appear under "Government". Credit ratings are subject to change.
                
	








Footnotes


1
The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's common shares outstanding.


2
Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).


3
Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.


4
Distribution rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through today's date and then dividing by the most recent market price. The distribution consists of the sum of net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains, and return of capital.  Distribution rates may vary. Any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration date for the next distribution.  See the fund's 19a-1 Notices, if any, located under the "News & Literature" section of the website for estimates of distribution sources. Final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in the current year will be made after year-end.


5
A measure of a bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes that reflects the change in a bond's price given a change in yield.  It accounts for the likelihood of changes in the timing of cash flows in response to interest rate movements.


6
Total return is the combination of reinvested dividend income and reinvested capital gains distributions, at prices obtained by the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, if any, and changes in the NAV and Share Price.  The NAV total return takes into account the fund's total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.


7
Leverage is a technique where a closed-end fund's manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate, seeking to increase yield and total return. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.


8
Market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions, which can differ from regulatory financial reports (Forms N-CSR and N-Q) that are based on trade date recording of security transactions. Holdings are subject to change.













Risk Considerations

Investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
    

    The debt securities in which the fund invests are subject to certain risks, including issuer risk, reinvestment risk, prepayment risk, credit risk, and interest rate risk. Issuer risk is the risk that the value of fixed-income securities may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer. Reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the fund's portfolio will decline if the fund invests the proceeds from matured, traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the fund portfolio's current earnings rate. Prepayment risk is the risk that, upon a prepayment, the actual outstanding debt on which the fund derives interest income will be reduced. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result. Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates.


    A portion of the fund's managed assets may be invested in subordinated classes of mortgage-backed securities. Such subordinated classes are subject to a greater degree of non-payment risk than are senior classes of the same issuer or agency.


    Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.


    The risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the prospectus, shareholder report and other regulatory filings.

FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.

This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.
