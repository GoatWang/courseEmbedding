Investor Overview




	Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Limited, or AOS, is a designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of power semiconductor products.

	AOS's portfolio of products target high-volume applications, including portable computers, flat panel TVs, LED lighting, smart phones, battery packs, consumer and industrial motor controls, and power supplies for TVs, computers, servers and telecommunications equipment.

	AOS has developed extensive intellectual property and technical knowledge that encompasses the latest advancements in the power semiconductor industry, which enables us to introduce innovative products to address the increasingly complex power requirements of advanced electronics.  AOS differentiates itself by integrating its Discrete and IC semiconductor process technology, product design, and advanced packaging know-how to develop high performance power management solutions, and our goal is to become a total power semiconductor solution provider.

	AOS has two major categories of products: power discretes and power ICs.   AOS’s power discrete products consist primarily of low, medium and high voltage power MOSFETs.  The primary function of power MOSFETs is to deliver power by switching, transferring or converting electricity.  AOS has made advances in its mid-voltage portfolio by offering Best In Class performance for telecommunications and industrial power supply applications. In addition, its high-voltage portfolio was expanded to include proprietary insulated-gate bipolar transistor ("IGBT") technology, for which AOS developed robust and easy-to-use solutions designed for industrial motor control, welding, induction heating, renewable energy inverters and white goods applications.

	For power ICs, AOS employs a multi-chip approach that allows us to update a product by interchanging only the MOSFETs without changing the power management IC, thereby reducing the time required for new product introduction.  These compact and high efficiency devices are ideal for the consumer, computing and communication market segments.

What is this?





Investor Overview




	Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Limited, or AOS, is a designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of power semiconductor products.

	AOS's portfolio of products target high-volume applications, including portable computers, flat panel TVs, LED lighting, smart phones, battery packs, consumer and industrial motor controls, and power supplies for TVs, computers, servers and telecommunications equipment.

	AOS has developed extensive intellectual property and technical knowledge that encompasses the latest advancements in the power semiconductor industry, which enables us to introduce innovative products to address the increasingly complex power requirements of advanced electronics.  AOS differentiates itself by integrating its Discrete and IC semiconductor process technology, product design, and advanced packaging know-how to develop high performance power management solutions, and our goal is to become a total power semiconductor solution provider.

	AOS has two major categories of products: power discretes and power ICs.   AOS’s power discrete products consist primarily of low, medium and high voltage power MOSFETs.  The primary function of power MOSFETs is to deliver power by switching, transferring or converting electricity.  AOS has made advances in its mid-voltage portfolio by offering Best In Class performance for telecommunications and industrial power supply applications. In addition, its high-voltage portfolio was expanded to include proprietary insulated-gate bipolar transistor ("IGBT") technology, for which AOS developed robust and easy-to-use solutions designed for industrial motor control, welding, induction heating, renewable energy inverters and white goods applications.

	For power ICs, AOS employs a multi-chip approach that allows us to update a product by interchanging only the MOSFETs without changing the power management IC, thereby reducing the time required for new product introduction.  These compact and high efficiency devices are ideal for the consumer, computing and communication market segments.

	Commenting on the results, Dr. Mike Chang, the chairman and CEO of the company, stated, "Our turnaround efforts continued to produce solid results despite supply constraints at our third-party foundries. The gross margin and the bottom line exceeded expectations by virtue of a favorable product mix of higher margin products.  The solid December performance also marked a successful conclusion of AOS recovery plan. In calendar 2016, we improved our financial performance significantly as compared to the prior year, including revenue increase of 14.6%, margin expansion of 390 basis points and return to profitability. As we enter the next chapter of our rejuvenated growth, we are optimistic that the continued execution of our business strategies will create a firm foundation for sustainable growth in the years ahead."



	Business Outlook for Fiscal Q3 Ending March 31, 2017




	The following statements are based on management's current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially. AOS undertakes no obligation to update these statements.




	Revenue is expected to be between $90 million and $94 million.



	GAAP gross margin is expected to be 22% plus or minus 1%. 



	GAAP operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $19 million plus or minus $1 million. 



	Tax expense is expected to be approximately $1.0 million to $1.2 million. 



	Loss attributable to noncontrolling interest is expected to be between $1.2 million and $1.3 million.



	The above projections on GAAP gross margin and GAAP operating expenses include estimated share-based compensation expense of $1.6 million to $1.8 million.



	Conference Call and Webcast



	AOS plans to hold an investor teleconference and live webcast to discuss the financial results for the fiscal second quarter of 2017 ended December 31, 2016 today, February 8, 2017 at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET.  To participate in the live call, analysts and investors should dial 877-312-8797 (or 253-237-1194 if outside the U.S.).  To access the live webcast and the subsequent replay of the conference call, which will be available for seven days after the live call, go to the "Events & Presentations" section of the company's investor relations website, http://investor.aosmd.com.  In addition, a copy of the script of prepared remarks by CEO and CFO at the investor teleconference and webcast is available prior to the call at the Company’s investor relations website.



	Forward-Looking Statements



	This press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections of future performance based on management's judgment, beliefs, current trends, and anticipated product performance.  These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements relating to the expected new product cycle, projected amount of revenue, gross margin, operating income (loss), income tax expenses, net income (loss), noncontrolling interest, and share-based compensation expenses, our ability and strategy to develop new products, expand our sales, and achieve sustained growth and other information under the section entitled “Business Outlook for Fiscal Q3 Ending March 31, 2017”.  Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.  These factors include, but are not limited to, the decline of the PC industry and our ability to respond to such decline, our ability to introduce or develop new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance, the actual product performance in volume production, the quality and reliability of our product, our ability to achieve design wins, the general business and economic conditions, the state of semiconductor industry and seasonality of our markets, our ability to maintain factory utilization at a desirable level, our ability to successfully establish and operate our joint venture in China, and other risks as described in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 filed on August 26, 2016.  Other unknown or unpredictable factors or underlying assumptions subsequently proving to be incorrect could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance, or achievements.  You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  All information provided in this press release is as of today's date, unless otherwise stated, and AOS undertakes no duty to update such information, except as required under applicable law.



	Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures



	To supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross profit, gross margin, operating income (loss), net income (loss) and diluted earnings per share ("EPS"). These supplemental measures exclude share-based compensation expenses for all periods presented in this press release and impairment of long-lived assets for the three and six months ended December 31, 2015.  We believe that non-GAAP financial measures can provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses that are not indicative of our core operating results.  In addition, our management uses non-GAAP measures to compare our performance relative to forecasts and to benchmark our performance externally against competitors.  Our use of non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations in that the non-GAAP financial measures we use may not be directly comparable to those reported by other companies.  For example, the term used in this press release, non-GAAP net income (loss), does not have a standardized meaning.  Other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors with a comparable view of our performance in relation to other companies.  We seek to compensate for the limitation of our non-GAAP presentation by providing a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the tables attached to this press release.  Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.

	Prepared Remarks of Investor
	Conference Call




	for the Quarter Ended December
	31, 2016



	 



	February 8, 2017



	 


	 



	So-Yeon Jeong (Moderator):



	 


	Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Alpha and Omega Semiconductor’s conference
	call for fiscal 2017 second quarter financial results. This is So-Yeon Jeong, Investor Relations representative for the company.
	With me today are Dr. Mike Chang, our CEO, and Yifan Liang, our CFO. This call is being recorded and broadcasted live over the
	Web and can be accessed for seven days following the call via the link in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.aosmd.com.


	 



	The
	earnings release was distributed by globe newswire today, February 8, 2017, after the market closed. The release is also posted
	on the company's website. Our earnings release and this presentation include certain non-GAAP financial measures. We use non-GAAP
	measures because we believe they provide useful information about our operating performance that should be considered by investors
	in conjunction with the GAAP measures that we provide. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures
	is included in our earnings release.



	 


	We would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will make
	forward-looking statements, including discussions of business outlook and financial projections. These forward-looking statements
	are based on management's current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ
	materially from such expectations. For a more detailed description of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our recent
	and subsequent filings with the SEC. We assume no obligations to update the information provided in today's call.


	 



	Now,
	I’ll turn the discussion over to our CFO to provide an overview of the second fiscal quarter financial results.

	Yifan Liang (Chief Financial Officer):



	 


	Thank you, So-Yeon. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. To begin, I will discuss
	financial results for the quarter. Then I’ll turn it over to Mike, our CEO, who will review the company’s business
	highlights and I will follow up with our guidance for the next quarter. Finally, we’ll reserve time for questions-and-answers.


	 


	Revenue for the December quarter was $94.7 million, down 2.7% sequentially and up 18.6%
	year-over-year even under the supply constraint challenge that we started to experience during the December quarter. Our new products
	continue to show strong momentum during our typically lower season.


	 


	In terms of product mix, MOSFET revenue was $69.8 million, a decrease of 2.2% from the
	prior quarter and an increase of 17.6% from the same quarter last year. Power IC revenue was $21.9 million, down 5.0% from the
	prior quarter and up 33.3% from the same quarter last year. Service revenue was $3.0 million, as compared to $2.9 million for the
	prior quarter and $4.0 million from the same quarter last year.


	 


	In terms of segment mix, this quarter’s Computing segment represented 38.4% of
	the total revenue, Consumer 25.4%, Power Supply and Industrial 20.9%, Communications 11.9%, Service 3.2% and others 0.2%.


	 


	Gross margin was 23.3% for the December quarter, as compared to 22.5% in the prior quarter
	and 18.8% for the same quarter last year. The increase in gross margin quarter-over-quarter was mainly driven by the improved product
	mix.


	 


	Operating expenses for the quarter were $19.3 million, compared to $18.2 million for
	the prior quarter and $15.2 million for the same quarter last year. The higher operating expenses quarter-over-quarter were primarily
	due to the increased variable compensations resulted from the better than expected company’s performance in calendar year
	2016.


	 


	Income tax expense was $1.1 million for the quarter, compared to $1.2 million for the
	prior quarter and $1.0 million for the same quarter last year.

	Net income attributable to AOS for the quarter was approximately $2.8 million or 11 cents
	earnings per share, as compared to 14 cents earnings per share for the prior quarter and 7 cents loss per share for the same quarter
	last year.


	 


	Non-GAAP EPS attributable to AOS for the quarter was 18 cents earnings per share as compared
	to 19 cents earnings per share for the prior quarter and break even for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP EPS excluded the effect
	of share based compensation expenses of $1.6 million for the December quarter as compared to $1.3 million in the prior quarter
	and $1.1 million in the same quarter last year.


	 


	We continue to generate positive cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $8.8 million
	for the December quarter compared to $9.3 million for the prior quarter and $16.8 million for the same quarter last year.


	 


	EBITDAS for the December quarter was $12.2 million compared to $12.3 million for the
	prior quarter and $7.8 million for the same quarter last year.


	 


	Moving on to the balance sheet.


	 


	We completed the December quarter with cash and cash equivalents balance of $122.8 million
	including $19.1 million balance at our Chongqing Joint Venture, as compared to $118.8 million at the end of last quarter and $81.9
	million a year ago.


	 


	Net trade receivables were $24.5 million, as compared to $27.1 million at the end of
	last quarter and $26.1 million for the same quarter last year. Day Sales Outstanding was 35 days for the quarter, flat as compared
	to the prior quarter.


	 


	Net inventory was $70.2 million at the quarter-end, compared to $70.0 million for last
	quarter and $61.1 million for the prior year. Average days in inventory were 87 days for the quarter compared to 83 days in the
	prior quarter.


	 


	Net Property, Plant and Equipment balance was $122.7 million, as compared to $123.0 million
	for last quarter and $112.1 million for the prior year. Capital expenditures were $6.4 million for the quarter.

	In January 2017, our Chongqing Joint Venture entered into a turn-key design and construction
	contract to build a manufacturing facility for assembly, test and 12” wafer fabrication for a total price of approximately
	$78.0 million, which will be paid in accordance with the payment schedule based on the achievement of certain milestones. We expect
	the construction work will start in mid February and finish in a year to a year and a half.


	 


	With that, now I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Dr. Mike Chang, who will
	provide the business highlights for the quarter.


	 



	Mike Chang (Chief Executive Officer):



	 


	Thank you, Yifan!


	 


	Our turnaround efforts continue to produce positive results. For the December quarter,
	typically a low season for us, our gross margin exceeded the top end of the guidance range while the

	revenue
	of $94.7 million came in near the high end of our expectations.

	This time last year, I said that we hit an inflection point
	as our new products were gaining traction at design-in and design-win levels, and since then our relentless efforts to execute
	AOS product roadmap enabled us to achieve an 18.6% growth in revenue compared to the same quarter a year ago. Also, we continued
	to expand our gross margin by virtue of a favorable product mix of higher margin products. As a result, we posted non-GAAP earnings
	per share of $0.18 for the quarter. I am pleased with our strong execution in the December quarter despite supply constraints at
	our third party foundries.


	 


	The solid December performance marked a successful conclusion of the recovery plan that
	our Board had commenced a few years ago. During the course of calendar year 2016, which was the last phase of our recovery plan,
	we have been putting all our efforts and focus to deliver meaningful revenue growth and profitability. Our results speak to the
	substantial progress we have made: The revenue grew 14.6% to $366.4 million in calendar year 2016 from $319.7 million in 2015,
	and the gross margin expanded about 390 basis points to 21.8% in 2016. The bottom line swung to 50 cents earnings per share on
	a non-GAAP basis in 2016 from a loss of 28 cents per share in 2015. I am encouraged by the confidence and capability of our team
	to steer further improvement and growth in the coming years.

	While on the subject, let me take a few moments to share my near- to mid-term vision
	for AOS. Consistent with our ultimate goal of becoming a total power semiconductor solution provider, AOS has been evolving from
	a relatively small MOSFET provider for a single market to a diversified and reliable supplier addressing four different target
	markets. The next step in our journey is to steadily grow to be a more sizable force in the power semiconductor market. It will
	serve as a firm foundation upon which our business model can fully demonstrate its scalability and leverage. Our business strategies
	are well aligned to reach the goal in 3-5 years, and the entire team at AOS remains committed to drive the objectives we have identified.


	 


	Now, I will review our performance and initiatives in each business segment. First, Computing
	segment: It represented 38.4% of the total revenue in the December quarter. The Skylake ramp and the shipment of graphics card
	continued to improve, and contributed to a counter seasonal strength. We posted a 3.9% sequential increase and 24.7% growth year-over-year.
	Our products designed in for Skylake are compatible for Kabylake platform with similar BOM content, which brings a smooth and seamless
	transition to the next platform. Furthermore, our recent strides in graphics card application continued to make good progress as
	we have benefited from the GPU market expansion. We continue to strive to broaden our BOM content and customer engagement. With
	the slowing decline in the Computing market, we expect to see our devotion coming to fruition in the next year or so.


	 


	Second, Consumer: The revenue was 25.4% of the total. It decreased 12.1% sequentially
	due to anticipated seasonality but grew by 16.1% compared to the prior year as we expanded revenue from ultra high definition TVs
	and other diversified applications. Our shipments to key TV customers were pulled into the September quarter to prepare for the
	holiday season and China Golden Week holidays, resulting in a seasonal decline in the December quarter. This segment is more exposed
	to the wafer shortage from third-party foundries that are operating at full capacity. However, we expect that the progressive shipments
	of the new products from our own fab will help us maintain the Consumer segment’s revenue level in current calendar year.


	 


	Third, Power Supply and Industrial segment: It was 20.9% of the total revenue, which
	was down 3.2% sequentially, but up 16.3% from last year, as our products for the quick charger applications were well adopted by
	top-tier Chinese and Korean smart phone customers. Under the tight supply environment, we will continue to take a two-pronged approach
	in managing this segment. With regard to growing applications, we will continue to expand the footprint and BOM content with our
	new products. For legacy products, we will manage the mix to optimize our margin. All in all, we expect to maintain the revenue
	level in this segment for 2017.

	Last, Communications segment: The revenue was 11.9% of the total revenue, representing
	a decrease of 1.3% quarter-over-quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, however, it grew 29.6%. A majority of the growth
	was propelled by the increased shipments of our AlphaDFN products supporting smartphone battery management applications. In addition,
	we penetrated into new sockets and gained market shares with our surge protection products during the quarter. As the demand for
	AlphaDFN product line increases, we expect the Communication segment to continue to grow.


	 


	In calendar year 2017, while our main challenge is to manage our mix to ease the supply
	constraints and improve gross margin, we still expect a healthy growth. As we are entering the next chapter of AOS journey, we
	are optimistic that the continued execution of our business strategies will accelerate our expansion. We believe that these efforts
	will create a firm foundation for sustainable growth in the years ahead.


	 



	Yifan Liang: Guidance for the next quarter



	 


	As we look forward to the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we expect:


	 







	·



	Our March quarter’s revenue to be in the range of $90 million to $94 million.









	·



	GAAP gross margin to be approximately 22% plus or minus 1%.









	·



	GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $18 million to $20 million.









	·



	Tax expenses to be about $1.0 million to $1.2 million.









	·



	Loss attributable to non-controlling interest to be around $1.2 million to $1.3 million.









	·



	Our share-based compensation to be in the range of $1.6 million to $1.8 million.




	 


	As per our regular practice, we are not assuming any obligations to update this information.


	 


	With that, we will open up the floor for questioning.


	 


	Closing:


	This concludes our earnings call today. Thank you for your interest in AOS and we look
	forward to talking to you again next quarter.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
