GDPR Compliance | Patented BigPrivacy Solution |
Anonos


















 Anonos Enables New Ways to Unlock Maximum Data Value 












Anonos patented BigPrivacy technology is the ONLY system that enables data analytics use in compliance with evolving regulations like the GDPR.







What BigPrivacy Achieves








BigPrivacy supports alternative legal bases for data use when consent is not a valid legal basis under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). BigPrivacy heuristics and artificial intelligence technically enforce policies to adjust the granularity of data exposed in real-time to comply with differing and evolving regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, other) and restrictions. 







BigPrivacy enables access to additional, and more accurate, sources of data. Due to the technically controlled separation of information value from identifiers that link back to sensitive data, sources are now able to provide access to and use of more valuable data 







BigPrivacy enables broader distribution of enhanced data assets by technically enforcing compliance with restrictions and regulations. Controlling data flows at the source data element level ensures use of the minimum identifying information necessary for each authorized access enabling the creation of new data sets and subsets since access rights are no longer all or nothing. BigPrivacy heuristics and artificial intelligence technically enforce policies to adjust the granularity of data exposed in real-time to comply with differing and evolving regulations and restrictions. 







BigPrivacy protects against liability from improper access to and use of data. Whether data is collected directly or received from third parties, joint and several liability and data breach obligations exist without adequate privacy safeguards and compliance with data protection by default requirements. BigPrivacy heuristics and artificial intelligence technically enforce policies to adjust the granularity of data exposed in real-time to comply with differing and evolving regulations and restrictions. 







Compliance does not have to be an obstacle to growth. Anonos successfully implements new technology required under evolving regulations like the GDRP to turn compliance into a business facilitator that enables growth.






Anonos BigPrivacy is the first of its kind technology that enforces data flow controls to maximize data use in a privacy respectful, compliant manner.




 DECOUPLE DATA:
Patented dynamically changing identifiers decouple data representation from its underlying value, securing and protecting sensitive data elements that could be used to link data back to individuals. BigPrivacy controls unauthorized linking of data (which is the result with static identifiers) without degrading the value of data (which is the result of other solutions).






 DE-RISK DATA:
Patented fine-grain controls de-risk data by ensuring that only the minimum level of identifying information necessary to support each authorized data access is exposed. BigPrivacy heuristics and artificial intelligence technically enforce policies to adjust the granularity of data exposed in real-time to comply with differing and evolving regulations and restrictions.




 CONTROL SHARING:
Only data elements necessary to support each authorized access are exposed at the time of use, with secure centrally-managed keys. BigPrivacy maximizes information value while minimizing identifiability reconciling conflicts between protecting privacy and data use.
Data flow controls are necessary because traditional contract/policy restrictions do not flow with data over its life cycle.







“With Anonos, I can generate new revenue sources because we can now granularly control how we share data sets.” 

Head of business development for Fortune 500 company







Benefits








BigPrivacy improves data-driven innovation by enabling access to and use of additional sources and more accurate information for analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning and other secondary uses of data. 







BigPrivacy maximizes data asset revenue growth by enabling the multi-purpose use of data for all strategic needs. Anonos BigPrivacy is a first-of-its-kind, patented technology platform that enables robust data collection, use and sharing of data in compliance with differing and evolving international (e.g. the EU General Data Protection Regulation, “GDPR”) and domestic (Common Rule, HIPAA) regulatory requirements and contractual restrictions. 









BigPrivacy technically enables compliance with data privacy and governance policies and procedures. BigPrivacy heuristics and artificial intelligence technically adjust the granularity of data exposed in real-time to comply with differing and evolving regulations and restrictions. 







BigPrivacy complements perimeter, network and endpoint security technologies by protecting data in use to achieve security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information over the full life cycle of data. 







How BigPrivacy Compares to Other Technologies










All other technologies distort and degrade the value of data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning and secondary uses of data. They limit access to, and use of, representative data and fail to satisfy security and privacy requirements under industry specific (HIPAA) and jurisdiction specific (GDPR) legal regimes.

Overcome Limitations of Consent: Consent no longer supports lawful data analytics under the GDPR:


Anonos patented BigPrivacy technology is the ONLY solution that converts Personal Data to legitimate interest processing so analytics can be done.
Other solutions do not enable real-time analytics or use of historical data bases collected using pre-GDPR non-compliant consent.


Global Multi-Jurisdictional Support: The benefits of Anonos BigPrivacy’s ability to control the linkability of a data by leveraging capabilities embodied in the GDPR definitions of Pseudonymisation and Data Protection by Default extend beyond GDPR compliance to enable controls necessary for secondary uses of data underlying the new global digital economy – including complying with emerging data protection laws and established regimes like HIPAA (US) and PIPEDA (Canada).








Ask other vendors how they satisfy GDPR technical requirements for Data Protection by Default and dynamic Pseudonymisation necessary to convert Personal Data to legitimate interest processing.


Why Others Can't Enable GDPR Compliant Analytics:


Data Protection by Default vs Privacy by Design: Be wary of vendors who highlight compliance with Privacy by Design but not Data Protection by Default. They are very different. The GDPR mandates the most strict implementation of Privacy by Design called  Data Protection by Default which requires real-time, use case specific, fine grain control over use of Personal Data.

Dynamic vs Static Pseudonymisation: If a vendor claims to Pseudonymise data to comply with the GDPR, check if they use static/stateless tokens or dynamically changing tokens. Only the latter satisfy new GDPR requirements that the information value of data be separated from the ability to attribute data back to individuals via the "Mosaic Effect." 

Security-Only solutions: Personal Data under the GDPR extends beyond data that is directly linked to data subjects to also include information that is indirectly linkable to data subjects. Encryption, hashing, static/stateless tokenization, data masking, and other security techniques help protect against unauthorized re-identification using direct identifiers. They do nothing to protect against unauthorized re-identification via "linkage attacks" by correlating indirect (quasi) identifiers as required under the GDPR definition of Personal Data.

Anonymisation: This word means something very different under EU law. If a vendor claims they make your data "anonymous" that likely means you are only able to do aggregated analysis and do not have the ability to relink to individuals.







Use Cases



General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Many companies “scramble” to conduct data inventory assessments and data protection impact assessments without realizing that inventories and assessments do nothing to support new legal bases required under the GDPR to continue making desired use of personal data. Requirements for GDPR-compliant consent is impossible to satisfy for iterative data analytics (Analytics), Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) because successive analysis, correlations and computations are not capable of being described with specificity and unambiguity at the time of consent. In addition, the GDPR has no “grandfather” provision allowing for continued use of data collected using non-compliant consent prior to the effective date of the GDPR. To process GDPR-compliant Analytics, AI and ML, and to continue legally using historical data bases containing EU personal data, new technology is required that supports alternate (non-consent) GDPR-compliant legal bases.

Anonos BigPrivacy is the only technology that can satisfy alternate (non-consent) legal bases for GDPR-compliant Analytics, AI, and ML and enable ongoing legal use of historical data. The Anonos BigPrivacy platform embodies 5 granted patents covering core capabilities necessary to support GDPR requirements for Pseudonymisation and Data Protection by Default.

Even in situations where a company is not required to comply with EU regulations, compliance with GDPR requirements is evidence of state-of-the-art initiatives to serve as a good steward of data thereby engendering maximum trust with customers. 
 

Digital Intelligence/Marketing and Sales
 
Sharing “Digital Intelligence” data (i.e., capturing, integrating and analyzing data to drive measurement, optimization, and execution of marketing and sales tactics and strategies) can create significant liability. In the U.S., this is exemplified by the $2.2 Million fine imposed by the FTC on Vizio for sharing indirectly identifying information (IP addresses) with a third party for Analytics purposes. In the EU, data controllers and processors are jointly and severally liable for failure of one another to comply with new GDPR requirements, including obligations to support direct, one-on-one relationships with, and expansive new rights of, individual data subjects. However, the GDPR provides a means for data controllers to share data with third parties (for Analytics, AI, ML and other legitimate purposes) who do not have relationships with data subjects, if such third parties “are not able to identify data subjects.”

Anonos BigPrivacy is the only technology that can enable lawful (under U.S., EU and other legal regimes) collection, transformation, integration, and use of data to support real-time privacy-respectful aggregate analysis of data (both structured and unstructured) while retaining context to enable re-linking of aggregate data to source (identifying) information under controlled conditions. The Anonos BigPrivacy platform embodies 5 granted patents covering core capabilities necessary to enable lawful collection, transformation, integration, and use of data.

WASHINGTON, July 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Anonos, Inc. (www.anonos.com), the inventor of technologies that unlock the true value of data without compromising privacy, announced today that it has been issued U.S. Patents for its pioneering solutions to architecturally enforce controlled conditions capable of satisfying even the most stringent United States and European Union data privacy regulations. 
Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150709/234351LOGO 
Anonos CEO, Gary LaFever, commented, "The biggest data security challenge confronting global enterprises in the medical, pharmaceutical, finance, and consumer markets is protecting individual privacy without sacrificing the value of that data. Stringent United States and European Union privacy regulations have forced an unacceptable but, until now, necessary trade-off between either more privacy and less value or more value with insufficient privacy. Anonos' patented and patent-pending technologies solve this problem for the first time, unlocking the value of data while substantially increasing privacy and security by reducing re-identification risk to near-zero."
Anonos technology and intellectual property works by producing de-identified, but fully usable, data with no greater likelihood of re-identification than that of highly encrypted data. Yet, while Anonos is fully compatible with all methods of encryption, it neither relies upon nor requires encryption itself. Rather, Anonos architecturally enforces desired levels of data privacy, security, and value, while enabling authorized, trusted third parties to enforce policies at a granular data element level using a much wider range of quantifiable policy controls than previously possible.
Anonos solutions thus unlock the true value of data, transforming it into business intelligence by replacing old-style static access controls with technologically enforced dynamic permissions applied per-element and per-use instead of across entire records or applications. This dramatically reduces the value of data to attackers, while enabling compliance-driven access controls and protecting personal information from unauthorized and inappropriate use.
Anonos Dynamic De-Identification and Anonymity / Just-In-Time-Identity (JITI) technologies and intellectual property:

Enforce privacy policies: Dynamic and concurrent architecturally enforced policies enable access control per data element and table instance, with unlimited instances available simultaneously on demand.
Enhance security: Source data is intentionally worthless to unauthorized parties and freely portable when decoupled from the JITI enforcement ecosystem, even in cases where super users have broad visibility due to revocation of ephemeral key credentials.
Enable privacy / security respectful innovation: Data utility is maximized as a matter of policy, compliance, commercial, and societal objectives, without hindrance by restrictive and inflexible security controls.
Potential Use Cases / Applications of Anonos Technology and Intellectual Property
Data Breach ("Hack") Damage Reduction: Organizations like Anthem*, Target*, Home Depot* and even the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM)* suffer when their facilities are breached (as do their millions of subscribers / customers / citizens whose identities are "hacked") and data is kept in unencrypted form to enable use of the data. As a result, attackers can gain unauthorized access to personal data in "cleartext" form – i.e., unencrypted information that is "in the clear" and understandable. In contrast to standard encryption, which is generally fully "on" or "off," or traditional data masking techniques which do not protect data at the database level, Anonos Just-In-Time-Identity (JITI) technology and intellectual property could help protect against data loss from external breaches without losing use of data for authorized purposes within the organization. With JITI, an attacker may gain access to data but would not gain access to JITI keys (kept securely in separate virtual or physical locations) necessary to reveal personal information.
Protection of Credit Card User Identities: The January 2015 Science* journal (see http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6221/536.abstract) includes a three month study of credit card records for 1.1 million people that shows four spatiotemporal points are enough to uniquely re-identify 90% of credit card customers. Anonos Dynamic De-Identifiers (DDIDs) could de-identify credit card customers for each transaction – providing a Just-In-Time-Identity (JITI) for each transaction. As a result, customers could not be re-identified by means of correlating static anonymous identifiers. The Anonos approach makes limiting the ability to single out, link or infer a data subject a policy choice instead of a statistical risk. See http://www.anonos.com/unicity for an interactive version of this example.
Mobile OS tools: The trend between the two major mobile operating systems, iOS* and Android*, is to encrypt personal data both on the device and in the cloud environments of the platform operators. Application developers, however, are generally free to bypass these controls, either by using their own libraries for interaction with data-driven applications, or by using proxies and VPNs to conceal their information queries. A privacy-friendly mobile OS could be built whereby no data interactions were permitted unless they were enabled via Anonos Just-In-Time-Identity (JITI) keys. The platform operators would therefore be able to define quantifiable and enforceable conditions under which lawful intercept; search and seizure would be permissible, without the present risk of leakage and casual browsing of personal data by unauthorized users. Data subjects could therefore choose whether or not to share personal data not based on vague promises and murky assurances, but instead based on concrete evaluations of the governance policies surrounding lawful intercept. Control could therefore be returned to the data subject, and informed choices and consent could both be possible and revocable at any time and for usage of personal data within the mobile ecosystem. At the same time, technology companies and platform operators could have a positive, constructive conversation with regulators about conditions under which authorized disclosure would be permitted, and cascade those back down in plain, simple language to the end users whose data would be affected.
About Anonos
Anonos solves the problem of delivering data privacy and security while empowering users to leverage the full power of their data. For companies, Anonos technology and intellectual property can transform information at the data element level to deliver security while preserving the value of underlying data for deep analysis. For individuals, Anonos tools can provide controls for data subjects to share information in a controlled manner that allows them to receive personalized information, services and offerings, while protecting against misuse of their data. Anonos' patented and patent-pending technologies and intellectual property obscure and anonymize information at the data element level while preserving the full value of all the underlying data (see http://www.anonos.com/data_scientist_privacy_analysis). 
Anonos Founders Gary LaFever and Ted Myerson helped revolutionize data risk management protection for worldwide financial markets with their prior company, FTEN. In 2010, NASDAQ acquired FTEN, where its solutions today form an integral part of real-time data risk management technology around the globe for financial markets.
Anonos was granted U.S. Patent Nos. 9,087,215 (Application No. 14/529,960, see http://www.anonos.com/us_patent_application_14529960) and 9,087,216 (Application No. 14/530,339, see http://www.anonos.com/us_patent_application_14530339) for Anonos Dynamic De-Identification and Anonymity. Anonos Dynamic De-Identification and Anonymity facilitates enhancements to data privacy, security and value for electronic commerce, credit cards, connected cars, the Internet of Things (IoT), digital healthcare, pharmaceuticals, medical research, personalized medicine and other industries by enabling the complete use of data without revealing, intentionally or unintentionally, the identities of underlying data owners.

          Big Data Needs BigPrivacy™ is a Breakthrough Idea Worth Spreading

NEW YORK, April 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Anonos Inc. announces its selection for the highly competitive inaugural TED Residency innovation program for breakthrough ideas.








TED's mission of supporting "Ideas Worth Spreading" reaches far beyond the conference and video series, encompassing a variety of projects and initiatives that leverage the power of ideas. According to TED, participants in its residency program are selected based on passion, expertise, the strength of their idea, their character, and their ability to bring a fresh perspective and positive contribution to the diverse TED community.
"The Anonos Big Idea worth spreading is BigPrivacy™" said Ted Myerson, Co-Founder of Anonos. "BigPrivacy is a software-based product that makes it easier to safely collect, combine, share, and publish large volumes of data. As Big Data paves the way for new discoveries in diverse disciplines, Anonos' BigPrivacy product enables breakthroughs in the life sciences, including personalized and precision medicine, while at the same time protecting the privacy of the sensitive data sources on which new insights depend," said Myerson.
Dr. Jonas Almeida, Professor and Chief Technology Officer at the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Stony Brook University, and an advisor to the company observed, "Anonos was ahead of the curve in anticipating the world awash in data that we live in today. Streams from myriad web-enabled devices make it difficult to manage privacy through traditional access controls alone. This is what excites me about Anonos: they saw de-identification as a way to bolster the governance of gigantic sensitive data ecosystems at a time when this scenario was only academic conjecture."
Realizing the promise of Big Data depends on secure access to personal data, including sensitive health data. However, outdated methods of privacy protection (such as data masking, traditional access controls, and static de-identification) undermine research by reducing the accuracy of data, restricting access to data sets, and/or requiring the deletion of data, minimizing its value. Anonos BigPrivacy technology overcomes these limitations by dynamically de–identifying data, maintaining a high level of accuracy, and by separating data sets into components, enabling selective access to varied gradations of sensitive information under controlled conditions.
"Restoring privacy protection to a realistic possibility rather than just an aspirational goal creates great value for both individuals and society," said Marty Abrams, Executive Director & Chief Strategist at Information Accountability Foundation. "Anonos' selection for the TED Residency is clear evidence that the company's vision and success in implementing it thus far address this need."
Anonos' patented BigPrivacy technology simultaneously protects data privacy and accuracy so researchers and other data users can leverage the value of Big Data and comply with federal, state and international laws.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
Who’s ready for a wardrobe refresh? Shop men’s clothing, shoes, accessories and more at Macy’s.Looking for huge savings? Shop our Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Holiday Gift Guide!
