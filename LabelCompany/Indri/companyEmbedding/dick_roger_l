Overview

The one drawback to the ubiquitous and incredibly useful ''sawhorse workbench'' is that it almost always suffers from saddleback. But these nifty brackets from Rockler are an instant cure - just slip them onto the sawhorses and add two 2x4's in any length you desire to create a strong, stable base. Or you can add a sheet of plywood as a top for a sturdy, portable assembly table or for job-site work tables. A simple tool with virtually limitless possibilities.  


What's included

                    (4) Sawhorse Supports

Allows a modular solution to lateral bracing for 2 to 3 sawhorses, either (2) 4' bridges between 2 sawhorses, or (1) 4' bridge between 3, WITH ONLY 2 PAIRS OF BRACKETS.  My sawhorses are only 3' long, so with even only 1 brace between adjacent sawhorses it forms a sturdy setup.

Great for building a support system for cutting sheet goods with a track saw.  I use 6 pair of supports to spread 4' long 2x4s between 2 - 8' long 2x4s set on Stanley saw horses.  The 4' long cross members are somewhat sacrificial but I have been using the same set for over 3 years now.

I planned a plywood cutting project.  The concept of having flush, secure braces on my sawhorses appealed to me.  The supports should also help make a solid outdoor work table.

I saw these in the store and had an "aha" moment.  So many times I've needed a jig just like this to make working with large flat boards / plywood, etc. easier and more stable on the saw horses.

maximize use of self built saw horses for cutting plywood panels

        on Nov 28, 2016
    





Great for building a support system for cutting sheet goods with a track saw.  I use 6 pair of supports to spread 4' long 2x4s between 2 - 8' long 2x4s set on Stanley saw horses.  The 4' long cross members are somewhat sacrificial but I have been using the same set for over 3 years now.

        on Apr 5, 2016
    





I planned a plywood cutting project.  The concept of having flush, secure braces on my sawhorses appealed to me.  The supports should also help make a solid outdoor work table.

        on Mar 22, 2016
    





I saw these in the store and had an "aha" moment.  So many times I've needed a jig just like this to make working with large flat boards / plywood, etc. easier and more stable on the saw horses.

Versatile
I needed a long serving  station for our BBQ and they did the trick, 2 ea 2 x 4's and a piece of plywood  I have since used as a portable work bench.  I only have to change out the leg height for comfort depending on the project.

Rockler Sawhorse Supports
My first use for these was to lay a sheet of plywood on top to make a large table to separate two 5 gallon buckets of hardware and small parts I had accumulated over the years. I'm sure I'll have many more uses in the future.
