	ITEM 7.01     REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE









	On June 20, 2017, Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. ("Ashford Prime" or the "Company") announced that it has entered into an agreement with Marriott to convert its Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown hotel (the “Courtyard Philadelphia”) to an Autograph Collection property. Additionally, the Company announced that it has begun marketing for sale its Marriott Plano Legacy hotel (the “Marriott Plano”). These announcements are consistent with the Company’s refined strategy to either reposition or opportunistically sell its non-core hotels.




	The agreement with Marriott calls for the Courtyard Philadelphia to be converted to an Autograph hotel by June 30, 2019 pursuant to a conversion Product Improvement Plan (“PIP”) currently estimated to be approximately $23 million - including updates to the guestrooms, guest bathrooms, corridors, lobby, restaurant, and meeting space - which will create a distinctive theme and style for the property that is commensurate with the Autograph product. Marriott will continue to manage the property after the conversion under a management agreement.




	The Company also announced that it is listing its Marriott Plano hotel for sale and has engaged Holiday Fenoglio Fowler (“HFF”) to market the property to potential buyers. The sales effort was officially launched at the NYU Hospitality Investment Conference during the first week of June.

	ASHFORD PRIME ANNOUNCES FURTHER PROGRESS ON




	NON-CORE HOTELS STRATEGY









	Announces Agreement to Convert Courtyard Philadelphia to Marriott’s Autograph Collection




	Lists the Marriott Plano Legacy for Sale









	DALLAS, June 20, 2017 -- Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. (NYSE: AHP) ("Ashford Prime" or the "Company") announced today that it has entered into an agreement with Marriott to convert its Courtyard Philadelphia Downtown hotel (the “Courtyard Philadelphia”) to an Autograph Collection property. Additionally, the Company announced that it has begun marketing for sale its Marriott Plano Legacy hotel (the “Marriott Plano”). These announcements are consistent with the Company’s refined strategy to either reposition or opportunistically sell its non-core hotels.




	The agreement with Marriott calls for the Courtyard Philadelphia to be converted to an Autograph hotel by June 30, 2019 pursuant to a conversion Product Improvement Plan (“PIP”) currently estimated to be approximately $23 million - including updates to the guestrooms, guest bathrooms, corridors, lobby, restaurant, and meeting space – which will create a distinctive theme and style for the property that is commensurate with the Autograph product. Marriott will continue to manage the property after the conversion under a management agreement.




	The Company also announced that it is listing its Marriott Plano hotel for sale and has engaged Holiday Fenoglio Fowler (“HFF”) to market the property to potential buyers. The sales effort was officially launched at the NYU Hospitality Investment Conference during the first week of June. For further information on the opportunity please contact John Bourret at the Dallas office of HFF.





















	“Consistent with the announcement of our refined strategy of focusing on luxury hotels and resorts, we have been exploring opportunities to either reposition our non-core hotels to better fit that strategy or to sell them if we think the timing is right and we have visibility into an accretive redeployment of our capital,” said Richard J. Stockton, Ashford Prime’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “With its prime location across from City Hall and historical building designation, the upbranding of the Courtyard Philadelphia to an Autograph Collection will occupy a desirable niche in the attractive downtown Philadelphia market. As for the Marriott Plano, the property has performed very well over the last several years in the dynamic and growing Plano market and we currently see an opportunity to capitalize on the growth and investment taking place in that market.”




	Ashford Hospitality Prime is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on investing in luxury hotels and resorts.




	Ashford has created an Ashford App for the hospitality REIT investor community. The Ashford App is available for free download at Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store by searching “Ashford.”

                        Ashford Hospitality Prime is a conservatively capitalized REIT that invests primarily in high RevPAR, 
                        full-service luxury hotels and resorts. We are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol 
                        AHP and are externally-advised by Ashford (NYSE American: AINC).

                        Our strategy is to invest primarily in full-service luxury hotels and resorts which are anticipated to 
                        generate RevPAR of at least twice the then current U.S. average RevPAR for all hotels as determined by 
                        Smith Travel Research.  We will seek to acquire both premium branded
                          and independent hotels.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
