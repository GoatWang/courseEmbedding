eStatements and eNotices



eStatements is a paperless method of receiving your monthly account statements.
By signing up for eStatements, you will have access to at least 12 months of statements via Online Banking. No more filing and storing statements. No more statements sitting in your mailbox, which means your account information will be safer. Plus, you will have 24/7 access.
When you enroll in eStatements, you will also begin to receive most notices via eNotices available in Online Banking. When an eNotice is available in Online Banking, you will receive an email notification that indicates what type of notice you have received and provides instructions for accessing it.
Sign up for eStatements and eNotices from Lake City Bank today.
Log in to Online Banking. Then click on the “Change document delivery method” link in the Customer Service drop-down menu and agree to the terms of the eStatement Service Agreement and Disclosure.



Electronic Tax Documents



You can opt in to receive your tax documents electronically via Online Banking. To opt in, simply sign in to Online Banking, click the “Change your document delivery method” link and agree to the Online Documents Service Agreement and Disclosure. If you opt in for electronic tax documents, you will no longer receive a printed version.

Corporate Profile
Corporate Profile













































Lakeland Financial Corporation is a $4.4 billion bank holding company that operates through Lake City Bank, with its headquarters in Warsaw, Indiana.  Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under “LKFN”.  The Bank was founded in 1872 and has continuously operated under the name Lake City Bank since its organization and we are proud to be the third oldest financial institution headquartered in Indiana.  Our business strategy is focused on maintaining a traditional community banking approach while at the same time concurrently leveraging the strength and size of our balance sheet to effectively compete with larger regional and national competitors.  We are an Indiana bank focused on serving Indiana clients.  While our strategy encompasses all phases of traditional community banking, including consumer lending, wealth advisory, trust services and retail brokerage, we are primarily focused on building expansive commercial lending and deposit relationships and pursuing retail deposit gathering strategies through high levels of relationship-based client services.

Lake City Bank serves Indiana with 49 branches located in the following Indiana counties: Allen, DeKalb, Elkhart, Fulton, Hamilton, Huntington, Johnson, Kosciusko, LaGrange, Marion, Marshall, Noble, Pulaski, St. Joseph and Whitley.

Lakeland Financial Reports Record Performance











Lakeland Financial Corporation To Present at The Keefe, Bruyette & Woods 2017 Community Bank Investor Conference













Lakeland Financial Reaches Analyst Target Price
In recent trading, shares of Lakeland Financial Corp have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $42.67, changing hands for $43.58/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level.

LKFN: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 04/28/2017 settlement date, and Lakeland Financial Corp is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 13.36 "days to cover" versus the median component at 4.80. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.
