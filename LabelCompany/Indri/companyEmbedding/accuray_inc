Important Safety Statement: Most side effects of radiotherapy, including radiotherapy delivered with Accuray systems, are mild and temporary, often involving fatigue, nausea, and skin irritation. Side effects can be severe, however, leading to pain, alterations in normal body functions (for example, urinary or salivary function), deterioration of quality of life, permanent injury and even death.
Side effects can occur during or shortly after radiation treatment or in the months and years following radiation. The nature and severity of side effects depend on many factors, including the size and location of the treated tumor, the treatment technique (for example, the radiation dose), the patient's general medical condition, to name a few. For more details about the side effects of your radiation therapy, and if treatment with an Accuray product is right for you, ask your doctor.

The nature and severity of side effects depend on many factors, including the size and location of the treated tumor, the treatment technique (for example, the radiation dose), the patient's general medical condition, to name a few. For more details about the side effects of your radiation therapy, and if treatment with an Accuray product is right for you, ask your doctor.

Accuray Expands Product Portfolio, Radixact Now CE-Marked


August 12, 2016, 11:36:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

Accuray Inc
ARAY

is expanding its product portfolio on the back of regulatory
approvals. The company recently announced the receipt of CE-Marking
for its Radixact Treatment Delivery System, Precision Treatment
Planning System and iDMS Data Management System.



Additionally the company's flagship CyberKnife and TomoTherapy
systems continue to win accolades. Accuray presented significant
clinical data demonstrating the growing utilities of both the
products at the recently concluded annual meeting of the American
Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM).



Although the expanding product portfolio and the growing clinical
evidence is positive, we believe that they are yet to translate
into key growth drivers for the company. Year-to-date, Accuray's
share price is down almost 19.11%, which primarily reflects the
company's modest third quarter results and
fiscal year 2016 view cut

.



Accuray is set to report its fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results
on Aug 17.

The Radixact System Holds Promise



Notably, in June, all the three systems that form the Radixact
System had received 510(K) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). (Read More:
Accuray Receives 510(k) FDA Clearance for
Radixact

)



As per data available from Markets & Markets, the radio-therapy
market is estimated to reach $7.54 billion by 2020, which presents
a considerable growth opportunity for Accuray. We believe the
addition of Radixact in Accuray's product portfolio will aid the
company in penetrating this fast growing market.



As per Accuray, the Radixact system features a more powerful linear
accelerator as compared with the TomoTherapy system. Moreover, the
availability of MVCT imaging and helical treatment delivery will
help clinicians administer highly conformal and homogeneous dose to
any cancer affected region, without hurting the surrounding normal
healthy tissues.



The CE-Mark will now allow Accuray to commercialize the product in
certain markets of Europe. The company plans to ship the first
product during first quarter of 2017.


CyberKnife and TomoTherapy in Focus



According to the second quarter of 2016 MD Buyline Market
Intelligence Briefing, CyberKnife and TomoTherapy systems received
the highest composite overall user satisfaction rating among
radiation treatment delivery systems in the U.S.



Meanwhile, Accuray presented more than 45 studies on the use of the
CyberKnife at the annual meeting of the AAPM. The clinical data
displayed the growing utility of the InCise Multileaf Collimator
(MLC) with the CyberKnife System to deliver full-body radiosurgery.



Accuray also presented clinical data from more than 35 studies
related to TomoTherapy, which confirmed the versatility and
effectiveness of the system in treating cancer patients with
extreme precision.



Last month, Accuray announced preliminary results from a
prospective, phase II trial evaluating once-daily accelerated
partial breast irradiation (APBI) in patients treated with the
TomoTherapy system.



The trial reported no recurrence of cancer in the treated breast at
median follow-up of 34 months. Additionally, more than 95% of
patients and their physicians rated cosmesis - preservation of the
normal appearance of the breast - as good or excellent.


Zacks Rank & Key Picks



Accuray carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).



Some better-ranked stocks in the medical space are Cryolife Inc
CRY

, Natus Medical
BABY

and Masimo Corp
MASI

. All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Accuray Inc. (ARAY  -  Free Report)	 reported a loss of 6 cents per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, comparing unfavorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of a penny. The figure was also significantly lower than earnings of a penny in the year-ago quarter.Total revenue in the third quarter decreased approximately 7.6% year over year to $97 million and missed our estimate of $117 million. The decline was primarily due to lower sales as well as product and channel mix.Notably, Accuray carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), hinting at probabilities of outperformance in the near term.   Segment DetailsProduct Revenues: The downside in revenues was more reflected in product revenues that decreased 10.6% to $48 million ($53.7 million in the second quarter). Product revenues in both the U.S. and Japan were significantly above the prior-year quarter. However, China and Europe delivered a sluggish revenue performance in the quarter.Service Revenues: Revenues at the segment decreased 4.4% to 49.3 million year over year. Per management, the decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower installations.Gross Order Update: In the reported quarter, gross product orders totaled $83.8 million, compared with $56.4 million in the prior-year quarter.  At the end of the quarter, product backlog was $450 million, approximately 21% higher year over year. Gross order performance was favorably impacted by the company’s flagships Radixact Systemand CyberKnife System orders.Accuray Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Accuray Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Accuray Incorporated QuoteOther HighlightsThe company’s new TomoTherapy product platform, also known as Radixact, continued to contribute to the company’s top line. The platform gained Japanese regulatory approval (Shonin approval) and is expected to start formal treatments from the fourth quarter.Onrad, Accuray’s second new product, also provided a modest contribution to gross orders.Coming to the CyberKnife platform, this represented approximately 50% of gross orders in the quarter, courtesy of its M6 system.Margin DetailsGross margin (as a percentage of net revenues) contracted 620 basis points (bps) in the third quarter to 36.4%. This was primarily driven by reduced product gross margins.Product gross margin (as a percentage of product revenues) decreased 650 bps over the prior year to 38%, primarily driven by lower overall unit sales volumes.Service gross margins in the fiscal third quarter were 34.4%, down 600 bps on a year-over-year basis.Operating expenses for the quarter were $36.7 million, down 7% on year-over-year basis.Balance SheetAccuray had $84.1 million of cash and investments as of Mar 31, 2017, reflecting a decrease of $24.3 million from Dec 31, 2016.GuidanceAccuray projects full-year revenues in the band of $380 million to $390 million. This is lower than the previously provided guidance of $410.0 million to $420.0 million.The company expects 5% increase in gross orders for fiscal 2017. The product system backlog is expected in the band of $445 million to $460 million.Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2017 is anticipated in the range of $22 million to $26 million.Key PicksBetter-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector include Inogen Inc.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Important Safety Statement: Most side effects of radiotherapy, including radiotherapy delivered with Accuray systems, are mild and temporary, often involving fatigue, nausea, and skin irritation. Side effects can be severe, however, leading to pain, alterations in normal body functions (for example, urinary or salivary function), deterioration of quality of life, permanent injury and even death.
Side effects can occur during or shortly after radiation treatment or in the months and years following radiation. The nature and severity of side effects depend on many factors, including the size and location of the treated tumor, the treatment technique (for example, the radiation dose), the patient's general medical condition, to name a few. For more details about the side effects of your radiation therapy, and if treatment with an Accuray product is right for you, ask your doctor.
