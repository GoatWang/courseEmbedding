Cat Supplies
If you’re a cat person—or a soon-to-be cat person—you’ve come to the right place. The Chewy Cat Shop has all the cat supplies your little furball could ever need, want, dream about, purr over and claw for. You’ll find pet cat supplies ranging from food and treats to litter and toys, supplements, beds and so much more. Here are some of the products you’ll discover.

Wet cat foods and dry cat foods have all the ingredients your cat needs to thrive. Since cats are obligate carnivores, look for foods that are high in protein. If you want to take your kitty’s nutrition to the next level, you can try freeze-dried and dehydrated cat foods. These foods give your cat all the goodness of the ingredients in their raw form. Freeze-dried food and treats are never cooked, and dehydrated raw foods are only gently cooked, so the vital nutrients aren’t lost in the cooking process.  

When it comes to cat potty solutions, there are more options than you might think. You can choose between standard litter boxes, covered litter boxes, specialized litter box systems, disposable litter boxes, and even automatic-scooping litter boxes. Some of these litter boxes require certain litters, while others do not. And when it comes to litter, there are even more options—clumping, non-clumping, all-natural, lightweight, multi-cat, scented, unscented, and on and on. Explore the selection of litters and weigh the benefits of each before deciding which litter is best for your cat. 

Cat toys are an essential part of the necessary cat supplies, and the types of toys cats love are seemingly endless. Balls and chaser cat toys are sure to keep your cat busy, even when you can’t be there to play with her. Teaser cat toys provide a great opportunity to bond with your cat while also feeding her playful side. And many interactive cat toys are made to challenge your cat by presenting puzzles for her to conquer in order to reach her treats. They will keep your cat busy when left alone and can even curb unwanted behaviors that result from boredom. 

Cat beds fulfill all your kitty’s catnap needs. You’ll find standard pillow cat beds and covered cat beds that are sure to keep any cat purring all night long. Or step up the comfort level with an orthopedic cat bed. It’s perfect for any cat, and a must if your cat has hip and joint pain—a common issue with aging cats. If you want your cat to have a place to nap and play all in one—a place she’ll thank you for with endless snuggles—get her a cat tree. You’ll find a range of shapes, sizes and materials, so browse around to find the perfect cat tree for your feline family member.

The Chewy Cat Shop has these cat supplies and many more. Discover high-quality cat items like food and water bowls, leashes, collars, grooming supplies, dietary supplements, crates, pens and travel supplies. So have a look around, and find the cat supplies your kitty will purr over.

Cat Food
Whether your feline friend is sitting down to a meal or enjoying a kitty snack, ensure they’re getting the nutrients they need, and the flavor they deserve with the top cat food and treats. Chewy carries only the best cat food brands, making shopping for your feline’s food easier than ever. Chewy carries cat food brands your cuddly kitty will love like Fancy Feast, Friskies & Royal Canin. A balanced diet is vital to the overall health of your courageous cat, but every cat has different needs and tastes. Cat food comes in a variety of textures, ingredients and flavors. There are also healthy cat food brands that offer recipes that help address health concerns like urinary tract health, allergies, digestive health and more. 

Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Urinary SO cat food comes in wet and dry varieties, and helps promote urinary tract health. Urinary crystals and stones are often linked to this disease, but the most common cause of lower urinary tract disease is idiopathic cystitis. Wet and dry cat food that promotes urinary health can help dissolve pure struvite uroliths, and help prevent struvite, calcium oxalate and phosphate uroliths. Looking for natural cat food? Chewy carries natural cat food brands like Cat Chow and Natural Balance, which feature minimal ingredients for cats with allergies. Natural Balance produces grain-free natural cat food in dry and wet varieties for felines with food sensitivities. 

Wet cat food is great for the classy kitty who demands meals packed with flavor. Fancy Feast offers a variety of canned cat food recipes like poultry and beef, seafood feast and chicken feast. Chewy also carries several dry cat food brands, great for the kitty who likes to nibble throughout the day. 
When it comes to rewarding your pet, picking the right treat matters. Chewy offers the top cat treat brands like Greenies, Temptations and Friskies. If your cat’s in need of some tender love and dental care, look to Greenies for a healthy kitty snack. Feline Greenies are specifically designed to help remove plaque buildup while your cat chews. Whether it’s meal time or snack time, treat your kitty to meals they’ll love from Chewy today!

Cat Supplies
If you’re a cat person—or a soon-to-be cat person—you’ve come to the right place. The Chewy Cat Shop has all the cat supplies your little furball could ever need, want, dream about, purr over and claw for. You’ll find pet cat supplies ranging from food and treats to litter and toys, supplements, beds and so much more. Here are some of the products you’ll discover.

Wet cat foods and dry cat foods have all the ingredients your cat needs to thrive. Since cats are obligate carnivores, look for foods that are high in protein. If you want to take your kitty’s nutrition to the next level, you can try freeze-dried and dehydrated cat foods. These foods give your cat all the goodness of the ingredients in their raw form. Freeze-dried food and treats are never cooked, and dehydrated raw foods are only gently cooked, so the vital nutrients aren’t lost in the cooking process.  

When it comes to cat potty solutions, there are more options than you might think. You can choose between standard litter boxes, covered litter boxes, specialized litter box systems, disposable litter boxes, and even automatic-scooping litter boxes. Some of these litter boxes require certain litters, while others do not. And when it comes to litter, there are even more options—clumping, non-clumping, all-natural, lightweight, multi-cat, scented, unscented, and on and on. Explore the selection of litters and weigh the benefits of each before deciding which litter is best for your cat. 

Cat toys are an essential part of the necessary cat supplies, and the types of toys cats love are seemingly endless. Balls and chaser cat toys are sure to keep your cat busy, even when you can’t be there to play with her. Teaser cat toys provide a great opportunity to bond with your cat while also feeding her playful side. And many interactive cat toys are made to challenge your cat by presenting puzzles for her to conquer in order to reach her treats. They will keep your cat busy when left alone and can even curb unwanted behaviors that result from boredom. 

Cat beds fulfill all your kitty’s catnap needs. You’ll find standard pillow cat beds and covered cat beds that are sure to keep any cat purring all night long. Or step up the comfort level with an orthopedic cat bed. It’s perfect for any cat, and a must if your cat has hip and joint pain—a common issue with aging cats. If you want your cat to have a place to nap and play all in one—a place she’ll thank you for with endless snuggles—get her a cat tree. You’ll find a range of shapes, sizes and materials, so browse around to find the perfect cat tree for your feline family member.

The Chewy Cat Shop has these cat supplies and many more. Discover high-quality cat items like food and water bowls, leashes, collars, grooming supplies, dietary supplements, crates, pens and travel supplies. So have a look around, and find the cat supplies your kitty will purr over.

Dry Cat Food
Dry cat food continues to be the most economical and convenient way to feed your feline friend. Cat kibble is a basic, healthy and balanced choice for cat parents. Unlike wet cat food, cat kibble does not require refrigeration after opening. It’s also safe to leave out all day for cats to snack and graze on. This makes dry cat food perfect for pet parents who spend most of the day away from home. Dry cat food is also easy to travel with. Chewy carries a wide range of dry cat food brands like Taste of the Wild, Purina, Blue Buffalo and Orijen. Dry cat food is a simple choice for many pet owners, but with so many varieties out there, how do you choose the right one for your cuddly kitty? First, consider your cat’s age. Some dry cat food formulas are made for specific life stages, while others provide proper nutrition for cats of all ages, which is great for multiple-cat households. Activity level is also an important factor when deciding on a cat kibble, and there are many weight-management options for adult and mature indoor cats. There are even dry cat foods that cater to the needs of specific breeds. One of the most important factors when choosing a cat kibble, is protein flavor and whether or not it appeals to your cat’s palate. Choosing the healthiest dry cat food isn’t based on any one factor, but based on the specific needs of your feline. If your kitty has a grain allergy, look for grain-free kibble varieties to satisfy your cat without unwanted gastrointestinal side effects. There are also kibble varieties for kitties with sensitive stomachs. Healthy dry cat food made for sensitive stomachs contains prebiotics and probiotics to promote digestive health. Remember to allow the proper transition time as you try out different cat kibble and settle on the best dry cat food for your kitty’s needs. Shop top rated dry cat food brands on Chewy.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


Firm Contact Number: (800) 279-6851 




August 20, 2002


 




Release # 02-232





WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Arctic Cat Inc., of Thief River Falls, Minn., is voluntarily recalling about 45,000 all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). The ball joints on the front suspension of these ATVs can fail, resulting in a loss of control. This can cause the ATV to overturn, posing a risk of serious injury or death to riders. Arctic Cat has received 73 reports of broken front suspensions, 10 of which resulted in injuries to riders, including a shoulder rotator cuff injury, and bumps and bruises.The recalled 2002 model ATVs are either red or green. They have the brand name "Arctic Cat" written on both sides of the vehicle. The recall includes the following ATV model names: 250, 300, 300 Massey Ferguson, 375, 400, 400 i, 500, TBX 500 and 500i. Consumers should have their ATV's model name and 13-digit model number available when they call or visit the firm's web site to determine if an ATV is included in the recall. The model name is located on the front of the ATVs, just below the speedometer. The model number is included in the registration materials received at the time of purchase. Arctic Cat dealerships nationwide sold these ATVs from June 2001 through June 12, 2002 for between $4,000 and $6,500. Consumers should stop using these ATVs immediately. Registered owners have been notified about this recall by mail. To determine if an ATV is part of this recall, consumers should call Arctic Cat toll-free at (800) 279-6851 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. CT Monday through Friday or go to the firm's web site at www.arctic-cat.com. Consumers should have their ATV's model name and number available when they call. Consumers with a recalled ATV should contact their local Arctic Cat ATV dealer to schedule the free repair. 




The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing
          to CPSC's free e-mail newsletters.

History[edit]
Arctic Cat was formed by snowmobile pioneer Edgar Hetteen in 1960[2] due to his departure from his previous self-started business, Polaris Industries. Like Polaris, Arctic Cat grew to become a major manufacturer of snowmobiles, watercraft, and all-terrain vehicles (ATV's).[4] The company's first name was Polar Manufacturing but was soon changed to Arctic Enterprises.[2] The company made their first snowmobile in 1960 and in 1970, started the Boss Cat line.[5] Various boat manufacturers, including Silver Line, Lund and Spirit Marine, were bought to attempt to expand the company. However, Arctic Cat went bankrupt in 1982. Two years later, a new company Arctco was created to continue the production of Arctic Cat snowmobiles.[2] The company was successful in keeping the Arctic Cat alive and in 1996 the company changed its name to Arctic Cat.[6] The company continues to make snowmobiles as well as all-terrain vehicles and side-by-sides. Over the years, the company has attempted many other product lines including snowblowers, generators, mini bikes, and two-wheel drive vehicles. Arctic Cat relocated its headquarters, certain corporate executives, general managers, and sales and marketing personnel to Plymouth MN from Thief River Falls in 2007. In 2016, the headquarters was relocated again to a more prominent location in downtown Minneapolis. Also in 2016, most of the ATV/UTV engineering was moved to St. Cloud, MN, in the same facility that produces the Arctic Cat engines. Arctic Cat continues the majority of their manufacturing, along with snowmobile engineering, in Thief River Falls, Minnesota.[7]
On January 25, 2017 it was announced Arctic Cat will be acquired by Textron in for $247M in a cash transaction.[8]

Arctic Cat Snowmobile.


Arctic Cat is known for their M series snowmobile models which were 3rd in Market share behind Ski-doo and Polaris in 2003. This "Skinny Mini" prototype sled had features different from other sleds at that time, by utilizing parts that provided more than one role and a track that had less width then other sleds, reducing rotating mass. Cat discovered that this design was splendid for mountain riding, however the trail model developed an over heating issue as the heat exchanges were found to be insufficient when ridden on ice and in marginal snow conditions. Though the majority of sleds experienced no issues, this resulted in a class action lawsuit and resulted in an out of court settlement where cat bought back from owners 3200 short track Firecat F-7's. These sleds featured a lay down type engine which placed the carburetors in front of the engine. which was centered low in the sled to centralize mass and was believed to allow cooler air inlet temperatures. Big changes were made to the lineup for the 2007 model year as a new chassis was introduced which was called a twin-spar chassis replacing all previous models while adding a new 4 stroke engine, the Z1 Jaguar, which featured an 1056cc 4-stroke parallel twin. In 2009 the Z1 was turbocharged to produce 177 horsepower (132 kW), which was 1 horsepower (0.75 kW) more than any other production snowmobile.[9] The Crossfire and M-series remain on the same M-series chassis which is a spin off from the original Firecat Chassis.




Arctic Cat ATV in use by the Finnish Border Guard


All-terrain vehicles[edit]
Arctic Cat started producing utility all-terrain vehicles in 1996, and expanded to produce side by side UTV's in 2005. They now produce many different models from youth models to competition models, with other models being sport, recreation, 2-Up Trail, and utility models.[10] They also now offer a line of economy mid size utility atv's which are manufactured by Kymco in Taiwan. Most models come with both 2-wheel drive and 4-wheel drive, ride in suspensions, and electronic power steering capabilities.[11]
The original design of utility ATVs was offered from 1996 to 2004 and featured single cylinder liquid or air cooled motors from 250 to 500cc's, and all of a common design. This Arctic Cat-designed motor was manufactured by Suzuki and featured a 2V SOHC design with hemispherical combustion chambers. Manual and CVT automatic transmissions were offered. A 650V2 V-twin engine option borrowed from the Kawasaki Prairie was also offered starting in 2003. A major redesign of the platform was launched in 2005. With the new redesign came new body work, electronics, rear mounted gas tank and a standard front locking diff, though the chassis in general remained largely unchanged. A new high performance engine platform also debuted in the 650H1. This H1 platform was a direct evolution of the previous suzuki manufactured engines with many parts being interchangeable, but was now manufactured by Arctic Cat in the US. A 700EFI model was also offered which used an engine and transmission combo borrowed from the Suzuki king quad model. This is a 4V dohc design with no relation to the H1 engine platform. This was replaced with the 700H1 which was a higher displacement version of the 650H1 with fuel injection added. A 1000cc H2 V-twin engine, was also made available. Arctic Cat utility ATV's are primarily designed and marketed toward utilitarian uses such as farm work and hunting. Compared to other ATVs, they offer very high ground clearance, low gear ratios for towing, and large steel racks for hauling large loads, and large fuel tanks for extended range. The high ground clearance and locking differentials make them particularly adept off road. They also offer 2 up models, and the TBX model which features a large dump box and high payload capacity, and a Mud Pro model which features factory air snorkels to allow it to drive nearly submerged, larger mud tires, and stronger driveline components.
Side-by-sides[edit]
Arctic Cat offered its first side by side UTV, the Prowler, starting in 2005. This is a utility model with large rear mounted box similar to a pickup truck bed. It is mainly intended for utility and farm use and continues in production today. A new high performance model, the Wildcat was also launched to meet the new demand for recreational UTVs aimed at high speed trail riding which was made popular by the huge success of the Polaris RZR. Both Prowlers and Wildcats are offered in 2 and 4 seat models with various engine offerings.
In 2015, Arctic Cat launched the Side-By-Side (SXS) Racing Series as a support series to Speed Energy Formula Off-Road; the series fields ten Wildcat side-by-sides and made its debut at the Sand Sports Super Show in Costa Mesa, California.[12]

History[edit]
Arctic Cat was formed by snowmobile pioneer Edgar Hetteen in 1960[2] due to his departure from his previous self-started business, Polaris Industries. Like Polaris, Arctic Cat grew to become a major manufacturer of snowmobiles, watercraft, and all-terrain vehicles (ATV's).[4] The company's first name was Polar Manufacturing but was soon changed to Arctic Enterprises.[2] The company made their first snowmobile in 1960 and in 1970, started the Boss Cat line.[5] Various boat manufacturers, including Silver Line, Lund and Spirit Marine, were bought to attempt to expand the company. However, Arctic Cat went bankrupt in 1982. Two years later, a new company Arctco was created to continue the production of Arctic Cat snowmobiles.[2] The company was successful in keeping the Arctic Cat alive and in 1996 the company changed its name to Arctic Cat.[6] The company continues to make snowmobiles as well as all-terrain vehicles and side-by-sides. Over the years, the company has attempted many other product lines including snowblowers, generators, mini bikes, and two-wheel drive vehicles. Arctic Cat relocated its headquarters, certain corporate executives, general managers, and sales and marketing personnel to Plymouth MN from Thief River Falls in 2007. In 2016, the headquarters was relocated again to a more prominent location in downtown Minneapolis. Also in 2016, most of the ATV/UTV engineering was moved to St. Cloud, MN, in the same facility that produces the Arctic Cat engines. Arctic Cat continues the majority of their manufacturing, along with snowmobile engineering, in Thief River Falls, Minnesota.[7]
On January 25, 2017 it was announced Arctic Cat will be acquired by Textron in for $247M in a cash transaction.[8]

Arctic Cat Snowmobile.


Arctic Cat is known for their M series snowmobile models which were 3rd in Market share behind Ski-doo and Polaris in 2003. This "Skinny Mini" prototype sled had features different from other sleds at that time, by utilizing parts that provided more than one role and a track that had less width then other sleds, reducing rotating mass. Cat discovered that this design was splendid for mountain riding, however the trail model developed an over heating issue as the heat exchanges were found to be insufficient when ridden on ice and in marginal snow conditions. Though the majority of sleds experienced no issues, this resulted in a class action lawsuit and resulted in an out of court settlement where cat bought back from owners 3200 short track Firecat F-7's. These sleds featured a lay down type engine which placed the carburetors in front of the engine. which was centered low in the sled to centralize mass and was believed to allow cooler air inlet temperatures. Big changes were made to the lineup for the 2007 model year as a new chassis was introduced which was called a twin-spar chassis replacing all previous models while adding a new 4 stroke engine, the Z1 Jaguar, which featured an 1056cc 4-stroke parallel twin. In 2009 the Z1 was turbocharged to produce 177 horsepower (132 kW), which was 1 horsepower (0.75 kW) more than any other production snowmobile.[9] The Crossfire and M-series remain on the same M-series chassis which is a spin off from the original Firecat Chassis.

All-terrain vehicles[edit]
Arctic Cat started producing utility all-terrain vehicles in 1996, and expanded to produce side by side UTV's in 2005. They now produce many different models from youth models to competition models, with other models being sport, recreation, 2-Up Trail, and utility models.[10] They also now offer a line of economy mid size utility atv's which are manufactured by Kymco in Taiwan. Most models come with both 2-wheel drive and 4-wheel drive, ride in suspensions, and electronic power steering capabilities.[11]
The original design of utility ATVs was offered from 1996 to 2004 and featured single cylinder liquid or air cooled motors from 250 to 500cc's, and all of a common design. This Arctic Cat-designed motor was manufactured by Suzuki and featured a 2V SOHC design with hemispherical combustion chambers. Manual and CVT automatic transmissions were offered. A 650V2 V-twin engine option borrowed from the Kawasaki Prairie was also offered starting in 2003. A major redesign of the platform was launched in 2005. With the new redesign came new body work, electronics, rear mounted gas tank and a standard front locking diff, though the chassis in general remained largely unchanged. A new high performance engine platform also debuted in the 650H1. This H1 platform was a direct evolution of the previous suzuki manufactured engines with many parts being interchangeable, but was now manufactured by Arctic Cat in the US. A 700EFI model was also offered which used an engine and transmission combo borrowed from the Suzuki king quad model. This is a 4V dohc design with no relation to the H1 engine platform. This was replaced with the 700H1 which was a higher displacement version of the 650H1 with fuel injection added. A 1000cc H2 V-twin engine, was also made available. Arctic Cat utility ATV's are primarily designed and marketed toward utilitarian uses such as farm work and hunting. Compared to other ATVs, they offer very high ground clearance, low gear ratios for towing, and large steel racks for hauling large loads, and large fuel tanks for extended range. The high ground clearance and locking differentials make them particularly adept off road. They also offer 2 up models, and the TBX model which features a large dump box and high payload capacity, and a Mud Pro model which features factory air snorkels to allow it to drive nearly submerged, larger mud tires, and stronger driveline components.
Side-by-sides[edit]
Arctic Cat offered its first side by side UTV, the Prowler, starting in 2005. This is a utility model with large rear mounted box similar to a pickup truck bed. It is mainly intended for utility and farm use and continues in production today. A new high performance model, the Wildcat was also launched to meet the new demand for recreational UTVs aimed at high speed trail riding which was made popular by the huge success of the Polaris RZR. Both Prowlers and Wildcats are offered in 2 and 4 seat models with various engine offerings.
In 2015, Arctic Cat launched the Side-By-Side (SXS) Racing Series as a support series to Speed Energy Formula Off-Road; the series fields ten Wildcat side-by-sides and made its debut at the Sand Sports Super Show in Costa Mesa, California.[12]

Cat Supplies
If you’re a cat person—or a soon-to-be cat person—you’ve come to the right place. The Chewy Cat Shop has all the cat supplies your little furball could ever need, want, dream about, purr over and claw for. You’ll find pet cat supplies ranging from food and treats to litter and toys, supplements, beds and so much more. Here are some of the products you’ll discover.

Wet cat foods and dry cat foods have all the ingredients your cat needs to thrive. Since cats are obligate carnivores, look for foods that are high in protein. If you want to take your kitty’s nutrition to the next level, you can try freeze-dried and dehydrated cat foods. These foods give your cat all the goodness of the ingredients in their raw form. Freeze-dried food and treats are never cooked, and dehydrated raw foods are only gently cooked, so the vital nutrients aren’t lost in the cooking process.  

When it comes to cat potty solutions, there are more options than you might think. You can choose between standard litter boxes, covered litter boxes, specialized litter box systems, disposable litter boxes, and even automatic-scooping litter boxes. Some of these litter boxes require certain litters, while others do not. And when it comes to litter, there are even more options—clumping, non-clumping, all-natural, lightweight, multi-cat, scented, unscented, and on and on. Explore the selection of litters and weigh the benefits of each before deciding which litter is best for your cat. 

Cat toys are an essential part of the necessary cat supplies, and the types of toys cats love are seemingly endless. Balls and chaser cat toys are sure to keep your cat busy, even when you can’t be there to play with her. Teaser cat toys provide a great opportunity to bond with your cat while also feeding her playful side. And many interactive cat toys are made to challenge your cat by presenting puzzles for her to conquer in order to reach her treats. They will keep your cat busy when left alone and can even curb unwanted behaviors that result from boredom. 

Cat beds fulfill all your kitty’s catnap needs. You’ll find standard pillow cat beds and covered cat beds that are sure to keep any cat purring all night long. Or step up the comfort level with an orthopedic cat bed. It’s perfect for any cat, and a must if your cat has hip and joint pain—a common issue with aging cats. If you want your cat to have a place to nap and play all in one—a place she’ll thank you for with endless snuggles—get her a cat tree. You’ll find a range of shapes, sizes and materials, so browse around to find the perfect cat tree for your feline family member.

The Chewy Cat Shop has these cat supplies and many more. Discover high-quality cat items like food and water bowls, leashes, collars, grooming supplies, dietary supplements, crates, pens and travel supplies. So have a look around, and find the cat supplies your kitty will purr over.

Cat Food
Whether your feline friend is sitting down to a meal or enjoying a kitty snack, ensure they’re getting the nutrients they need, and the flavor they deserve with the top cat food and treats. Chewy carries only the best cat food brands, making shopping for your feline’s food easier than ever. Chewy carries cat food brands your cuddly kitty will love like Fancy Feast, Friskies & Royal Canin. A balanced diet is vital to the overall health of your courageous cat, but every cat has different needs and tastes. Cat food comes in a variety of textures, ingredients and flavors. There are also healthy cat food brands that offer recipes that help address health concerns like urinary tract health, allergies, digestive health and more. 

Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Urinary SO cat food comes in wet and dry varieties, and helps promote urinary tract health. Urinary crystals and stones are often linked to this disease, but the most common cause of lower urinary tract disease is idiopathic cystitis. Wet and dry cat food that promotes urinary health can help dissolve pure struvite uroliths, and help prevent struvite, calcium oxalate and phosphate uroliths. Looking for natural cat food? Chewy carries natural cat food brands like Cat Chow and Natural Balance, which feature minimal ingredients for cats with allergies. Natural Balance produces grain-free natural cat food in dry and wet varieties for felines with food sensitivities. 

Wet cat food is great for the classy kitty who demands meals packed with flavor. Fancy Feast offers a variety of canned cat food recipes like poultry and beef, seafood feast and chicken feast. Chewy also carries several dry cat food brands, great for the kitty who likes to nibble throughout the day. 
When it comes to rewarding your pet, picking the right treat matters. Chewy offers the top cat treat brands like Greenies, Temptations and Friskies. If your cat’s in need of some tender love and dental care, look to Greenies for a healthy kitty snack. Feline Greenies are specifically designed to help remove plaque buildup while your cat chews. Whether it’s meal time or snack time, treat your kitty to meals they’ll love from Chewy today!

History[edit]
Arctic Cat was formed by snowmobile pioneer Edgar Hetteen in 1960[2] due to his departure from his previous self-started business, Polaris Industries. Like Polaris, Arctic Cat grew to become a major manufacturer of snowmobiles, watercraft, and all-terrain vehicles (ATV's).[4] The company's first name was Polar Manufacturing but was soon changed to Arctic Enterprises.[2] The company made their first snowmobile in 1960 and in 1970, started the Boss Cat line.[5] Various boat manufacturers, including Silver Line, Lund and Spirit Marine, were bought to attempt to expand the company. However, Arctic Cat went bankrupt in 1982. Two years later, a new company Arctco was created to continue the production of Arctic Cat snowmobiles.[2] The company was successful in keeping the Arctic Cat alive and in 1996 the company changed its name to Arctic Cat.[6] The company continues to make snowmobiles as well as all-terrain vehicles and side-by-sides. Over the years, the company has attempted many other product lines including snowblowers, generators, mini bikes, and two-wheel drive vehicles. Arctic Cat relocated its headquarters, certain corporate executives, general managers, and sales and marketing personnel to Plymouth MN from Thief River Falls in 2007. In 2016, the headquarters was relocated again to a more prominent location in downtown Minneapolis. Also in 2016, most of the ATV/UTV engineering was moved to St. Cloud, MN, in the same facility that produces the Arctic Cat engines. Arctic Cat continues the majority of their manufacturing, along with snowmobile engineering, in Thief River Falls, Minnesota.[7]
On January 25, 2017 it was announced Arctic Cat will be acquired by Textron in for $247M in a cash transaction.[8]

Arctic Cat Snowmobile.


Arctic Cat is known for their M series snowmobile models which were 3rd in Market share behind Ski-doo and Polaris in 2003. This "Skinny Mini" prototype sled had features different from other sleds at that time, by utilizing parts that provided more than one role and a track that had less width then other sleds, reducing rotating mass. Cat discovered that this design was splendid for mountain riding, however the trail model developed an over heating issue as the heat exchanges were found to be insufficient when ridden on ice and in marginal snow conditions. Though the majority of sleds experienced no issues, this resulted in a class action lawsuit and resulted in an out of court settlement where cat bought back from owners 3200 short track Firecat F-7's. These sleds featured a lay down type engine which placed the carburetors in front of the engine. which was centered low in the sled to centralize mass and was believed to allow cooler air inlet temperatures. Big changes were made to the lineup for the 2007 model year as a new chassis was introduced which was called a twin-spar chassis replacing all previous models while adding a new 4 stroke engine, the Z1 Jaguar, which featured an 1056cc 4-stroke parallel twin. In 2009 the Z1 was turbocharged to produce 177 horsepower (132 kW), which was 1 horsepower (0.75 kW) more than any other production snowmobile.[9] The Crossfire and M-series remain on the same M-series chassis which is a spin off from the original Firecat Chassis.

All-terrain vehicles[edit]
Arctic Cat started producing utility all-terrain vehicles in 1996, and expanded to produce side by side UTV's in 2005. They now produce many different models from youth models to competition models, with other models being sport, recreation, 2-Up Trail, and utility models.[10] They also now offer a line of economy mid size utility atv's which are manufactured by Kymco in Taiwan. Most models come with both 2-wheel drive and 4-wheel drive, ride in suspensions, and electronic power steering capabilities.[11]
The original design of utility ATVs was offered from 1996 to 2004 and featured single cylinder liquid or air cooled motors from 250 to 500cc's, and all of a common design. This Arctic Cat-designed motor was manufactured by Suzuki and featured a 2V SOHC design with hemispherical combustion chambers. Manual and CVT automatic transmissions were offered. A 650V2 V-twin engine option borrowed from the Kawasaki Prairie was also offered starting in 2003. A major redesign of the platform was launched in 2005. With the new redesign came new body work, electronics, rear mounted gas tank and a standard front locking diff, though the chassis in general remained largely unchanged. A new high performance engine platform also debuted in the 650H1. This H1 platform was a direct evolution of the previous suzuki manufactured engines with many parts being interchangeable, but was now manufactured by Arctic Cat in the US. A 700EFI model was also offered which used an engine and transmission combo borrowed from the Suzuki king quad model. This is a 4V dohc design with no relation to the H1 engine platform. This was replaced with the 700H1 which was a higher displacement version of the 650H1 with fuel injection added. A 1000cc H2 V-twin engine, was also made available. Arctic Cat utility ATV's are primarily designed and marketed toward utilitarian uses such as farm work and hunting. Compared to other ATVs, they offer very high ground clearance, low gear ratios for towing, and large steel racks for hauling large loads, and large fuel tanks for extended range. The high ground clearance and locking differentials make them particularly adept off road. They also offer 2 up models, and the TBX model which features a large dump box and high payload capacity, and a Mud Pro model which features factory air snorkels to allow it to drive nearly submerged, larger mud tires, and stronger driveline components.
Side-by-sides[edit]
Arctic Cat offered its first side by side UTV, the Prowler, starting in 2005. This is a utility model with large rear mounted box similar to a pickup truck bed. It is mainly intended for utility and farm use and continues in production today. A new high performance model, the Wildcat was also launched to meet the new demand for recreational UTVs aimed at high speed trail riding which was made popular by the huge success of the Polaris RZR. Both Prowlers and Wildcats are offered in 2 and 4 seat models with various engine offerings.
In 2015, Arctic Cat launched the Side-By-Side (SXS) Racing Series as a support series to Speed Energy Formula Off-Road; the series fields ten Wildcat side-by-sides and made its debut at the Sand Sports Super Show in Costa Mesa, California.[12]

History[edit]
Arctic Cat was formed by snowmobile pioneer Edgar Hetteen in 1960[2] due to his departure from his previous self-started business, Polaris Industries. Like Polaris, Arctic Cat grew to become a major manufacturer of snowmobiles, watercraft, and all-terrain vehicles (ATV's).[4] The company's first name was Polar Manufacturing but was soon changed to Arctic Enterprises.[2] The company made their first snowmobile in 1960 and in 1970, started the Boss Cat line.[5] Various boat manufacturers, including Silver Line, Lund and Spirit Marine, were bought to attempt to expand the company. However, Arctic Cat went bankrupt in 1982. Two years later, a new company Arctco was created to continue the production of Arctic Cat snowmobiles.[2] The company was successful in keeping the Arctic Cat alive and in 1996 the company changed its name to Arctic Cat.[6] The company continues to make snowmobiles as well as all-terrain vehicles and side-by-sides. Over the years, the company has attempted many other product lines including snowblowers, generators, mini bikes, and two-wheel drive vehicles. Arctic Cat relocated its headquarters, certain corporate executives, general managers, and sales and marketing personnel to Plymouth MN from Thief River Falls in 2007. In 2016, the headquarters was relocated again to a more prominent location in downtown Minneapolis. Also in 2016, most of the ATV/UTV engineering was moved to St. Cloud, MN, in the same facility that produces the Arctic Cat engines. Arctic Cat continues the majority of their manufacturing, along with snowmobile engineering, in Thief River Falls, Minnesota.[7]
On January 25, 2017 it was announced Arctic Cat will be acquired by Textron in for $247M in a cash transaction.[8]

Arctic Cat Snowmobile.


Arctic Cat is known for their M series snowmobile models which were 3rd in Market share behind Ski-doo and Polaris in 2003. This "Skinny Mini" prototype sled had features different from other sleds at that time, by utilizing parts that provided more than one role and a track that had less width then other sleds, reducing rotating mass. Cat discovered that this design was splendid for mountain riding, however the trail model developed an over heating issue as the heat exchanges were found to be insufficient when ridden on ice and in marginal snow conditions. Though the majority of sleds experienced no issues, this resulted in a class action lawsuit and resulted in an out of court settlement where cat bought back from owners 3200 short track Firecat F-7's. These sleds featured a lay down type engine which placed the carburetors in front of the engine. which was centered low in the sled to centralize mass and was believed to allow cooler air inlet temperatures. Big changes were made to the lineup for the 2007 model year as a new chassis was introduced which was called a twin-spar chassis replacing all previous models while adding a new 4 stroke engine, the Z1 Jaguar, which featured an 1056cc 4-stroke parallel twin. In 2009 the Z1 was turbocharged to produce 177 horsepower (132 kW), which was 1 horsepower (0.75 kW) more than any other production snowmobile.[9] The Crossfire and M-series remain on the same M-series chassis which is a spin off from the original Firecat Chassis.

All-terrain vehicles[edit]
Arctic Cat started producing utility all-terrain vehicles in 1996, and expanded to produce side by side UTV's in 2005. They now produce many different models from youth models to competition models, with other models being sport, recreation, 2-Up Trail, and utility models.[10] They also now offer a line of economy mid size utility atv's which are manufactured by Kymco in Taiwan. Most models come with both 2-wheel drive and 4-wheel drive, ride in suspensions, and electronic power steering capabilities.[11]
The original design of utility ATVs was offered from 1996 to 2004 and featured single cylinder liquid or air cooled motors from 250 to 500cc's, and all of a common design. This Arctic Cat-designed motor was manufactured by Suzuki and featured a 2V SOHC design with hemispherical combustion chambers. Manual and CVT automatic transmissions were offered. A 650V2 V-twin engine option borrowed from the Kawasaki Prairie was also offered starting in 2003. A major redesign of the platform was launched in 2005. With the new redesign came new body work, electronics, rear mounted gas tank and a standard front locking diff, though the chassis in general remained largely unchanged. A new high performance engine platform also debuted in the 650H1. This H1 platform was a direct evolution of the previous suzuki manufactured engines with many parts being interchangeable, but was now manufactured by Arctic Cat in the US. A 700EFI model was also offered which used an engine and transmission combo borrowed from the Suzuki king quad model. This is a 4V dohc design with no relation to the H1 engine platform. This was replaced with the 700H1 which was a higher displacement version of the 650H1 with fuel injection added. A 1000cc H2 V-twin engine, was also made available. Arctic Cat utility ATV's are primarily designed and marketed toward utilitarian uses such as farm work and hunting. Compared to other ATVs, they offer very high ground clearance, low gear ratios for towing, and large steel racks for hauling large loads, and large fuel tanks for extended range. The high ground clearance and locking differentials make them particularly adept off road. They also offer 2 up models, and the TBX model which features a large dump box and high payload capacity, and a Mud Pro model which features factory air snorkels to allow it to drive nearly submerged, larger mud tires, and stronger driveline components.
Side-by-sides[edit]
Arctic Cat offered its first side by side UTV, the Prowler, starting in 2005. This is a utility model with large rear mounted box similar to a pickup truck bed. It is mainly intended for utility and farm use and continues in production today. A new high performance model, the Wildcat was also launched to meet the new demand for recreational UTVs aimed at high speed trail riding which was made popular by the huge success of the Polaris RZR. Both Prowlers and Wildcats are offered in 2 and 4 seat models with various engine offerings.
In 2015, Arctic Cat launched the Side-By-Side (SXS) Racing Series as a support series to Speed Energy Formula Off-Road; the series fields ten Wildcat side-by-sides and made its debut at the Sand Sports Super Show in Costa Mesa, California.[12]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
