MXL2 is the new AiM dashlogger providing all the info needed by professional racers as well as by newbies. 
                                The product has been designed with the aim to make configuration and usage smooth and easy either for amateurs  and for people with sophisticated technical background. 
MXL2 acquires and displays data coming from your ECU, the internal accelerometer and gyro, as well as from the GPS08 module included in the kit, analog/digital inputs and predefined math channels. 
Performance and data acquired can also be incremented adding up to eight expansion modules.

Second
CAN











GPS08 Module




























With the CAN Output you can send messages directly to an existing CAN network in order to improve the range of vehicle control possibilities.

















You can define up to eight different custom pages, choosing among a wide library of page styles, defining which data to be shown, their end of scale and measure units. 
                                Here, examples of pages with 1, 2, 3 or 4 different data:


























The MXL2 display features a high contrast
traditional LCD, with a black to white ratio
nearly double its predecessor, fused with a
graphical LCD offering great flexibility in
information display and alerts.
The MXL2 now offers a dual colored
backlight of high contrast white and red
which can also be changed conditionally.

An ambient light sensor keeps the
backlight at optimum brightness levels.


























Six different alarm LEDs: you choose the conditions,  the colors and the flashing frequency. 
                              You can configure them in order to turn them on/off depending on analog or digital inputs, ECU values, expansion values, GPS information or math channels.











                              You can also associate an alarm LED a message and a digital output with each event.


























MXL2 features two digital outputs. 
                                The two digital outputs (Dout) are LOW SIDE type (switch to ground): they  can be configured in order to be turned on/off depending on the value of the analog or digital inputs. 
                                They permit to automatically run external systems, i.e. to switch on/off additional lights, to activate/de-activate a cooling fan or circulation pumps, etc. when a certain event happens.

























More info




























An integrated shift light is a hallmark of
the MXL, but an even better 10 LED shift
light array is found in the MXL2.
Choose from a host of advanced multicolored
RGB shift light patterns that can be
customized to your liking, and for each
unique gear when required.





























Are you an MXL (Strada or Pista) owner? 
                                Connecting the MXL2 to your car is very easy. 
                                  
                                You do not need to cable your car again: just connect the specific adapter harness to your standard AiM MXL  harness and immediately exploit the huge potential of the newest MXL2.































More info




























Using the built-in CAN bus, you can add expansion modules to the MXL2 to increment the performance and the data acquired: 








GPS08 Module
Thanks to GPS08 Module (included in the kit) and its Race Studio 3 software, you can immediately get laptimes and all data needed for engine tuning as well as for improving driving technique. 










Channel Expansion
                                      It permits to add 4 0-5Volt analog channels for pressure, temperature sensors and potentiometers. Two of these channels can be configured to receive digital inputs like wheel speed.










TC Hub
                                      It adds 4 K thermocouples.










LCU-One Lambda Controller Wide band Lambda controller LCU-One, with Bosch LSU 4.9 probe, providing all Air/Fuel data, lambda value and exhaust gas temperature, allows to perfectly tune the carburetion.










SmartyCam HD cameras
 The on-board cameras that overlays on videos the data sampled by your logger.










Memory Module
The Memory Module is a small SD Card holder that can be connected via CAN bus to your AiM logger in order to record the data during your tests.

                                      examples






























Race Studio 3 is the heart of your MXL2, managing all your activities related to: 

Configuration
                                With Race Studio 3 you can create, modify, delete, import and export configurations with all channels, ECU drivers, Math channels, Display Pages, Digital outputs, Alarms, Shift Lights and all the expansions you need.
                                You will also be able to manage the map of all your racing tracks and compare two laps watching the video recorded by SmartyCam HD cameras.











Analysis
