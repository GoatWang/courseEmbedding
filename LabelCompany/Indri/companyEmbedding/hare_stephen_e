BOCA RATON, Fla. & NAPERVILLE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Office Depot, Inc. (NYSE:ODP), a leading global provider of office

      Company, and interim Co-CFO Deb O’Connor, who has returned to her 
      position as Senior Vice President, Finance and Co-Chief Accounting 
      Officer.
    

      Hare comes to Office Depot, Inc. from The Wendy’s Company where he 
      served as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer from 2011 
      until September 2013. Hare was Senior Vice President and Chief Financial

      “Having worked closely with Steve on transforming businesses in the 
      past, I know he brings to Office Depot, Inc. the knowledge and 
      discipline needed to realize the synergies inherent in the merger of 
      Office Depot and OfficeMax,” Smith said. “I am confident that Steve’s 
      financial skills and wealth of operations and management experience will 
      enable us to be a more competitive and efficient provider of office 
      products and services, and set us on a path for sustainable growth.
    

      “I also would like to thank Mike for his many contributions to Office 
      Depot over the past five years,” Smith added. “In that time, he has 
      delivered strong financial and operational management and successfully 
      guided the Company during a period of significant economic challenges. 
      Further, his leadership has been instrumental in the merger and 
      integration of Office Depot and OfficeMax. The Board and I wish him the 
      best in the future.
    

      “Additionally, I would like to thank Deb for stepping up these last four 
      months and assuming the role of interim CFO,” Smith said. “She has done 
      an outstanding job of leading the OfficeMax financial organization and 
      supporting the integration.”
    

      Smith plans to have the Office Depot, Inc. Executive Committee in place 
      by the end of this month.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

					OFFICE DEPOT CFO HARE CHARGED WITH DUI			

		by bocanews 


Stephen Hare, CFO of OfficeDepot, Courtesy Palm Beach County Jail. 
UPDATED: 10:44a with arrest report. 
BOCA RATON, FL (BocaNewsNow.com) — Stephen E. Hare, recently named Chief Financial Officer of Boca-based Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) spent part of the weekend in the Palm Beach County Jail following his arrest for DUI.
The affidavit of probable cause obtained by BocaNewsNow.com reveals a blood alcohol content of .180 and .186 in two tests, taken after police stopped Hare — allegedly speeding in his Audi on Palmetto Park Road. Read the entire report here. 
Boca Raton Police arrested Hare early Sunday morning. He was booked into jail a short time later and released in his own recognizance by 9am. 
A court date is pending.
Hare, 60, of Sabal Palm Drive, joined Office Depot following its merger with OfficeMax late in 2013. He joined the company from Wendy's and is a graduate of Harvard Business School, as highlighted in this press release excerpt:

Hare comes to Office Depot, Inc. from The Wendy’s Company where he served as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer from 2011 until September 2013. Hare was Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, Inc. from 2008 through 2011. Previously, he served as Chief Financial Officer of Arby’s Restaurant Group, Inc.
“Having worked closely with Steve on transforming businesses in the past, I know he brings to Office Depot, Inc. the knowledge and discipline needed to realize the synergies inherent in the merger of Office Depot and OfficeMax,” Smith said. “I am confident that Steve’s financial skills and wealth of operations and management experience will enable us to be a more competitive and efficient provider of office products and services, and set us on a path for sustainable growth.”
Prior to his senior management positions with The Wendy’s Company, Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, Inc., and Arby’s Restaurant Group, Inc., Hare was Executive Vice President of Cadmus Communications Corp. and the President of Publisher Services Group, a division of Cadmus, from 2003 to 2006. He served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Cadmus from 2001 to 2003.
From 1996 to 2001, Hare was Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of AMF Bowling Worldwide, where he also was a member of the Board of Directors. From 1990 to 1996, he was Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of James River Corp.
Hare, 60 years old, serves on the Board of Directors of Hanger, Inc. (NYSE: HGR). He graduated with a BBA from the University of Notre Dame and with an MBA from the Harvard Business School.
