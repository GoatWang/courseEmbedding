Early life and education[edit]
Lefkofsky grew up in Southfield, Michigan, the son of Bill, a structural engineer, and Sandy, a school teacher. He is Jewish. He has a brother, Steven, an attorney practicing in Michigan, and a sister, Jodi, also a former school teacher. After graduating from Southfield-Lathrup High School in 1987, Lefkofsky attended the University of Michigan and graduated with honors in 1991. He continued on at University of Michigan Law School to receive his Juris Doctor in 1993.[7]
Entrepreneurial ventures[edit]
Lefkofsky began his career selling carpet at the University of Michigan. After law school, in 1993, he and a college friend, Brad Keywell, borrowed money from relatives to buy an apparel company in Madison, Wisconsin named Brandon Apparel.
In 1999, Lefkofsky and Keywell created an early Internet company called Starbelly that specialized in promotional products. Starbelly experienced rapid "pre-bubble" Internet growth and was sold to Halo Industries in January 2000. Lefkofsky joined Halo to become chief operating officer. A little more than a year later, the company went bankrupt. Halo and Starbelly faced multiple lawsuits from shareholders, all of which were resolved by 2004.
After Starbelly, Lefkofsky, co-founded InnerWorkings in the fall of 2001. InnerWorkings provided print procurement services for mid-sized companies and achieved solid year-over-year growth. In August 2006, InnerWorkings had a successful initial public offering in the U.S. stock market (Nasdaq: INWK).[8] Lefkofsky was on the board of directors of InnerWorkings until October 2012.
In February 2005, Lefkofsky and Keywell created a freight logistics company called Echo Global Logistics. Echo attracted series D financing from New Enterprise Associates (NEA), one of the largest technology investors in the country, in June 2006. Echo Global Logistics went public on the NASDAQ under the symbol 'ECHO' and is now successfully being traded.[9]
In June 2006, Lefkofsky and Keywell founded MediaBank, a media-buying technology company. MediaBank provides advertising buyers with planning, buying, accounting and analysis software. In June 2007, MediaBank acquired Datatech,[10] one of the leading media planning and procurement platforms in the advertising industry. In July 2007, New Enterprise Associates invested in MediaBank.[11] In February 2012, the US Department of Justice approved a merger between MediaBank and Donovan Data Systems to create a single company, Mediaocean, in a deal estimated at $1.5 billion.[12]
In January 2007, Lefkofsky co-founded and provided $1,000,000 in funding for ThePoint.com, an online collective action website started by Andrew Mason. New Enterprise Associates led an early stage investment round in ThePoint.[13] In late 2008, The Point changed its name to Groupon.com. In October 2009, Groupon raised $30 million from Accel Partners and New Enterprise Associates.[14] In April 2010, Digital Sky Technology and Battery Ventures invested $135 million in Groupon at a valuation of $1.35 billion. In August 2010, Forbes reported that Groupon is the fastest growing company in history.[15]
In February 2010, Lefkokfsky and Keywell announced a new venture firm called Lightbank that plans to develop new companies in the Chicago area.[16]
In December 2010, Google offered a reported $6 billion for Groupon. The offer was turned down, possibly due to anti-trust and regulatory scrutiny the deal might face.[17]
In October 2011, Groupon [18] raised $950 million in private funding in January and then paid $810 million to employees and investors. Mr. Lefkofsky and family were paid $398 million of these funds.[19]
In November 2011, Groupon's IPO was the biggest by a US web company since Google, raising $700 million at $20 per share.[20]
In August 2013, Lefkofsky became CEO of Groupon.[21]
In July 2014, Lefkofsky co-founded Uptake, LLC, an analytics company.
In November 2015, Lefkofsky stepped down as CEO of Groupon, resuming his role as Chairman.
In 2016, Lefkofsky co-founded Tempus,[22] a technology company that enables physicians to deliver personalized cancer care, and serves as its CEO.
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2006, Eric Lefkofsky and his wife, Elizabeth, formed a charitable trust, the Lefkofsky Foundation, for the "purpose of supporting charitable, scientific, and educational organizations and causes around the world". The foundation has a focus on children. The foundation has helped fund more than 50 organizations to date.[23]
In 2013, Lefkofsky and his wife joined The Giving Pledge.[24][25]
Community interests[edit]
Lefkofsky is on the board of directors at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, the board of directors of The Art Institute of Chicago, the board of directors of The Museum of Science and Industry, and a Trustee of Steppenwolf Theatre Company, a Chicago-based performing arts institution.[26] He is a board member of World Business Chicago, and serves as co-chairman of its Technology Council.[27]
In May 2008, Lefkofsky joined the committee to bring the 2016 Summer Olympics to Chicago, Chicago 2016.
Teaching and writing[edit]
Since his success at InnerWorkings, Lefkofsky began a teaching career at business schools in the Chicago area. He previously taught Applied Technology at DePaul University's Kellstadt Graduate School of Business and at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University where he taught a course in disruptive business models. Lefkofsky is currently[when?] an Adjunct Professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, teaching a course on entrepreneurship and building technology-based businesses.[28]
In November, Easton Studio Press published Lefkofsky's Accelerated Disruption, a book about how technology affects business.

Early life and education[edit]
Lefkofsky grew up in Southfield, Michigan, the son of Bill, a structural engineer, and Sandy, a school teacher. He is Jewish. He has a brother, Steven, an attorney practicing in Michigan, and a sister, Jodi, also a former school teacher. After graduating from Southfield-Lathrup High School in 1987, Lefkofsky attended the University of Michigan and graduated with honors in 1991. He continued on at University of Michigan Law School to receive his Juris Doctor in 1993.[7]
Entrepreneurial ventures[edit]
Lefkofsky began his career selling carpet at the University of Michigan. After law school, in 1993, he and a college friend, Brad Keywell, borrowed money from relatives to buy an apparel company in Madison, Wisconsin named Brandon Apparel.
In 1999, Lefkofsky and Keywell created an early Internet company called Starbelly that specialized in promotional products. Starbelly experienced rapid "pre-bubble" Internet growth and was sold to Halo Industries in January 2000. Lefkofsky joined Halo to become chief operating officer. A little more than a year later, the company went bankrupt. Halo and Starbelly faced multiple lawsuits from shareholders, all of which were resolved by 2004.
After Starbelly, Lefkofsky, co-founded InnerWorkings in the fall of 2001. InnerWorkings provided print procurement services for mid-sized companies and achieved solid year-over-year growth. In August 2006, InnerWorkings had a successful initial public offering in the U.S. stock market (Nasdaq: INWK).[8] Lefkofsky was on the board of directors of InnerWorkings until October 2012.
In February 2005, Lefkofsky and Keywell created a freight logistics company called Echo Global Logistics. Echo attracted series D financing from New Enterprise Associates (NEA), one of the largest technology investors in the country, in June 2006. Echo Global Logistics went public on the NASDAQ under the symbol 'ECHO' and is now successfully being traded.[9]
In June 2006, Lefkofsky and Keywell founded MediaBank, a media-buying technology company. MediaBank provides advertising buyers with planning, buying, accounting and analysis software. In June 2007, MediaBank acquired Datatech,[10] one of the leading media planning and procurement platforms in the advertising industry. In July 2007, New Enterprise Associates invested in MediaBank.[11] In February 2012, the US Department of Justice approved a merger between MediaBank and Donovan Data Systems to create a single company, Mediaocean, in a deal estimated at $1.5 billion.[12]
In January 2007, Lefkofsky co-founded and provided $1,000,000 in funding for ThePoint.com, an online collective action website started by Andrew Mason. New Enterprise Associates led an early stage investment round in ThePoint.[13] In late 2008, The Point changed its name to Groupon.com. In October 2009, Groupon raised $30 million from Accel Partners and New Enterprise Associates.[14] In April 2010, Digital Sky Technology and Battery Ventures invested $135 million in Groupon at a valuation of $1.35 billion. In August 2010, Forbes reported that Groupon is the fastest growing company in history.[15]
In February 2010, Lefkokfsky and Keywell announced a new venture firm called Lightbank that plans to develop new companies in the Chicago area.[16]
In December 2010, Google offered a reported $6 billion for Groupon. The offer was turned down, possibly due to anti-trust and regulatory scrutiny the deal might face.[17]
In October 2011, Groupon [18] raised $950 million in private funding in January and then paid $810 million to employees and investors. Mr. Lefkofsky and family were paid $398 million of these funds.[19]
In November 2011, Groupon's IPO was the biggest by a US web company since Google, raising $700 million at $20 per share.[20]
In August 2013, Lefkofsky became CEO of Groupon.[21]
In July 2014, Lefkofsky co-founded Uptake, LLC, an analytics company.
In November 2015, Lefkofsky stepped down as CEO of Groupon, resuming his role as Chairman.
In 2016, Lefkofsky co-founded Tempus,[22] a technology company that enables physicians to deliver personalized cancer care, and serves as its CEO.
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2006, Eric Lefkofsky and his wife, Elizabeth, formed a charitable trust, the Lefkofsky Foundation, for the "purpose of supporting charitable, scientific, and educational organizations and causes around the world". The foundation has a focus on children. The foundation has helped fund more than 50 organizations to date.[23]
In 2013, Lefkofsky and his wife joined The Giving Pledge.[24][25]
Community interests[edit]
Lefkofsky is on the board of directors at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, the board of directors of The Art Institute of Chicago, the board of directors of The Museum of Science and Industry, and a Trustee of Steppenwolf Theatre Company, a Chicago-based performing arts institution.[26] He is a board member of World Business Chicago, and serves as co-chairman of its Technology Council.[27]
In May 2008, Lefkofsky joined the committee to bring the 2016 Summer Olympics to Chicago, Chicago 2016.
Teaching and writing[edit]
Since his success at InnerWorkings, Lefkofsky began a teaching career at business schools in the Chicago area. He previously taught Applied Technology at DePaul University's Kellstadt Graduate School of Business and at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University where he taught a course in disruptive business models.

He is co-founder and CEO of Tempus.[4] He is also the co-founder and chairman of Groupon,[5] co-founder of Echo Global Logistics (ECHO), InnerWorkings (INWK), Mediaocean,[6] and Uptake. He is also a co-founder of Chicago-based venture capital firm, Lightbank.Contents1 Early life and education2 Entrepreneurial ventures3 Philanthropy4 Community interests5 Teaching and writing6 References7 External linksEarly life and educationLefkofsky grew up in Southfield, Michigan, the son of Bill, a structural engineer, and Sandy, a school teacher. He is Jewish. He has a brother, Steven, an attorney practicing in Michigan, and a sister, Jodi, also a former school teacher. After graduating from Southfield-Lathrup High School in 1987, Lefkofsky attended the University of Michigan and graduated with honors in 1991. He continued on at University of Michigan Law School to receive his Juris Doctor in 1993.[7]Entrepreneurial venturesLefkofsky began his career selling carpet at the University of Michigan. After law school, in 1993, he and a college friend, Brad Keywell, borrowed money from relatives to buy an apparel company in Madison, Wisconsin named Brandon Apparel.In 1999, Lefkofsky and Keywell created an early Internet company called Starbelly that specialized in promotional products. Starbelly experienced rapid "pre-bubble" Internet growth and was sold to Halo Industries in January 2000. Lefkofsky joined Halo to become chief operating officer. A little more than a year later, the company went bankrupt. Halo and Starbelly faced multiple lawsuits from shareholders, all of which were resolved by 2004.After Starbelly, Lefkofsky, co-founded InnerWorkings in the fall of 2001. InnerWorkings provided print procurement services for mid-sized companies and achieved solid year-over-year growth. In August 2006, InnerWorkings had a successful initial public offering in the U.S. stock market (Nasdaq: INWK).[8] Lefkofsky was on the board of directors of InnerWorkings until October 2012.In February 2005, Lefkofsky and Keywell created a freight logistics company called Echo Global Logistics. Echo attracted series D financing from New Enterprise Associates (NEA), one of the largest technology investors in the country, in June 2006. Echo Global Logistics went public on the NASDAQ under the symbol 'ECHO' and is now successfully being traded.[9]In June 2006, Lefkofsky and Keywell founded MediaBank, a media-buying technology company. MediaBank provides advertising buyers with planning, buying, accounting and analysis software. In June 2007, MediaBank acquired Datatech,[10] one of the leading media planning and procurement platforms in the advertising industry. In July 2007, New Enterprise Associates invested in MediaBank.[11] In February 2012, the US Department of Justice approved a merger between MediaBank and Donovan Data Systems to create a single company, Mediaocean, in a deal estimated at $1.5 billion.[12]In January 2007, Lefkofsky co-founded and provided $1,000,000 in funding for ThePoint.com, an online collective action website started by Andrew Mason. New Enterprise Associates led an early stage investment round in ThePoint.[13] In late 2008, The Point changed its name to Groupon.com. In October 2009, Groupon raised $30 million from Accel Partners and New Enterprise Associates.[14] In April 2010, Digital Sky Technology and Battery Ventures invested $135 million in Groupon at a valuation of $1.35 billion. In August 2010, Forbes reported that Groupon is the fastest growing company in history.[15]In February 2010, Lefkokfsky and Keywell announced a new venture firm called Lightbank that plans to develop new companies in the Chicago area.[16]In December 2010, Google offered a reported $6 billion for Groupon. The offer was turned down, possibly due to anti-trust and regulatory scrutiny the deal might face.[17]In October 2011, Groupon [18] raised $950 million in private funding in January and then paid $810 million to employees and investors. Mr. Lefkofsky and family were paid $398 million of these funds.[19]In November 2011, Groupon's IPO was the biggest by a US web company since Google, raising $700 million at $20 per share.[20]In August 2013, Lefkofsky became CEO of Groupon.[21]In July 2014, Lefkofsky co-founded Uptake, LLC, an analytics company.In November 2015, Lefkofsky stepped down as CEO of Groupon, resuming his role as Chairman.In 2016, Lefkofsky co-founded Tempus,[22] a technology company that enables physicians to deliver personalized cancer care, and serves as its CEO.PhilanthropyIn 2006, Eric Lefkofsky and his wife, Elizabeth, formed a charitable trust, the Lefkofsky Foundation, for the "purpose of supporting charitable, scientific, and educational organizations and causes around the world". The foundation has a focus on children. The foundation has helped fund more than 50 organizations to date.[23]In 2013, Lefkofsky and his wife joined The Giving Pledge.[24][25]Community interestsLefkofsky is on the board of directors at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, the board of directors of The Art Institute of Chicago, the board of directors of The Museum of Science and Industry, and a Trustee of Steppenwolf Theatre Company, a Chicago-based performing arts institution.[26] He is a board member of World Business Chicago, and serves as co-chairman of its Technology Council.[27]In May 2008, Lefkofsky joined the committee to bring the 2016 Summer Olympics to Chicago, Chicago 2016.Teaching and writingSince his success at InnerWorkings, Lefkofsky began a teaching career at business schools in the Chicago area.

Early life and education[edit]
Lefkofsky grew up in Southfield, Michigan, the son of Bill, a structural engineer, and Sandy, a school teacher. He is Jewish. He has a brother, Steven, an attorney practicing in Michigan, and a sister, Jodi, also a former school teacher. After graduating from Southfield-Lathrup High School in 1987, Lefkofsky attended the University of Michigan and graduated with honors in 1991. He continued on at University of Michigan Law School to receive his Juris Doctor in 1993.[7]
Entrepreneurial ventures[edit]
Lefkofsky began his career selling carpet at the University of Michigan. After law school, in 1993, he and a college friend, Brad Keywell, borrowed money from relatives to buy an apparel company in Madison, Wisconsin named Brandon Apparel.
In 1999, Lefkofsky and Keywell created an early Internet company called Starbelly that specialized in promotional products. Starbelly experienced rapid "pre-bubble" Internet growth and was sold to Halo Industries in January 2000. Lefkofsky joined Halo to become chief operating officer. A little more than a year later, the company went bankrupt. Halo and Starbelly faced multiple lawsuits from shareholders, all of which were resolved by 2004.
After Starbelly, Lefkofsky, co-founded InnerWorkings in the fall of 2001. InnerWorkings provided print procurement services for mid-sized companies and achieved solid year-over-year growth. In August 2006, InnerWorkings had a successful initial public offering in the U.S. stock market (Nasdaq: INWK).[8] Lefkofsky was on the board of directors of InnerWorkings until October 2012.
In February 2005, Lefkofsky and Keywell created a freight logistics company called Echo Global Logistics. Echo attracted series D financing from New Enterprise Associates (NEA), one of the largest technology investors in the country, in June 2006. Echo Global Logistics went public on the NASDAQ under the symbol 'ECHO' and is now successfully being traded.[9]
In June 2006, Lefkofsky and Keywell founded MediaBank, a media-buying technology company. MediaBank provides advertising buyers with planning, buying, accounting and analysis software. In June 2007, MediaBank acquired Datatech,[10] one of the leading media planning and procurement platforms in the advertising industry. In July 2007, New Enterprise Associates invested in MediaBank.[11] In February 2012, the US Department of Justice approved a merger between MediaBank and Donovan Data Systems to create a single company, Mediaocean, in a deal estimated at $1.5 billion.[12]
In January 2007, Lefkofsky co-founded and provided $1,000,000 in funding for ThePoint.com, an online collective action website started by Andrew Mason. New Enterprise Associates led an early stage investment round in ThePoint.[13] In late 2008, The Point changed its name to Groupon.com. In October 2009, Groupon raised $30 million from Accel Partners and New Enterprise Associates.[14] In April 2010, Digital Sky Technology and Battery Ventures invested $135 million in Groupon at a valuation of $1.35 billion. In August 2010, Forbes reported that Groupon is the fastest growing company in history.[15]
In February 2010, Lefkokfsky and Keywell announced a new venture firm called Lightbank that plans to develop new companies in the Chicago area.[16]
In December 2010, Google offered a reported $6 billion for Groupon. The offer was turned down, possibly due to anti-trust and regulatory scrutiny the deal might face.[17]
In October 2011, Groupon [18] raised $950 million in private funding in January and then paid $810 million to employees and investors. Mr. Lefkofsky and family were paid $398 million of these funds.[19]
In November 2011, Groupon's IPO was the biggest by a US web company since Google, raising $700 million at $20 per share.[20]
In August 2013, Lefkofsky became CEO of Groupon.[21]
In July 2014, Lefkofsky co-founded Uptake, LLC, an analytics company.
In November 2015, Lefkofsky stepped down as CEO of Groupon, resuming his role as Chairman.
In 2016, Lefkofsky co-founded Tempus,[22] a technology company that enables physicians to deliver personalized cancer care, and serves as its CEO.
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2006, Eric Lefkofsky and his wife, Elizabeth, formed a charitable trust, the Lefkofsky Foundation, for the "purpose of supporting charitable, scientific, and educational organizations and causes around the world". The foundation has a focus on children. The foundation has helped fund more than 50 organizations to date.[23]

Early life and education[edit]
Lefkofsky grew up in Southfield, Michigan, the son of Bill, a structural engineer, and Sandy, a school teacher. He is Jewish. He has a brother, Steven, an attorney practicing in Michigan, and a sister, Jodi, also a former school teacher. After graduating from Southfield-Lathrup High School in 1987, Lefkofsky attended the University of Michigan and graduated with honors in 1991. He continued on at University of Michigan Law School to receive his Juris Doctor in 1993.[7]
Entrepreneurial ventures[edit]
Lefkofsky began his career selling carpet at the University of Michigan. After law school, in 1993, he and a college friend, Brad Keywell, borrowed money from relatives to buy an apparel company in Madison, Wisconsin named Brandon Apparel.
In 1999, Lefkofsky and Keywell created an early Internet company called Starbelly that specialized in promotional products. Starbelly experienced rapid "pre-bubble" Internet growth and was sold to Halo Industries in January 2000. Lefkofsky joined Halo to become chief operating officer. A little more than a year later, the company went bankrupt. Halo and Starbelly faced multiple lawsuits from shareholders, all of which were resolved by 2004.
After Starbelly, Lefkofsky, co-founded InnerWorkings in the fall of 2001. InnerWorkings provided print procurement services for mid-sized companies and achieved solid year-over-year growth. In August 2006, InnerWorkings had a successful initial public offering in the U.S. stock market (Nasdaq: INWK).[8] Lefkofsky was on the board of directors of InnerWorkings until October 2012.
In February 2005, Lefkofsky and Keywell created a freight logistics company called Echo Global Logistics. Echo attracted series D financing from New Enterprise Associates (NEA), one of the largest technology investors in the country, in June 2006. Echo Global Logistics went public on the NASDAQ under the symbol 'ECHO' and is now successfully being traded.[9]
In June 2006, Lefkofsky and Keywell founded MediaBank, a media-buying technology company. MediaBank provides advertising buyers with planning, buying, accounting and analysis software. In June 2007, MediaBank acquired Datatech,[10] one of the leading media planning and procurement platforms in the advertising industry. In July 2007, New Enterprise Associates invested in MediaBank.[11] In February 2012, the US Department of Justice approved a merger between MediaBank and Donovan Data Systems to create a single company, Mediaocean, in a deal estimated at $1.5 billion.[12]
In January 2007, Lefkofsky co-founded and provided $1,000,000 in funding for ThePoint.com, an online collective action website started by Andrew Mason. New Enterprise Associates led an early stage investment round in ThePoint.[13] In late 2008, The Point changed its name to Groupon.com. In October 2009, Groupon raised $30 million from Accel Partners and New Enterprise Associates.[14] In April 2010, Digital Sky Technology and Battery Ventures invested $135 million in Groupon at a valuation of $1.35 billion. In August 2010, Forbes reported that Groupon is the fastest growing company in history.[15]
In February 2010, Lefkokfsky and Keywell announced a new venture firm called Lightbank that plans to develop new companies in the Chicago area.[16]
In December 2010, Google offered a reported $6 billion for Groupon. The offer was turned down, possibly due to anti-trust and regulatory scrutiny the deal might face.[17]
In October 2011, Groupon [18] raised $950 million in private funding in January and then paid $810 million to employees and investors. Mr. Lefkofsky and family were paid $398 million of these funds.[19]
In November 2011, Groupon's IPO was the biggest by a US web company since Google, raising $700 million at $20 per share.[20]
In August 2013, Lefkofsky became CEO of Groupon.[21]
In July 2014, Lefkofsky co-founded Uptake, LLC, an analytics company.
In November 2015, Lefkofsky stepped down as CEO of Groupon, resuming his role as Chairman.
In 2016, Lefkofsky co-founded Tempus,[22] a technology company that enables physicians to deliver personalized cancer care, and serves as its CEO.
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2006, Eric Lefkofsky and his wife, Elizabeth, formed a charitable trust, the Lefkofsky Foundation, for the "purpose of supporting charitable, scientific, and educational organizations and causes around the world". The foundation has a focus on children. The foundation has helped fund more than 50 organizations to date.[23]
In 2013, Lefkofsky and his wife joined The Giving Pledge.[24][25]
Community interests[edit]
Lefkofsky is on the board of directors at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, the board of directors of The Art Institute of Chicago, the board of directors of The Museum of Science and Industry, and a Trustee of Steppenwolf Theatre Company, a Chicago-based performing arts institution.[26] He is a board member of World Business Chicago, and serves as co-chairman of its Technology Council.[27]
In May 2008, Lefkofsky joined the committee to bring the 2016 Summer Olympics to Chicago, Chicago 2016.
Teaching and writing[edit]
Since his success at InnerWorkings, Lefkofsky began a teaching career at business schools in the Chicago area. He previously taught Applied Technology at DePaul University's Kellstadt Graduate School of Business and at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University where he taught a course in disruptive business models. Lefkofsky is currently[when?] an Adjunct Professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, teaching a course on entrepreneurship and building technology-based businesses.[28]

In August 2006, InnerWorkings had a successful initial public offering in the U.S. stock market (Nasdaq: INWK).[8] Lefkofsky was on the board of directors of InnerWorkings until October 2012.
In February 2005, Lefkofsky and Keywell created a freight logistics company called Echo Global Logistics.

Echo Global Logistics went public on the NASDAQ under the symbol 'ECHO' and is now successfully being traded.[9]
In June 2006, Lefkofsky and Keywell founded MediaBank, a media-buying technology company. MediaBank provides advertising buyers with planning, buying, accounting and analysis software. In June 2007, MediaBank acquired Datatech,[10] one of the leading media planning and procurement platforms in the advertising industry. In July 2007, New Enterprise Associates invested in MediaBank.[11] In February 2012, the US Department of Justice approved a merger between MediaBank and Donovan Data Systems to create a single company, Mediaocean, in a deal estimated at $1.5 billion.[12]
In January 2007, Lefkofsky co-founded and provided $1,000,000 in funding for ThePoint.com, an online collective action website started by Andrew Mason. New Enterprise Associates led an early stage investment round in ThePoint.[13] In late 2008, The Point changed its name to Groupon.com. In October 2009, Groupon raised $30 million from Accel Partners and New Enterprise Associates.[14] In April 2010, Digital Sky Technology and Battery Ventures invested $135 million in Groupon at a valuation of $1.35 billion. In August 2010, Forbes reported that Groupon is the fastest growing company in history.[15]
In February 2010, Lefkokfsky and Keywell announced a new venture firm called Lightbank that plans to develop new companies in the Chicago area.[16]
In December 2010, Google offered a reported $6 billion for Groupon. The offer was turned down, possibly due to anti-trust and regulatory scrutiny the deal might face.[17]
In October 2011, Groupon [18] raised $950 million in private funding in January and then paid $810 million to employees and investors. Mr. Lefkofsky and family were paid $398 million of these funds.[19]
In November 2011, Groupon's IPO was the biggest by a US web company since Google, raising $700 million at $20 per share.[20]

Early life and education[edit]
Lefkofsky grew up in Southfield, Michigan, the son of Bill, a structural engineer, and Sandy, a school teacher. He is Jewish.

He continued on at University of Michigan Law School to receive his Juris Doctor in 1993.[7]
Entrepreneurial ventures[edit]
Lefkofsky began his career selling carpet at the University of Michigan. After law school, in 1993, he and a college friend, Brad Keywell, borrowed money from relatives to buy an apparel company in Madison, Wisconsin named Brandon Apparel.
In 1999, Lefkofsky and Keywell created an early Internet company called Starbelly that specialized in promotional products.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
