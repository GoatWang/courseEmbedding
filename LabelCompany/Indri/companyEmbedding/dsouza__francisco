This interview with 
Francisco D’Souza, chief executive of the information technology company Cognizant, was conducted and condensed by 
Adam Bryant. Q. What were some early lessons for you?A. I was very fortunate in my upbringing. My father was a diplomat, and so, until I was 18, we traveled to a new country every three years. After finishing high school in the Caribbean, I wound up in Hong Kong when I was 18. We realized that there were few universities that taught in English, and so I went to one in Macau that focused on working professionals. I went to school at night and on weekends.My days were free, and I got a job as a bank teller. It was a small bank, and they still used a punch-card system. I had taught myself as a teenager how to program. I went to the branch manager and told him he ought to consider new technology. He said: “Fine. Help me figure it out.” We bought a computer. We wrote the software, and I wound up supervising a couple of people when I was 19.Q. I can imagine that some kids would resent moving to a new country every three years.A. I was somewhat indifferent to it because I expected it, and I knew nothing else. In hindsight, I wouldn’t do it any other way. It really did shape who I am today.

Q. In what sense?A. We learned how to love the world. There’s this great richness of diversity, yet people are far more similar than they are different. You’re not as likely to learn that when you grow up in one town, in one environment, in one culture or in one country. Continue reading the main story

The second thing is that it was an environment of scarcity in many ways, because my parents weren’t particularly affluent. You learn how to find opportunities where they don’t exist and capitalize on them. You have to find ways to make the most of everything, from the littlest things to the biggest.Q. What are some leadership lessons you’ve learned during your career?A. We started Cognizant in 1994, and there was a period early on when I personally knew everyone in the company. Now we have 160,000 employees, and there were several personal and rapid transitions over that time.The lesson I learned is that when you have to evolve that quickly as a person, you need to be aware of two things. One is personal blind spots and the other is personal comfort zones. Those two things can be real gotchas.

Francisco D’Souza, C.E.O. of the information technology company Cognizant, says an organization’s culture is passed along via its rituals, legends and heroes. That’s why it has corporate celebrations with entertainment and awards.

It’s very hard to see your blind spots, by definition, and it’s very easy to fall into comfort zones, because people like patterns and a sense of familiarity. I’ve tried consciously to say, “What are the tools I can use to identify these blind spots and push through comfort zones?” And I always tell myself that if I wake up in the morning and feel comfortable, I’m probably not pushing myself hard enough.Q. And what are the tools to help you see your blind spots?A. One is just talking to other leaders. The conversations with them help me because they are, in a sense, a mirror — I can assess what I think they’re doing well, and where I think their blind spots are. It’s easier to see someone else’s blind spots than it is to see your own, of course, and you can use that to reflect on what your own blind spots are.

I also learned a lot from the people who work for me. Before I took over as C.E.O. in 2007, the board gave me the benefit of some time. I worked with a coach for a while, and he talked to about 20 people who worked for me, above me and around me, and to my board. It was difficult feedback, but very enlightening. That helped me identify a couple of my blind spots.Q. Can you share one?A. There was a lot of feedback from my team that people had confidence in my ability, but they also said that when I criticize something they’ve done, the weight of that is very pronounced and significant. It made me understand that the weight of my words was a lot heavier than I gave myself credit for, and it led me to be much more thoughtful and measured in how I give feedback.Q. What’s unusual about your culture?A. We’ve organized the company in a way to make sure that we continuously delegate and empower people on the front lines. As we got bigger, we would take larger units and break them down into smaller units and give individuals a sense of ownership, creating very clear success metrics around those individuals.

But when you decentralize and empower, you have to make sure you don’t wind up with lots of microcultures, because every leader, every manager, puts his or her stamp on the culture. Culture gets passed along not by writing it down, but through the rituals you have in the organization, the legends you refer to, and the heroes of the organization. So we institutionalized a set of things to create rituals, heroes and legends.For example, we have a tradition of naming the associate of the year — we use a process in each region to find the single associate who contributed well above and beyond and, through his or her actions, exhibited the traits of the culture that we thought were important. We similarly institutionalized a ritual that we called the project of the year. And we rent stadiums around the world and bring all the employees and their families for a celebration, with entertainment and awards.Q. How do you hire? A. I’m looking for passion. The person I’m hiring needs to have passion for what they’re doing, and they need to understand where that passion comes from. They need to be in touch with that. You need to know what drives you.And you need somebody who’s got just raw smarts and talent and an innate ability to learn. Because the thing about functional expertise is that unless you’re in some very specific area, almost everything that we need to do our job becomes obsolete quickly, and the half-life of knowledge is becoming shorter and shorter. So do you have the personal agility to continuously renew those skills, to reinvent yourself?

Young gun: D’Souza sold his first piece of software 25 years ago. Jayachandran / Mint

Updated: Fri, May 15 2009. 09 14 PM IST

Just a few minutes on the open rooftop at Taj Connemara’s popular Raintree restaurant, and I hasten back inside. Even the azure waters of the pool facing the restaurant cannot mitigate Chennai’s evening heat. I retreat into the comfort of the enclosed, air-conditioned portion of the restaurant, order a watermelon juice, and wait for my guest. Francisco D’Souza is the CEO of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTS), the fourth largest Indian information technology (IT) company, with revenues of $2.86 billion (around Rs14,000 crore) last year, and around 70% of its 62,000 employees based in India. Two years ago, when 38-year-old D’Souza took over as CEO, he became one of the youngest heads of a major technology company in the world.
D’Souza walks in exactly on time and orders a pineapple juice while a colleague of his, who has joined us, gets a beer for himself. Clean-shaven, almost baby-faced, D’Souza has an easy smile. He drapes his jacket over the back of his chair and sits down, looking informal in a formal shirt open at the neck. 

Young gun: D’Souza sold his first piece of software 25 years ago. Jayachandran / MintThese are not exactly easy times for chief executives of IT companies—technology spending, especially in the key US and Europe markets, has seen a slump. But D’Souza seems unfazed. Sipping on his juice, he posits the view that Cognizant is better placed than most players “because of our strengths. In fact, the current slowdown will help us pull further away from competition”. 
The confidence comes from having survived and thrived in various environments while growing up. The biggest influence was his father, an Indian Foreign Service officer. “Every three years, he would get transferred and we would be uprooted and thrown into a new milieu,” he says. Born in Kenya, D’Souza has lived in 11 countries and has studied in places such as erstwhile Zaire (now Congo), Panama, Hong Kong and New York. 
And unlike several expatriates, D’Souza says, his parents did not want to leave their children in boarding schools in India or put them in “international ones”. Instead, they enrolled their children in local schools wherever they were posted. That cross-cultural adaptability, he says, became a key strength. 
A precocious child, he says his fascination with technology started at 13, when a friend of his father’s got a computer. He learnt programming on his own and, at age 16, sold his first piece of programming—an inventory management system for the Trinidadian army: “Though don’t remember how much I got paid, I still have a letter of appreciation on their letterhead.” When he was 18, D’Souza’s father was posted to Hong Kong. Those days, most day colleges there taught only in Cantonese so the young D’Souza joined an evening college and spent the mornings working as a teller at a branch of the Indian Overseas Bank. 
He noted that the bank was using an antiquated punch-card system to store data and volunteered to write a software program for the bank’s Olivetti computer—he did it successfully. “I have always loved technology and deploying it to enhance efficiency and deliver cost savings,” explains D’Souza. 
A year later, he teamed up with a friend to build a mass fax machine: “My friend built the hardware and I did the software part wherein the machine would do what is today’s equivalent of email spamming— sending out several hundred faxes advertising our products,” grins D’Souza. He adds that he learnt a lot about entrepreneurship from Hong Kong’s gritty trading houses.
After five years in Hong Kong, he moved to the US to pursue a master’s degree in business administration at the Carnegie Mellon University, a mecca of computer science. After the programme, he was recruited on campus by conglomerate Dun and Bradstreet (D&B), a credit information services provider. 
In 1994, when D&B was looking at entering the Indian market, D’Souza jumped at the opportunity to return. As a part of regulatory approvals, D&B had to agree to export software services. Thus, he became a part of the founding team of D&B’s India outsourcing arm, which eventually morphed into CTS. 
D’Souza’s reminisces on the origins of the present-day IT behemoth between nibbles of cottage cheese dipped in basil sauce. Few thought CTS’ model of providing MNC-quality services at Indian prices—so unlike the models followed by domestic heavyweights such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Technologies Ltd and Wipro Technologies—would work. The company, however, has proved many critics wrong. Over the last four-five years in particular, it has clearly shown that its model is working. D’Souza explains: “Look at the growth we have had since, say, 2003 onwards. The results you see today are a vindication of the strategy we have followed.”
I am meeting D’Souza a few days before the announcement of the company’s annual financial results and I ask him about revenue guidances from CTS that many analysts deemed too aggressive. “We have taken all factors into consideration before guiding the market and I am confident that we will meet it,” says D’Souza, dismissing analyst concerns (when first quarter results were announced on 5 May, CTS’ revenues had jumped by 16%, vindicating a guidance of 10% growth for the full year).
But what makes this model unique? What sets the company apart from traditional Indian IT services vendors? CTS gets about 75% of its revenues from just three verticals: healthcare, life science and financial services. Twenty-seven of the top 30 life sciences companies in the world and at least six of the top 10 global healthcare companies do business with D’Souza’s company. “In these segments, our competition is from the likes of Perot and Accenture rather than Indian IT companies,” says D’Souza. 
And conveniently for CTS, many of these focus areas, such as healthcare and public sector companies, have weathered the downturn, helping to prop up its business as the competition struggles.
Large Indian IT companies may be growing at a slower rate for the first time, but D’Souza is confident Cognizant will do well. “Yes, we will be affected by the external environment to some extent. But we believe that we have the skills and offer enough value for our customers to continue growing. Our adaptability to changing market conditions is one of our biggest strengths.”
D’Souza learnt adaptability as a child—and that is what he is now teaching his two children. “We learnt to survive and thrive in a flat world even before the term was in vogue,” he says. His Brazilian wife of Portuguese extraction speaks to their children only in Portuguese and he talks to them in English. “It’s not just language skills, but the ability to work with and across cultures which is key.” 
Even as he grapples with the business challenges of increasing CTS’ growth from close to $3 billion in revenue, D’Souza talks about a domestic challenge—battling his son on a Nintendo Wii. As we tuck into the main course, he explains: “Playing with my children or reading up a legal thriller on the inevitable long flights is the way I relax.” 
And no, the downturn isn’t getting in the way of his relaxation: “It is both exciting and challenging times for both the company and the industry. I like nothing better than tackling challenges.”

No other company has appeared more times on Fortune’s list of Fastest-Growing Companies than Cognizant. Revenue exploded by a factor of 20 and profits by a factor of 15 over the past decade at this infotech outsourcer and consultancy. D’Souza is the company’s youthful (47) and dynamic chief. The son of an Indian diplomat, he taught himself programming in high school, joined Cognizant in 1994, and has been CEO since 2007. Financial services is the company’s stalwart sector, but D’Souza has kept Cognizant on the cutting edge not only with digital services, analytics, and cloud services but also by expanding its health care segment with organic revenue growth (16% last year) and its biggest acquisition to date (a health care IT-services provider called TriZetto). The ascent isn’t over either: The company says it’s on track for sales growth of 20.1% in 2015.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
