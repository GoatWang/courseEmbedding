					Full Description



Abtech Holdings, Inc., incorporated on February 13, 2007, through its subsidiary, AbTech Industries, Inc. (AbTech Industries), provides solutions to water contamination issues that are caused by stormwater runoff, industrial processes, water produced in the extractive industries, such as oil and gas drilling, and spills of oil-based fluids in marine environments. The Company operates through the filtration and treatment of polluted water segment. It provides services for the design and selection of water treatment systems, products sales of filtration and treatment systems, installation of the treatment technologies and maintenance of the installed systems. Some of these activities are provided through subcontractors and on some projects the Company may act as a subcontractor to other entities. AbTech Industries manufactures its products and markets them into a range of markets resulting in over 20,000 products installed in approximately 50 states and over 10 countries.Smart SpongeAbTech Industries has developed products that leverage its cornerstone filtration media technology called Smart Sponge. It has developed and patented its Smart Sponge technologies based on a blend of synthetic polymers focused at the removal of hydrocarbons and oil derivatives from surface water. Smart Sponge products remove pollutants from water and encapsulate them so that they cannot be released back into the water, even under high pressure. AbTech Industries' polymers consist of amorphous products that are able to absorb hydrocarbons (contaminants) present in water, then stabilize and retain them in a gelified structure. Its polymers, in order to remove oil derivatives from water, are oleophilic (strong affinity for oils) and hydrophobic (repel water).Smart Sponge PlusThe Company offers Smart Sponge technology with an antimicrobial agent in reducing coliform bacteria found in storm water, industrial wastewater and municipal wastewater while maintaining its oil-absorbing capability. This technology, known as Smart Sponge Plus, provides a solution to municipalities and other entities faced with beach closures and other hazards of bacteria-laden storm water. The anti-microbial agent used for this technology is an organosilane derivative that is used in the fields, including medical, consumables, pool equipment and consumer goods. The anti-microbial mechanism of Smart Sponge Plus is based on the agent's electromagnetic interaction with the microorganism cell membrane, causing the disruption of the cell wall of the microorganism, but no chemical or physical change in the agent.Smart Sponge HMThe Company has exclusively licensed a heavy metals removal technology from Synanomet, LLC (Synanomet). The technology is a carbon-based renewable material with attached nanostructures that removes phosphates, as well as heavy metals, including selenium, chromium, copper, iron, lead and zinc. AbTech is targeting both point and non-point source applications of the technology. The technology is protected by over 10 issued patents. AbTech Industries has also combined the media with Smart Sponge, which is referred to as SmartSponge HM, in order to achieve hydraulic conductivity over the wood-based media alone. AbTech deploys the media both in its virgin form and as Smart Sponge HM.Smart Sponge PopcornThe Smart Sponge material can be formed into a range of physical shapes to optimize its performance in filtration applications. When produced in its popcorn form (clumps of polymer similar in shape to popcorn), Smart Sponge is a filtration media due to its high porosity and favorable hydraulic characteristics. AbTech Industries is pursuing the use of Smart Sponge popcorn in end-of-pipe applications, such as vaults and other configurations. The Smart Sponge material can also be sold to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and other users to be integrated into different filtration pressure vessels or gravity flow structures.Ultra-Urban FilterThe Ultra-Urban Filter (UUF) is a modular filtration unit (Catch Basin Insert) designed in different shapes and sizes for use in curb opening and top down storm drains and is used to treat storm water runoff for new or retrofitted sites by absorbing oil and grease and capturing trash and sediment. The UUF is ideal for municipal, industrial and construction applications ensuring compliance with storm water regulations. The filter comes in approximately three designs the Curb Opening, Drain Insert and Customized Drain Insert.Water Treatment Vaults (using advanced filtration media like Smart Sponge)AbTech Industries' water treatment vaults with advanced filtration media, such as Smart Paks are an alternative to treating individual catch basins. These pre-cast vaults are retrofitted into existing storm water systems and are ideal for storm water treatment at or near the end of pipe. AbTech Industries can engineer its water treatment vaults for large projects either as standalone applications or as part of a treatment train to polish water working with retention ponds or hydrodynamic separators.SMART PAKAbTech Industries' Smart Pak is designed for use in new or existing vaults that experience oil and grease pollution accompanied by sediment, trash and debris, hydrocarbons and coliform bacteria (when specified with Smart Sponge Plus). Smart Paks help users meet and exceed storm water the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit requirements with filtration, absorption, life expectancy and maintenance costs. Smart Pak products are constructed out of AbTech Industries' patented Smart Sponge media, which is a nonhazardous material and can be specified for a range of applications. AbTech Industries' Smart Pak allows Smart Sponge technology to be scaled to virtually any size required in an easy-to-maintain form.Absorbent Boom and Line SkimmerAbTech Industries' Tubular Absorbent Booms and Line Skimmers employ the Smart Sponge absorptive technology, which rejects water while absorbing even sheen levels of hydrocarbons in low energy flow environments. Tubular Absorbent Booms and Line Skimmers are designed to absorb and permanently encapsulate hydrocarbons resulting in no dewatering of oily water during removal. These products remain completely buoyant, even after being saturated allowing long-term deployment and conveniently scheduled removal.Passive SkimmerThe Passive Skimmer is designed to absorb and encapsulate hydrocarbons by floating directly on the water in catch basins, sumps, oil and water separators and marine fueling stations. Passive Skimmers are made with Smart Sponge, are packaged in mesh containers and are available in various sizes.Bilge SkimmerThe Smart Sponge Non-Leaching Bilge Skimmer is engineered and designed for permanently encapsulating the petroleum hydrocarbons that appear as oily sheen in the engine compartment during normal boat operation. The Bilge Skimmer will absorb the contaminant and allow the boater to discharge clean water from the bilge pump.Industrial Process Water SystemsAbTech Industries offers process water systems space. These systems utilize a combination of components, including pretreatment, membranes and ion exchange to purify makeup water (well or surface) streams for various different plant requirements. Some systems may utilize AbTech's core Smart Sponge technology in the pretreatment, depending upon the contaminants in the source water. The Company has collaborative relationships with engineering contractors and third party manufacturers to provide systems for its customers.Produced Water ProductsAbTech Industries has developed de-oiling solutions for the produced water market. These solutions generally are combined with other treatment systems to address the problematic contaminants present at a given site. AbTech Industries de-oiling solutions are designed to remove hydrocarbons as both a pre-filter to protect the other treatment systems in the treatment train or as polishing agent at the end of the treatment process.The Company competes with CDS Technologies, Stormceptor, Baysaver Technologies, United Storm Water, Inc., Fabco Industries, Kristar, Suntree Technologies, AquaShield, Stormdrain Solutions, Advanced Aquatic Products and Ultra Tech International.

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., May 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Abtech Holdings, Inc. (OTC QB: ABHD) ("AbTech" or the "Company"), an environmental technologies firm dedicated to providing innovative solutions to communities, industry and governments addressing issues of water pollution and contamination, today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2017.    








Key First Quarter 2017 Financial Results Summary

Revenues for the first quarter of 2017 were approximately $107,000 (including $42,000 for the Company's first sale of filters containing its new heavy metals filtration media, Smart Sponge HM) compared to revenues of $43,000 for the same period of the previous year and $150,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Although revenue during the first quarter of 2017 is predominantly attributed to stormwater product applications, AbTech's commercial and industrial opportunity pipeline and planned pilot projects have been active during the first quarter of 2017; 
The monthly cash burn for the first quarter 2017 averaged approximately $296,000, a decrease from the average monthly cash burn during the first quarter of 2016 of $322,000; 
Operating expenses totaled $1.6 million in first quarter of 2017, an increase of $144,000 over first quarter of 2016 and an increase of $979,000 over fourth quarter 2016, due predominately to an increase in legal fees in the first quarter of 2017; 
Operating loss for the first quarter of 2017 totaled $(1.6) million, compared to an operating loss of $(1.5) million for the same period of the prior year and an operating loss of $(605,000) in the fourth quarter of 2016; 
In 2017, AbTech has continued its activity with several water treatment field trials, of note: 

Prepared for 2nd field test of evaporative technology for produced and frac flowback water with focus on emissions. 
Successfully completed a Smart Sponge® hydrocarbon removal and recycling of spent media demonstration in a produced water application for our Colombian distributor, advancing discussions to economics and design issues. 
Achieved low phosphorus results on a sanitary wastewater application in China with a larger pilot scale demonstration scheduled for June 2017; and,

During the first quarter, the Company received cash advances totaling $932,000 from a related party investor. Subsequent to quarter-end, the Company received an additional $464,000 in short-term funding from this investor. 

"2015 marked a year of corporate restructuring, with a clean-up of our balance sheet, a broadening of our treatment capabilities to include heavy metals development, and an expansion of the focus of our business to include industrial and commercial market segments.  During 2016, we focused on educating our target markets and customers about our capabilities to help them meet new regulatory requirements, reestablished our presence at the most notable and heavily trafficked trade shows, reengaged in active marketing and social media presence, and dynamically sought opportunities for testing and pilot projects. Today, with strong data and proven results from pilots and test projects addressing water contamination issues within several industries globally under varied conditions, we are now attempting to convert these past efforts into positive revenue results," commented Jeff Gutierrez, AbTech's Vice President of Sales.  
An important potential early industrial revenue contributor exists through AbTech's distributor in Colombia, South America, KLIMA Projects, S.A.S. ("KLIMA").  After working together for over a year and applying Smart Sponge media to remove hydrocarbons in produced water, KLIMA is advancing it sales effort with two large energy companies.  KLIMA has made tremendous progress educating the oil and gas industry on uses of Smart Sponge media to reduce operating costs and meet new discharge regulations that came into effect during 2016.
A second potential early contributor to commercial/industrial revenues is the low cost onsite vaporization technology designed to treat produced water, including frac flowback water, reducing the volume by greater than 80% and returning the water back to the environment in the form of water vapor.  Over the past 18 months, AbTech has made numerous modifications to its prototype unit, which uses thin film direct convection in a closed reaction chamber.  This thermal process can use, as its energy source, the flare gas or well-head gas available at the oil and gas production site.  The technology is designed to be straightforward and robust in order to be reliable under very difficult operating conditions.  The initial field trial was concluded in mid-December 2016, during which several improvements were identified to enhance the customer experience, improve operation, and meet anticipated regulatory Clean Air Act emissions requirements.  All modifications are being incorporated into an upgraded prototype unit, which is planned to be redeployed for a second pilot field trial in the second and third quarter 2017.
Within the stormwater business segment, AbTech is seeing an up-swing in interest for design build projects.  While the Company has several larger project opportunities for vault systems addressing industrial customers' needs, the more immediate sales continue to be smaller in nature.   An important and growing opportunity for AbTech is in deploying its new heavy metals media for heavy metal and ortho-phosphate removal in stormwater.  This technology could be particularly relevant in areas with intense regulatory oversight and pressure to reduce sediment and nutrients flowing into key water bodies, such as reducing phosphorous in lakes in California.  AbTech recognized its first stormwater sale which integrated Smart Sponge HM within its Ultra Urban® filters product line during first quarter 2017.  
A focus for AbTech over the past year has been in cultivating opportunities that address industrial process water.  Projects focused on oil discharge and removal within the shipping industry, as well as selenium removal from process water in the beverage industry, have some of the greatest nearer term opportunity for the Company during 2017.  
AbTech reported net revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 of approximately $107,000 compared to $43,000 for the same period of the previous year and $150,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016.  All revenues recognized in the first quarter of 2017 were related to stormwater product applications.  Revenues have not yet benefited from the redirected sales effort toward commercial and industrial applications.  
AbTech incurred a loss from operations of $(1.6) million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 versus a loss from operations of $(1.5) million in the same period of the prior year and a loss from operations of $(605,000) in the fourth quarter 2016. The Company reported a net loss of $(1.7) million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This compares to the previous year's first quarter net loss of $(1.5) million and $(712,000) for the fourth quarter of 2016.  The net loss per share and net loss attributable to controlling interest per share for these periods is less than one cent. 
AbTech reported a negative gross profit in the first quarter of 2017 of approximately $(2,700) compared to a negative gross profit of approximately $(35,000) during the first quarter of 2016 and gross profit of approximately $43,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016.  The negative gross margin in the first quarter of 2017 and 2016 was caused by the cost of excess manufacturing capacity. The Company operated at approximately 1% of production capacity in the first quarter of both 2017 and 2016.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 totaled $1.4 million, an increase of approximately $282,000 (26%) over the prior year first quarter due primarily to legal fees of approximately $694,000  associated with the Company's responses to subpoenas received by the Company and some of its officers and directors in 2015 and 2016 from the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and an investigation by the New York Joint Commission on Public Ethics ("JCOPE").  This compares to $209,000 of similar legal fees incurred in the first quarter of 2016.  Excluding these unusual legal expenses, other SG&A expenses decreased by approximately $203,000 in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in prior year, due largely to reduced payroll costs, travel expenses, board compensation and consulting fees in 2017.  
Research and development ("R&D") expenses decreased by approximately $138,000 (41%) to approximately $200,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period of the prior year and a decrease of approximately $29,000 (13%) over the fourth quarter of 2016. The lower R&D expenses in 2017 were primarily attributable to a reduction in payroll costs as well as lower costs associated with work conducted to develop and test the Company's evaporation technology intended for use in the treatment of produced water at oil and gas drilling sites.  Costs for the evaporator technology are expected to increase significantly in the second quarter of 2017 as the Company continues its development efforts and modification of a prototype unit.
Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 totaled approximately $129,000, compared to $25,000 in the same period of 2016 and approximately $107,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016.  The first quarter 2017 increase in interest expense was due to increased outstanding loans from investors, including an increase of $932,000 during the first quarter of 2017, accruing interest at a rate of 10% per annum.
At March 31, 2017, the Company reported cash and cash equivalents of approximately $95,000, accounts receivable of $62,000 and inventory of $356,000.  The monthly cash burn from operations for the first three months of 2017 averaged approximately $296,000, a reduction of $26,000 from the prior year first quarter.  At March 31, 2017, AbTech's long term debt totaled approximately $70,000.  The Company's short term debt, including accrued interest, totaled approximately $6.2 million, an increase of approximately $1,026,000 from the year-end 2016 balance due primarily to the receipt of several cash advances made by a related party investor to fund first quarter working capital.  Subsequent to March 31, 2017, this related party investor advanced the Company an additional $464,000, bringing the total due to investors for these cash advances to approximately $5,127,000.  
On March 31, 2017, AbTech had approximately 501.7 million shares of common stock outstanding, consistent with year-end 2016. The Company's fully diluted share count decreased by approximately 2.6 million shares during first quarter 2017, as compared to year end 2016, to approximately 524.6 million shares (inclusive of all options, warrants and convertible debt), largely due to expiration of approximately 1.6 million warrants and 100,000 options.  In addition, the repayment of approximately $27,000 of convertible debt in the first quarter of 2017 resulted in a reduction of approximately 857,000 of shares reserved for conversion of such notes.  
Future Investor Conference Calls and Earnings Releases:  The Company has determined to temporarily suspend issuing future earning press releases and holding quarterly investor conference calls but will continue to provide its quarterly and annual financial results through its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms 10-Q and 10-K.  The Company will continue to file material announcements on Form 8-K, as required, and intends to resume earnings press releases and/or investor conference calls when merited by its business activity.
