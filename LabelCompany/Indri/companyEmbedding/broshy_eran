Linden Capital Partners Adds Operating Partner to Team


March 13, 2013
By Angela Sormani






Linden Capital Partners has added Eran Broshy as an operating partner. Broshy joins Linden from Providence Equity Partners and will work closely with Linden’s team focusing on investments in the provider, payer, and pharmaceutical services spaces.
PRESS RELEASE
Linden Capital Partners, a Chicago-based private equity firm focused exclusively on healthcare, announced today the addition of Eran Broshy as an Operating Partner. Mr. Broshy joins Linden from Providence Equity Partners and will work closely with Linden’s team focusing on investments in the provider, payer, and pharmaceutical services spaces.
Mr. Broshy has over 29 years of management experience within the healthcare industry. Most recently he has been a Senior Advisor of Providence Equity Partners where he supported the firm’s healthcare information investment efforts. Previously, Mr. Broshy served for over a decade as chief executive officer and chairman of inVentiv Health (Nasdaq: VTIV). Mr. Broshy took the company public in the fall of 1999, and under his leadership transformed the company into the leading provider of commercialization and complementary services to the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, growing revenues from $215 million in 2002 to $1.1 billion in 2008. Mr. Broshy stepped down as CEO in 2008, and as chairman oversaw the company being taken private in 2010.
Prior to joining inVentiv, Mr. Broshy served as a partner at The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) where he was responsible for the firm’s healthcare practice across the Americas. During his fourteen-year tenure at BCG, Mr. Broshy consulted widely with senior executives from a number of the major global pharmaceutical manufacturers, managed care organizations, and academic medical centers, and led a broad range of strategic, organizational and operational initiatives. Mr. Broshy has also served as president and chief executive officer of Coelacanth Corporation, a privately-held biotechnology company. 





Mr. Broshy serves on the board of directors of Magellan Health Services (Nasdaq: MGLN), and previously has served on the boards of a number of healthcare companies including inVentiv, Coelacanth, ikaSystems, Virtual Radiologic, HeartFlow, and Neurogen. He is also on the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s NY Executive Board, the MIT Visiting Committee for the Social Sciences and the MIT Science Dean’s Advisory Council. Mr. Broshy is a graduate of Harvard University (MBA), Stanford University (MSc), and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (BSc).
“The broad changes underway across healthcare present myriad opportunities for investment in middle market healthcare services companies, and for creating value through the strategic guidance and capital that Linden provides” said Mr. Broshy. “I was attracted to Linden’s exclusive healthcare focus, its successful track record of identifying attractive subsectors and platforms, and its operating partner model of integrating and leveraging executives across the portfolio at each juncture of the investment cycle from sourcing and diligence to governance throughout the ownership period.”
“Linden is thrilled to add Eran to our team of operating executives and continue to expand the resources and support for our portfolio companies,” said Tony Davis, a Managing Partner at Linden. “Eran’s mix of strategic and operating talent, depth of experience across a variety of healthcare services sectors, and insights from his numerous board roles make him a valuable resource for our investment team and our portfolio companies.”
