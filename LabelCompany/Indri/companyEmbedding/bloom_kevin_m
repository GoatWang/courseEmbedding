Practice Areas

Sometimes litigation does not end at the trial level. When an appeal is pursued, the firm’s Appellate practice group is ready to step in with its extensive experience.
The firm’s Appellate practice group is chaired by Adam S. Chotiner.

Collaborative Law (Family Law)
Jeffrey P. Wasserman has now expanded his practice to offer Collaborative Law as the alternative process in helping clients resolve their differences with their spouse. He has been properly trained and certified as a Collaborative Lawyer. Continuing with his education and training in Collaborative Law helps him provide the best service possible for you in this process.
Jeff has come to recognize the benefits and need for resolving divorces through a process that keeps the parties from entering the unknown realm of the courthouse. The Collaborative Practice of Divorce Law assists people to find creative solutions without litigation. It helps the parties to achieve a fair outcome with the least amount of emotional and financial cost.
The process does not permit litigation in the Courts. Instead, it brings people together in a way that they are part of a process of resolving the issues of divorcing parties. Issues such as developing a Parenting Plan and other issues relating to the children of a couple who are going to divorce are much better resolved between the parents than by giving the final decision to a total stranger, who happens to wear a robe and goes by the salutation of “Your Honor.”
Collaborative law permits the parties to resolve all issues relating to support (spousal and child) and dividing assets and liabilities just like having them resolved by a Judge. In this process, you are in charge of your own destiny and you move at the pace set by both parties in coming to a resolution. Instead of a Judge and unfamiliar Rules setting the pace and process, you will have the benefit of legal and mental health professionals and experts to guide you through to the end in a non-litigious setting.
Please contact Jeff for more information on Collaborative Law if you are interested in this process for resolving the issues of your divorce.

Real Estate Litigation
Senior named shareholder Andrew B. Blasi oversees the Firm’s real estate litigation practice group, which includes shareholder Andrew M. Dector and senior attorneys Robin I. Frank and Brian Becher.
This practice group is focused on the litigation of all types of litigation based upon real property and real estate deals gone bad. The group devotes a large part of their practice to representing and assisting buyers in pre-construction real property contracts seeking to revoke or rescind the sales contract, to recover deposits paid by the buyers to sellers/developers and to recover any other damages the buyers have incurred where builders or developers have failed to comply with the requirements of the law, most notably the Federal Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act and the Florida Condominium Act. With an overabundance of condos and houses on the market and values plummeting, the group continues to represent and assist buyers in demanding and getting refunds of their deposits along with damages against developers who have failed to conduct their business in a legally appropriate or required manner.

                            05-19-2017                        







                                        Excellent customer service - gorgeous flowers.   I ordered from out of state, flowers to be sent to my mother (the night before Mother's Day.)   The flowers were delivered fresh and the owner sent me via text, a picture of them.  They were beautiful and she was so nice.  I will definitely use Elegant Designs In Bloom in the future and highly recommend them!

                                        It was a great experience. They called to make a suggestion for improvement that they didn't charge me for, and the actual boquete was even more beautiful than the picture. Thanks!

                                        Beautiful flowers that were delivered perfectly on time. I received an email with a photo when the order was ready, and I got one when they were delivered. Excellent for gift-giving.

                                        My mother-in-law LOVED the flowers and note.  I had a great an easy experience placing the order online.  I quickly received an email confirming my order and then when the flowers were ready to go I also received an email and photo.  Overall a great experience and will certainly keep you in mind to use in the future.

                                        We were not able to attend the funeral and the emails you sent showing us our purchase were greatly appreciated. These orchids are absolutely gorgeous. Simply but elegant and was exactly what we wanted. We were told the arrangement was beautiful. Thank you so much!

                                        Easy to  place order and pay on site. Since I was sending as a gift I never saw the finished product. It would be nice to see product in these circumstances. Even though it should match the order picture,  it could be included in a confirmation email. I received a confirmation when the design was ready for delivery, indicating I would receive another notification once it was delivered, but I never received the delivery notification.
