Click to review 






						

						
						Another great set of combo books for young players by the Clark Boys. Playable with rhythm section plus any horn or combination of horns, these great tunes are perfect for groups that have mastered the very popular First Gig Combo Books and are ready to move on to new tunes at a slightly higher level. These books also work in improv classes or with large groups that have instrumentation problems. The rhythm book comes with a CD recording that provides full performance recordings and also has cuts which serve as play-along recordings.

Four Decades of Excellence
When Glenn and Lloyd Clark founded Clark Associates, Inc. in 1971, they didn’t have a lot of money to create flashy advertising campaigns. They didn’t market themselves with dazzling brochures filled with fluff either. What they did do, however, was provide reliable service at a fair price, with the customer’s needs always held as a top priority.





















That formula, combined with the tireless commitment of our dedicated employees, has allowed us to branch out into many different industries and grow tremendously within each of them.  What started over forty years ago as an electrical service company with 2 partners and 7 employees has grown into a family of companies that employs more than 1,000 people operating out of 15 buildings in 4 states.



Our thriving multi-industry company with sales, service, mechanical, and manufacturing functions has been featured in Central Penn Business Journal's Top 50 Fastest Growing Companies for 6 years in a row, showing that a commitment to hard-working employees and meeting the needs of an evolving customer base has equipped Clark Associates, Inc. with the tools needed for another four decades of excellence.
