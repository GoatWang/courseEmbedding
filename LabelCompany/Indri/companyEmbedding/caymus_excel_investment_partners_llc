Plastics NewsManagement may be best – or worst – feature in acquisitionFinancials are not the only measure when considering a potential merger or acquisition in the plastics market, or really an acquisition in any business.By: Jim JohnsonATLANTA — Financials are not the only measure when considering a potential merger or acquisition in the plastics market, or really an acquisition in any business.Existing management of a potential takeover candidate can help determine whether a deal goes through, or potential investors decide to walk away, according to a trio of money men who spoke at The Packaging Conference in Atlanta.“From my perspective and the investments that we make, if we find an impediment to change, it is generally management,” said Geoffrey L. Faux, managing partner with Caymus Equity Partners LLC of Atlanta. “We really cannot acquire a business if we don’t have a management team to partner with.“Developing a relationship with a management team is part of the experience of being a financial investor, but also can be a challenge.“The types of businesses that we invest in, they are typically businesses that are five, 10, 20 years old. Management has been there for a while, tend to get set in their ways. And sometimes it’s hard to get management to change if we challenge them in certain ways,” he said.“Other times, we see management who is trying to do too much,” Faux said, and is unwilling to bring in additional help, such as financial, sales or manufacturing leaders, to help manage the business.Brett A. Snyder is president of Nicolet Capital Partners LLC of Chicago. He sees two situations that commonly are impediments to change from management: an unwillingness to both take risks and to establish priorities on initiatives to improve their businesses.“Often, there’s a lot of good ideas that both senior management and people in the organization have. There’s usually no shortage of ideas, sometimes we can debate whether they are good or not. But there usually are good ideas,” Snyder said.“What we see a lot is people, for whatever reason, hedging their bets, being unwilling to do the work to analyze different opportunities and then make a decision on a manageable number of initiatives that you can then actually execute,” he said. “You can’t execute 10 or 15 things. That’s just not realistic.“Those are the two areas that we’ve seen holding a lot of companies back,” Snyder said.Jack Knott is CEO of investment firm Arion Partners LLC of New York City and former CEO of Coveris, a plastics packaging company.“Absolutely management is the one impediment that would cause us to walk away from a potential turnaround or acquisition. The other one would be cash flow. If the burn rate was just such that the balance sheet was weak enough that we just could not see our way to support the changes necessary,” he said.The investors also provided some insight about how they view the current mergers and acquisition market.“It continues to be a very good market environment for businesses,” Faux said, to “bring in private equity partners like ourselves when management and owners have the opportunity to take some cash out of the business, yet continue run the business in partner with a private equity firm.“There’s a significant amount of capital in the marketplace today with folks like the three of us looking for attractive investment opportunities,” he said. “I think, from our perspective, it will continue to be a very strong market.”Not only are financial investors interested mergers and acquisitions these days, Knott said there is an increasing number of family run companies looking to make deals to expand their businesses.“We’re not going to go back to the way it was in terms of less competition M&A,” Snyder said. “The long arm of history is going to continue to be up and to the right in terms of the competitive environment.“Sure, there will be cycles,” he said, but that means the market will just pull back. “When that happens, it really means the deal market grinds to a halt. It doesn’t mean there’s great opportunities to buy things at lower prices. Just everything sits still for a while and we all decide to go back to our hijinks again.“Our answer to that is to be specialized, and we’re increasingly focusing our efforts around plastics and converting packaging businesses under the assumption that if you are going to have to pay a lot and pay more than you would want to pay, presumably at least you would like to know what you are doing or think you know what you are doing,” Snyder said.Link to original article: http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20150211/NEWS/150219970

Caymus Equity Invests in Hospitality Staffing Solutions
January 2014 - Atlanta, GeorgiaContinue Reading




A group formed by Caymus Equity, including Caymus Equity HS Investment Partners LLC, LJC Investments I, LLC, Littlejohn Opportunities Master Fund, L.P., SG Distressed Fund, L.P. and management, has completed the acquisition of HS Solutions Corporation, the holding company of Hospitality Staffing Solutions, LLC (“HSS” or the “Company”).   Headquartered in Atlanta, GA, HSS is the nation’s largest provider of full service outsourced staffing solutions to the hotel, lodging, and gaming industries.Founded in 1990, HSS’s full service offering includes housekeeping, food and beverage, janitorial, stewarding, laundry, and grounds maintenance staffing for commercial hospitality locations in over 35 states in the U.S. Caymus Equity has had a long-standing relationship with HSS since Caymus Partners LLC, the investment banking predecessor to Caymus Equity, advised the Company in three separate transactions, including the sale of the Company to an institutional investor in 2010. Post-transaction initiatives, including a significant increase in the corporate office and turnover in the field supervisor team, contributed to cash flow difficulties for the Company and ultimately led HSS to default on its loans in the spring of 2013. Because of the strong relationship with the management team and in-depth knowledge of the Company, Caymus Equity teamed with the management team and initiated the restructuring transaction. Shortly thereafter, Caymus Equity, in partnership with Littlejohn, formulated and executed the planned acquisition of the assets of HSS. The acquisition provides HSS with the necessary capital and strategic support to emerge from the transaction as a stronger company with a revitalized operating model.“While this transaction was unique for us, we are excited about the opportunity to work alongside a management team of HSS that we have had a longstanding relationship with, as well as the opportunity to invest and work side-by-side with one of the premier distressed securities investors – Littlejohn & Co.,” said Geoffrey Faux, a managing partner with Caymus Equity.  “We believe HSS’s market leadership in its service offerings and reputation, combined with the vision and strategic support from Caymus Equity and Littlejohn allow for a significant opportunity for the Company to return to and surpass previous operating benchmarks. We have known Angus Littlejohn for a long time and are delighted to have the opportunity to work with him on this exciting opportunity.”

Caymus Equity Partners and Littlejohn & Co. in Agreement to Purchase the Assets of Hospitality Staffing Solutions
October 2013 - Atlanta, GeorgiaContinue Reading




Hospitality Staffing Solutions, LLC (“HSS”), a leading provider of outsourced staffing solutions for the hospitality industry, today announced that it has reached agreement to enter into an asset purchase agreement with HS Solutions Corporation, an entity formed by LJC Investments I, LLC and a group of investors including Littlejohn Opportunities Master Fund, L.P., Caymus Equity Partners and Management, under which HSS proposes to sell its assets as a going concern through a court-supervised process. The transaction, which is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2013, is subject to a competitive bidding process and Court approval. This transition will allow HSS to substantially reduce its outstanding indebtedness, shed certain legacy obligations and emerge with the strong financial backing of a new owner.

HSS will continue uninterrupted service to its customers through the sale process. In addition, HSS does not expect to make any meaningful reductions to its workforce through the sale process. HSS team members will continue to work their usual schedules and be paid in the normal course, pending customary Court approval.

Rick Holliday, president and CEO, said, “This transaction will allow us to clean up our balance sheet and emerge as a stronger company with new owners. Importantly, the process will enable HSS to continue to provide its customers with the same high-quality, industry-leading staffing solutions they’ve come to expect.”

To facilitate the sale, HSS has filed a voluntary petition for relief with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. To ensure that the Company can continue providing ongoing access to staffing solutions to its customers, and to protect the value of the Company’s assets, HSS will seek to sell its assets under Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, subject to higher and better bids.

Caymus



    As the Wagner family celebrated the 40th anniversary of Caymus Vineyards in 2012, they thought back to 1972 which Charlie Wagner, Lorna Belle Glos Wagner and their son, Chuck, built their winery among the vines planted on the family's ranch in Rutherford, California - the center of the Napa Valley.  In 1975, the Wagners produced their first Special Selection Cabernet Sauvignon, which remains the only wine to have twice been named Wine Spectator's "Wine of the Year" (1984 and 1990 vintage).

WHAT IS IT?
Local Pickup dramatically simplifies the wine delivery process by eliminating the need to wait for your order to arrive at your home or office. We ship your wine directly to one of thousands of pickup locations, so you can get your delivery whenever it's convenient for you. Many locations are even open nights and weekends.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
It's simple. Just choose Local Pickup in your cart at checkout. Select a location that works for you, and we'll send your order there. (Not available in some locations. Specific store locations available in checkout.) When it arrives, you'll receive an email notification. An adult signature is still required.

DOES STEWARDSHIP APPLY?
Yes! Your StewardShip free shipping benefit applies to every order sent everywhere, including the thousands of participating pickup locations across the country.

WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE SAYING
I tried the Wine.com Local Pickup and it was a great experience from order entry to delivery. Selecting my most convenient FedEx Office was straightforward during the checkout process. My shipment was delivered to FedEx Office before 11 AM and was waiting for me on my way home from work. All of my future orders will use Wine.com Local Pickup and I'll be sure to tell my friends who are afraid to buy online because they can't be home all day for a delivery.- Collierville, TN I've enjoyed buying from Wine.com but delivery has been a hassle. With the new FedEx pickup program, I don't have to worry about being home. I can just stop at the FedEx store on my way home from work.- Dallas, TX
