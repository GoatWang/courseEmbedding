Publisher's Description▼▲
The third millennium. It's a time of tremendous opportunity for the church--and tremendous challenge. More than ever, pastors need a model for ministry that can equip them for the rigors of a restless, increasingly secularized culture. In the 21st Century Pastor, David Fisher explores the apostle Paul's concept of ministry to offer a paradigm that is both biblical and relevant. Paul's view is fleshed out with examples from Fisher's own twenty-five years of pastoral experience, presenting a roadmap for today's pastor that is scholarly, practical, dynamic, and inspiring. The 21st Century Pastor first addressees crucial issues of pastoral identity, the significance of geography, time, and ecclesiology. It then explores Paul's metaphors for ministry (jars of clay, farmers and builders, servants and stewards, and others) to reveal an accurate portrait of an effective, biblical pastor--the kind who will speak to the heart of modern culture rather than languish on its fringes. Filling the rare role of a pastor to pastors, Fisher's sage insights help pastors answer their own identity questions, empowering them to minister to a deeply needy society. Says Fisher, "Pastors who know what time it is will, in the name and power of God, create communities of faith where the values of the Gospel are embraced, taught, and lived out."


Author Bio▼▲
       David Fisher is senior pastor of Plymouth Church in Brooklyn, New York.  He was formerly senior pastor of Colonial Church in Edina, MN.

Electronic paper, or e-paper is making great technological advances, but what exactly is it and how does it work?
Electronic paper is also known as e-paper and is a technology designed to imitate the look and style of ordinary ink and paper. E-paper reflects light just as ordinary paper does, unlike the usual flat-panel display that is lit with a backlight to illuminate pixels.
Electronic paper was first developed in the 1970s by Nick Sheridon at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. The first electronic paper, called Gyricon, consisted of polyethylene spheres between 20 and 100 micrometres across.
E-paper comprises two different parts: the first is electronic ink, sometimes referred to as the "frontplane"; and the second is the electronics required to generate the pattern of text and images on the e-ink page, called the "backplane".Several different technologies are involved in the production of e-paper, some use plastic substrate and electronics to make the display flexible, this makes it more comfortable to read that traditional displays and gives it a stable image, so you don't have to refresh it constantly. Though it's light and durable the color representation is still somewhat limited.There are several uses of electronic paper that can be seen or even purchased today. Here are some examples:Lucent's new E Ink device shows how the future of ePaper is coming. The technology uses electronic ink and combines thin, plastic, flexible transistors with polymer LEDs to create smart pixels. The process involved uses silicon rubber stamps to print minute computer circuits onto the surface. For display, E Ink uses electronic ink: a liquid plastic substance made up of millions of tiny capsules filled with light and dark dyes that change color when exposed to an electric charge. This device will be completely flexible like paper (without the easy tearing or crumpling) and can display changing text or image.The benefits to using electronic paper are quite impressive. Here are some of the benefits of using the technology:

Shopping Tips
Who doesn't need to get the best offer for their buck -- especially of these tough economical times? There is no shortage of sales advertisements from retailers who would like your business: they're using preferred customer special offers, early parrot sales, midnight madness occasions, coupon savings times, and pre- AND post-holiday sales. Precisely how do you select if their offers are real?
The Federal government Trade Commission, the country's consumer protection company, has some tips to obtain the most for your cash.
Check around. A "sale" price isn't always the "best" price. Some merchants may give you a sale price on an item for a limited time; others may discount the purchase price on a single item everyday. Having an item's manufacturer, model number, and other identifying information can help you to get the best price for that you want.Read sale advertising carefully. Some may say "quantities limited," "no rainfall inspections," or "unavailable whatsoever stores." Before you come out the door, call ahead to be sure the merchant has the item in stock. If you're searching for a favorite or hard-to-find item, ask the merchant if he'd be willing to carry that until you can reach the store.Devote some time and travel costs under consideration. If something is for sale, but it's way anywhere, how much are you truly saving once you element in your time, your transportation, and parking?Search for price-matching guidelines. Some retailers will match, or beat even, a competitor's prices -- at least for a restricted time. Browse the merchant's pricing plan. It may well not apply to all items.Go online. Have a look at websites that compare charges for items offered online. Some sites also may compare prices offered by stores locally. If you opt to buy online, keep shipping costs and delivery amount of time in mind.Calculate discount offers that derive from buys of additional products. For instance, "buy one, get one free," "free gift idea with purchase," or "free delivery with minimal purchase" may appear enticing. Unless you want or need that, it isn't a deal.Ask about sales adjustments. In the event that you buy something at regular price and it continues on sales another week, is it possible to get a credit or refund for the reduced amount? What documentation how about?Enquire about refund and come back guidelines on the market items. Merchants frequently have different refund and return policies on the market items, clearance merchandise especially.
Gifting is one of the human being emotional accessories that stay static in the hearts of the recipients permanently. There are different events when you might need to send somebody a bunch or gift idea box in Vietnam. That's the reason services of a specialist florist are specially an integral part of any city on earth today, including Ho or Hanoi Chi Minh. Additionally, you can also do flower delivery in Hanoi online which incorporates both a assortment of gift idea alternatives, and genuine delivery services.
There are actually a great number of florists on the net today. How would you select? While they could look like similar, their choice, prices, and services can golf swing mainly. Most are trusted organizations; however some are not. Thus, be alert!
Locating the best online florist in Vietnam isn't just a search yet somewhat a need so you might get its rewards at whatever time you will need, and plan a celebration or event from remote control effectively without facing any level of resistance as it's up to plants. There are a few beneficial circumstances of choosing the Vietnam florist, but to obtain the best out of most florists for just about any gifting on any day here are some tips. Have a look at their blossom delivery style as normally online florist deliver plants in a way that the receiver gets them in the freshest form. Many ways is there by which they shipped it like covered individual plants and filled with a moist smooth sponge within the base, in order that they reach you fresh and budded. And yet another way is straight way by which recipient has got the flowers in conventional bouquet.
Most important truth you should tag is about blossom delivery business is their online timely deliver reviews. As plants are always designed to speak on special event and which only prices when deliver promptly. So, you must check the opinions of the florist prior to making decision.
Best way to get the online florist in Vietnam is through looking at their reviews. This is actually the safest and speediest option you can take up. Research the ultimate way to obtain the best florist for your web orders. A good florist will have other gifting options like individualized gifts, weekly and monthly gifts, present cards, chocolates etc that they will deliver along with plants.
When you compare prices of different bouquets and online florists, you should take the time to read the conditions and conditions. Find out if all taxes and delivery fees have been considered. Some florists advertise their products at lower prices but these prices are prior to tax and delivery fees and therefore final prices change from florist to florist. The full total price is what you ought to focus on.
