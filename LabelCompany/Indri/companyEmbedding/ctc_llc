CTC Pressure Products, LLC provides customers with personal service for the solutions and resources needed to succeed. Our key team members have a combined experience of over 100 years in the design, manufacture and assembly of high pressure and ultra high pressure products. As a founder-led company, we are dedicated to delivering high quality products and dependable services, 24 hours a day 7 days a week, for total customer satisfaction.  Contact CTC Pressure Products, LLC and find the perfect product for your specific needs and requirements.HISTORY:The Coned and Threaded Connection originated out of a US Government research program in the late 1920s. Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory (FNRL) focused on a means for converting atmospheric nitrogen to nitrates. Those means being of high pressure necessitated development of a high pressure tube connection machined into pressure vessels, valves, and fittings. FNRL worked with an American Company to develop the coned and threaded connection and components. By the mid-1950s, valves, fittings, tubing and other accessories of high strength steel, were brought to market with a coned and threaded connection.CTC Training Sample Tool:  The CTC (Coned Threaded Connection) Training Sample Tool is a cutaway with a medium pressure and high pressure connection assembly.  This training tool is designed to teach the assembly procedure of the connections and to show the difference between the medium pressure and high pressure connection.









Assembly Instructions for Standard Coned & Threaded Connections:1. Slide the gland nut onto the end of the tubing with the threads facing the cone and threaded end of the tube. 2. Screw the "left handed threaded" collar onto the tube until one to two threads of the tube end are exposed from the tapered coned end. (Do not thread the collar to back of the tube nipple threads)3. Apply a compatible lubricant to the gland threads and the back side of the collar where it comes in contact with the gland. Also lubricate the tapered cone portion of the tube with a system compatible lubricant. (This will help protect the sealing surfaces from galling during the assembly process.)4. Insert the gland, collar and tubing assembly into the female connection.  Thread the gland into the connection and tighten the assembly hand tight. 5. Tighten the gland nut to the required torque value of the connection.Note: In cases with the smaller fittings it is good practice to use an additional wrench to hold the mating fitting in place to prevent the opposite connection from turning.

Investment Advisory Services

                        There are many global alternatives for wealthy individuals and families to choose from when searching for thoughtful investment advice, guidance and counsel.    Yet, discerning families soon realize few firms deliver advice and service with focus, objectivity or meticulous customization. Even fewer possess the depth of experience necessary to serve the unique needs of the ultra-affluent.
                    
We have organized our firm to offer you the following distinctive capabilities:

Focus - Advising Individuals and families is our business.  Our selectivity in working with only ultra-affluent families enables us to deliver deeper, more tailored expertise to larger clients with a much more concentrated level of service.   Our focus on individuals and families also arms us with a keen understanding of one of the most important and pervasive investment planning variables: taxes.
Objectivity - Grounded in the belief that wealth is enhanced when managed holistically, our investment advisory team has a 30 year history of addressing each client’s unique investment and tax-related issues by combining dynamic investment research and integrated advice that is aligned with our clients’ interests.    Our unbiased approach as an organization distinguishes us from most of our peers, as we are paid only by our clients and serve as each client’s chief, independent advocate.
Customization - The architecture of each and every client’s family structure is unique and requires a custom approach to how we deliver.  To that end, clients may engage CTC | myCFO to serve as their own Chief Investment Officer, or to partner directly with their existing investment professionals and staff in an effort to enhance their existing capabilities.  Our clients may also retain, share or delegate some or all aspects associated with the management of their portfolios. In the end, the clients we serve select the optimal service model that best matches how they wish to manage and implement their own personal capital.
Experience – We have assembled an in-house team of investment advisors and research professionals that are seasoned veterans.  Our institutional memory and extensive network of investment contacts enables us to identify global, new and niche oriented managers that fulfill our clients’ customized investment strategies.



Family Office Services
Significant wealth brings with it many opportunities to enjoy a lifestyle that is independent, self-directed and secure. Yet, great wealth is also typically accompanied with complexity, risk and highly interdependent issues.
The Family Office Services platform of CTC | myCFO was custom built to assist you in navigating the myriad activities, decisions and professional relationships necessary to safeguard and grow your wealth.
We offer clients the following capabilities:

Acting as your outsourced family office, we can serve as the central hub for the management of your tax, philanthropic, wealth transfer, risk management, lifestyle and family financial reporting needs. 
If you already have established your own family office, we partner and collaborate well with your existing team and advisors.  You can select from our broad range of services to augment or enhance your current capabilities. 
If you are evaluating the merits of establishing your own private family office, retaining a multi-family office or pursuing elements of both approaches, we have the experience, knowledge and domain expertise to assist you in identifying the most appropriate structure.

Whether we help manage all or a part of your financial picture, our seasoned Family Office Services professionals deliver an integrated approach that seeks to unify all of your advisors and strategies towards a common goal of executing with one voice.


Capital Advisory Services

                        Our organization recognizes that few firms, if any, can satisfy your entire range of customized banking needs under their own roof.  As a result, the Capital Advisory Services Team of CTC | myCFO delivers a unique, advocacy based approach to customized banking.   Acting as your advocate, we offer objective advice on how to manage and optimize your financial assets and liabilities to help you achieve your wealth and lifestyle goals.
                    
CTC | myCFO offers customized balance sheet and liquidity advice that centers on the following:

Debt Sourcing – We help you assess and select debt alternatives for personal and business needs, optimizing loan terms, conditions and cost. 
Capital Asset Financing – We provide you with a full analysis of the cost and other considerations to help you plan for and finance capital asset acquisitions. 
Monetization of Specialized Asset Classes – We help you leverage the value of assets to provide additional investment capital and/or liquidity.

In addition to advice regarding optimal use of financing, CTC | myCFO delivers depository advice and solutions that are best suited to your needs, including checking accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. When your cash management needs extend beyond this offering set, we will partner with you to identify, tailor and implement enhanced strategies available within both the money and capital markets.


Fiduciary Advisory Services
The complexities and nuances of serving as a trustee, executor or administrator of an estate are many. The Fiduciary Advisory Services Team of CTC | myCFO delivers a full spectrum of trust and estate advice and service capabilities that combine our professionals’ financial, tax and administrative experience with the utmost objectivity, discretion and thoughtful administration.
Acting in a fiduciary capacity, our capabilities include:

Serving as a co-trustee or sole trustee of revocable and irrevocable trusts in either a full or directed trustee capacity
Serving as executor or personal representative, or appointed agent thereof, for estates
Serving as an objective advisor to individual fiduciaries, providing guidance regarding the prudent investment, tax and administrative aspects of trust and/or estate management

Whether we are managing a comprehensive or directed corporate fiduciary engagement, providing trust and estate administrative services or delivering guidance, advice and services to individual fiduciaries, CTC | myCFO professionals offer advice that is integrated within each of our clients’ comprehensive financial planning architectures.


BMO Delaware Trust Services

                        The wealth planning strategies of the ultra-affluent individuals and families we serve often touch on a number of complex, interrelated issues and structures.  When those planning circumstances involve the formation and/or administration of trusts, the old adage of “location, location, location” rings true.  The location or situs of a trust can have direct bearing upon the applicability of state income tax laws, trust investment and distribution flexibility, trust duration, beneficiary disclosure requirements, creditor protection and many other considerations.
                    

                        While CTC | myCFO is fully committed to providing advice and access to all venues that assist in addressing these considerations, we are able to effectively address some of the more unique and sophisticated fiduciary needs of our clients through our Delaware based affiliate, the BMO Delaware Trust Company.
                    

                        Some of the more notable advantages of selecting the trust-friendly State of Delaware for the establishment of a new trust or as a destination for moving an existing trust include:
                    

Potential state income tax deferral and/or minimization, particularly for non-resident beneficiaries 
Wealth preservation via perpetual trusts that hold personal property 
Confidentiality in terms of the degree of disclosures to beneficiaries that are required 
Investment flexibility and direction from third party advisors that enables a separation of investment duties from administrative functions 
Distribution flexibility to treat different classes of beneficiaries equitably 
Favorable creditor protection statutes, including spendthrift provisions, that mitigate unintended erosion of trust assets

As a founder-led company, we are dedicated to delivering high quality products and dependable services, 24 hours a day 7 days a week, for total customer satisfaction.  Contact CTC Pressure Products, LLC and find the perfect product for your specific needs and requirements.HISTORY:The Coned and Threaded Connection originated out of a US Government research program in the late 1920s. Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory (FNRL) focused on a means for converting atmospheric nitrogen to nitrates. Those means being of high pressure necessitated development of a high pressure tube connection machined into pressure vessels, valves, and fittings. FNRL worked with an American Company to develop the coned and threaded connection and components. By the mid-1950s, valves, fittings, tubing and other accessories of high strength steel, were brought to market with a coned and threaded connection.CTC Training Sample Tool:  The CTC (Coned Threaded Connection) Training Sample Tool is a cutaway with a medium pressure and high pressure connection assembly.  This training tool is designed to teach the assembly procedure of the connections and to show the difference between the medium pressure and high pressure connection.









Assembly Instructions for Standard Coned & Threaded Connections:1. Slide the gland nut onto the end of the tubing with the threads facing the cone and threaded end of the tube. 2. Screw the "left handed threaded" collar onto the tube until one to two threads of the tube end are exposed from the tapered coned end. (Do not thread the collar to back of the tube nipple threads)3. Apply a compatible lubricant to the gland threads and the back side of the collar where it comes in contact with the gland. Also lubricate the tapered cone portion of the tube with a system compatible lubricant. (This will help protect the sealing surfaces from galling during the assembly process.)4. Insert the gland, collar and tubing assembly into the female connection.  Thread the gland into the connection and tighten the assembly hand tight. 5. Tighten the gland nut to the required torque value of the connection.Note: In cases with the smaller fittings it is good practice to use an additional wrench to hold the mating fitting in place to prevent the opposite connection from turning.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
