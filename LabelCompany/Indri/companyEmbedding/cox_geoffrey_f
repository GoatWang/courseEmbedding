Jan 08, 2014, 10:15 ET
		  		  						
						 from   Lakewood-Amedex Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


SARASOTA, Fla., Jan. 8, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Lakewood-Amedex Inc., a leading developer of novel anti-infective pharmaceuticals, announced today that it has elected Geoffrey F. Cox, Ph.D., to serve on its board of directors.  Dr. Cox, currently an independent consultant to the Biotechnology and Life Sciences Industry and Principal of Beacon Street Advisors, brings to the company significant experience of the biotechnology industry, through a number of positions as a Senior Executive and CEO and also as a Board Director, and Chairman, of both public and private companies.  
Dr. Cox was employed by Genzyme Corporation for 13 years last serving as its Executive Vice President, Operations. He subsequently became Chairman, CEO and President of Aronex Pharmaceuticals Inc. and then Chairman, CEO and President of GTC Biotherapeutics Inc., before becoming a Partner with Red Sky Partners, LLC. 
Dr. Cox is the immediate past Chairman of MassBio, the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council and served for a number of years on the Board of the Biotechnology Industries Association (BIO), together with the Health Governing and Emerging Companies Sections of BIO. 
Lakewood-Amedex's President and CEO, Steve Parkinson, commented, "I have known Dr. Cox for many years since my days at Genzyme and welcome a world-class executive of Geoff's standing to the board of directors.  His knowledge and experience of financial, manufacturing, regulatory, drug-development and business development matters will be invaluable in working with our team to successfully commercialize our products.  This experience brings to Lakewood-Amedex additional capabilities as we prepare to enter our first human clinical trials and advance our current potential licensing and partnership opportunities."
Dr. Cox commented, "Having been involved with many biotechnology companies in my time, I am greatly impressed with the breadth of the Lakewood-Amedex product portfolio and the quality of the company's science.  This sets them apart from most companies at this stage of development.  Also the management team has the right level of passion and chemistry and I look forward to working with them and to helping them make a great success of this very promising company."
About Lakewood-Amedex, Inc.
Lakewood-Amedex is a privately held biopharmaceutical company developing a broad portfolio of anti-infective products, including first-in-class anti-bacterial compounds, orally available nanoRNA therapeutics for acute and chronic diseases such as arthritis, inflammation, cancer, influenza, and hepatitis, and a fully human monoclonal antibody for HUS.  The Company's products and technology are covered by an extensive patent portfolio consisting of 74 granted and/or issued patents and 13 pending patent applications filed on a worldwide basis covering all major pharmaceutical markets.  The Company's lead therapeutic candidate is a novel synthetic broad spectrum anti-bacterial proven to be effective in killing a wide range of gram-positive, gram-negative, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria and is expected to enter the clinic in 2014.
