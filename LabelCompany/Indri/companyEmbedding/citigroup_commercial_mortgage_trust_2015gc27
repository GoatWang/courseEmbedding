The DBRS underwritten WA DSCR and WA debt yield at issuance were 1.45x and 8.1%, respectively. The largest 15 loans in the pool collectively represent 50.4% of the transaction balance and reported YE2015 or trailing-12-month financials showing a WA net cash flow growth of 19.9% over the DBRS underwritten figures, with a WA DSCR and WA debt yield of 1.74x and 9.5%, respectively. 
As of the January 2017 remittance, there is one loan in special servicing and one loan on the servicer�s watchlist, representing 0.5% and 0.7% of the current pool balance, respectively.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch to Rate Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust Ser 2015-GC29 
      Commercial Mtg P-T Ctfs
    





March 26, 2015 12:47 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report for Citigroup Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust Series 2015-GC29 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through 
      Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$29,302,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$146,427,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$220,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$334,415,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$52,822,000 class A-AB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$838,892,000* class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$72,704,000* class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$55,926,000b class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$72,704,000b class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$180,362,000b class PEZ 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$51,732,000b class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$65,713,000a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$65,713,000*a class X-D 'BBB-sf; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$23,769,000a class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$11,185,000a class F 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (*) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (a) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) The class A-S, class B and class C certificates may be exchanged for 
      class PEZ certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for 
      the class A-S, class B and class C certificates.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Mar. 25, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $15,380,000a class G 
      and $39,148,505a class H certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 86 loans secured by 108 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.12 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were originated by Citigroup 
      Global Markets Realty Corp.; Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company; Rialto 
      Mortgage Finance, LLC; KGS-Alpha Real Estate Capital Markets, LLC; GS 
      Commercial Real Estate LP; FCRE REL, LLC; and RAIT Funding, LLC. In 
      addition, one loan contributed to the trust was co-originated by 
      Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp., German American Capital 
      Corporation, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 75.3% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 79.9%, and asset summary reviews of 86.0% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The transaction has higher leverage than other 
      recent Fitch- rated transactions. The pool's Fitch DSCR of 1.17x is 
      below both the YTD 2015 average of 1.20x and the 2014 average of 1.19x, 
      and the pool's Fitch LTV of 111.2% is above both the YTD 2015 average of 
      109.3% and the 2014 average of 106.2%.
    

      Concentrated Pool: The largest ten loans account for 57.2% of the pool 
      by balance. This is greater than the YTD 2015 average of 47.7% and the 
      2014 average of 50.5%. The pool's above-average concentration resulted 
      in a loan concentration index (LCI) of 476, which is greater than the 
      YTD 2015 and 2014 averages of 337 and 387, respectively. However, four 
      of the largest ten loans (29.1% of the pool) are secured by properties 
      located in New York City.
    

      Limited Hotel Exposure: Only 6.2% of the pool by balance consists of 
      hotel properties, which is below the YTD 2015 average of 17.8% and the 
      2014 average of 14.2%; hotels have the highest probability of default in 
      Fitch's multiborrower CMBS model.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 10.3% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI) (for properties for which 
      historical NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during the most recent reporting period). Unanticipated further declines 
      in property-level NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted loans, and could result in potential rating actions on the 
      certificates. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      CGCMT 2015-GC29 certificates and found that the transaction displays 
      slightly above average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a 
      scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. 
      In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from 
      Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' 
      could result. The presale report includes a detailed explanation of 
      additional stresses and sensitivities on pages 10 - 11.
    

      The master servicer will be Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC 
      Bank, National Association, rated 'CMS1' by Fitch. The special servicer 
      will also be Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National 
      Association, rated 'CSS1' by Fitch.
