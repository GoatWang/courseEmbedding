"She Knows" #1 in Vegan Cheese Review






 







"She Knows"  #1 in Vegan Cheese Review


(Excerpts – for full article go to”
http://www.sheknows.com/food-and-recipes/articles/1095035/vegan-cheese-taste-test
“She Knows” is the #1 Women’s LifeStyle Digital Media Company
Vegan cheese taste test: 8 Non-dairy products, ranked
Vegans hear it all the time: “I could never go vegan, because I could never give up cheese!”
But even though vegans have given up cheese, that doesn’t mean some of them don’t miss it. When I switched to a primarily vegan diet two years ago, my friends and family were shocked, mostly because I was notoriously obsessed with cheese. Back in the day, my sister always said she would marry cheese when she grew up, and for some reason my personal motto was “I like cheeeeeeeese.” So giving it up was a daunting prospect.
So maybe it’s because of my love for the taste of dairy cheese — and my dissatisfaction with its nutritional profile and the farming techniques that are used to procure it — that have helped me be more open-minded about vegan cheese. Yeah, vegan cheese. And while some vegan cheeses are made with mysterious combinations of tapioca starch, artificial flavors and colors, others are made from cultured nuts and nut milks using techniques very similar to traditional artisanal dairy cheeses.
But how do they stack up? To find out, I bought eight different brands of vegan cheese and hosted a tasting for two of my omnivorous friends and one other vegan. While there were definitely some misses, there were a few options that wowed us all.
1. Leaf Cuisine Peppery Jack Probiotic Cashew Spread (Similar to: Boursin/dip)
This cheese came out of nowhere and totally won the tasting. I was the most skeptical of this product. I mean, it’s called “probiotic cashew spread” right on the label — I assumed it was going to taste like the worst stereotype of vegan hippie food. But I was so, so wrong. This super-creamy spread was richly flavored with herbs and spices. It didn’t taste like pepper jack, as the name implied, but more like Boursin. One taster even likened it to French onion dip. Once we were done with the tasting, I had to get the rest of this one out of the fridge so we could keep snacking. I will definitely purchase this product again, and I’m excited to bring it to parties with crackers or potato chips and to watch my omnivore and vegan friends eat it up.
And I’m thrilled to know that tasty vegan cheese is now a reality.

MY FAVORITES OF EXPO WEST 2016
leaf cuisine / When you pair probiotics and cashew cheese in the same sentence, you have my full attention.
I can appreciate a smooth, flavorful cashew cheese spread with a distinct probiotic tang. A good option for those times you want a lighter cashew cheese.
Gluten-free,  Soy-free and Raw


 









 

 






Clean-Slate Article






 











 



Local Favorite | Leaf Cuisine Cashew Cheese Spreads
Leaf Cuisine is a local, Los Angeles cashew cheese based company with roots that date back to the formative Leaf Cuisine Restaurant run by “Raw Food’s For Real People” author and chef Rod Rotundi.
Rod has dedicated his career to helping others understand the powerful benefits in raw foods and the positive effects it has on our mind and body. 
An individual with such passion has now taken his latest endeavor to this year’s Natural Products Expo West, where I met him and his lovely girlfriend Mia. 
I tried the Smoked Gouda and The Original. I was hooked. The fermented cashew cheese spread was creamy, salty/sweet, soy-free, gluten-free and raw–a winning combination to create a minimally processed product. 
Since scouting them at Expo West, they have added to their line. 
After trying all the new flavors, I still stand firm on the Smoked Gouda being my standout favorite. 
Since seeing them originally at my local Whole Foods, they have now expanded across the US. I have also seen them at Erewhon Market, Santa Monica Coop and Lassen’s.

We use traditional culinary techniques such as fermentation to enhance the nutrition and wholesomeness of our exclusively plant-based foods. We keep it simple. 

 









 

 






LEAF = Love expressed around food

Chef Rod Rotondi- Bio






 







														Chef Rod Rotondi is an author (“Raw Food for Real People”), restaurateur (Leaf Organics) and chef specializing in vegan and raw foods cuisine. He is the founder of the Leaf Cuisine, with products sold at Whole Foods Markets and many other natural foods retailers since 2006.

Rod Rotondi has used his unique experience and perspective to translate world cuisine into delicious and affordable vegan, gluten-free, raw and paleo offerings.  

Changing the world one bite at a time has become Rod’s approach to social activism:

“Everyone has control over what they put in their mouth and these choices make a huge difference for our shared environment- our planet, as well as our individual environments- our bodies!”

Growing up in an Italian-American family with food as the center of family and social gatherings, hospitality and food preparation are second nature to Rod. From hand rolling his grandmother’s “secret” gnocchi, to enjoying formal banquets in Rome at the residence of his grandfather, the American Ambassador, to cooking courses in Paris, Rod’s youth was food-centric.

After completing his Masters in International Economics, Rod spent 6 years managing grass roots development projects in the Middle East for the United Nations. 

Trading in his 3-piece suit for a wet suit, Rod moved to Dahab, Egypt, a Bedouin village along the Sinai Peninsula, where he developed Club Red, a major resort offering scuba diving, desert safaris, a hotel, restaurant, and a wellness center. There he opened the first yoga center in Egypt and on the millennium held the largest party in the Sinai since Moses- over 2,000 people!

Deciding to return home, Rod settled in Marblehead, MA, and opened Rod’s Wrap & Juice Bar, an organic, vegan and raw restaurant. Capitalizing on a lifetime of culinary lessons from around the globe, Rod developed the recipes and concept, which he then brought out to Los Angeles to become Leaf Organics Restaurants. Soon a steady stream of customers came including celebrities such as Toby Maguire, Stevie Wonder, Andre 3000, Woody Harrelson, Ali Larter, Alicia Silverstone, Carol Alt, Forest Whitaker, Allen Chance and many more.” Rod closed the restaurants in 2013, choosing to focus on building his packaged foods brand, Leaf Cuisine, and have a life. 

Rod lives in Los Angeles, loves his daughter, plays several instruments, sails, scuba dives and loves everything to do with the water. He takes part in many charity events throughout Los Angeles including Save the Bay, The American Heart Association and the Breast Cancer Fund. He also does private teaching, chefing, consulting and speaks at schools and colleges and has catered the Grammy Awards and other entertainment industry functions.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
