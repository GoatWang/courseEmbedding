        Brown Products manufactures the most durable, versatile, and dependable outdoor power equipment you will ever own. With the highest standards in quality, Brown Products equipment is built to last. But don't just take it from us, see what our customers have to say.
        










TrenchMaster
"We have used several other brands of trenchers in our three rental stores and had problems with the drive mechanisms, bearings, and frames cracking. In the time we've had the TrenchMaster, I don't think we have had a single breakdown that stopped a customer. The TrenchMaster's belt drive system eliminates sheared engine drive shafts which were a common problem with direct drive systems."

David McClellan, Rent Mart Stores — South Dakota 


 
 


  







BedEdger
"I recently purchased a Brown BedEdger Model F990H after renting them for several years. It has increased my productivity and allows me to
                    earn more money. It has eliminated the need to hire additional workers, thus increasing my profits. This is a great trencher, easy to use, doesn't damage nice lawns, and the versatility allows me to perform other landscaping work."

Mark Murray, Murray's Irrigation — Newton, Alabama 


 
 


  







EdgeMaster
"A recent demonstration for a state agency in Florida consisted of edging five miles of street curb. The curb had not been edged in about 8 months. The grass was so overgrown that, after edging, it had to be removed from the curb with a shovel. The EdgeMaster finished the job in about three hours and was the only edger to complete the trial. The agency has since purchased two EdgeMasters. They use them to edge the highways in 5 mile sections at a time, and are running them continuously in 10 hour shifts."

Mike Gail, AIA Small Engines — Florida

Tom Brown Inc.About Us 











Tom Brown, Inc. – Specialty Tape Products
With its headquarters located in Lawrence, PA, Tom Brown, Inc. is a fully integrated converter and manufacturer of specialty tapes and gasket materials and a distributor of specialty construction products under the Garvin Brown Construction Products name.











Tom Brown was a born entrepreneur, taking over The James Brown Feed and Grain Co at the age of 13 after his father’s death. In 1915 a fire destroyed the business and Tom was forced to find another job.

He landed at the Duncan and Porter Company where he became interested in the sale of industrial lime. He went on to start several businesses with the experience gained at Duncan and Porter.
The Neville Lime Company was formed in 1934 and sold lime to the steel industry. Tom Brown Builder’s Supply was started in 1936 to sell lime to the building and construction industry.










He purchased Heppenstall and Marquis Builder’s Supply in 1938 and added additional product lines, the company settled at 36th and AVRR in Pittsburgh. He also started the Wholesale Distributing Company in 1940 and later purchased Iron City Sash and Door Company which became one of the largest distributor of Andersen windows in the US.
Tom Brown, Inc was formally incorporated in 1946 and was rapidly expanding with the addition of many surrogate companies- Tom Brown Industrial Supply, Lanz Brick, Tom Brown Mill and Mine Supply, Brown Dettling Supply Company, and General Concrete Units Corp.
Don Brown joined the company in 1949 and General Concrete Units became his main focus. He took it from a concrete block provider to a major manufacturer of architectural precast concrete. St. Martin’s Hall at Duquesne University and Litchfield Towers at the University of Pittsburgh are celebrated as GCU’s first two major projects.

As a precast concrete provider, Don became exposed to the need for high performance sealants and caulking materials. Tom Brown, Inc became a distributor for GE Silicone, Vulkem and Sonneborn Sealants to service the industry. Specialty Construction Tape and Adhesive products from Norton Company were added in the early 1970’s. Kenny Brown (our current CEO) joined the company in 1978 and led the expansion into tape converting in 1983.
Today, TBI has 7 single knife log slitters, 4 die cutting presses, 2 traverse wound spooling machines, a large format laminating machine, 2 rewind slitters and a waterjet cutter. TBI converts tapes for major tape manufacturers including 3M, Saint-Gobain (Norton), Adhesives Research, Adco, Adchem, Rubberlite, and others. Brendan Brown (our current president and COO) joined the company in 2010 and is leading the expansion of TBI into a national converter of tape products with the addition of a new tape converting facility in Salt Lake City. He is also instrumental in a strategic alliance with Garvin Construction Products of Boston to market sealants, caulking, waterproofing, and concrete repair products under Garvin Brown Construction Products in the Northeast.
