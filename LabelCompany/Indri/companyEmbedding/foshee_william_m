Obituary for Foshee William M.d.
 Edit

Dr. William Stuart Foshee, 76, of Red Level, passed away Tuesday, May 3, 2016 in a Birmingham Hospital. Funeral services will be held at 11:00 AM Friday, May 6, 2016 at Buck Creek Baptist Church with Reverend Billy Boles and Reverend Tyler Ingram officiating; interment will follow in Buck Creek Cemetery. Visitation will be from 5:30-8:00 PM Thursday evening at Foreman Funeral Home.
William "Stuart" Foshee M.D. was born in McKenzie, Alabama. He graduated Red Level High School with honors in 1957. He then pursued his undergrad degree in a Bachelor of Science from the University of Alabama in 1966. He attended the University of Alabama at Birmingham and earned his medical degree then continued his career specializing in Pediatric Infectious Disease.
He was one of the first physicians to attain this specialty within Pediatrics. In 1967, he entered the USAF where he retired as Colonel. In the military, as a practicing physician, he received many awards. "Meritorious Service Medal", Outstanding Pediatric Staff Physician", "Outstanding Scholarship and Dedication to Resident Education", "Excellence in Patient Care", "Dedication to Teaching and Guidance to Research" are some of the accolades he received.
He was also a consultant to the Surgeon General while in the USAF. In July of 1987, he joined the faculty of the Medical College of Georgia. He was the Pediatric Education Coordinator for the Medical College of Georgia Hospital where he supervised the training of doctors during their residency. He was admired and adored by his residents, nurses, and staff and received the Teacher of the Year Award in the 1995-1996 school year.
Being on the forefront of AIDS research, he was a principle investigator in antibotic trials and very active in antiobiotic research during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. He had a natural way of putting people at ease, both patients and coworkers, about AIDS and the stigmas that were presented with it. Through his research, he was able to drastically reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of AIDS/HIV.
Being a member of the Georgia Task Force on AIDS in 1999, he saw no obstacles in getting the proper care for his patients and extremely persistant in making sure the needs of his children were addressed. His love of Pediatrics and compassion of children were as equally important as his specialty. After retiring from the Medical College of Georgia, he moved back "home" to Red Level, Alabama where he wanted to give back to the community in which he was raised.
He worked at Covington Pediatrics from 2003 until retirement in 2009 from his career that he loved so much. He was a Fellow with the American Academy of Pediatrics and a Diplomat of the American Board of Pediatrics, and Member of the Infectious Disease Society, Pediatric Infectious Society of America, and American Society of Microbiology.
In his retirement years, he loved gardening, tinkering around the house, and Alabama football. For several years, he served as the Men's Sunday School teacher at Buck Creek Baptist Church. He is survived by his wife, Janna Foshee of Red Level; son, William Bradley Foshee of Sherman, TX; daughter and son-in-law, Jennifer Foshee and Darryl Segich of Sherman, TX; step-son, Marcus McIntyre of Red Level; step-daughters and step-sons-in-law, Margo M. and Brad Sharpless of Montgomery and Megan and Jason Sasser of Red Level; grandchildren, Ashley Foshee, Nicole Segich, Marley Sharpless, John Holland Sharpless, and Mitchell Sasser; 2 great grandchildren; sisters and brothers-in-law, Christine and Albert Barton of Red Level and Ernestine and Byron Sturgis of Peachtree, GA; brothers and sisters-in-law; George and Barbara Foshee of Red Level and Winston and Miriam Foshee of Letohatchee; and sister-in-law, Eleanor Foshee.
He is preceded in death by his parents, James Madison and Irene Foshee, and brother, Joseph "Doby" Foshee. Pallbearers will be the United States Air Force Honor Guard and the Honorary Pallbearers will be the Buck Creek Church Men's Sunday School class. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to Buck Creek Baptist Church, Dr. Stuart Foshee Children's Fund courtesy of Billy Joe Sharpe, 33715 Bryant Rd., Red Level, AL 36474, or the Make A Wish Foundation Alabama, 244 Goodwin Crest Drive, Homewood, AL 35209; in memory of William Stuart Foshee.

      Hello Fran, Yes I'm still here.Here is the information that I have on my James Madison Fishea:James M &amp; Colista Foshea are listed in the 1880 Census of Milam County, Texas.That census shows James M to be age22 born in Louisiana,Colista age 21 born in Texas.James M married Colista Johnson April 28, 1878. At the time of his death, James M was living/working on either The Threadgill Ranch or The Roundtree Ranch near Burlington, Falls County, Texas.So I have his birth year listed as 1858. His date of death January 17, 1932 is recorded in Vol 3, page 140 Fall County, Texas. James Madison Foshea is my Great Grandfather.<br><br>I hope this Helps. Vernon D. "Woody" Laywell Houston, Texas.

John W Foshee Alabama
/surnames.foshee/197/mb.ashx
      Doing a bit of snooping around on Fold3 I started finding records for John W Foshee that matched the age of one of my ancestors.  However, the birth place is incorrect.  It also doesn't match any of the other John W Foshees that are in our line.  He is a Jr and his father is also enlisted in the same regiment of the 29th.  I'd be willing to share the information with someone if it is their line.

Everybody in this family, is stuck on W.J. Patterson. We do not know from where he came. I was just looking for what I might put together and came across your post.

      The Wiley Foshee born in 1806 married to Mary Polly Smith died in 1857 in Tallapoosa County, Alabama and is buried in Ephesus Primative Baptist Church Cemetary.  He did go to Kirby in Pike County, Arkansas but returned to Tallapoosa County, Alabama before his death.  Wiley G Foshee is the grandson of Wiley Foshee.  He lived in Arkansas and served in the Civil War.  His father was William Riley Foshee.  I am also a descendant of William Riley's through his other son, John W., who remained in Tallapoosa County while everyone went to Arkansas.

Re: Maplesville

      I have Foshee ancestors who were in Bibb and Chilton Counties Alabama. Winifred Foshee who was born about 1810 and died in Alabama sometime after 1880 and before 1900 was my gggrandmother. She is (we believe) the daughter of David Foshee. I traced David Foshee from Edgefield Co., SC (where he is named in a deed of gift as son of Nathaniel Foshee). David was born about 1775. He and his family were in Alabama by 1820 (church records indicate he was in SC in 1814 and other church records show he is in Alabama by 1820.) David is listed in the 1830 census in Bibb Co., AL. By 1840 David and his son Wiley Foshee have moved to Talledega Co., AL where David died in 1844 (as per church record). His son Wiley moved to Texas. David's daughter Winifred Foshee (mygggrandmother) married Alexander C Culp and their son Nathan N. Culp was my ggrandfather. There were two Nathan N. Culps about the same age in Bibb Co., AL. One is the son of Alexander C. Culp and the other is the son of his brother Nathan N. Culp, Sr. The Nathan N. Culp son of Alexander (my ggrandfather) (1848-1926) moved to Mississippi and then on to Texas. Contact me if you are interested in or are connected to this Foshee line.<br> <br>Vonda

      My great-great-grandfather was John Foshe.  He lived in Greene County, Tennessee and was married twice.  The first marriage was to a Nancy Foster.<br><br>They had 8 children by this marriage.<br><br>After Nancy died in 1856, John married Sarah Jones and had 8 children by her.<br><br>My great-great grandfather was the 1st born of the 2nd marriage.  His name was Elbert Alexander Foshe.<br><br>I have been trying to find the father of John Foshe without much luck.  There is some bad information on the internet stating that a Solomon Forshey was his father but I have found that to be inaccurate (at least at this point).<br><br>If you would like to correspond concerning Foshe genealogy (or other like spellings...Foshee, etc.) please email me at <a href="mailto://bmccauley@mchsi.com">bmccauley@mchsi.com</a><br><br>Blake McCauley

      Well I would start with your dad's birth and death records which show his birth date, place and prove his parents.  Then go back to your grandparents etc.  You should be able to easily find this info for a few generations, and it requires a bit more digging when you get beyond the 1880's but can be done.   In addition to census records, church and cemetery records are helpful.<br><br>remeber to document what and where you found the info.  Also trace all the siblings as this often reveals many clues.  Often times siblings married tinto the same familes in rural, less populated areas.

      This is not my line so I don't have much information. Check the 1900-1930 census.  There is a lot of information and clues to be found regarding marriages, birth dates, number of living and dead children and occupations etc.  For example, the 1930 AL census, Census Place: Munford, Talladega, Alabama; Roll: 50; Page: 17A; Enumeration District: 37; Image: 419.O shows the following for this family:<br><br>James Foshee 45  <br>Mamie Foshee 39  <br>Garland Foshee 18  <br>Ruby Foshee 16  <br>Howard Foshee 13  <br>Johnnie Foshee 11  <br>Mary Foshee 8  <br>James Foshee 5  <br>Nathan Foshee 1  <br>

      Thank you for this info.  Is there more that you know on this lineage? How far back can you go?  Do you have record of my dad's birth in Miami Fla.?  Or could that have been Miami, Tx?  My dad passed in 1990, I don't know how to gather more info.  The only living relative of his generation is an aunt in a nursing home.  What kind of records would you pull?

      JmThis James amadison Foshee is the son of William Emmett Foshee 23 Aug 1853, Maplesville, Bibb, Alabama - 22 Nov 1917<br>Gladewater, Gregg, Texas and Mary L Rivanna Shepperd.  William Emmett Foshee married Mary L Rivanna Shepperd on 6 Aug 1876 in Texas. Mary L Rivanna Shepperd 21 Aug 1855, Upshur, Texas - 5 Sep 1929 Gladewater, Gregg, Texas.  They appear in the 1880 Texas Census;  Precinct 5, Upshur, Texas; Roll: T9_1330; Family History Film: 1255330; Page: 481.4000; Enumeration District: 115. Then they appear in the 1900 Texas Census; 1900; Justice Precinct 3, Gregg, Texas; Roll: T623 1641; Page: 4B.<br><br>This family seems to stem from the Bibb  Co., AL Foshee lines, which is thought to relate to the Conecuh/Escambia Co. AL lines.  One theory on this line is that Willam Foshee and James Stewart Foshee were brother who moved from NC to Conecuh Co AL about 1818-1820, with Fielding Straughn. Then sometime later William Foshee moved on to Bibb co. AL.
