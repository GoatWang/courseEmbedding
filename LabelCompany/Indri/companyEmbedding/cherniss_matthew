UPDATED: Former Fox Broadcasting Co. and FX executive Matt Cherniss is returning to the TV business and reuniting with his former boss Peter Liguori. Cherniss is joining Tribune Co. as President/General Manager of WGN America and the newly formed Tribune Studios. At superstation WGN, Cherniss replaces Julio Marenghi, who has been named President of Broadcast Media Sales.
Tribune Studios marks Tribune’s official re-entry in the TV production business. The company was a leading producer and distributor of first-run syndication programming in the 1980s and ’90s through its division Tribune Entertainment until it was shut down in 2007. In the past couple of years, Tribune had signaled its interest in re-entering the space. It produces and distributes daytime syndicated program The Bill Cunningham Show and has interest in CBS’ Arsenio Hall late-night talk show and The Test, which will launch on Tribune’s 23 local TV stations in the fall. With Tribune Studios, the company plans to build on and expand what it is doing on Arsenio Hall and The Test by producing and co-producing programming that targets the needs of its stations and the superstation, Tribune CEO Liguori said, noting that “No longer can a media company look at their stations and network as a vehicle to deliver ratings and ad revenue, it’s a much bigger play.” The studio will focus on three areas, Liguori said: “Daytime, where we have 23 local stations reaching 80% of the country to monetize and market, Access, and of course Primetime on WGN America,” adding that the goal is to put on “fresh original programming from quality producers” for Tribune’s cable affiliates, advertisers and the audience. For that, Liguori said he has brought in Cherniss, “known within the creative community for his incredible eye for high-quality, commercial programming, as well as his integrity as a partner and a programmer.” Cherniss will report to Liguori, for whom he previously worked at Fox and FX, and will be based in Los Angeles, expanding Tribune’s West Coast presence.

Cherniss spent the past two years on the feature side, working as SVP Production for Warner Bros, where he oversaw the development and production of such movies as 300: Rise Of An Empire and the upcoming comedy Mail Order Groom, starring Steve Carell and Tina Fey, set to begin shooting this summer. He said he enjoyed the feature development process and was not contemplating a move until he started talking to Liguori and “seeing an opportunity I couldn’t pass up.” Cherniss’ background is in scripted programming, and he plans to get into the arena in a big way. He will be looking for a scripted series that would define WGN the way The Shield did for FX and Mad Men did for AMC. “Through WGN America and Tribune Studios we will be looking to attract the most innovative and imaginative creators in the business, as we make a commitment to unique and distinctive programming,” he said.







Before joining Warner Bros, Cherniss was EVP Programming and the No. 2 programming executive for Fox Broadcasting Co, where he shepherded the development of such series as Glee, Raising Hope, and Bob’s Burgers. As SVP Original Programming at FX, Cherniss played an integral role in the development of Damage, Nip/Tuck, as well as Rescue Me and Sons Of Anarchy.
In his new role, Marenghi, who has headed WGN America since 2009, will oversee ad sales for the Tribune local TV stations and WGN Radio in Chicago, reporting to Larry Wert, President/Broadcast Media. “Julio has done a great job growing advertising share and revenue at WGN America, where sales reached all-time highs,” said Liguori. “He’ll bring the same talent, passion and commitment to our local broadcast stations, and work closely with our sales teams to ensure that we continue delivering outstanding results for our clients.”

Way to go Matt! Perfect choice.

And hoping the first move he makes is ridding themselves of Sean Compton at WGN America, another Zell cronie who ruined that network with his insane and idiotic ideas, especially these horrible talk shows in Cunningham and Maury and such.

good for Matt, and especially good for Peter.  They will make a successful team (again).  Glad to have Matt back in TV!

Now they just need someone to work with Matt who understands programming local TV stations..which is no quite the same as programming a network

LOS ANGELES and CHICAGO, June 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Tribune Media Company (NYSE:    TRCO) today announced that Matt Cherniss, president and general manager of WGN America and Tribune Studios since March 2013, has decided to step down at the end of the month.  Since his appointment, Cherniss has driven the successful evolution of WGN America from a superstation to a cable network with critical and commercial hits and broad distribution across the country.    








"I've had the great honor of leading the transformation of WGN America from a superstation to a fully distributed cable network, and the great privilege of leading a talented and wonderful team," said Cherniss.  "I am tremendously proud of all of the strides we've made and what we were able to accomplish in a short period of time."   
Peter Kern, Chief Executive Officer of Tribune Media Company said, "We are grateful to Matt for his leadership, and creative vision in transforming WGN America.  He's had a tremendous impact on the company, and we thank him for his significant contributions."  
Cherniss expanded WGN America's reach, its audience and presence in the minds of viewers with brand-defining original programming.  Equally important, the network's advertisers more than doubled and distribution increased by nearly 10 million homes.  
WGN America debuted its first original series "Salem" in 2014, premiering to record highs for the network, followed by the critically acclaimed drama "Manhattan," which garnered the network's first-ever Emmy Award.  The momentum continued with the 2016 launch of "Underground" and "Outsiders," which consistently ranked among the top 20 cable dramas on television.  
Kern has named television industry veteran Gavin Harvey to serve as interim president of WGN America.  Harvey has a long and distinguished history in the cable industry, serving in executive roles with networks such as E! and FX, and leading Versus, Fuse and Sportsman's Channel through significant growth periods.   
"I've been fortunate to work closely with Gavin over the years, and he is a terrific executive with an impressive track record of building brands and delivering programming that resonates with viewers, advertisers and distributers," said Kern.  "I have no doubt that he can steer WGN America to continued growth and profitability."      
Tribune Media Company (TRCO) Tribune Media Company (NYSE:    TRCO) is home to a diverse portfolio of television and digital properties driven by quality news, entertainment and sports programming. Tribune Media is comprised of Tribune Broadcasting's 42 owned or operated local television stations reaching more than 50 million households, national entertainment network WGN America, whose reach is approximately 80 million households, Tribune Studios, and a variety of digital applications and websites commanding 60 million monthly unique visitors online. Tribune Media also includes Chicago's WGN-AM and the national multicast networks Antenna TV and THIS TV. Additionally, the Company owns and manages a significant number of real estate properties across the U.S. and holds a variety of investments, including a 32% interest in CareerBuilder, LLC and a 31% interest in Television Food Network, G.P., which operates Food Network and Cooking Channel. For more information please visit www.tribunemedia.com. 
About WGN America WGN America, the flagship entertainment destination of Tribune Media Company (NYSE:   TRCO), is a nationally distributed television network available in approximately 80 million homes via cable, satellite and telco.  The network features a strong slate of popular, first-run syndicated dramas, comedies and blockbuster movies celebrated by fans across the country.  Stay connected to WGN America on Twitter @wgnamerica.  For additional information, please visit www.wgnamerica.com.
