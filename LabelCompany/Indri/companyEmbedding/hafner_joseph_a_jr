Corporate Governance

At Sysco, we believe the underlying principle for proper corporate governance is a simple one: Do the right thing. Our business is built upon quality relationships with our customers, suppliers, communities, and, of course, our shareholders. Relationships require a strong foundation of mutual trust and understanding that is nurtured day after day. That trust is earned, not just by adhering to the letter of the law, but also by acting within the spirit of the law.
The following pages contain Sysco’s fundamental governance documents. They embody the way Sysco conducts business on behalf of its shareholders, customers, suppliers, associates, and the communities in which we work. We have attempted to touch upon the areas of most concern to people who have a stake in or do business with Sysco. For situations not specifically included in these documents, you have our pledge that Sysco and its associates will endeavor to do the right thing.
