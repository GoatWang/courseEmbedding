YieldBoost Leucadia National Corp. From 0.9% To 15.1% Using Options

Shareholders of Leucadia National Corp. (Symbol: LUK) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 0.9% annualized dividend yield can sell the December covered call at the $27 strike and collect the premium based on the $1.50 bid, which annualizes to an additional 14.2% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ), for a total of 15.1% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $27 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but LUK shares would have to climb 0% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 5.6% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Leucadia National Corp., looking at the dividend history chart for LUK below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 0.9% annualized dividend yield. 



Below is a chart showing LUK's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $27 strike highlighted in red: 



The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December covered call at the $27 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $27. ( Do most options expire worthless? This and six other common options myths debunked ). We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Leucadia National Corp. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $27.10) to be 20%. For other call options contract ideas at the various different available expirations, visit the LUK Stock Options page of StockOptionsChannel.com. 



In mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 755,899 contracts, with call volume at 1.35M, for a put:call ratio of 0.56 so far for the day. Compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65, that represents high call volume relative to puts; in other words, buyers are showing a preference for calls in options trading so far today. Find out which 15 call and put options traders are talking about today .

The New #91 Most Shorted S&P 500 Component: Leucadia National
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 08/31/2016 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the S&P 500 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.

History[edit]
Leucadia executives Ian Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg both graduated in the same Harvard Business School Class of 1970. They joined Leucadia around 1979. Ian Cumming (a Vancouver native) and Joseph Steinberg each own about 13% of Leucadia's shares.[4]
Leucadia is headquartered in New York City, but has additional offices in Salt Lake City, Utah. The company's name comes from the seaside town in Southern California and was chosen randomly after several other choices were rejected during the incorporation process. Cumming and Steinberg spotted the sign along the freeway and suggested it as an alternative.
Leucadia's highest profile move as of 2005[update] was a bid in 2004 to acquire 50 percent of telecommunications company MCI's common stock. However, after MCI received higher bids from other companies, Leucadia withdrew from the bidding process.[5]

Jefferies remains independent and is the largest operating company within Leucadia. On March 1, 2013, Leucadia bought the Jefferies Group for $3.6 billion. The company’s founders, Ian M. Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg, stepped down from their management roles after the merger, with Mr. Steinberg staying on as chairman. The number of directors also increased to 11 from eight, including the addition of nine new directors. Richard B. Handler became chief executive of Leucadia, while remaining chief executive of Jefferies.
Other Investments[edit]

WMAC Investment Corp., a subsidiary of Leucadia, is the largest backer of Pershing Square Capital Management L.P., a Delaware-incorporated investment partnership. William Ackman is the founder of the $10 billion+ activist hedge fund Pershing Square. The Fund had 20%+ returns over the past 9 years.

Leucadia (through a subsidiary) was an investor in controversial syngas plants which utilize coal gasification technology through a Department of Energy loan guarantee. A $2.6 billion plant was planned in Indiana, while similar proposals in Illinois have met resistance from state regulators.[8][9] The project in Indiana was ultimately panned by the state legislature in 2013.[10]
In January 2015, Leucadia granted a loan to FXCM after it became insolvent due to a sharp rise in the CHF currency after the Swiss Bank stopped pegging its currency to the Euro. The loan value is estimated to be at $300 million.[11]

History[edit]
Leucadia executives Ian Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg both graduated in the same Harvard Business School Class of 1970. They joined Leucadia around 1979. Ian Cumming (a Vancouver native) and Joseph Steinberg each own about 13% of Leucadia's shares.[4]
Leucadia is headquartered in New York City, but has additional offices in Salt Lake City, Utah. The company's name comes from the seaside town in Southern California and was chosen randomly after several other choices were rejected during the incorporation process. Cumming and Steinberg spotted the sign along the freeway and suggested it as an alternative.
Leucadia's highest profile move as of 2005[update] was a bid in 2004 to acquire 50 percent of telecommunications company MCI's common stock. However, after MCI received higher bids from other companies, Leucadia withdrew from the bidding process.[5]

Merger with the Jefferies Group[edit]
On November 12, 2012, Jefferies Group announced its merger with Leucadia, its largest shareholder. Jefferies was valued at $3.8 billion at the time of the acquisition. Jefferies remains independent and is the largest operating company within Leucadia. On March 1, 2013, Leucadia bought the Jefferies Group for $3.6 billion. The company’s founders, Ian M. Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg, stepped down from their management roles after the merger, with Mr. Steinberg staying on as chairman. The number of directors also increased to 11 from eight, including the addition of nine new directors. Richard B. Handler became chief executive of Leucadia, while remaining chief executive of Jefferies.
Other Investments[edit]

WMAC Investment Corp., a subsidiary of Leucadia, is the largest backer of Pershing Square Capital Management L.P., a Delaware-incorporated investment partnership. William Ackman is the founder of the $10 billion+ activist hedge fund Pershing Square. The Fund had 20%+ returns over the past 9 years.
In June 2007, Leucadia (through a subsidiary) purchased most of the assets of ResortQuest International, Inc., a vacation rental property management company headquartered in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, from Gaylord Entertainment Company.
In December 2011, National Beef Packing Company, LLC and its major owner U.S. Premium Beef, LLC (USPB) announced the company’s majority owners have entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Leucadia National Corporation under which Leucadia will acquire approximately 79 percent of the outstanding ownership interests in National Beef.
Leucadia (through a subsidiary) was an investor in controversial syngas plants which utilize coal gasification technology through a Department of Energy loan guarantee. A $2.6 billion plant was planned in Indiana, while similar proposals in Illinois have met resistance from state regulators.[8][9] The project in Indiana was ultimately panned by the state legislature in 2013.[10]
In January 2015, Leucadia granted a loan to FXCM after it became insolvent due to a sharp rise in the CHF currency after the Swiss Bank stopped pegging its currency to the Euro. The loan value is estimated to be at $300 million.[11]

History[edit]
Leucadia executives Ian Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg both graduated in the same Harvard Business School Class of 1970. They joined Leucadia around 1979. Ian Cumming (a Vancouver native) and Joseph Steinberg each own about 13% of Leucadia's shares.[4]
Leucadia is headquartered in New York City, but has additional offices in Salt Lake City, Utah. The company's name comes from the seaside town in Southern California and was chosen randomly after several other choices were rejected during the incorporation process. Cumming and Steinberg spotted the sign along the freeway and suggested it as an alternative.
Leucadia's highest profile move as of 2005[update] was a bid in 2004 to acquire 50 percent of telecommunications company MCI's common stock. However, after MCI received higher bids from other companies, Leucadia withdrew from the bidding process.[5]

Merger with the Jefferies Group[edit]
On November 12, 2012, Jefferies Group announced its merger with Leucadia, its largest shareholder. Jefferies was valued at $3.8 billion at the time of the acquisition. Jefferies remains independent and is the largest operating company within Leucadia. On March 1, 2013, Leucadia bought the Jefferies Group for $3.6 billion. The company’s founders, Ian M. Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg, stepped down from their management roles after the merger, with Mr. Steinberg staying on as chairman. The number of directors also increased to 11 from eight, including the addition of nine new directors. Richard B. Handler became chief executive of Leucadia, while remaining chief executive of Jefferies.
Other Investments[edit]

WMAC Investment Corp., a subsidiary of Leucadia, is the largest backer of Pershing Square Capital Management L.P., a Delaware-incorporated investment partnership. William Ackman is the founder of the $10 billion+ activist hedge fund Pershing Square. The Fund had 20%+ returns over the past 9 years.
In June 2007, Leucadia (through a subsidiary) purchased most of the assets of ResortQuest International, Inc., a vacation rental property management company headquartered in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, from Gaylord Entertainment Company.
In December 2011, National Beef Packing Company, LLC and its major owner U.S. Premium Beef, LLC (USPB) announced the company’s majority owners have entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Leucadia National Corporation under which Leucadia will acquire approximately 79 percent of the outstanding ownership interests in National Beef.
Leucadia (through a subsidiary) was an investor in controversial syngas plants which utilize coal gasification technology through a Department of Energy loan guarantee. A $2.6 billion plant was planned in Indiana, while similar proposals in Illinois have met resistance from state regulators.[8][9] The project in Indiana was ultimately panned by the state legislature in 2013.[10]
In January 2015, Leucadia granted a loan to FXCM after it became insolvent due to a sharp rise in the CHF currency after the Swiss Bank stopped pegging its currency to the Euro. The loan value is estimated to be at $300 million.[11]

History[edit]
Leucadia executives Ian Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg both graduated in the same Harvard Business School Class of 1970. They joined Leucadia around 1979. Ian Cumming (a Vancouver native) and Joseph Steinberg each own about 13% of Leucadia's shares.[4]
Leucadia is headquartered in New York City, but has additional offices in Salt Lake City, Utah. The company's name comes from the seaside town in Southern California and was chosen randomly after several other choices were rejected during the incorporation process. Cumming and Steinberg spotted the sign along the freeway and suggested it as an alternative.
Leucadia's highest profile move as of 2005[update] was a bid in 2004 to acquire 50 percent of telecommunications company MCI's common stock. However, after MCI received higher bids from other companies, Leucadia withdrew from the bidding process.[5]

Merger with the Jefferies Group[edit]
On November 12, 2012, Jefferies Group announced its merger with Leucadia, its largest shareholder. Jefferies was valued at $3.8 billion at the time of the acquisition. Jefferies remains independent and is the largest operating company within Leucadia. On March 1, 2013, Leucadia bought the Jefferies Group for $3.6 billion. The company’s founders, Ian M. Cumming and Joseph S. Steinberg, stepped down from their management roles after the merger, with Mr. Steinberg staying on as chairman. The number of directors also increased to 11 from eight, including the addition of nine new directors. Richard B. Handler became chief executive of Leucadia, while remaining chief executive of Jefferies.
Other Investments[edit]

WMAC Investment Corp., a subsidiary of Leucadia, is the largest backer of Pershing Square Capital Management L.P., a Delaware-incorporated investment partnership. William Ackman is the founder of the $10 billion+ activist hedge fund Pershing Square. The Fund had 20%+ returns over the past 9 years.
In June 2007, Leucadia (through a subsidiary) purchased most of the assets of ResortQuest International, Inc., a vacation rental property management company headquartered in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, from Gaylord Entertainment Company.
In December 2011, National Beef Packing Company, LLC and its major owner U.S. Premium Beef, LLC (USPB) announced the company’s majority owners have entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Leucadia National Corporation under which Leucadia will acquire approximately 79 percent of the outstanding ownership interests in National Beef.
Leucadia (through a subsidiary) was an investor in controversial syngas plants which utilize coal gasification technology through a Department of Energy loan guarantee. A $2.6 billion plant was planned in Indiana, while similar proposals in Illinois have met resistance from state regulators.[8][9] The project in Indiana was ultimately panned by the state legislature in 2013.[10]
In January 2015, Leucadia granted a loan to FXCM after it became insolvent due to a sharp rise in the CHF currency after the Swiss Bank stopped pegging its currency to the Euro. The loan value is estimated to be at $300 million.[11]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
