Reviews | Testimonials






Regroover is an amazing plugin. Pretty crazy! I will definitely be using this on records. Instantly! 

Mischke (Songwriter/Producer) - Michael Jackson, Trey Songz, Pussycat Dolls, Jessica Simpson, Jennifer Lopez, Spice Girls, KC & JoJo 



 
 
 
 
 

 
 







I'm beyond fascinated & inspired by this plug in, Regroover is a must-have. It can be used in so many ways: from cleaning a drum loop, to layering drums, sound replacement, re-sequencing kicks, snares, hi hats etc.  

Lord Finesse (Artist/Producer)



 
 
 
 
 

 
 



 



“ERA-R is a very powerful plug-in for cleaning up reverberant dialogue. Users can simply turn down excessive reverberation in real-time with the use of the single ERA one knob control in the middle of the GUI.” 

Pro Tools Expert



 
 
 
 
 

 
 







“With dialog and vocals, Era-N easily does the business, knocking out hiss, hum, rumble and any other constant low-level annoyances entirely [...] 9/10”


Computer Music Magazine



 
 
 
 
 

 
 



 



Regroover is a true New-Era sampling tool. A must-have plugin. Simple as that. Brilliantly allowing flexibility when working with layered percussive material, whilst inspiring unique sonic possibilities when using it more creatively. 
 

Aneek Thapar - Head of Sound - Ninja Jamm app, Audio Jedi - Ninja Tune, Sound designer & engineer



 
 
 
 
 

 
 







"ERA-D is an excellent plugin, though, achieving just the right balance between ease of use and behavioural fine-tuning. It does a great job of drying out source material, and noise reduction is a bonus."


Computer Music - Magazine



 
 
 
 
 

 
 



 



"I love drumatom. Just being able to get rid of cymbal and hi-hat bleed from the snare drum track is worth the price of admission alone. Now that many of my mix projects are coming from self produced bands, drumatom is pretty essential for getting drum sounds quickly." 

Chris Shaw  (Producer/Engineer) - Bob Dylan, Lou Reed, Goo Goo Dolls, Super Furry Animals, Wilco



 
 
 
 
 

 
 







"ERA-D is pretty damn sweet! Nice interface. Best de-reverb I have heard so far. The de-noiser is so good in fact it certainly blows all other live adaptive software de-noisers I have tried- out the water." 

Michael Wabro (Sound/Dialogue/ADR editor) - Perfume-The story of a murderer, Alfie, The Escapist, 9th company



 
 
 
 
 

 
 



 



Regroover  is a great tool for doing the seemingly impossible! Whether you need a simple way to remove the kick from a clip, play back individual drum hits, or dissect every sound in a loop onto its own layer, you’ll be surprised how well this great new plugin works.  

Ask.Audio  - Magazine



 
 
 
 
 

 
 







"Drumatom is an innovative product that does represent a genuine advance over existing technology. Ιt can make a significant difference to the ‘mixability’ of most multi-miked drum recordings."

Regroover - Your samples, reimagined
Discover the magic inside your drum loops which you’ve wanted to extract for years. Create new sounds from old or simply adjust the volume of individual elements inside a loop. Regroover uses Artificial-Intelligence to extract layers from within your previously recorded beats and samples. Once Regroover analyzes the file, you are able to make your own drum kits and combine them with external sounds to make new beats, loops and your own unique Expansion Kits. 
Use Regroover to:
Unmix your loops into distinct sound layers.
Get previously unheard sounds from inside your loops.
Craft the isolated beat elements and form your unique rhythmic signature.
Regroover Pro Only Features:
Grab that magic kick, snare or clap and place it on its own trigger pad.
Or Build your own Expansion Kit with any element inside your loop which makes for rapid-fire MIDI triggering of samples to make new beats and grooves.
Create Regroover Projects with both external and found sounds from inside your loops.
Who's It For?
Regroover is for music producers, beatmakers and DJs who use sampling, drum programming, and beat slicing to remix and compose.
Who should never use Regroover?
Musical snobs who don’t like fun sample manipulation tools and new ways to work with samples.
To upgrade from Regroover Essential to Regroover Pro, please login and check your personal offer.

Wow, Regroover is really groundbreaking. Easy syncing of loops to your DAW Master Tempo but it also delivers the DNA of any loop. This is where the magic starts! You can use just parts of the loop you need, re-arrange and remix them to your taste. A must have for all producers working with loops. Plug-in of the year 2016! 

Blank & Jones,  - DJs/ Producers



 
 
 
 
 

 
 







Regroover makes it possible to deeply discover the magic drum loops which you wanted to extract for years and then it’s now time to get this magic kick, snare or clap alone on a new track. It is a very nice and useful product for electronic musicians, beat makers, or even for sample makers.

 INNOVATION AWARD  - Regroover provides a creative workbench on which to program interesting kick-free percussion lines and variations on dense melodic parts, and indulge in experimental groove design. Just bunging samples in and firing MIDI at them quickly becomes addictive.

Regroover is unique beat tool that combines some pretty advanced features with a surprisingly quick and easy workflow. The results can be quite impressive, especially if you take the time to tweak the automatic splitting process.

SAN JOSE, Calif., Nov. 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:   CDNS) and Accusonus Inc. (Lexington, MA) today announced that the Accusonus Focus-MDR and Focus-DNR speech enhancement software has been optimized for Cadence® Tensilica® HiFi Audio/Voice digital signal processors (DSPs). Accusonus was able to achieve a 60 percent reduction in computational cost as measured in megacycles per second (MCPS) without any loss of quality. With these optimizations, the Accusonus two-microphone embedded joint de-noise and de-reverberation software products reduced the computational requirement to as little as 4.8 MCPS, making them among the most efficient implementations in the market. 
The patented Accusonus algorithms eliminate noise and reverberation while significantly improving speech quality to make conversations intelligible, even when there's a large distance between the speaker and microphone. For more information on the Accusonus Focus-MDR and Focus-DNR technology, visit http://accusonus.com/technologies/focus-voice-engine. 
The Tensilica HiFi DSP is the most widely used licensable audio/voice/speech DSP family, with support for over 160 proven audio/voice software packages and over 75 software partners in the Tensilica Xtensions™ partner program. For more information on the Tensilica HiFi DSP family, visit http://www.cadence.com/news/HiFiDSP/Accusonus.
"Our products were, from the very beginning, designed to work in tandem with any other technologies running on the HiFi DSPs and to improve their performance in demanding acoustic environments," said Elias Kokkinis, CTO, Accusonus. "We envision our de-noise and de-reverberation products as essential additional components of any indoor voice processing solution, such as conference systems or IoT devices. By utilizing the flexible architecture of the HiFi DSPs, we have achieved a dramatic improvement in computational performance without any loss of speech quality and our products are now ideal for those cases where computational efficiency is the top priority." 
"The unique and compelling solution offered by Accusonus significantly improves the voice quality of mobile and IoT devices," said Larry Przywara, group director of Audio/Voice IP Marketing at Cadence. "The dramatic improvement in computational performance provides our customers the advantage of being able to design applications with significantly lower frequency and lower power compared to other architectures."
