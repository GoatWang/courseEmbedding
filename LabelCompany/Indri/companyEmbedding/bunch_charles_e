The most efficient rank is 1 and least efficient is 206.

Footnotes: 
	Compensation data is from the latest available proxy statements filed through Mar. 23, 2012. Total returns and value of stock owned (including all classes) is based on Mar. 14, 2012 stock price. Compensation percent change is based on combined salary and bonus. Annualized total return during tenure covers the tenure of the executive or from the time of the IPO or available stock history. Relative to market is the ending value of $100 invested in the stock, divided by the ending value of $1 invested in the S & P 500 (a score of 100 = the S & P 500).

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Weak mortgage income hurts U.S. regional lenders

Weak refinancing, thanks to higher interest rates, took a bite out off regional banks' earnings in the second quarter and loan growth remained sluggish, mirroring trends seen at larger banks. Mortgage banking income fell by double digits on a percentage basis at most regional banks that have reported results so far.

Big U.S. banks are starting to pay corporations, financial firms and rich people more to hold on to their deposits, but ordinary consumers will have to wait longer to see more than a few pennies for every $100 they stash in their accounts.

The U.S. housing sector has seen prices, sales and financing applications soar lately as more buyers entered the market for the first time, but those trends were hard to see in big banks' mortgage businesses during the second quarter. Four major U.S. lenders reported an average 33 percent drop in second-quarter mortgage banking revenue on Friday, compared with the same quarter of last year.

U.S. banks are starting to see some long-awaited benefits of higher interest rates, with four of the largest lenders beating analysts' quarterly profit expectations on Friday by raising loan prices without paying much more for deposits. But shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC), Citigroup Inc (C) and PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC) were down in early trading.

PNC Financial Services Group Inc.' s second-quarter earnings and revenue topped estimates as the regional bank's lending continued to grow. The Pittsburgh-based bank said loans grew 4.3% from a year ago to $218 billion, fueled by a rise in commercial and consumer lending balances. Banks across the board are expecting to get an earnings boost from recent interest-rate increases, but loan growth was expected to be tepid in the second quarter.
