Linda
Eye Matrix
Awesome Product. True to your description this eye gel works. I am in my late sixties and have a few fine lines around my eyes. After using KWA Eye Matrix I can see a surprising difference even after the first use. Felt so wonderful on my eyes and you could feel a slight tightening sensation. Your product is amazing and I plan on trying the KWA Face Gel. Thank You!!!!

Chad
Aloe Max 100
This is the only product where you can get aloe gel at nearly 100%. This stuff works, takes the burn away over night. I have used it for 2 years now on my sun burns, and I have some shipped to my home in Texas when ever I run out. Great Product.

Save A Tan
10 stars - I love this stuff and I use it all of the time. My husband had to use it for his sun burn when we were down in the keys and it saved our vacation. He put it on and was still able to go in the sun the next day! I swear and live by this product.


Todd
Aloe in the Pink Toner 
A lifelong product in my home! I first came across this product while growing up in the Caribbean during the 1970's. It has worked great for cleaning my pores over the years and also helped me a GREAT deal during my embarrassing High School acne phase when I was younger.I am still using Aloe in the pink after 40 years! I highly recommend it if you have never tried it before.
