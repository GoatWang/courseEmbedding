Investment programs consisting solely of fixed dollar and fixed income investments, such as bank deposits, CDs, treasury bills, and bonds may preserve capital, but will not produce capital appreciation.Capital PreservationWe protect capital by means of portfolio management, including asset allocation, diversification, avoiding inherently risky securities, and by investing rather than speculating. Our value approach – shunning overpriced investments and striving to acquire those which are undervalued – helps to preserve the investor’s accumulated capital and to grow it safely over time.Investment ApproachWe strive to earn favorable long-term rates of return in a less volatile manner than that which is endured via general stock market exposure. We regularly seek and monitor high quality, large-cap companies with strong balance sheets, high returns on invested capital, and growing streams of free cash flow. We prefer to own businesses with durable competitive advantages run by shareholder-friendly managements that are skilled at capital allocation. Shares of these companies are then purchased only when they become available at a discount to our estimate of their intrinsic value or true worth. Shares may be sold if the share price exceeds our estimate of intrinsic value, if there is a reduction in the quality of the underlying business, or if funds can be better deployed in a more attractive opportunity.Cheviot is a completely independent firm, focused on providing objective advice to clients – always with the highest of integrity and the priority of putting the client first in everything we do.Account Access :View your investment portfolio.

RacanelliIt’s unusual, but (ticker: JNJ) and the broad market have gone their separate ways. In the past 11 months, J&J stock is down slightly, compared to an 10% rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average—of which J&J is a member—and a 23% jump in the health-care sector. Friday, the stock jumped $1.81 to $101.47, but shares are off 7% from a high of $109.49.The strong dollar and worries about the health-care giant’s pharmaceuticals growth can be blamed for the weakness, but long-term investors interested in a high-quality name with both income and price-gain potential might take a second look. As the clouds dissipate, J&J could deliver a double-digit annual total return.One issue has been the muscular greenback. J&J gets more than half its sales overseas, and the rising dollar had a negative impact of nearly 5% in the fourth quarter, and another 7% in the recently reported first quarter, causing sales declines in both periods—yet another unusual thing. Sales comparisons will likely be pressured for another quarter or two.The more important concern is Remicade, J&J’s autoimmune medication that, at $6.9 billion last year, made up 9% of total sales of $74.3 billion. Its future growth could be dented by new competition and adverse U.S. patent rulings. It recently went off patent in a number of European countries.Celltrion (068270.Korea) is attempting to introduce its CT-P13 biosimilar in the U.S., and J&J has filed a lawsuit alleging infringement on its Remicade patents. Additionally, a Remicade patent is being challenged by recent decisions from the U.S. Patent & Trade Office, though appeals are ongoing.The Remicade battles shouldn’t be ignored, but a long-term investor has the luxury of viewing the head winds facing a giant like J&J in a wider context. This is a healthcare firm with unrivaled product and geographic diversity; a bulletproof balance sheet; a culture of capital discipline; a strong pipeline of medicines; and a stable consumer business made up of powerful brands such as Tylenol. Moreover, the Remicade issues will probably take some time to play out.J&J isn’t overly reliant on any single product, notes Darren Pollock, a portfolio manager at Cheviot Value Management. It has been a consistent performer over decades, “a profits machine,” he says. Cheviot has added lately to a longstanding J&J stake. Underlying trends remain strong. Adjusted for the dollar, sales in the most recent two quarters were up a healthy 3% to 4%, he points out. Deleterious currency effects should roll out of comparisons in the next 12 months.In recent years, J&J has changed its pharma approach and become more nimble, adds Jack Oliver, managing partner at RBO Investment Management, which has also added J&J shares lately. The company is more amenable to partnering on products, instead of taking on the entire development, cost, and risk, he says.J&J’s valuation, at a P/E ratio of 16.5 times this year’s midpoint guidance of $6.12, is roughly in line with its historical average. However, relative to the market, the shares trade near the bottom of their long-term range.There should be no discount, says Pollock. J&J has more consistent cash flow, better operating metrics, a higher dividend yield, and a stronger balance sheet than most companies in the market. During the past 20 years, J&J’s valuation carried an average premium to the market of 20%, he says. Pollock looks for a $120 stock at some point in the next three years, which, combined with a 3% dividend yield, would be close to a double-digit annual total return.“J&J is a tough company to bet against,” says RBO’s Oliver. “If you have reasonable expectations in an aging bull market, then J&J stock works.”The risk is that Remicade biosimilars will be available in the U.S. this year, but it is more likely that challenges to the drug will be held up in courts for another 12 to 18 months. Remicade goes off patent in 2018. In the meanwhile, J&J continues to develop its drug pipeline, about which investors will learn more on May 20, when the company will give a pharma-division outlook.J&J stock won’t shoot the lights out, but it should outperform in a downturn and provide a stable but steady rise in a bull market. What’s wrong with that? The securities discussed in the posted article are current holdings of Cheviot’s clients.
