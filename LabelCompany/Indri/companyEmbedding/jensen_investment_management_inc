Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

THE JENSENQUALITY UNIVERSE
Our investment universe produces two different investment strategies grounded in the Jensen philosophy








QG

Jensen Quality 
										GROWTH FUND									




Searches for successful, well-managed businesses that are understandable, sustainable, display shareholder value and are available at sensible prices.









QV

Jensen Quality 
								VALUE FUND




Applies a specific multi-factor model to the companies in our investable universe to uncover those that we believe offer above average growth potential and are undervalued relative to their business performance.











What’s inside the Jensen Quality Universe™?


We are extremely selective. The Jensen Quality Universe™ includes only those businesses that have produced a return on shareholder equity of 15% or greater in each of the past ten years, as determined by the Investment Team. We search for quality companies by targeting exceptional business performance combined with endurance. For those businesses that qualify, we have found the stamina of these quality businesses to be powerful; possessing sustainable competitive advantages and producing consistent earnings growth which, when compounded, can deliver tremendous value to shareholders. The ability to maintain these characteristics over time has generally resulted in increasing free cash flow well in excess of operating needs—which can be a prime indicator of a valuable investment.
Derived from this investable universe, Jensen’s Quality Growth Fund and Quality Value Fund share the same investment philosophy. We then apply a distinct investment process to each, producing different performance characteristics.

Our View on Valuations: Perspective is Key


By Allen Bond, CFA, Portfolio Manager
In recent conversations with both clients and the media, the topic of valuation has been a common theme.  We believe perspective is vital.
One particularly pointed question of this variety was presented during a recent appearance on CNBC.  The hosts cited the seemingly irrational divergence between movements in the bond and stock markets and inquired about the valuation implications for both.  They highlighted that the S&P 500 Index continues to flirt with all-time highs, while the 10-year Treasury yield is approaching 50-year lows.  And, they are not the only market observers interested in this trend.  Jeffrey Gundlach, the often outspoken founder and manager of DoubleLine Capital, recently referred to this phenomenon as “market mass psychosis.”[1]
Are Markets Behaving Irrationally?
We view the crux of this argument as follows.  On the surface, a stock market trading near all-time highs indicates, at a minimum, benign fundamentals.  Currently, we see evidence of this in steady (if plodding by historical standards) domestic economic growth and an improving jobs market.  On the other hand, the sharp rally in the Treasury market could indicate a ‘flight-to-quality’ foreshadowing an impending uptick in market volatility. So, back to Mr. Gundlach’s characterization, is the market crazy or is there a rational explanation?
We believe perspective is critical here.  Jensen’s perspective is that of a long-term investor, and we view the ebb and flow of these relationships over the period of multiple market cycles.  And through that lens, the current relationship between stock and bond prices may ultimately prove to be unsustainable. However, we do not believe it to be irrational (or even psychotic, as Gundlach suggests) given the current investment climate.
Investors of all stripes continue to search for income.  In our view, this desire, in combination with a supportive fundamental backdrop and low absolute Treasury yields, has rationally led to a simultaneous rally in both stock and bond prices.  Case in point: high-dividend paying stocks have led the equity market in 2016, while the decline in bond yields has come primarily from a ‘flattening’ at the longer end of the Treasury yield curve.
Implications for Jensen’s Investment Philosophy
Our CNBC appearance was a good reminder that not all market participants share our perspective.  Specifically, the show hosts wanted us to identify a near-term catalyst that would end this so-called imbalance.  Perhaps the catalyst will be an uptick in inflation, or signs of a sustainable increase in corporate earnings growth.  However, these are at best educated guesses, and we do not believe in investing based on such speculation.
At Jensen, we continue to build the portfolio one stock at a time based on company-specific fundamentals and valuations.  We realize, however, that this endeavor does not take place in a vacuum and that price discipline becomes paramount in the current investing environment.  We have executed more sales of portfolio companies based solely on valuation in the past two years than at any period in recent history.  At the same time, our ‘bench’ of potential portfolio candidates remains robust and we continue to see valuation opportunities.  This is evidenced in our addition of two new companies to the Jensen Quality Growth Fund portfolio thus far in 2016.
The bottom line is that we remain steadfast in our philosophy of diligent, bottom-up portfolio construction.  Within this construct, we maintain that the right balance of patient and nimble investing is critical and, consequently, do not see long-term discipline and short-term flexibility as mutually exclusive.

The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.
