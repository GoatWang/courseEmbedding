Portfolios Designed with the Investor In Mind
Beacon Capital Management is an independent money management firm dedicated to building portfolios that work to deliver consistent returns to investors with finite financial goals.  Our focus is on you, the investor, and meeting your investment needs by providing investment solutions that work to capture market gains when things are good, while working to protect your investments from severe market downturns if things take a turn for the worse.  So what do you want your money to do for you?  Click on a link below to learn more.







Which of the following best describes you?





I need a better investment approach.





I need to know my risk profile and invest accordingly.





I need a plan to meet my financial goals.










If you are like many Americans, your emotions ride along with the extreme cycles of the market. Traditional diversification and asset allocation may fall short in today’s increasingly globalized and volatile marketplace, leaving many investors overexposed to the potentially devastating impact these dramatic market shifts can bring. At Beacon, we believe the greatest risk to investors is severe market volatility, often resulting in double-digit losses. Because losses can be more impactful than gains, requiring a hundred percent increase to recoup from a 50 percent loss, for example, the average investor may not have the time to wait to get back where they started.
 
The overwhelming response from investors today has been a need for safety and consistency in their investment approach, without giving up all hope for competitive returns.
 
This is where we come in. Beacon Capital Management believes it has created a distinctive philosophy designed to meet your unique and complex needs today, based on three fundamentals:
#1        Maximize diversification through equal sector allocation.
#2        Minimize losses with mechanical investments.
#3        Maintain discipline to protect from emotion-led decision making.

We believe that understanding your risk comfort level is the first step in investing.  And recognizing that your risk comfort level can vary over time is important to consider too.  A cautious investor may value asset preservation more than beating the market, while an aggressive investor may aspire to achieve higher than average returns by undertaking more exposure to risk.  At Beacon we do not believe that risk is the only road to return; your comfort level in exposure to market volatility is a major consideration when determining the investment approach that will work best for you.
 
To get started on identifying which investment strategy that might work best for you over the long haul, please take a moment to complete our Risk Tolerance Survey.


Investing is one part of a financial plan.  A comprehensive financial plan may also include things like asset preservation, income withdrawal, tax preservation, estate planning and more. Beacon Capital Management has a nationwide network of affiliated advisors who can assist you with implementing your Beacon investment strategy along with a number of other financial planning services and strategies.  To find a trusted Beacon advisor in your area, click here.
Because your financial goals and investment objectives are significant pieces to effective investing, Beacon Capital Management portfolios are available exclusively through our financial advisor partners. Find an advisor in your area here.

Your Organization’s Fiduciary Partner 
Consider Beacon Capital Management your organization’s fiduciary, financial partner. We understand the unique challenges of managing an entity’s long-term financial goals, and we have turnkey solutions to help manage those goals with and for you.  As an independent money management firm, we are dedicated to cost-efficient portfolio solutions that work to: capture market gains, limit market losses and deliver consistent returns.  Beacon has many customizable, all-encompassing solutions available to organizations too. How can Beacon be of service to you?  Click on a link below to learn more.
 







Which of the following best describes you?





We need a better investment approach.





We need a fiduciary partner.





We need a plan to meet our long-term financial goals.










At Beacon, we understand that your organization has both short-term needs and long-term goals for the money entrusted to you.  We also understand that decisions made today have a lasting impact on the future value of your assets and the sustainability of your financial goals.  Experiencing a decline of an institution’s investable assets during a market downturn can have a significant ripple effect on those who may depend on distributions from those funds today or in the near future.  In recent years we’ve seen endowments, pensions and similar negatively impacted from severe market volatility, leaving long-term consequences in many cases.
Beacon works to maximize returns while minimizing losses, with the goal of providing institutional clients a more consistent investment experience.  To learn more about how Beacon Capital Management’s investment approach may benefit for your institution, contact us today.


Institutions need more than a money manager; they need a fiduciary partner.  A fiduciary, such as Beacon Capital Management, works as part of your team and is committed to the same long-term goals as the organization. Whether you’re in charge of managing the assets for an institution, pension, chartable organization, endowment or similar, we are committed to upholding all fiduciary duties as they relate to the UPMIFA (Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act) which include:

Duty of Care
Duty to Minimize Costs
Duty to Investigate

We will work as your investment management partner to strategize, develop, implement and manage an investment strategy designed for your organizational needs. Working directly with your organization, we can consult, report and evaluate your current investment strategy, performance history and long-term outlook, and provide recommendations that work to align your investments with your goals.


Institutional assets often need to extend beyond just one lifetime, and in many cases, need to be available to meet current financial commitments while continuing to grow for long-term liabilities.  For these reasons, a more sophisticated investment strategy needs to be implemented that both limits market loss and protects current account value while working to maximize investment returns.  Beacon Capital Management maintains these fundamental investment principles, and applies them to the development and management of an investment strategy for our institutional clients.  To learn more about how Beacon Capital Management can provide long-term value to your institution, please call 866-439-9093 or request more information here.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 06/17/2013
            

                BBB has determined that Beacon Capital Management, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
