Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Advisory services
Many organizations like yours find it challenging to oversee their portfolio while also managing the day-to-day responsibilities of running their endowment, foundation, or charitable organization. But partnering with a provider who understands your needs can help you better balance these competing priorities.
Partnering with your organization
Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services® (VIAS) offers nonprofits the considerable resources of a large investment firm like Vanguard with the customized service of a specialized boutique. When your organization partners with VIAS, you work with a team of investment professionals that has your objectives and fiduciary responsibilities in mind. VIAS strives to:

Understand your organization's mission, spending needs, and unique situation and offer sophisticated, unbiased advice.
Develop a low-cost portfolio customized to your organization's needs.
Relieve your staff of many of the day-to-day burdens of investment program management.

OCIO: One service, many names


One approach nonprofits are increasingly considering is an outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO). An OCIO service—which is a key offering of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services—acts as an extension of the board and investment staff. The OCIO determines an asset allocation strategy, selects investment advisors to implement it, and manages its operation and execution. Investment providers and clients call this service a variety of names, including discretionary management, advisory services, and investment management.





Investing and advising
Optimizing your portfolio to meet your long-term investment objectives requires time and skill. VIAS helps you develop a tailored portfolio that ensures your investments are diversified, risk-appropriate, and aligned with your overall strategy.
Our comprehensive advisory services include:









Portfolio construction 

Asset allocation analysis that uses a distinct, proprietary model to deliver solutions based on your portfolio needs.
Investment policy consulting designed to meet the unique investment goals of your organization.
Customized product selection that focuses on low-cost index and active investments.











Portfolio management

Performance reporting to help keep your investment committee informed.
Investment reviews that provide insights into your portfolio and the broader market and economic environment.
Steadfast commitment to risk management and process excellence through ongoing portfolio monitoring and rebalancing.








Research & expertise

Investment expertise and commentary on financial issues that provide context for your decision-making.
Investment committee best practices that are designed to increase your group's effectiveness.





Notes:

Advice services offered through Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services are provided by Vanguard Advisers, Inc., a registered investment advisor.
All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. 
Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.

Vanguard - DB plans: Helping you balance priorities

Advisory services
Many DB plan sponsors find it challenging to oversee plan portfolios while also managing other day-to-day responsibilities for their organizations. But partnering with a provider who understands your needs can help you better balance these competing priorities.
Partnering with your organization
Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services® (VIAS) offers DB plan sponsors the considerable resources of a large investment firm like Vanguard with the customized service of a specialized boutique. When your organization partners with VIAS, you work with a team of investment professionals that has your plan and organization objectives and fiduciary responsibilities in mind.
OCIO: One service, many names


One approach defined benefit plans are increasingly considering is an outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO). An OCIO service—which is a key offering of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services—acts as an extension of the board and investment staff. The OCIO determines an asset allocation strategy, selects investment advisors to implement it, and manages its operation and execution. Investment providers and clients call this service a variety of names, including discretionary management, advisory services, and investment management.





Optimizing your portfolio to meet your short- and long-term goals
Whether your DB plan is open or frozen, underfunded or approaching full funding, or if plan termination is a possibility, VIAS will help you develop a tailored portfolio that ensures your plan investments are risk-appropriate, designed to achieve and maintain full funding, and aligned with your overall strategy. It does this by: 
Understanding your organization, your plan objectives, and your obligations. 
Developing a dynamic investment policy statement that identifies appropriate asset allocation strategies, including funded status triggers, to change the allocation to preserve gains in DB plan funded status.
Based on a proven investment philosophy, constructing a portfolio glide path to full funding and implementing that strategy.
Selecting the best investment minds to manage your portfolio.
Providing ongoing oversight, consultation, and reporting. 

Our comprehensive advisory services include:









Portfolio construction 

Asset-liability modeling—or ALM—to assess your plan's strategic asset allocation relative to its liability.
Investment policy consulting that sets your plan on a path to full funding.
Product selection that focuses on low-cost investments.











Portfolio management

Performance reporting to help keep your investment committee informed.
Investment reviews that provide insightsinto your DB portfolio and the broader market and economic environment.
Daily funded status monitor that flags funded status changes or when a trigger spelled out in our dynamic investment policy statement has been reached to change the asset allocation according to the plan's glide path.








Research & expertise

Investment expertise and commentary on financial issues that provide context for your decision-making.
Investment committee best practices that are designed to increase your group's effectiveness. 





Notes:

Advice services offered through Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services are provided by Vanguard Advisers, Inc., a registered investment advisor.
All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.

Company History






The BT Investment Management business was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in 2007 as a specialist investment manager with a history of managing and creating wealth for clients for over 45 years. The business was originally established in 1969 as Ord-BT Ltd and became fully owned by Bankers Trust Company (New York) in 1978 when it changed its name to BT Australia Ltd. BT Australia became known as a progressive, innovative and successful organisation offering investment banking, equities and fund management services to domestic and overseas clients. BT’s long history of strong investment performance and client service made it one of the most successful funds management businesses in Australia and one of the most recognised brands in the investment industry. In the late 1990’s following the takeover of Deutsche Bank for the Bankers Trust Corporation, BT Australia went through a series of ownership changes involving Deutsche Bank and then US-based Principal Financial Group (Principal) in August 1999. In 2002, Westpac acquired BT Financial Group (BTFG) from Principal including the funds management division. Also folded into the BT funds management business at the time were the Rothschild Asset Management and Westpac Investment Management businesses. In 2007 the investment management arm of the broader BT Financial Group listed as a separate investment management business as BT Investment Management (BTIM) with Westpac retaining majority ownership. The establishment of a specialist investment management business provides for a business model that attracts and retains superior investment talent aligned to providing sustained investment performance for clients. In 2011 BTIM expanded offshore by acquiring J O Hambro Capital Management (JOHCM) a London based boutique active equity manager. In 2015 Westpac reduced its holding to approximately 31%, providing increased size and diversity of BTIM’s shareholder base, an increased free float resulting in greater liquidity of BTIM shares and eligibility for consideration in key market indices. In 2017 Westpac further reduced its holding to approximately 10% and announced its intention to sell its remaining holding by May 2018.
BTIM’s relationship with Westpac remains strong and mutually beneficial.

About


Corporate Approach






Investment-led multi-boutique approach
Investment management is our core business. We combine a strong institutional platform with an investment-led culture to achieve strong risk-adjusted returns for our investors via our ‘multi-boutique’ approach. BT Investment Management Limited (BTIM) is one of the largest ASX-listed pure investment managers (ASX:BTT), with a market capitalisation of around $3.13 billion and funds under management of $91.2 billion as at 31 March 2017. The BT Investment Management Board consists of a majority of independent directors.  Staff of BTIM and J O Hambro Capital Management (our wholly owned subsidiary) are significant equity holders along with institutional and retail investors.  
Multi-boutique model
The BTIM Group follows a ’multi-boutique’ business model, where teams of investment professionals focus exclusively on asset management while distribution, compliance, business and general management functions are delivered centrally. The model is designed to provide the best of both worlds. Fund managers operate in a boutique environment where they maintain full autonomy over their investment approaches and share in the economic value that they create for clients, combined with the strength of a significant institution with a strong operational platform (brand, distribution, compliance, sales and marketing, back office). Boutiques also share information, giving each the benefit of expert views from other asset classes. All our investment teams and those in the central functions receive a portion of their variable pay in BT Investment Management (BTT) equity. This directly aligns our people with the broader shareholder base and links all to the success of the investment performance delivered to clients. Take a look at our investment capabilities here.   
J O Hambro Capital Management
Our wholly owned subsidiary, J O Hambro Capital Management (JOHCM), is a boutique investment management business with offices in London, Singapore, New York and Boston specialising in the active management of equities. JOHCM manages assets of $39.9 billion as at 30 September 2016.

About


Corporate Governance






Corporate Governance Overview
BTIM’s commitment to exceeding industry standards means we actively maintain corporate governance policies across every aspect of our operations.
BTIM’s corporate governance policies are considered in light of the ASX Corporate Governance Council’s Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (Third Edition) and other relevant standards or guidelines.
 
2015 Corporate Governance Statement
Each year BTIM publishes a Corporate Governance Statement which outlines BTIM’s corporate governance framework and policies.
Click here to view BTIM’s 2015 Corporate Governance Statement.
 
Board & Committees
The Board of BTIM has adopted a Board Charter which sets out its roles and responsibilities.
To assist in the execution of its duties and responsibilities, the Board has established the following committees, each of which has its own charter:

Audit & Risk Management Committee; and
Remuneration & Nominations Committee.

The Board may also establish other committees from time to time if required.
 
Market Disclosure Policy
BTIM has adopted a Market Disclosure Policy designed to assist BTIM in keeping the market fully informed and in meeting its continuous disclosure obligations under the ASX Listing Rules.
 
Compliance Policies
BTIM has adopted a set of policies to promote transparency, fair dealing and the protection of stakeholder interests. These include;
 
Code of Conduct Policy
BTIM has adopted a Code of Conduct Policy which applies to all employees and Directors. The Code of Conduct requires all employees and Directors to observe high standards of corporate and individual behaviour in the context of their employment. The Code provides that employees and Directors should:

act with honesty and integrity
respect the law and act accordingly
respect confidentiality and do not misuse information
value and maintain their professionalism
appropriately manage conflicts of interest

 
Conflicts of Interest Policy
BTIM has adopted a Conflicts of Interest Policy, which is intended to identify, monitor and manage conflicts of interest. The policy sets out the procedure for managing potential conflicts, including procedures relating to:




participation in activities that involve an actual or perceived conflict with duties and responsibilities to BTIM or transactions which are prejudicial to BTIM;
participation in dealings that involve an actual or perceived conflict with the interests of a customer or a position which unfairly puts the interests of one customer before another’s, regardless of the size or nature of that relationship;
where acting as a trustee, ensuring that employees make decisions in that capacity having regard to the fiduciary obligation to act in the best interests of the fund members; and
acting in accordance with the terms of BTIM’s investment mandates.





Trading in BTT Securities Policy
BTIM has adopted a Trading Policy (known as the Trading in BTT Securities Policy). This policy governs trading in BTT Securities by Directors and employees.
BTIM has also adopted a Personal Account Trading Policy which governs trading in other securities by Directors and employees. These policies set out the applicable laws and procedures to be followed when dealing and trading in securities (including notification and clearance procedures).
Directors and employees are not permitted to deal in any securities (including shares in BTIM) where the individual is in the possession of price sensitive information which is not generally available to the market, and must not provide such price sensitive information to other persons (including fellow employees) who may use such information to trade in securities. In addition, employees must not trade in BTIM’s Shares or other securities during a specified blackout period. These blackout periods occur 4-6 weeks prior to the Company’s half year or year end results or its quarterly announcements in relation to funds under management. There are limited exceptions for acquisitions pursuant to employee share or option plans.
If a Director deals in BTIM’s shares, BTIM must advise the ASX within five business days, in accordance with the Corporations Act and the Listing Rules.

Why the BT Investment Management Share Price Blasted Off on Friday Money Morning 10/04/2015What Happened to BT Investment Management Ltd’s Share Price?
Shares in global fund manager BT Investment Management Ltd [ASX:BTT] soared by a massive 7% on Friday, strongly outpacing a resilient Aussie stock market. Today’s price action caps a sensational 12 months for BT, which has seen its share price rise by 50% over the past year.
Why Did This Happen to BTT Shares?
This morning BT revealed that its funds under management (FUM) grew solidly in the three months to March. At the end of 2014, BT’s FUM sat at $70 billion. FUM has now grown beyond $77 billion. BT said the quarter’s inflows will boost fee income by $11.5m this year.
This shows us the business is performing well and raises the scope for a stronger dividend payment. That’s why investors were happy to bid the stock up well in Friday’s trading.
What Now for BT Investment Management Ltd?
BT remains in a strong position to continue growing its business. Its investment in global distribution and product development should support profit and share price growth.
But you can’t expect BT’s share price to keep growing at the remarkable rate of the past 12 months. Things could get tougher for BT investors into the back half of 2015.
If you’ve got the right tolerance for risk, you can find even attractive businesses in the small-cap end of the Aussie stock market. If you’re seeking big potential rewards from exciting stocks that trade now for mere cents, go here to find out more.
Cheers, Tim Dohrmann

Options ‘Black Book’: 30 Year Stock Market Veteran’s Complete Guide to Profitably Trading Options on the ASX


If recent jitters on the Aussie stock market have you worried about your portfolio. This guide is for you. Because once you understand how to trade options, you can use this powerful cash-generating tool to collect extra-income from the ASX anytime you want. And in this special investor guide you’ll learn the (jargon free) truth about trading options for profit on the ASX.

The (jargon-free) truth about trading options for profit: Have you wanted to learn how to trade options in the past but you were put-off by all the complex ‘trader talk’ surrounding this powerful cash-generating tool? You’re not alone. It seems like most of the books and courses written on options require you to have a finance degree just to understand the contents page. This report is different. Matt shows you how to start trading options profitably as soon as today…without all the confusing and complicated jargon.
How to profit from a stock price crash: When you buy stocks, there’s only one way you can profit — when stock prices rise. On the other hand when you trade a particular type of option contract (that Matt reveals in the report) you can profit even if the stock price falls. That’s the power of trading options. No matter what direction stock prices take you can still make money!
How to buy and sell exchange traded options (a case study): You’ve learnt a couple of options strategies and now you’re ready to try your hand at trading options. Question is, how do you actually buy and sell options on the open market? Well, in the ‘Options Black Book’ guide Matt walks you through a case study of how trade both ‘call’ and ‘put’ options.

1. About 
BT Investment Management Limited is one of the largest ASX-listed pure investment managers with a market capitalisation of around $2.73 billion and funds under management of $84.0 billion as at 30 September 2016. Investing is the Company’s only business and it operates a multi-boutique structure that provides for a full investment autonomy. BT Investment does not subscribe to a ‘house view’ and allows the freedom for each boutique to apply discretion in determining its investment process and philosophy and hence there is no influence from management on any investment decision.[1]

9. Risk 
Major risks include[12]
 
The Board has identified the following key business risks for the 2016 Financial Year:
 
Strategic Execution
The risk associated with the failure to effectively execute the Group’s strategy. Risk that the strategy does not produce the expected results.
 
People and Talent Management
The risk of loss of key personnel which may lead to an adverse effect on business growth and/or the retention of existing business.
 
Complexity and Pace of Change in regulation
Risk that the Group will not be able to effectively respond to a change in laws and regulation which could materially affect the Group.
 
Compliance
This risk of the Group not complying with laws, regulations, contracts, industry codes, internal standards and policies applicable to the Group’s operations.
 
Outsourced Service Providers
The risk of loss from failing to manage the Group’s key outsourced service providers whereby services provided by external parties are not conducted in line with the respective service level agreement.
 
Acquisitions
Risk that an acquisition is a strategic failure and adversely impacts other parts of the Group.
 
Information Security
The risk that investors or the Group may suffer service disruptions, or that investors or the Group may incur losses arising from system defects such as failures, faults or incompleteness in computer operations, or illegal or unauthorised use of computer systems, including cyber crime.
 
Investment Performance
The risk of loss of revenue resulting from ineffective investment strategies resulting in sustained underperformance relative to benchmarks and peers.
 
Market
The risk of an adverse impact on earnings resulting from changes in market conditions, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates or equity markets.
 
Financial
The risk of financial loss arising from the Group’s activities in the financial and investment markets.
 
Operational
The risk arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems or from external events.
 
Currency Risk
The risk associated with sustaining losses by having earnings, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Australian Dollar.
 
Market risk
The BTIM Group may take on exposure to market risks which include securities price and interest rate risk due to the nature of its investments and liabilities. The key direct risks are driven by investment and market volatility which have a resulting impact on the funds under management (FUM) of the BTIM Group. A reduction in FUM will reduce management fee income, calculated as a percentage of FUM, and consequently reduce NPAT.
 
Price risk
The BTIM Group is exposed to securities’ price risk. This arises from both FUM and investments directly held by the BTIM Group for which prices in the future are uncertain. The majority of the BTIM Group's revenue consists of fees derived from FUM. Exposure to securities price risk could result in fluctuations in FUM that would impact the BTIM Group's profitability. Exposure to price risk also exists from directly held equity securities in funds managed by JOHCM . The directly held securities consist of shares in unlisted companies and other investments.
 
Interest rate risk 
The BTIM Group is subject to interest rate risk, which impacts both the BTIM Group's FUM and the BTIM Group's cash balances and borrowings. This risk is managed through asset/liability management strategies that seek to limit the impact arising from interest rate movements.
 
Foreign exchange risk
The BTIM Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the BTIM Group’s functional currency.
 
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to perform contractual obligations, either in whole or in part under a contract. Credit risk exposures are monitored regularly with all BTIM Group counterparties. The major counterparties are The Westpac Group, Bank of Scotland, the funds for which BTIM and JOHCM are the fund managers as well as outstanding receivables including credit exposures to wholesale and institutional clients.
 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the BTIM Group may not be able to meet its financial obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost. The BTIM Group maintains sufficient cash and working capital in order to meet future obligations and statutory regulatory capital requirements.

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.

Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
