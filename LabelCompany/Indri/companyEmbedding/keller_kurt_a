Item Description: 2014. Hard Cover with dust jacket. Book Condition: New. Collector Bookstore is a retailer of new books located in Leavenworth, Kansas. We specialize in price guides and reference books for the antiques and collectibles industry. In this massive volume, the Keller brothers continue their excellent series on US Army Patches and insignia. This book represents the culmination of over 15 years of study and collecting on this subject alone. The level of research and attention to detail is unparalleled for this area of specialization. To ensure accuracy, the authors have invested thousands of hours of investigation on this subject matter. In addition, they have consulted collectors and historians with literally hundreds of years of experience between them. Over 300 period images, 1400 insignia and the authors' keen forensic eye have produced what is likely the most detailed, accurate and complete book on this subject to date. Government and military archives, Veterans associations and some of the finest private collections of Airborne insignia in the world were utilized to ensure the best of everything was represented. A number of new and obscure identifications are detailed and documented for the first time within these pages. Starting with shoulder patches (SSI), this work also covers pocket patches, overseas cap patches, ovals (background trimmings) and finally, miscellaneous airborne related insignia. This accounts for every facet of Airborne cloth insignia, approved and unapproved, worn by US paratroopers. The material depicted spans the period from the early days of WWII up to about 1965 and the beginning of US involvement in Vietnam. Also included is a detailed guide which will help collectors determine the country of origin for theater made insignia. Covers all cloth US Airborne insignia from World War 2 to the mid 1960's; contains over 1400 insignia plus more than 300 period photographs of soldiers wearing insignia.

							We like the rack and found that it is well made.  It fit well on the car and looks good.  The only complaint is that the bolts that attach it to the crossbars stick up too high.  If you screw it on enough to hold it tight, the bolts are so high that anything you put in the rack gets poked or scratched by the bolts.

							So far it works well,I had one issue while putting it together one of the screws stripped , not really a big deal I won't need to disassemble it , I'm using it to put some of my pool equipment in it so it is working out fine for me.

I think a spring and rod locking system to prevent the ball from rotating into the j system would have added a little more security.  I'm sure it was tested to make sure it won't decouple."
