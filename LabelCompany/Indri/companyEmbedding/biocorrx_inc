        	About        







About
A Company That Changes Lives
BioCorRx® is a leading edge healthcare solutions company focused on improving the lives of those struggling with alcohol and opioid addiction. Designed to treat alcoholism and certain opioid addictions, the BioCorRx® Recovery Program is used by a network of independently owned and operated treatment centers located throughout the United States. The program consists of a proprietary long-lasting implant of the FDA approved medication, naltrexone, which is proven to substantially reduce cravings for drugs and alcohol. It's a high-quality, comprehensive and cost- effective recovery program built on a strong foundation of experience and practice, allowing for an improved quality of life for recovering addicts.
What Makes the BioCorRx® Recovery Program Different?
Our innovative, non-addictive, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) program, uses a two-pronged approach that addresses the underlying physical and behavioral issues of alcohol and opioid addiction. Studies have shown that long-term success is more likely when intensive counseling is paired with specific medications such as Naltrexone, that reduce the urge to use.
Our two-pronged approach includes:
A highly effective, proprietary implant formulation of the FDA-approved medication, naltrexone, for which we hold the worldwide rights (except in Australia and New Zealand).
A proprietary modular counseling program that is tailored specifically to help those afflicted with addiction and prepares them for a life without their desired substance.
This approach of medication plus tailored support typically results in lower patient drop-out rates due to reduced cravings for a longer period of time since the medication is delivered automatically. The program can be done very discreetly on an outpatient basis with virtually no major disruptions from daily life.

Support
Support When it Matters Most
The BioCorRx® Recovery Program is a one of a kind comprehensive outpatient, non-addictive medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for alcohol and opioid addictions.
A Unique Opportunity for Addiction Treatment Centers
Our program consists of two main components:

Medical intervention (known as advanced medication administration) in the form of a minor procedure to implant naltrexone pellets (typically one or two)
Psychosocial intervention in the form of one-on-one, structured behavioral counseling followed by peer-support

What we Bring to the Table
Our supportive matrix offers not only positive outcomes for patients, but a whole new area of expansion and practice building for the physicians and treatment centers that partner with us. We provide the expert guidance, consultation support, access to the naltrexone implant, screening and certification of counselors, a full support and tracking program, and best practice protocols for every segment of treatment. Our virtual back office contains written protocols, video tutorials and education, along with customizable patient forms that are being used by other practices.
We facilitate access to the naltrexone implant and the psychosocial components of the program including:

Locating/screening/certifying licensed recovery counselors if needed
Pairing counselors to your practice
Transition protocol to peer support aftercare program
Access and processing orders for the implant from the pharmacy that produces the proprietary naltrexone pellets for your patients

A Simple Procedure that (Im)Plants Seeds of Hope
Specifically formulated and biodegradable, the naltrexone pellets are typically inserted just beneath the skin in the lower abdominal area. On average, the implant procedure takes less than 30 minutes.

Market Opportunity :: BioCorRx, Inc. (BICX)















 
































        	About        







Market Opportunity
Addressing Unmet Challenges in Addiction Treatment
We have created the BioCorRx® Recovery Program to address some of the biggest, previously unmet challenges related to addiction treatment: the low rates of long-term sobriety. One study, for example, found that only 46% of addicts who attended a residential treatment program managed to stay in recovery (only about 40% of that number managed to stay completely clean and sober).
An elegantly simple solution to reduce cravings
In the past, treatment has been focused on the emotional needs and behaviors associated with addiction while ignoring or underutilizing pharmacological solutions that go to the heart of addiction: the intense craving to use.
A real illness requires real medication
It is much like telling a diabetic, who should be prescribed insulin, to rely solely on nutrition and exercise without giving them the medications they need to actually treat their medical condition.
BioCorRx® is uniquely poised to gain significant market share of the $35 billion annual treatment market in the US.
Addiction by the Numbers

38 million Americans are heavy drinkers, according to the CDC
Per the CDC, more than 12% of the population are alcohol dependent
23.5 million American adults are addicted to drugs and or alcohol
100 Americans die from preventable overdose every day, per the CDC
770% increase in those seeking treatment for opioid addiction in the last 15 years
In 2010, more than 12 million people reported using pain killers non-medically
85% of the people with alcohol abuse or dependence go untreated
Heroin is the most widely used opiate, with more than 900,000 estimated users

What We Bring to a Vast, Untapped Market

Innovative Approach - Combines medication with supportive behavioral management.
Trending Market Opportunity - We were recently featured in USA Today, The Doctor Oz Show, MSNBC and many other local news segments across the country.
Exclusive Worldwide Rights - We have the worldwide rights (except in Australia and New Zealand) to a highly effective, proprietary implant formulation of the FDA-approved drug, Naltrexone.
Other Formulas - We are currently developing a patent pending injectable naltrexone product as well as another naltrexone implant formula recently acquired in 2016.
Proprietary Counseling Program - We have developed a proprietary 16-session counseling program identifying 35 key areas specific to the treatment of patients on long term naltrexone and have available a growing network of counselors nationwide certified to deliver the program.
$35 Billion Market in the U.S. Alone - We are uniquely poised to gain significant market share.
Rapid Expansion Possibilities - We intend to introduce and distribute the BioCorRx® Recovery Program to a new independent treatment center in the U.S. every 30 days or sooner.

Innovation = Unparalleled Growth Opportunity
By partnering with independently owned treatment centers throughout the U.S., we are leveraging brick and mortar already established. The benefits of the innovative BioCorRx® Recovery Program include:

Long lasting medication - Our implanted naltrexone product has been shown to last several months, depending on individual metabolism rates.
Dramatically increased compliance - The automatic dosing removes the need for routine medication while preventing abuse.
Increased dignity and privacy via discreet treatment - Other treatment solutions are notorious for a lack of privacy.
No major life disruptions - The consequences of life disruptions may discourage addicts from seeking treatment; our program requires virtually no downtime from daily life and routines.

BioCorRx Inc. Announces BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals Subsidiary; Forms Joint Steering Committee for Injectable Naltrexone Technology



 Download as PDF

August 31, 2016

Completes First Milestone in License Agreement With TheraKine Ltd.
LOS ANGELES, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 08/31/16 -- 
 BioCorRx Inc. (OTC PINK: BICX) (the "Company"), developer of the BioCorRx® Recovery Program, a medication-assisted treatment (MAT) program, announced today the formation of a new subsidiary, BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals, in conjunction with the company's Development, Commercialization and License Agreement with TheraKine Ltd. for exclusive worldwide rights, licenses and sublicensing to patented and patent pending TheraKine technology for sustained release naltrexone delivery.
BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals will focus on development and commercialization activities of the technology for an injectable naltrexone with the potential to deliver therapeutic levels of naltrexone for 30 days subcutaneously and/or for a few months intramuscularly. The subsidiary will also be used to do further work on the company's naltrexone implant product(s).
"Moving forward with our development of a new injectable naltrexone product and R&D initiative involving the implant, it made strategic sense to create a new subsidiary to handle these initiatives, separate from our operational company which will continue distributing the BioCorRx Recovery Program," said Brady Granier, CEO of BioCorRx.
In addition, the Company has assembled an expert team to form a Joint Steering Committee (JSC) for the injectable, which marks the first milestone completion for the license agreement with TheraKine.
Members of the JSC from BioCorRx include Brady Granier, President/CEO, Director and Dr. David Gastfriend, Medical Consultant. In his prior roll as Vice President at Alkermes, Dr. Gastfriend worked on pivotal efficacy studies and research on effectiveness, health services, criminal justice systems and health economics. Dr. Gastfriend has accrued extensive experience in the field of addiction treatment at institutions such as Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Psychiatry, The Treatment Research Institute and the American Society of Addiction Medicine.
Joining the committee from TheraKine, will be Scott Hampton, Founder & COO of TheraKine BioDelivery GmbH, and Dr. Andreas Voigt, Chief Scientist of TheraKine BioDelivery GmbH.
Scott is responsible for establishing drug delivery and medical device research and development groups. He also drives patent strategy, supports business development/partnering programs and fund raising. Scott is also the co-founder of Atlanta Catheter Technologies (ACT, USA), started in 2009.
Prior to TheraKine, Dr. Voigt was co-founder and CSO of Capsulution Pharma AG and worked at the Max-Planck-Institute for Colloid and Interface Research, Berlin/Potsdam. Dr. Voigt has published 60 publications and holds 35 patents and received a PhD from Humboldt-University of Berlin.
"We've assembled an outstanding team with decades of experience to accomplish our first milestone in our partnership with TheraKine," said Mr. Granier. "As we continue on the path to final development of a new injectable naltrexone product based on TheraKine's technology, this committee will oversee, review and coordinate all activities in our development plan, including validation studies in humans, and ultimately commercial deployment. We look forward to updating our shareholders soon as work on the formula has been underway for several weeks already."
About BioCorRx

BioCorRx, Inc. Strengthens Product-Market Growth With New Contract - Jana B | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Jana B's Bloglong/short equity, value, Growth, small-capSend MessagePlease Note: Blog posts are not selected, edited or screened by Seeking Alpha editors.BioCorRx, Inc. Strengthens Product-Market Growth With New ContractSep.  3, 2014 10:08 AM ET|Includes: BioCorRx Inc. (BICX)

Addiction rehabilitation leader BioCorRx, Inc. (OTCQB: BICX), developer of the Start Fresh Program, has announced that it has entered an agreement with BioWyze LLC in a move to strengthen its product-market growth in its niche, a new company statement said.
BioWyze will be assisting BioCorRx, Inc. in product development and market penetration strategies starting on September 8, 2014. The company has extensive experience providing solutions to companies in the biotech, pharma, medical device and clinical research sectors.
Under the agreement, BioCorRx, Inc. will be working directly with BioWyze's team of marketing veterans including Jeff Bagshaw, Richard Maloy, Tobin Geatz, Jeff Reiniche, Vicky Robinson, and Grace Granato.
"We look forward to this strategic relationship with the BioWyze team. BioCorRx can benefit greatly from their expertise with many well-respected corporations in a wide variety of fields and specialties," BioCorRx, Inc. CEO Kent Emry said in the statement.
"BioCorRx is entering an exciting growth phase of its business, and we are honored to have been selected by the leadership team to support their strategic corporate goals. Initially, our efforts will focus on establishing scalable business processes while optimizing current business," Jeff Bagshaw, BioWyze Managing Partner said of the partnership.
"Supporting our licensees' expansion within their served market is a priority and will be an important function moving forward, as will be the identification of other expansion verticals along with the development of technology solutions," he added.
Bagshaw has over 25 years of experience in clinical development, sales, marketing and product commercialization in health care. His experience includes leadership roles at contract research company Inclinix, Inc., and Hoffman La Roche, Bristol Myers Squibb and Exact Sciences.
Maloy, a principal of the company, lends his 20 years of experience in brand management, sales and trading in pharmaceuticals to Biowyze. His most notable work as of late is the development of Warner Chilcott.
Geatz, another principal at BioWyze, is also a seasoned pharmaceutical and biotech leader. He was a Special General Partner at Aurora Funds II, and founder and chairman of the board of Pharmatech Solutions. He has been a CEO of five private companies, according to the press release. (Read more about the company's principals here.)
BioCorRx, Inc. is one of the fastest growing companies in the substance abuse treatment sector.
The company is widely known for its Start Fresh Program, a two-tiered program that takes a different approach to addiction rehabilitation. The first phase of the program involves an outpatient medical procedure to embed a specially formulated, biodegradable naltrexone implant under the skin and fatty tissue in the lower abdominal area.
The second tier of the program involves a private, one-on-one coaching program to address the specific needs of the individual and to help him or her plan for a life free from substance abuse.
According to its website, the company has a huge upside potential and has the ability to corner a "significant market share of the $22 billion annual alcohol treatment market" in the United States.
For more information on BioCorRx, Inc.'s Start Fresh Program, you may reach the company's headquarters via phone: 714-462-4880, or email: info@BioCorRx.com.

	Leading Edge Addiction Treatment Programs




About 
	BioCorRx Inc.


www.biocorrx.com
BioCorRx, Inc. is 
	a healthcare solutions development company on the leading edge of addiction 
	treatment programs. The company currently owns an addiction treatment 
	program called the Start Fresh Program (SFP) that is used by various 
	independently owned licensed addiction clinics throughout the United States. 
	The company is currently working on other treatment programs and products 
	that will focus on other health issues and addictions.

 

The Start Fresh 
	Program (SFP) consists of two components:

1) BioCorRx has 
	the worldwide rights (except in Australia and New Zealand) to a highly 
	effective, proprietary implant compound of the FDA-approved drug, naltrexone. 
	After being surgically implanted by a medical professional, the naltrexone 
	implant significantly reduces cravings for alcohol and opioids for as long 
	as a year in some patients, depending on individual metabolism rates. 
	Furthermore, once the implant has dissolved, a vast majority of patients are 
	pleased to discover that their physical cravings continue to remain greatly 
	reduced or even eliminated.

 

2) BioCorRx also 
	owns a life coaching program that is tailored specifically to alcoholics and 
	other addictions. Once a patient has received the implant, they are 
	encouraged to enter the life coaching program to maximize results.

 

BioCorRx�s 
	revolutionary treatment program (SFP) has an 85% success rate as reported by 
	patients that complete the program in routine telephone and face to face 
	interviews conducted by the independently owned and operated clinics using 
	the SFP. The implant is administered as an outpatient procedure, and in most 
	cases, patients do not need to miss more than one day of work. They are then 
	able to enter the private life coaching program without co-workers or family 
	members knowing, unless they so choose.

Interview conducted by: Lynn Fosse, Senior 
	Editor, CEOCFO Magazine, Published � March 31, 2014
 


CEOCFO: 
	Ms. Felix, what attracted you to the BioCorRx?



Ms. Felix: 
	What initially attracted me to the company was the help that they were 
	giving to the people addicted to alcohol through the Start Fresh Program. 
	During my entire career in the accounting and financial industry, I had 
	always envisioned myself wrapping up the last 10 to 15 years of my career in 
	an industry that gave back to individual people in need. I feel that 
	BioCorRx Inc. is that right place. I have been with BioCorRx Inc. now for 
	about a year and a half and I am very excited with the medical technology 
	that the company continues to develop and provide to people suffering from 
	alcohol and now other addictions across the United States. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	What is the BioCorRx approach to the problem?


Ms. Felix: 
	The approach to the problem is what makes our Company unique; we have a 
	rehabilitation program which includes the use of a proprietary formula in 
	the form of a Naltrexone implant. It is implanted in the patient right 
	underneath the skin and it releases therapeutic levels of the medication 
	over an extended period of time that helps to block the pleasure effects of 
	the alcohol and opioids. Most patients report that they do not have any 
	cravings, almost immediately after the procedure.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What is it releasing? 


Ms. Felix: 
	The implant is a proprietary formulation consisting of the FDA approved drug 
	Naltrexone that was cleared by the FDA for the treatment of alcoholism in 
	1995. The implant has been able to help patients tremendously in reducing 
	their cravings for alcohol and opioids as well.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Has a similar approach been tried in the past?


Ms. Felix: 
	Yes, there are other Naltrexone implants out there. Our research shows that 
	they typically last up to 3 months. Our implant has been reported to last 
	anywhere from 6 to 12 months, depending on the person�s metabolism and other 
	factors. This is the superior advantage that the Start Fresh Program has 
	over any other Addiction Programs out there.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Are there any potential side effects?


Mr. Felix: 
	Patients report soreness around the area after the medical procedure. 
	Typically, the person can go back to work the next day. There is some 
	discomfort but nothing very significant. Some patients may report 
	inflammation around the surgery site and in rare cases, infection can occur 
	as with any other medical procedure. Other side effects from Naltrexone 
	itself can be found on our website FAQ section.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Who would be a typical candidate for the procedure or is it virtually good 
	across the board?


Ms. Felix: 
	I do not know the correct answer for who would be the correct candidate. 
	What we do know is that there is a multitude of family members who�s loved 
	ones are afflicted with alcoholism and other addictions and are seeking help 
	for them as well as the individuals themselves. The physicians treating the 
	people with this disease are familiar with the parameters and who would be a 
	perfect candidate for the Start Fresh Program. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	Would you tell us about the coaching part of the program?


Ms. Felix: 
	What we have is the Start Fresh program, which consists of the Naltrexone 
	implant but the program also includes a coaching portion of the program. The 
	coaching portion is vitally important. The implant procedure and the 
	coaching go hand and hand. The coaching part of the program will help 
	address the psycho-social issues that possibly led the person to drink to 
	begin with. It gives them time and clarity to address the mental aspect of 
	the demons they are probably dealing with. The clinics report back that 
	their patients have an 85% success rate if they complete the program. This 
	two-prong approach is what makes our program so successful.

 


CEOCFO: 
	How do you reach clinics that may want to use the Start Fresh programs and 
	what has been the general reception from that community?


Ms. Felix: 
	The predominant business model that we employ is the licensing of our Start 
	Fresh Program in U.S. territories that desire to implement, use and 
	distribute our program. We currently have five licensed clinics that use the 
	Start Fresh program in the U.S. We will speak to anyone in the medical 
	community that has an interest in our program. 

 


CEOCFO: What 
	you are talking with someone, do they understand the concept easily or are 
	there some objections you need to overcome?


Ms. Felix: 
	The fortunate part for us is that the very first licensed clinic in Santa 
	Ana has been treating patients for 4 years now so the success rate speaks 
	for itself. The medical director is familiar with the program. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	Why the change of name from Fresh Start to BioCorRx?


Ms. Felix: 
	We decided to change the name to reflect our new vision which consists of 
	adding more programs and product lines in the near future. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	Are you funded for the steps you would like to take next and will you be 
	seeking additional funding?


Ms. Felix: 
	Funding is something that we are always addressing and considering for our 
	projected future growth. At the moment our current business model has 
	enabled us to secure enough resources to maintain a steady business. We are 
	now poised for a continued expansion and will seek funding as needed.

 


CEOCFO: 
	How do you get the public to learn about what you are doing?
Ms. Felix: The licensed clinics 
	do marketing and advertising at the clinic level. BioCorRx has launched a 
	National TV campaign in an effort to create awareness about the Start Fresh 
	Program. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	Put it together for our readers. Why consider BioCorRx?


Ms. Felix: 
	BioCorRx has a unique program that directly addresses alcoholism and opioid 
	addiction with a reported 85% success rate. Patients report that quote, 
	unquote, �This was a miracle.� This is something that saved their life, 
	their family, saved their relationship with their spouse. We hear these kind 
	of stories nonstop from our licensed clinics and that their patients say 
	that they are astounded with the program. These patient testimonials are 
	what motivate us to continue to search for other products and programs to 
	add to our product line and help those afflicted with addiction.

February 23, 2017


ANAHEIM, CA / ACCESSWIRE / February 23, 2017 / BioCorRx Inc. (OTC PINK: BICX) (the "Company"), a developer and provider of advanced solutions in the treatment of alcohol and opioid addictions, today provided an update on the preclinical development of BICX101, a new sustained release injectable naltrexone product for the treatment of substance abuse addiction, via a webcast that is available on the News & Media section ("Presentation" subpage) of the Company's website: www.BioCorRx.com.
Brady Granier, President, CEO and Director, stated, "We're very excited about the preclinical studies thus far." He further stated that the company anticipates submitting a request for a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA sometime in the middle of March with the actual meeting anticipated to take place within 60 days from that request.
Dr. Balbir S. Brar, VP of Drug Development, commented, "We have screened a number of formulations that were produced by TheraKine and these formulations were tested in two phases of preclinical studies." He added, "We have selected a lead formulation which is very promising and will be tested in a number of variations in additional studies to be started very shortly. So far, the results are consistent with our goals." Brar also mentioned that the company hopes to complete the preclinical studies in 5 to 6 weeks and gain clearance for a 505(b)(2) 'fast-track' regulatory pathway which can shorten or even eliminate phases of the approval process. Dr. Brar provided a more detailed update on the Company's preclinical and regulatory activities in the webcast.
Dr. David Gastfriend, Medical Consultant to BioCorRx stated, "There is a market that has emerged. It is being developed and this desire to use injectable naltrexone has become established throughout the country. An improved formulation is a valuable addition to the medical armamentarium." In the webcast, Dr. Gastfriend discusses a number of additional anticipated benefits of BICX101 over the current approved products on the market.
