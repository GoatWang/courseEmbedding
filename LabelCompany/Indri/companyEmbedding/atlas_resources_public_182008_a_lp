Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group. Dominic M. • CLIENT5.0 Out of 5.0 Overall Superb Client Review RatingLawyers.com

                                         and its midstream subsidiary, Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. ("APL"), entered into definitive agreements to be acquired by Targa Resources Corp. and Targa Resources Partners LP, respectively. Immediately prior to the acquisition, Atlas Energy distributed to its unitholders 100% of the limited liability company interests in ARP's general partner, which changed its name to Atlas Energy Group, LLC ("New Atlas") and became a separate, publicly traded company as a result of the distribution. Following the distribution, New Atlas continues to hold the Partnership's business as well as ARP's general partner interest and incentive distribution rights, and now holds the non-midstream assets and ARP limited partner units previously held by Atlas Energy.  We have drilled and currently operate wells located in Pennsylvania, Tennessee Indiana, West Virginia and Ohio. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy (after February 27, 2015, New Atlas), for administrative services.  We intend to continue to produce our wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce, at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. We expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling.  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which primarily produce natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and/or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:  ? Well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;  ? Reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and  ? Preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials, and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials and a competitive charge for service performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well, to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of December 31, 2014, our MGP withheld $26,300 of net production revenue for this purpose.  MARKETS AND COMPETITION  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in gas and oil producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2014 and 2013, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Natural Gas. The MGP markets the majority of our natural gas production to gas marketers directly or to third-party plant operators who process and market the gas. The sales price of natural gas produced is a function of the market in the area and typically tied to a regional index. The production area and pricing indices for the Appalachian Basin are Dominion South Point, Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Transco Leidy Line.  We do not hold firm transportation obligations on any pipeline that requires payment of transportation fees regardless of natural gas production volumes. As is customary in certain of our other operating areas, we occasionally commit a predictable portion of monthly production to the purchaser in order to maintain a gathering agreement.  Crude Oil. Crude oil produced from our wells flows directly into leasehold storage tanks where it is picked up by an oil company or a common carrier acting for an oil company. The crude oil is typically sold at the prevailing spot market price for each region, less appropriate trucking charges. We do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.  Natural Gas Liquids. NGLs are extracted from the natural gas stream by processing and fractionation plants enabling the remaining "dry" gas to meet pipeline specifications for transport to end users or marketers operating on the receiving pipeline. The resulting dry natural gas is sold as described above and our NGLs are generally priced using the Mont Belvieu (TX) or Conway (KS) regional processing indices. The cost to process and fractionate the NGLs from the gas stream is typically either a volumetric fee for the gas and liquids processed or a volumetric retention by the processing and fractionation facility. We do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of NGLs in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.  For the year ended December 31, 2014, Chevron Natural Gas and Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC accounted for approximately 70% and 18%, respectively, of our total natural gas, oil and NGL production revenues, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of revenues for this period.  GENERAL TRENDS AND OUTLOOK  We expect our business to be affected by the following key trends. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.  The natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines during the fourth quarter of 2014 and early 2015, particularly in December 2014 and January 2015. The causes of these declines are based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, a significant increase in natural gas, oil and NGL production. While we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities over the long-term in the areas in which we operate, fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments in the development of new natural gas, oil and NGL reserves.  Our future gas and oil reserves, production, cash flow, our ability to make distributions to our unitholders, depend on our success in producing our current reserves efficiently. We face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas, oil and NGL prices. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, natural gas and oil production from particular wells decreases.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GAS AND OIL PRODUCTION: The following table sets forth information related to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated:   Years Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 3,936 $ 5,526 Oil 43 153 Liquids - 60 Total $ 3,979 $ 5,739 Production volumes: Gas (mcf/day) 3,064 3,975 Oil (bbls/day) 1 5 Liquids (bbls/day) - 4 Total (mcfe/day) 3,070 4,029 Average sales price: (1) Gas (per mcf) (2) $ 3.61 $ 4.21 Oil (per bbl) $ 92.96 $ 86.91 Liquids (per bbl) $ - $ 41.37 Production costs: As a percent of revenues 67 % 61 % Per mcfe $ 2.39 $ 2.39 Depletion per mcfe $ 1.55 $ 2.06  (1) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after reversing the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (2) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $102,400 and $576,000 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $3,936,400 and $5,526,200 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $1,589,800 (29%). The $1,589,800 decrease in natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to a $1,266,000 decrease in production volumes and a $323,800 decrease in natural gas prices after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions. Our production volumes decreased to 3,064 mcf per day for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 3,975 mcf per day for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of 911 (23%) mcf per day. The price we receive for our natural gas is primarily a result of the index driven agreements (See Item 1:  Oil Revenues. We drill wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $42,700 and $153,300 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $110,600 (72%). The $110,600 decrease in oil revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year was attributable to a $113,400 decrease in production volumes, partially offset by a $2,800 increase in oil prices after the effect of financial hedges. Our production volumes decreased to 1 bbl per day for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 5 bbls per day for the year ended December 31, 2013, a decrease of 4 bbls per day (80%).  Natural Gas Liquids Revenue. The majority of our wells produce "dry gas", which is composed primarily of methane and requires no additional processing before being transported and sold to the purchaser. Some wells, however, produce "wet gas", which contains larger amounts of ethane and other associated hydrocarbons (i.e. "natural gas liquids") that must be removed prior to transporting the gas. Once removed, these natural gas liquids are sold to various purchasers. Our natural gas liquids revenues were $59,300 for the year ended December 31, 2013. There were no natural gas liquid revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014.  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $2,679,200 and $3,509,700 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $830,500 (24%). This decrease was due to a combination of decreases in supervision fees and water hauling fees, and transportation costs which decreased due to the decline in revenue.  Depletion of our gas and oil properties as a percentage of gas and oil revenues was 44% and 53% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This change was primarily attributable to changes in gas and oil reserve quantities and to a lesser extent revenues, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of gas and oil properties.  General and administrative expenses were $180,500 and $201,600 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, a decrease of $21,100 (10%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP and vary from period to period due to the costs and services provided to us.  Impairment of gas and oil properties for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $13,776,200, net of $298,400 of unrealized derivative gains. There was no impairment of gas and oil properties for the year ended December 31, 2013. Annually, we compare the carrying value of our proved developed gas and oil producing properties to their estimated fair market value. To the extent our carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value, an impairment charge is recognized. As a result of this assessment, an impairment charge was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2014. This charge is based on reserve quantities, future market prices and our carrying value. We cannot provide any assurance that similar charges may or may not be taken in future periods.  Sale of Gas and Oil Properties. On December 30, 2013, the Partnership sold its gas and oil properties in the Antrim Shale geological formation mostly located in Michigan with a net book value of $1,341,200 for $1,003,800. Cash proceeds from the sale were distributed to the partnership unit holders in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement. As a result of the sale, $9,663,200 of gas and oil properties, $8,069,600 of accumulated depletion and impairment, and $252,400 of asset retirement obligations were removed from the partnership accounts resulting in a net loss of $337,400.  Liquidity and Capital Resources. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $994,900 for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $1,735,700 as compared to $2,730,600 for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net income before depletion, impairment, accretion and non-cash  Cash provided by investing activities was $1,001,200 for the year ended December 31, 2014, resulting from proceeds from the sale of miscellaneous tangible equipment of $1,100 and the proceeds from the sale of the Partnership's Michigan oil and gas properties of $1,003,800, partially offset by a purchase of tangible equipment of $3,700. Cash used in investing activities was $435,700 for the year ended December 31, 2013, resulting from the net of $15,100 in proceeds from the sale of tangible equipment and $450,800 for the purchase of tangible equipment.  Cash used in financing activities increased $988,900 to $3,159,600 for the year ended December 31, 2014, from $2,170,700 for the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due to an increase in cash distributions to partners.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Through December 31, 2014, our MGP withheld $26,300 of funds for this purpose. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow at any one time may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions, and we will not borrow from third-parties.  We are generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flow from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations.  Impairment  During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized an impairment expense of $13,776,200 related to gas and oil properties within property, plant, and equipment on our balance sheet, net of an offsetting gain from accumulated other comprehensive income of $298,500. This impairment related to the carrying amount of our gas and oil properties being in excess of our estimate of their fair value at December 31, 2014. The estimate of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by, among other factors, the deterioration of natural gas and oil prices. There was no impairment of oil and gas properties for the year ended December 31, 2013.  ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION  Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the release of regulated materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or human health or safety (See "Item 1:  Environmental laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years, and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes. Trends in environmental regulation include increased reporting obligations and placing more restrictions and limitations on activities, such as emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, generation and disposal of wastes, including wastes that may have naturally occurring radioactivity, and use, storage and handling of chemical substances that may impact human health, the environment and/or endangered species. Other increasingly stringent environmental restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and other similar businesses throughout the United States. It is possible that the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations may continue to increase. We will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly, but there can be no assurance that we will identify and properly anticipate each such change, or that our efforts will prevent material costs, if any, from rising.  CHANGES IN PRICES AND INFLATION  Our revenues and the value of our assets have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas and oil market prices. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict.  Inflation affects the operating expenses of our operations. Inflationary trends may occur if commodity prices were to increase, since such an increase may cause the demand for energy equipment and services to increase, thereby increasing the costs of acquiring or obtaining such equipment and services. While we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs, we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects.  SECURED HEDGE FACILITY  The MGP has a secured hedge facility agreement with a syndicate of banks under which the Partnership has the ability to enter into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to commodity price movements. Under the MGP's revolving credit facility the Partnership is required to utilize this secured hedge facility for future commodity risk management activity. The Partnership's obligations under the facility are secured by mortgages on its gas and oil properties and first priority security interests in substantially all of its assets and by a guarantee of the MGP. The MGP administers the commodity price risk management activity for the Partnership under the secured hedge facility. The secured hedge facility agreement contains covenants that limit the Partnership's ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make loans or investments, make distributions if a default under the secured hedge facility agreement exists or would result from the distribution, merge into or consolidate with other persons, enter into commodity or interest rate swap agreements that do not conform to specified terms or that exceed specified amounts, or engage in certain asset dispositions including a sale of all or substantially all of its assets. As of December 31, 2014 only the Partnership's natural gas swaps are included in the secured hedge facility.  In addition, it will be an event of default under the MGP's revolving credit facility if it, as our general partner, breaches an obligation governed by the secured hedge facility and the effect of such breach is to cause amounts owing under swap agreements governed by the secured hedge facility to become immediately due and payable.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of actual revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from the estimates on which our financial statements are prepared at any given point of time. Changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue and expense accruals, depletion and amortization, impairment, fair value of derivative instruments and the probability of forecasted transactions. We summarize our significant accounting policies within our financial statements (see "item 8:Financial Statements"), included in this report. The critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified are discussed below.  Depletion and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Long-Lived Assets. The cost of natural gas and oil properties, less estimated salvage value, is generally depleted on the units-of-production method.  Natural gas and oil properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is considered to be impaired when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount. The undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are based upon our estimates that rely on various assumptions, including natural gas and oil prices, production and operating expenses. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. As discussed in General Trends and Outlook within this section, recent increases in natural gas drilling have driven an increase in the supply of natural gas and put a downward pressure on domestic prices. Further declines in natural gas prices may result in additional impairment charges in future periods.  During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $13,776,200 of impairment within natural gas and oil properties, net of an offsetting gain from accumulated other comprehensive income of $298,500. There was no impairment recognized for the year ended December 31, 2013. The impairment related to the carrying amount of these gas and oil properties being in excess of our estimate of their fair value at December 31, 2014. The estimate of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by, among other factors, the deterioration of natural gas and oil prices at the date of measurement.  Events or changes in circumstances that would indicate the need for impairment testing include, among other factors: operating losses; unused capacity; market value declines; technological developments resulting in obsolescence; changes in demand for products manufactured by others utilizing our services or for our products; changes in competition and competitive practices; uncertainties associated with the United States and world economies; changes in the expected level of environmental capital, operating or remediation expenditures; and changes in governmental regulations or actions.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  We have established a hierarchy to measure our financial instruments at fair . . .  Mar 31, 2015  (c) 1995-2015 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)  Forward-Looking Statements  When used in this Form 10-Q, the words "believes", "anticipates," "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from the results stated or implied in this document. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to forward-looking statements which we may make to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  This Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and the Notes to our Financial Statements.  General  Atlas Resources Public #17-2008 (B) L.P. ("we", "us" or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership, formed on May 7, 2007 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and Operator ("Atlas Resources" or "MGP"). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. ("ARP") 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    ARP, -1.08%
 We have drilled and currently operate wells located in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Ohio. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy L.P. ("Atlas Energy"), for administrative services.  Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce natural gas and oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through third-party gas gathering systems. We do not plan to sell any of our wells and intend to produce them until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce, at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. We expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling.  Overview  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce primarily natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:   well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;   reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and   preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials, and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials, and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of March 31, 2013, our MGP had not withheld any funds for this purpose.  Markets and Competition  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2013 and 2012, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations The following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated: Three Months Ended March 31 2013 2012 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 1,634 $ 1,819 Oil 179 319 Liquids - 18 Total $ 1,813 $ 2,156 Production volumes: Gas (mcf/day) (1) 5,051 5,968 Oil (bbl/day) (1) 23 37 Liquids (bbl/day) (1) - 3 Total (mcfe/day) (1) 5,189 6,208 Average sales prices: (2) Gas (per mcf) (1) (3) $ 3.91 $ 3.71 Oil (per bbl) (1) (4) $ 85.31 $ 93.85 Liquids (per bbl) (1) $ - $ 62.79 Production costs: As a percent of revenues 55 % 52 % Per mcfe (1) $ 2.13 $ 1.98 Depletion per mcfe $ 1.86 $ 1.78  (1) "Mcf" represents thousand cubic feet, "mcfe" represents thousand cubic feet equivalent, and "bbl" represents barrels. Bbl is converted to mcfe using the ratio of six mcfs to one bbl.  (2) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after adjusting for the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (3) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $142,500 and $195,200 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  (4) Average oil prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $100 for the three months ended March 31, 2012.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $1,633,600 and $1,818,600 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $185,000 (10%). The $185,000 decrease in natural gas revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $296,400 decrease in production volumes, partially offset by a $111,400 increase in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which was driven by market conditions. Our production volumes decreased to 5,051 mcf per day for the three months ended March 31, 2013 from 5,968 mcf per day for the three months ended March 31, 2012, a decrease of 917 mcf per day (15%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the three months ended March 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well.  Oil Revenues. We drill wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $178,800 and $319,600 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $140,800 (44%). The $140,800 decrease in oil revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $122,900 decrease in production volumes and a $17,900 decrease in oil prices after the effect of financial hedges. Our production volumes decreased to 23 bbls per day for the three months ended March 31, 2013 from 37 bbls per day for the three months ended March 31, 2012, a decrease of 14 bbls per day (38%).  Table of Contents  Natural Gas Liquids Revenue. The majority of our wells produce "dry gas", which is composed primarily of methane and requires no additional processing before being transported and sold to the purchaser. Some wells, however, produce "wet gas", which contains larger amounts of ethane and other associated hydrocarbons (i.e. "natural gas liquids") that must be removed prior to transporting the gas. Once removed, these natural gas liquids are sold to various purchasers. Our natural gas liquid revenues were $17,800 for the three months ended March 31, 2012.  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $994,600 and $1,119,100 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $124,500 (11%). This decrease was due to lower transportation fees and monthly supervision fees due to wells being temporarily shut-in for repairs and maintenance.  Depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was 48% and 47% for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These percentage changes are directly attributable to changes in revenues, oil and gas reserve quantities, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas properties.  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 were $112,400 and $119,100, respectively, a decrease of $6,700 (6%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP. The decreases for the three months ended March 31, 2013 is primarily due to a decrease in third-party costs as compared to the prior year similar period.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash provided by operating activities decreased $673,400 in the three months ended March 31, 2013 to $862,800 as compared to $1,536,200 for the three months ended March 31, 2012. This decrease was due to a decrease in the change in accounts receivable trade-affiliate decreasing operating cash flows by $307,300 and a decrease in net income before depletion and accretion of $212,500. In addition, the change in accrued liabilities and a net non-cash loss on hedge instruments decreased operating cash flows by $99,600 and $54,600, respectively. The change in asset retirement obligations settled of $600 increased operating cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2012.  Cash used in investing activities was $7,600 for the three months ended March 31, 2012, representing the net of $3,000 in proceeds from the sale of tangible equipment and $10,600 for the purchase of tangible equipment.  Cash used in financing activities decreased $869,400 during the three months ended March 31, 2013 to $716,100 from $1,585,500 for the three months ended March 31, 2012. This decrease was due to a decrease in cash distributions to partners.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions, and we will not borrow from third-parties.  The Partnership is generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flows from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations.  Subordination by Managing General Partner  Under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the MGP may be required to subordinate up to 50% of its share of net production revenues so that the limited partners receive a return of at least 10% of their net subscriptions, determined on a cumulative basis, in each of the first five years of Partnership operations, commencing with the first distribution to the limited partners (February 2009) and expiring 60 months from that date. The MGP subordinated $139,600 of its net production revenue to the limited partners for the three months ended March 31, 2013.  Critical Accounting Policies  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our asset retirement obligations, depletion and certain accrued receivables and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of significant accounting policies we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our financial statements is included within "Notes to Financial Statements" in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" in this quarterly report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Atlas Resources Public #18-2008 (A) L.P. Investment Losses




(Last Updated On: January 11, 2017)Are you concerned about your losses investing in Atlas Resources Public #18-2008 (A) L.P.? If so, The White Law Group may be able to help you recover your losses.
According to their website, Atlas Resources Partners provides unique oil and gas opportunities that result in consistent and reliable performance for their investors.  The company often raises money for investments through Reg D private placement offerings like the company did for Atlas Resources Public #18-2008 (A) L.P. These Reg D private placements are then typically sold by brokerage firms in exchange for a large up front commission, usually between 7-10%, as well as additional “due diligence fees” that can range from 1-3%.
Atlas Resources Partners LP filed for bankruptcy protection on July 26 and joins dozens of struggling oil and gas producers that were pushed into Chapter 11 after energy prices began dropping in 2014. Since the beginning of 2015, at least 85 North American oil and gas producers have defaulted, according to Haynes & Boone LLP. Those cases involve about $61.2 billion in cumulative debt, the law firm said in a June 30 report.
The trouble with alternative investment products, like Atlas Resources Public #18-2008 (A) L.P., is that they involve a high degree of risk and are typically sold as unregistered securities which lack the same regulatory oversight as more traditional investment products like stocks or bonds.  An additional risk inherent to Atlas Resource Partners’ offerings is also the general risk that comes with the energy market – a market that has seen enormous losses over the last few years due to the declining cost of oil and other energy commodities.
The White Law Group continues to investigate the liability that brokerage firms may have for improperly selling oil and gas private placements like Atlas Resources Public #18-2008 (A) L.P.
Broker dealers that sell alternative investments are required to perform adequate due diligence on all investment recommendations to ensure that each investment is suitable for the investor in light of the investor’s age, risk tolerance, net worth, financial needs, and investment experience.
However, another problem with Reg D private placements is that the high sales commission and due diligence fees the brokers earn for selling such products sometimes can provide brokers with an enormous incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors who do not fully understand the risks of these types of investments or to outright misrepresentation the basic features of the products – usually focusing on the income potential and tax benefits while downplaying the risks.
Fortunately, FINRA does provide for an arbitration forum for investors to resolve such disputes and if a broker or brokerage firm makes an unsuitable investment recommendation or fails to adequately disclose the risks associated with an investment they may be liable for investment losses in a FINRA arbitration claim.
To determine whether you may be able to recover investment losses incurred as a result of your purchase of Atlas Resources Public #18-2008 (A) L.P. or another Atlas Resource Partners private placement investment, please contact The White Law Group at 1-888-637-5510 for a free consultation.
The White Law Group is a national securities fraud, securities arbitration, and investor protection law firm with offices in Chicago, Illinois and Vero Beach, Florida. The firm represents investors throughout the country in claims against their brokerage firm.

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group.
