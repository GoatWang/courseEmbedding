Hoy, 76, a news photographer with the old Washington Evening Star newspaper in the 1950s and 1960s who became public relations director for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, died Oct. 20 at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. He died of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, said his daughter Betsy Shiverick. From 1953 to 1966, Mr. Hoy was a photographer for the Star. His best-known pictures included Willie Mays hitting a home run in 1956; former British prime minister Winston Churchill flashing his famous V sign on his last visit to the United States in 1959; and a picture of first lady Jacqueline Kennedy and her two children at President John F. Kennedy’s grave site in Arlington National Cemetery after his November 1963 assassination. Thomas Larkin Hoy was born in Cincinnati and raised in the Washington area. He graduated from Falls Church High School in 1955, two years after he began working at the Star. He left the Star in 1966 for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, where he was employed until he retired in 1994. Mr. Hoy, a Bethesda resident, was a former board member of the White House News Photographers Association and a member of the National Press Club and Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Georgetown. Survivors include his wife of 53 years, Barbara Stall Hoy of Bethesda; two daughters, Betsy Shiverick of New York City and Christy Gosnell of Potomac; and five grandchildren. A twin brother, Frank Hoy, a former Washington Post photographer, died in 2006. — Bart Barnes             Comments           Share on FacebookShare       Share on TwitterTweet     Share via Email                         Show Comments       Discussion Policy     Comments       SuperFan Badge SuperFan badge holders consistently post smart, timely comments about Washington area sports and teams.
