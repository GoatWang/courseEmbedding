An In-Depth Look




Enables technology driven mass personalization








                                 We focus narrowly in just asset allocation, something that is exceedingly hard to do, and when executed properly creates enormous investing value for clients and migrates a financial advisor up the value chain.
                              

                                 ActiveAllocator helps financial advisors such as yourself analyze and arrive at personalized recommendations for each of your clients. We recognize that the “market of one” is the new norm. We do not lump people into broad amorphous categories such as the wide spectrum of "very conservative' to "risk seeking". In an age of technology driven mass customization, individual customers expect highly personalized offerings that are uniquely tailored to their own specifications. The portal is designed to drive the individualization of every aspect of asset allocation down to the level of a single client.
                              

                                 Marrying our cutting edge, fact based algorithm-driven analytics, with your own special understanding of your client's unique circumstances, drives superior outcomes. We believe that this powerful combination goes far beyond anything offered by emerging digital financial advice platforms, robo-advice and digital investment managers.
                              

                                 We assist you to sift through carefully generated choices to create timely, specific, and actionable recommendations. We, working with and for you, forever transform how your retail clients allocate to and implement actively managed portfolios.
                              




Improves Long Term Strategic Asset Allocation




                                 It has long been widely recognized that the majority of investment returns come from long term asset class strategic asset allocation decisions. This simple, boring, yet extremely powerful insight is unfortunately often glossed over in obsessive search for ‘best products’ or the next hot investment theme.
                              

                                 The asset allocation module within our portal optimizes on what your client already owns. It analyzes your client's aggregate portfolio, does a risk-return based analysis, generates numbers and metrics and makes recommendations to reallocate asset classes to improve the portfolio. In other cases, it suggests the addition of other asset classes such as alternative investments to complement and enhance existing holdings.
                              







                                 We recognize, as you undoubtedly do too yourself, that any long term strategic asset allocation or a particular fund recommendation is made at a snapshot in time. In the real world your client's circumstances evolve and change continually; periodic rebalancing that comes at a price, may or may not be an option. While many are anchored in a long term view, most investors would benefit from refreshing a dated investment allocation model, revisit funds that they have allocated to in the past, as well as act on changes in markets and include their future assumptions.
                              

                                 Until now, this however has been easier said than done. For instance, each wealth management firm, each wire house, often each broker dealer periodically arrives at their own future view of asset class expected risk and return. Yet financial advisors have no easy way to test such comparative views within the specific context of their particular client. ActiveAllocator allows you to do this in minutes. Our portal helps you quickly simulate such scenarios and allows you to quantify revision in views, triggering valuable dialog.
                              


                                 ActiveAllocator, in minutes, helps you in establishing detailed, standardized assessments of your client's existing holdings. You will be able to quickly incorporate your client's preferences to develop long term portfolio objectives. The portal allows you to combine your judgment with quantitative asset allocation, incorporate constraint conditions and develop appropriate risk management controls. All investment processes are well defined, replicable and completely transparent to you.
                              

                                 You will also be able to extend your fund manager sourcing capabilities to give your clients best in class asset exposure.
                              




Strengthens Your Bond with Your Clients




                                 We hope you recognize, as do we, that many of the new generation of self-directed investors are less comfortable handing off investment decisions solely to their advisors. Today’s clients know more and want to actively participate in managing their investments as well as the asset allocation process collaboratively with you.
                              

                                 ActiveAllocator strengthens your relationship with your client by enabling them to become more hands-on, should they choose to do so, and aided by your expert guidance. It makes remote interactions much more akin to face-to-face exchanges, helping you reduce client confusion, allay insecurity, and demonstrate value by drawing your recommendations to empirical data, facts and numbers. The portal is a valuable tool for you to grow your business and, unlike robo-advisors, not a disintermediation threat, for it marries the digital with the very special person-to-person relationship that only you bring to your client.
                              

                                 The portal is built to increase the frequency of interactions that your clients have with you - through real time collaboration, generating and discussing what if scenarios on the fly in your meetings, changing preexisting assumptions on an asset class or a fund's future expected risk and return and modeling it as you converse.
                              

                                 This deepens customer intimacy. You benefit along with your clients, for such collaboration raises the quality of your discourse, drives additional meaningful interaction and creates a positive effect on your relationship.
                              




Built Around Cutting Edge Analytics and Algorithms




                                 ActiveAllocator is built on a back end engine of advanced analytics technologies that add speed, scale, visualization and predictive capabilities to investment decision modeling. By embedding analytics capabilities to financial advisor use in real-time and in the context of a business process, the traditional system of record of 'client portfolio holdings' now becomes a system of actionable new investment insight. These insights are gleaned from predictive analytics which drives nearly all aspects of its recommendations.
                              


                                 There is a scarcity of good tools to analyze alternative investments. Given the absence of standards and recognized benchmarks in the alternative investments space, fund investors often lack meaningful performance comparison metrics. Our portal brings in best practices utilized by the most sophisticated institutional investors to the affluent and mass affluent main street investor. Our proprietary analytical tools and models will help you better support your clients. These include:
                              

                                 New Approaches to Alternative Asset Allocation

                                 ActiveAllocator uses multi-variable stochastic alternative asset models that go beyond the traditional Markowitz mean-variance approach, or the Treynor-Black approach or popular variants of the modified Black-Litterman approach. For instance, allocations may be optimized to have the highest return per unit of specified risk. Constraint considerations may include investor preferences, reducing volatility, left skew, excess kurtosis, maximum drawdown, whilst reducing corner solutions.

                                 New Approaches to Investing and Funds Analysis

                                 ActiveAllocator is able to extract information from proprietary databases of historical returns performance which serve as input to our stochastic manager selection models. It answers questions such as the amount to allocate to single or to multi-manager funds, choice of fund categories, optimum mix of skills based and cheap market beta exposure amongst others.


                                 Models for Performance Measurement and Benchmarking


                                 ActiveAllocator algorithms use a variety of means for performance analysis, time series and cross sectional peer group comparison, estimating measurement error, alpha (skills) attribution, the effects of leverage as well as customized performance analysis.


                                 As you begin using this portal we urge you to contrast this to prevalent simplistic asset allocation approaches. We believe that approaches often built off simply analyzing historical data, using mean variance optimization, extrapolating with clever optics create false precision.

                        The financial model enclosed herewith does not constitute an offering and is meant only to provide a broad overview for discussion purposes. This model was prepared by, and reflects the research, analysis and opinions of the asset allocation team of Active Allocator, Inc. The model, the information and analysis embedded in the model and the asset allocations described herein are subject to change at any time.
                     

                        If and when an investment opportunity is structured for a product within an alternative asset class described herein, you must obtain and carefully read the related Offering Memorandum, which will contain the information needed to evaluate the potential investment and provide important disclosures regarding risks, fees and expenses.
                     

                        Active Allocator, Inc. is not acting as your advisor or agent. This model is being given to you based on the understanding that you are not relying solely on for any advice or recommendation of any sort and that you have sufficient knowledge, experience and professional advice to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction. This model should be seen only as an analysis that is illustrative of the potential impact of including specific single manager s in a portfolio of broadly diversified asset classes. Further, the illustrative portfolios are intended to be used a strategic-generally longer than a five year-investment horizon.
                     

                        The model does not favor certain securities, asset classes, or managers over others. The results of this optimization depend heavily upon our estimates of expected returns, volatilities and correlations. To the extent that future events vary from our estimates, the recommended portfolios may be sub-optimal. Results of the model may vary with each use and over time.

                        The model does not account for taxation.  does not offer tax advice and urges you to consult a tax advisor for specific advice about the tax implications of an investment portfolio. The model does not consider all investment opportunities available to investors (other investments not considered may have characteristics similar or superior to those analyzed by the model).
                     

                        Partial List of Assumptions:
                     


Assumption — This model (including the constraints and these assumptions) is suggestive and may not be appropriate for all.
                        

Assumption — The model outputs are intended to be merely guidelines for asset allocation and should be used to facilitate yours’ and your Financial Advisor’s judgment and not as a substitute for the exercise of that judgment.
                        

Assumption — Your asset allocation guidelines are highly dependent on the financial assumptions that are made.  For purposes of developing these guidelines, we have used the pre-tax forecasts for returns, historical risks and correlations with assumptions.
                        

Assumption — For purposes of deriving correlations among the various asset classes, we used between 10 and 20 years of data based on our assessment of a range of factors for each asset class, including but not limited to data availability, stability of parameters and length of the investment cycle.
                        

Assumption — The model relies on index data for many asset classes. Indices are unmanaged, and investors cannot invest directly in an index. A variety of factors may cause an index to be an inaccurate benchmark for an asset class or particular investment within an asset class.  In certain cases, the data has been adjusted for certain structural biases in the indices, such as serial correlation and reporting biases.  In addition, adjustments for fees have also been made based on approximations.  Actual fees will vary for particular investments.  A number of other estimates have also been made.
                        

Assumption — The guidelines are intended for use as a strategic (as opposed to tactical) allocation and should be evaluated over a minimum 5 year timeframe.
                        

Assumption — We generally assume that there is an ongoing ability to rebalance positions, for traditional investments including for liquid alternatives emulating 'hedged exposures’, except for managed futures (generally monthly ability to rebalance); hedge funds (generally quarterly ability to rebalance); and private equity and real estate (generally no ability to rebalance).  Regardless of these constraints on the model, you should regularly rebalance your overall portfolio when possible.
                        

Assumption — You should review and assess the constraints imposed on the asset allocation guidelines proposed for you.
                        

Assumption — The model assumes that you hold a sufficiently diversified set of investments within each asset class so as to correlate closely enough to the index chosen for the asset class in order to effectively implement the asset allocation guidelines.  Although the determination of whether the investments in an asset class are “sufficiently diversified” will be a function of all of the facts and circumstances surrounding your specific investments, investors should strive to ensure that:
                           

a) Investments in a given asset class represent the sub-asset classes, or strategies, contained in that asset class. This can include but is not limited to diversification across geographies, trading strategies, sectors, and, in the case of real estate and private equity, vintage years. In addition, for real estate, investors should consider diversification across major property types, such as retail, multi-family, office and industrial. The model uses multiple underlying types of fixed income to characterize structured credit strategies: municipals, mortgages, bank loans and preferred. Investors who invest in this asset class should also consider diversification across these collateral types and explore corporate lending.
                           

b) Investments in a given asset class are spread across enough managers such that no one manager dominates the overall risk of that asset class. The number of managers to be sufficiently diversified depends on the size of the managers, as well as on how closely the managers resemble one another and how closely they resemble the index for their asset class. The model assumes that traditional asset classes are represented by passive investments in representative indices, which provide inherent diversification. At any time, there is no certainty that products sufficiently diverse to meet these standards will be available.  Even when they are, actual performance of the products may vary significantly from the index, thus diminishing the effectiveness of the allocation.
                           



Assumption — Other than the constraints that you have provided, the model does not take into account specific aspects of your financial situation, such as your preference for liquidity, cash flow requirements or costs of rebalancing your portfolio.
                        

Assumption — The model only considers the types of investments listed in the tables in developing your asset allocation guidelines.
                        

Assumption — We assume that real estate allocations are immediately fully invested, although unlike in Non Traded REITs these investments are typically staged over an extended period of several  (typically three) years.
                        

Assumption — Probabilities are calculated using a normal distribution, i.e., a symmetric, bell-shaped distribution, which should be viewed as an approximation only, and not as a precise reflection of the true structure of possible outcomes.  Probabilities of achieving multi-year returns are based on a log-normal distribution. These probabilities assume that the portfolio is being continuously rebalanced and that there are no withdrawals. These assumptions are approximations only, and therefore the probabilities should be treated as estimates. Actual probabilities may vary based on the appropriateness of these assumptions. In the optimization we have used mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, maximum draw down and tested against MVAR.
                        

Assumption — You should review the classification of your current portfolio to ensure you are in agreement. Differences in categorization can have a material effect on the asset allocation. Active Allocator, Inc. makes no representations concerning the characterization of the current portfolio or its valuation.
                        

Assumption — We have not made assumptions about indicative fee levels which may vary depending on a range of factors including specific product selections, time periods, size of investments and performance.

Overview of ActiveAllocator Framework






                        Active Allocator allows you to analyze an existing portfolio and then optimize it in minutes. The result
                        is a personalized allocation that accommodates your risk tolerance level, investment horizon,
                        preferences for alternative investments, and tolerance for illiquidity, as well as other needs.  This
                        video highlights key elements of our Strategic Asset Allocation system.

Beyond Conventional Allocation with ActiveAllocator






                        ActiveAllocator helps allocating to alternative investments within affluent investor portfolios. It
                        redefines conventional notions of asset allocation. It separates skills from
                        market exposure to help you analyze the characteristics of your current portfolio at the active
                        manager level. This video highlights how Active Allocator improves forecasting, helps capture
                        illiquidity premiums and account for multiple sources of returns.
                     







Feb, 2017
Going Beyond Modern Portfolio Theory






                        Modern Portfolio Theory is 60 years old.  Most capital allocators simply naively extend conventional
                        mean variance optimization techniques to alternative asset allocation.  In this video, we illustrate why
                        doing so just does not work for actively managed funds.
                     







Feb, 2017
Solving for Illiquid Investing






                        The addition of illiquid investments can significantly enhance portfolio returns for given levels of risk.
                        In this video, we illustrate how Active Allocator can be a way to help you figure out the cost and
                        benefits of investing in illiquid assets.

A Primer on Hedge Funds






                        A large part of the Active Allocator functionality is to allow you to allocate to liquid alternatives, active
                        managers and hedge funds. In this video, we talk about general concepts and introduce hedge
                        funds.

Allocating to Hedge Fund Strategy Types






                        There are four major hedge fund strategy groups with over 20 sub-types. This makes asset
                        allocation within hedge funds very complicated. In this video, we illustrate
                        how Active Allocator can be used to properly allocate across major hedge fund strategy types.

Creating Market Directional & Hedged Exposures






                        In this video, we illustrate how Active Allocator can help you create both market directional, as well
                        as hedged exposures. We also show, how you can create custom exposures.

Allocating to Credit & Market Risks






                        Active investing is all about making informed or speculative trades on credit risk and market risk.
                        Their interplay, is also the foundation of many trading strategies. In this video, we illustrate how
                        Active Allocator can be used to understand these risks, and to appropriately allocate to them.

Structuring Multi-Alpha Portfolios






                        At Active Allocator, we have built cutting edge models to support fund manager selection, portfolio
                        allocation, and market exposure hedging.  Our approach is closely tied to active investment
                        management, which separates passive risk (beta) from active risk (alpha). In this video, we show
                        you how to implement an active investment strategy.

                       Active Allocator


Abstract:
The capital allocator is in the business of entering into partnerships with fund sponsors to potentially generate significant returns,
mainly through long-term capital appreciation, by making, holding and disposing of privately negotiated equity and related investments. A methodical approach to selecting sponsors—which combines scientific rigor with seasoned subjective judgment— may contribute to creating strong results in a variety of economic environments. This paper presents a ‘best practices’ framework for selecting financial sponsors.

                        UBS Alternative Investments


Abstract:
Hedge Fund (HF) managers are expected to create excess investment returns (Alpha) through two primary skills based sources: (i) Security selection: buying undervalued securities and selling overvalued securities. (ii) Market timing: entering markets in advance of, or when they are rising and exiting, or shorting them when they are declining. In this paper we employ a Kalman Filtering approach to measure the skills based component of HF returns. We separately quantify value generated through market timing and security selection decisions over various market regimes and detail the characteristics of HF Alpha.

                        UBS Alternative Investments

Abstract:
Hedge fund investment strategies tend to be quite different from the strategies followed by traditional money managers. Moreover, in principle every hedge fund follows its own proprietary strategy. This means that hedge funds are a very heterogeneous group. There are, however, a number of “ideal” types that can be distinguished, comprising broad categories. This paper describes them from first principles.

                        Citi Capital Advisors

Abstract:
Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) differ in many ways from other institutional investors in their investment activities. They have different objectives, investment processes, time horizons, risk profiles, utility preferences as well as eligible instruments. One of the more recent debates within these funds revolves around considerations involving investing in hedge funds. Integrating hedge funds into portfolios has been difficult to do in a rigorous manner because the asset allocation technology that is available to many investors is ill equipped to handle the complexities that this asset class presents. Traditional approaches to asset allocation, portfolio construction, risk management and investor governance are quite inadequate for this task. This paper highlights issues that are specific to hedge fund investing and suggests new approaches to portfolio management.

                        UBS Alternative Investments

Abstract:
Hedge funds are considered an alternative asset class, in contrast with traditional investments such as stock and bonds. One of the reasons to view hedge funds in a somewhat different light than “bread and butter” asset classes is the differing asset characteristics that hedge funds exhibit. This installment of the hedge fund series focuses on these performance characteristics, providing insights into returns and correlations, but also drilling into additional distributional aspects such as skewness and kurtosis (fat tails).

Investing in Private Equity

                        Jain, Sameer
                        UBS Alternative Investments

Abstract:
The fundamental reason for investing in private equity is to improve the risk and reward characteristics of an investment portfolio. Studies have shown that private equity returns do not correlate closely with returns from other asset classes, such as bonds and in certain cases public equities. Having an allocation to private equity therefore may help smooth out the returns of a balanced portfolio as well as provide additional sources of returns.

 Investing in Developed Country Private Infrastructure Funds

                        Jain, Sameer
                        Citi Alternative Investments

Abstract:
Infrastructure investment encompasses multiple sectors, geographies, stages, and investment instruments/ products each with their own risk/return attributes. This broad range makes it a versatile asset permitting its consideration in diverse tailored portfolios. Infrastructure has traditionally been under the purview of governmental bodies. Its importance from a public interest perspective cannot be overstated. For several reasons, there has been globally widespread historical under-investment, resulting in degradation of existing assets with simultaneous failure to add new capacity. As this issue is unlikely to reverse course any time soon, forward thinking countries and government entities have sought to encourage convergence of public and private sector activity. Their aim is to help the creation of economically viable new infrastructure assets and upgrade, properly maintain, manage and operate existing ones. Formal contracting structures through active PPPs supported by recent government initiatives have made progress in encouraging private capital investment in infrastructure. A lot still remains to be done. Despite where they stand in the different stages of the privatization process, the collective market opportunity in developed countries remains substantial. These opportunities are in civil aviation, bridges, roads, mass transit, railways, greenfield and brownfield projects, dams, water, waste management and energy. From an alternative investment perspective, infrastructure assets exhibit different risk and return profiles from other private investments; they can be a source of both alpha as well as a valuable diversification tool in portfolio construction. They provide exposure through both illiquid long-term private vehicles as well as liquid publicly traded funds. This versatility makes them extremely attractive for different investor segments.

                        Jain, Sameer
                        UBS Alternative Investments

Abstract:
Selection of a hedge fund (HF) strategy, or strategies, is highly relevant in determining how a HF portfolio will fare under various financial market environments. Equally important, one can easily argue, is the task of implementing the selected strategy mix by choosing among HF managers in each of the selected strategies and skillfully combining them into robust portfolios. This installment sketches a framework for due diligence for selecting from among competing HFs and touches on aspects of portfolio construction. While financial professionals have specific regulatory diligence requirements, the issues discussed in this paper will also be useful to anyone considering an investment in HFs.

Abstract:
The alternative investments universe generally consists of investments outside of publicly traded real estate, equity and debt. It includes investments ranging from private commercial real estate, hedge funds and managed futures, liquid alternatives to illiquid private equity funds, and real asset and natural resource partnerships. Moreover, the alternative investments industry is rapidly evolving – expanding and increasing its ability to provide durable investment strategies, and therefore is attracting interest from a growing number of individual investors. This paper provides an overview of several examples of alternative investments.

Alternative Investments Building Blocks: Illiquid Assets




Click to Download




                        Jain, Sameer
                        AR Capital

Abstract:
Alternative asset classes have varying degrees of tradability and structural liquidity. This article outlines illiquidity considerations as well as the pros and cons of investing in illiquid instruments and long dated trading strategies. Investing opportunity sets in inefficient market cycles tend to vary. Often, given market anomalies they come to reside for extended periods of time in less liquid instruments such as in distressed debt, private equity, certain types of loans, or in the securities of firms experiencing turnaround situations. These securities, because they are difficult to price, due to limited market participants, infrequent transactions, complex structures or highly uncertain future performance offer potential for excess returns over the risk free rate. Investors who have the ability to buy and hold these securities may thus stand to profit.

                        Citi Capital Advisors

Abstract:
This report provides an update on developments in the economic infrastructure sector during 2009 as well as provides nuanced geographic and sector perspective. The focus is primarily on OECD countries, with ancillary attention to emerging markets. We analyzed 634 transactions that achieved financial closure in 2009 and contrasted them with around 895 transactions in 2008. These 1529 transactions, which collectively constitute around 90% of total market activity over the past two years, gave us 146,784 data points , which we examined on a variety of dimensions including, (i) Geographic focus. We investigated OECD (North America, Western Europe, Australia) transactions and contrasted them with emerging markets (Middle East, Asia Pacific-ex Japan, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Indian Subcontinent) deals. We segmented the data both at the aggregate and country level and the findings are presented at the global, developed country, emerging markets and, where significant, the country level. (ii) Sector focus. We excluded social infrastructure transactions and concentrated only on economic infrastructure – on Mining & Metals, Oil & Gas, Power, Renewable Energy, Telecom, Transport, Water & Sewage sectors. (iii) Financial focus. We analyzed different transaction types by size, sector, geography and the type of financing employed to unearth trends in debt and equity usage. When appropriate, we also examined the effect of the economic crisis and various stimulus programs on the asset class and include our perspective by way of commentary.

                        AR Capital

Abstract: 
NTRs typically invest in sector specific real estate programs, targeting stable, fully occupied properties subject to long-term leases to strong credit tenants. They are thus able to generate immediate, durable, rent-driven cash flows from the inception of the investment as capital is deployed without a cash drag. Much like traditional private equity core real estate investing, they aggregate property through acquisitions and build diversified portfolios by tenant, geography, industry and lease duration. They return value from these aggregated portfolios via asset sales, public listings or mergers, usually over a five- to seven-year timeframe.

Investing in Private Equity – Capital Commitment Considerations




Click to Download




                        Jain, Sameer
                        UBS Alternative Investments

Abstract:
This paper explores capital commitment and cash-flow management issues in private equity fund investing. It provides a theoretical framework to structure private equity capital commitment issues in a formal manner, and defines variables, inter-relationships, and boundaries in such a way that the problem can be worked upon. The paper’s findings suggest that achieving a targeted level of allocation to private equity is a function of the pace of capital deployment as well as dependent upon the desired amount of targeted exposure. It is also dependent on the spread of realized returns in private equity versus other asset classes, as well as on timing and realization periods for capital already invested.

Abstract:
The economic stimulus provided by abundant liquidity, low or negative real interest rates, and, in many markets, the rapid and dramatic appreciation of multi -family housing sets the economic backdrop for real estate markets. Against this backdrop, commercial real estate investment markets have fared well, albeit with wide variances by location and property sector type. This paper provides a view on investing opportunities in real estate.

What We Do









Frustrated with the sub-par tools currently available to financial advisors, our team created ActiveAllocator.com, the world’s first portal that seamlessly integrates traditional, illiquid and alternative investments within portfolios.








The ActiveAllocator Difference




Brings institutional quality asset allocation methods to financial advisors who serve mainstream investors. 
Built around cutting edge algorithms and software developed by analysts who have been advisors themselves with decades of main and wall street experience.
Far beyond anything offered by emerging digital financial advice platforms or robo advice.
Assists financial advisors to develop and implement sound investment policies to deploy client capital sensibly.
Augments financial advisor and client interactions by bringing in analytics driven, fact based, product agnostic decision making.

We are the Rational Alternative
Whilst recognizing comfort in past performance we do not place all our faith in it. Experience, in itself, is not good enough for us. We do not drive all the way home by looking at the rear view mirror. Neither, we hope, would you.
We believe that a fact-based approach to investment allocation decisions is often missing in the alternative investments space. We are in a sense the “Rational Alternative“.
Many of you who invest in alternative investments have a difficult task, given: 

Lack of transparency in investing given asymmetric information
Differentiating between results that come from active skills or passive market exposure
Properly integrating illiquid and liquid investments together
Absence of analytic tools to arrive at fact based decisions
Stale prices and subjective asset valuation
Constrained access to excellent fund managers

These challenges are compounded when it comes to investing across a broad range of strategies, asset types, managers, styles and instruments that constitute the alternative investments universe.
Choices, Choices, Choices.








Especially Well-suited for Alternative Investments, ActiveAllocator Accounts for:







Stale Pricing



                              In traditional investing returns are accurate, largely marked to market. In alternative investments returns for many strategies are not marked to market daily. ActiveAllocator algorithms correct data for stale pricing.
                           




Unique Risks



                              In traditional investing volatility is an appropriate risk measure as returns data is bell shaped/normally distributed. This is not so within alternative investing where volatility may misrepresent true risk. ActiveAllocator algorithms correct data to arrive at better measures of underlying risk. For instance, it incorporates extreme but rare downside events.
                           








Illiquidity



                              In traditional investing typically assets are highly liquid as they are traded continuously in markets. This is not so in alternative investments where different levels of liquidity restrict exit options. ActiveAllocator algorithms make an illiquidity premium adjustment.
                           







Inefficient Markets



                              In traditional investing, typically assets are traded in efficient public markets whereas alternative investments are often traded in private markets. ActiveAllocator algorithms take asymmetric information into consideration and attenuate style drift in long dated investments.
                           




Strategy Heterogeneity



                              In traditional investing, unlike in alternative investments, there is greater homogeneity between sub asset classes. ActiveAllocator algorithms are built to resolve greater heterogeneity in sub-strategies.
                           




Reporting Bias



                              In traditional investing one does not have to worry about reporting bias. Within alternative investments reporting biases create distortion in performance data. For example, fund managers may cease reporting typically due to poor performance leading to survivorship bias. Another example is selection bias where a database incorporates the performance of fund managers who choose to report; managers who perform better will typically be more likely to report creating an upward bias. Yet another example is short history bias: shorter history may not accurately reflect longer term returns. ActiveAllocator algorithms address and resolve such biases.
                           




Serial Correlation in Returns



                              In infrequently valued illiquid investments such as real estate or private equity, serial correlation in returns data causes an understatement in volatility. Serial correlation occurs when returns are inter-dependent as opposed to being independent across time. The result is risk is understated and the risk adjust return measure overstated. Also the true correlation between asset classes is altered. ActiveAllocator algorithms quantitatively adjust returns data using auto-regression techniques to remove serial correlation.
                           








Non-Normal Returns Distributions



                              In alternative investments Illiquid and difficult to trade securities have unmeasured risk. Securities that are not consistently marked to marked understate risk or volatility. Moreover, extreme event tail risk is difficult to quantify and downside risk capture is difficult to measure. ActiveAllocator algorithms are purpose built to address this and make provisions for left tail skew and kurtosis optimization.
                           







Style Drift



                              In alternative investments some hedge fund managers do not rigidly limit themselves to one strategy as they pursue market inefficiencies. The flexibility to seek out investment opportunities is an advantage, but such style drift also poses unique risks for investors. ActiveAllocator algorithms group strategies that are correlated as well as have similar statistical return characteristics into baskets to reduce the adverse effect of style drift in portfolios.
                           




In Summary…



                              We help you cut through opacity, fund manager claims, investment industry jargon to see the investing world in simple terms. We use our skills and proprietary analytical techniques to work for you so that you can serve your clients better. We help you decide between multiple competing potential high performing managers, dynamically control risk and incorporate objectivity in your asset allocation process. We help you exercise your responsibilities to your clients better.

Active Allocator Secures Pre-Series "A" Financing

							External Funding Values Fintech Start-up at $8.0 Million						


Press Release
-


									updated: Nov 3, 2016							

 





			New York, NY, 
			November 3, 2016			(Newswire.com) -
	 Active Allocator Holdings LLC ("Active Allocator"), a financial technology company that owns the world’s first and only asset allocation portal that seamlessly integrates traditional, illiquid and alternative investments within portfolios, has secured early stage equity financing at a pre-money valuation of $8.0 million from private investors.
Sameer Jain, Co-Founder of Active Allocator commented, “We have been self-funded for the past year and have never quite solicited external capital. This equity injection brings external ratification of our business plan and underlying technology and will go a long way to prepare us for a Series A round down the road. We intend to deploy the proceeds to further product development, including to our forthcoming advanced portfolio construction module.”
Mr. Jain continued, “My Partners and I believe that affluent investors should consider intelligently adding actively managed credit structures, alternative and illiquid asset classes to their portfolios. Until now, there has not been an objective method to systematically allocate amongst the larger, modern set of asset classes and between traditional and alternative investments. Our portal creates disruption in both product and market scope through our comprehensive view."

This equity injection brings external ratification of our business plan and underlying technology


				Sameer Jain,
		Co-Founder		
		
	


Brian Jones, Co-Founder added, “The limitations of Modern Portfolio Theory have reduced the perceived benefits of alternative asset classes in an optimized portfolio to conjecture and backward-looking metrics.  Active Allocator overcomes such limitations, allowing advisors to demonstrate quantitatively the benefits of intelligently adding alternative investments within existing portfolios.  In addition, our systematic, customizable and personalized approach, reduces both advisor subjectivity and the potential for error, resulting in expected cost savings for investors and advisors alike.”
About Active Allocator
ActiveAllocator.com is the world’s first portal that seamlessly integrates traditional, illiquid and alternative investments within portfolios. A fintech digital disruptor, it offers RIAs and broker-dealer’s financial advisors a simple way to understand and explain alternative investments’ benefits within the context of their particular client’s holdings; to allocate appropriately, as well as to access exposure by investing with the right set of active manager funds.

Active Allocator Partners With TradeIt to Enable Multi-Broker Portfolio Optimization Execution

Innovative FinTech integrates cutting edge TradeIt platform to let retail investors instantly place securities orders




Apr 12, 2017, 7:30pm EDT














NEW YORK, April 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- ActiveAllocator Holdings LLC ("ActiveAllocator") announced integration with TradeIt, a proprietary order management system which securely routes trade orders to brokers to facilitate securities order execution. This partnership enables investors to optimize their existing portfolios on ActiveAllocator by linking their brokerage account and sending order messages to their broker directly from ActiveAllocator's platform. To take advantage of this feature, users login to their broker via secure oAuth popup, specify the type of order and number of securities to trade generated by ActiveAllocator, and execute the trade to optimize their portfolios. TradeIt further provides real-time portfolio data from the user's brokerage firm, which is imported into ActiveAllocator to provide the most current picture of their portfolio's forward facing characteristics.
Sameer Jain and Brian Jones, ActiveAllocator's co-founders, noted, "Our integration with TradeIt for trade execution will now allow our customers to optimize their portfolios by buying or selling publicly listed equities and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with their choice of broker. They can now trade securely, safely and quickly through most of the popular brokerages."
"TradeIt is fast becoming the platform of choice for seamless order execution through many of the large brokerages," said Nathan Richardson, co-founder and CEO of TradeIt. "Our partnership with ActiveAllocator helps financial advisors and retail investors to increase their investible universe, makes for automated implementation, permits scalability in managing assets, eases trading and periodic rebalancing and helps express house views while making strategic allocation decisions."
ActiveAllocator helps investors go beyond traditional model portfolios by utilizing disruptive technology driven personalization for purposes of creating directional, semi-directional and non-directional market exposures. In fostering trade execution, it further augments advisor-client interactions by bringing in analytics driven, fact based, collaborative, product agnostic thinking to investment decision making. This enables financial advisors who offer various types of advisory services and programs, including wrap programs, mutual fund asset allocation programs, financial planning services, retirement plan consulting services, investment research, and other customized advisory services to bring added value to their practices.
