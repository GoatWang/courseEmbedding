Chatham Lodging Trust
































 














 






 























StrategyOur primary objective is to generate attractive returns for our shareholders through investing in hotel properties at prices that provide strong returns on invested capital, paying dividends and generating long-term value appreciation.
Disciplined AcquisitionsChatham is focused primarily on investing in upscale extended-stay hotels and premium-branded, select-service hotels.

We focus on acquiring hotel properties at prices below replacement cost in markets that have strong demand generators and where we expect demand growth will outpace new supply. We also seek to acquire properties that we believe are under managed or undercapitalized. We currently do not intend to engage in new hotel development.

Opportunistic hotel repositioning: We intend to employ value-added strategies, such as re-branding, renovating, or changing management, when we believe such strategies will increase the operating results and values of the hotels we acquire.
Aggressive Asset ManagementAlthough as a REIT we cannot operate our hotels, we will proactively manage our third-party hotel managers in seeking to maximize hotel operating performance.

Our asset management activities will seek to ensure that our third-party hotel managers effectively utilize franchise brands’ marketing programs, develop effective sales management policies and plans, operate properties efficiently, control costs, and develop operational initiatives for our hotels that increase guest satisfaction.

As part of our asset management activities, we will regularly review opportunities to reinvest in our hotels to maintain quality, increase long-term value and generate attractive returns on invested capital.
Experienced ManagementOur management team, led by our chief executive officer, Jeffrey H. Fisher, has extensive experience acquiring, developing, financing, repositioning, managing and selling hotels.

Prior to forming Chatham Lodging Trust, Mr. Fisher served as chairman, chief executive officer and president of Innkeepers USA Trust, or Innkeepers, a New York Stock Exchange-listed hotel real estate investment trust, or REIT, from its inception in 1994 through its sale in June 2007.

Mr. Fisher successfully grew Innkeepers from a portfolio of seven hotels at the time of its initial public offering, or IPO, in 1994 to 74 hotels at the time of its sale and delivered strong returns for Innkeepers’ shareholders. Six of the eight members of the board of trustees of Innkeepers at the time of its sale in June 2007 have agreed to serve as trustees of our company.

Strategic Relationship - Best in Class ManagerOur goal is to maximize the performance of our hotels through great collaboration with our operators.

Being flexible in our selection of hotel management companies increases the universe of potential acquisition opportunities. Island Hospitality is one of the best hotel operators of select service and extended-stay hotels in the industry and given the many markets where Island operates hotels, we use their expertise to help us underwrite and diligence potential hotel acquisitions.

Island Hospitality manages all but two of our wholly-owned hotels, all forty-seven hotels in the Innkeepers joint venture and 34 of the 48 hotels in the Inland joint venture. Concord Hospitality manages the two wholly-owned hotels not operated by Island Hospitality.


Visit Island Hospitality Website


Premium BrandsWe expect that a significant portion of our portfolio will consist of hotels in the upscale extended-stay segment, including brands such as Homewood Suites by Hilton®, Residence Inn by Marriott®, and Hyatt House. We also invest in premium-branded select-service hotels such as Courtyard by Marriott®, Hampton Inn® and Hampton Inn and Suites®.

Challenge
Coil leaks and premature failure of three ventilation rooftop  units
  on its Residence Inn Anaheim hotel led building owner,  Chatham
  Lodging Trust, to seek a quick solution to keep its guests
  comfortable. Looking beyond its short-term equipment needs, the REIT
  also sought the consistent delivery of quality HVAC systems that could
  handle dehumidification requirements at its nationwide hotel
  properties, a partner to handle its service and maintenance needs, and
  operational cost reductions throughout its hotel network. “Local
  manufacturer's reps might or might not have a service company,” said
  Kurt James, corporate engineer, Chatham Lodging Trust. “We needed
  quality equipment at the right price, as well as help with our service
  and maintenance.”
Solution

A one-stop solution
 Based upon past experience with Trane equipment and service
  offerings, Chatham Lodging Trust contacted the Trane hotel team
  regarding the failing equipment. After discussions to understand the
  needs at the Residence Inn Anaheim, the Trane team proposed a complete
  design/build solution that provided equipment to answer the hotel’s
  comfort needs, as well as turnkey installation. Having a single-point
  of responsibility allowed Chatham Lodging Trust to better meet its
  performance requirements, reduce costs and speed project completion.

Improving indoor air quality
 To stabilize the situation, Trane suggested replacing the
  rooftop units serving the corridors of the hotel with Trane® Horizon™
  dedicated outdoor air systems. The Trane systems condition 100 percent
  outdoor air — improving indoor air quality by properly conditioning
  and filtering the make-up air required to ventilate a building. The
  systems precisely deliver the right amount of outdoor air to properly
  pressurize the corridors and guest rooms, ensuring full compliance
  with hotel standards. MERV-8 air filters keep pollen, dust and other
  contaminants from entering the building.

Controlling humidity levels
 The Trane dedicated outdoor air systems are optimized for
  efficient, effective humidity control for improved comfort and
  cost savings. The units contain a specially designed six-row
  evaporator coil that can quickly dehumidify incoming outdoor air, and
  maximize both moisture removal and energy savings.

Reducing costs and energy use
 The system's evaporator coil dries the outdoor air to a lower
  dew point before bringing it inside. With less air needed for
  dehumidification, the hotel's guest room HVAC systems operate more
  efficiently. The unit's plenum fan with a variable frequency
  direct-drive motor also helps to lower energy use.

Improving performance and reliability
 Trane service professionals provide preventive maintenance to
  keep the systems running at their best.  Addressing maintenance on a
  scheduled basis increases system reliability, improves equipment life,
  and helps eliminate costly emergency service. When maintenance is
  performed at a Chatham Lodging Trust property, the hotel’s chief
  engineer accompanies the Trane technician for on-the-job training of
  system operations, allowing the hotel to maintain and monitor
  performance on an ongoing basis.
Results
A collaborative partnership between Chatham Lodging Trust and Trane
  is serving the equipment and maintenance needs of properties held by
  the REIT across the country. A recent renovation at the REIT’s
  Residence Inn Anaheim included the installation of three Trane®
  Horizon™ dedicated outdoor air systems. The systems have improved
  temperature control and ventilation, and reduced humidity levels,
  providing a more comfortable environment for guests.
Chatham Lodging Trust is reducing energy and operational costs with
  the installation of the Horizon™ units. Service costs are also lower
  as Trane technicians perform scheduled maintenance to help ensure
  optimal system performance and train hotel facilities engineers on
  equipment operations.
“The first two months were spent drying the corridors, then we
  started seeing results," said James. "It took ninety days to
  get the dew point right at this property. There’s a difference between
  doing it right and not doing it right.”
“Trane has a unique distribution system,” said Chuck Engelhardt,
  senior vice president, Chatham Lodging Trust.  “They’re a one-stop
  shop. They understand our needs and provide consistency in delivery.
  We have a ground breaking relationship with them, and I’m proud to be
  part of it.”

Hotel Deals: Up To 60% Off Hotels!
Our advertising partners offer great deals at savings of up to 60%. 


Priceline.com offers savings of up to 60% using their 'Name Your Own Price' program. Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system is different from other online travel sites. With Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system, the exact hotel is shown only after purchase. Over the last 12 months, a substantial percentage of accepted offers have resulted in savings of up to 60% in comparison to the lowest published rates on other leading online travel sites for the same itinerary. There is no guarantee that hotels, dates or prices will be available and savings are not guaranteed. Actual prices and availability are always subject to change.
You can also save up to 60% at Hotwire with 'Hotwire Hot Rates'. 
These are just two examples of amazing offers our partners are offering. Visit Booking.com, Hotels.com, and many more sites for other super deals.

OneTime allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by OneTime. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. OneTime does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.

Priceline.com offers savings of up to 60% using their 'Name Your Own Price' program. Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system is different from other online travel sites. With Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system, the exact hotel is shown only after purchase. Over the last 12 months, a substantial percentage of accepted offers have resulted in savings of up to 60% in comparison to the lowest published rates on other leading online travel sites for the same itinerary. There is no guarantee that hotels, dates or prices will be available and savings are not guaranteed. Actual prices and availability are always subject to change.
You can also save up to 60% at Hotwire with 'Hotwire Hot Rates'. 
These are just two examples of amazing offers our partners are offering. Visit Booking.com, Hotels.com, and many more sites for other super deals.

OneTime allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by OneTime. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. OneTime does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.

*
Total includes estimated local taxes & fees payable on check out.


Per night prices are per room. Rates not guaranteed to be available.

Here's why:
 We’re not the seller
At KAYAK we don’t set prices, so it’s not possible for us to guarantee what other companies are selling.

 We aggregate tons of data for you
Our service lets you quickly and easily compare results from hundreds of travel sites at once. In this sense, KAYAK is a search engine and we don't guarantee prices we find.

 Why aren’t prices accurate 100% of the time?
Prices on airline seats, hotel rooms and car rentals can change frequently. Several people may also be trying to buy the same travel option simultaneously. As a result, you may find on occasion that certain prices are no longer available.

 More questions or if you have a bad price to report to us
Please send us an email and someone from our team will get back to you promptly.


Hacker Rates can save you money by booking your hotel stay under two separate reservations.
You may need to change rooms when the first reservation ends.
Each reservation may also be subject to different hotel policies.
Be careful to make sure that the rates are still available before you book.
