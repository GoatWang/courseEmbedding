Richard L. Huber, 92, of Hendersonville, died Thursday, July 23, 2009 at Carolina Village Medical Center following a prolonged battle with lymphoma. 
Mr. Huber was born July 5, 1917 in Madison, IN, son of the late Leonhard L. and Florence B. Priest Huber. Mr. Huber was preceded in death by his sister, Laura James Rankin, a few weeks before the death of his beloved wife of 61 years, Ella Estep Huber on January 19, 2005

Changing The Guard At Aetna - tribunedigital-thecourant







 


 Home→CollectionsChanging The Guard At AetnaFebruary 29, 2000Life at Aetna Inc. certainly was not boring during the five years that the tough-talking, hard-charging Richard L. Huber was chief executive.He led the company through rapid expansion, dropping and adding products and purchasing U.S. Healthcare, NYLCare and Prudential HealthCare to make Aetna the nation's largest managed-care company. He was determined to make Aetna a major international player.FOR THE RECORD - Correction published 3/2/2000.The Tuesday editorial "Changing the Guard at Aetna" was in error when it said that Richard L. Huber was the company's chief executive for five years. He became CEO in 1997.Mr. Huber was a rarity among Hartford corporate leaders in more ways than one. He lived in the city and invested here by buying property. He and his wife participated in the social and cultural life of the community. He was accessible. But he also caused sparks to fly with his attempts to unload the money-losing Civic Center mall on the company's terms, and against city hall's wishes.As Aetna's chief, Mr. Huber had two things going against him: his abrasive personality and the public's growing unhappiness with the health insurance industry, particularly HMOs.He may have been able to survive the flak that his combative style attracted as well as the assault on HMOs by politicians, trial lawyers and doctors, among others. But he could not survive the 50 percent plunge in Aetna's stock price during the past year -- due in no small part to Aetna's being the target of class-action lawsuits and the poor performance of Prudential HealthCare.Last week, he resigned at the request of the company's board of directors. As if any HMO company doesn't have enough public relations problems, Aetna had to bear the burden of Mr. Huber's sharp tongue. Last year, a day after a California woman won a $120.5 million judgment against Aetna for delaying care for her husband before he died of cancer, the Aetna chief said the award was the work of a ``skillful ambulance-chasing lawyer, a politically motivated judge and a weeping widow.'' Mr. Huber later apologized.Mr. Huber's departure will not solve Aetna's problems, which in key respects mirror the challenges faced by all health insurance companies. Americans insist on getting the best health care in the world, but they don't want to pay for it through higher taxes and premiums. In Mr. Huber's flamboyant words, ``If you pay for a Chevy, you don't get a Cadillac. We've accustomed ourselves to feeling that no matter what you pay, you get a Cadillac.''Longtime Aetna director William H. Donaldson was chosen by the insurance giant's board to succeed Mr. Huber. Among the new chairman's impressive credentials: He is the co-founder of the investment banking firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and was chairman and CEO of the New York Stock Exchange.Mr. Donaldson has the best wishes of everyone in Aetna's hometown as he tries to improve the performance of a company whose fortunes have been entwined with Hartford's for well over a century.
