a different approach to traditional Investing
Crawford Lake Capital Management, LLC is a trading-oriented long/short equity hedge fund manager that strives to generate strong risk-adjusted returns. The firm is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser and is headquartered in Lakewood, New Jersey. Crawford Lake currently has over $500 million in assets under management.
 








investment philosophy
             Crawford Lake's investment philosophy is based upon three separate but interconnected concepts.  
        






1
A two-pronged approach is used in stock selection by combining both fundamental and technical analysis.
2
A unique risk management approach is employed to mitigate potential losses and lower overall volatility. 
3
Lastly, active management is a key component used in navigating the market's difficult environments.


            	The managers believe in a core principal that is the basis of its hybrid strategy. That principal is that the best risk-adjusted returns are made when the fundamental and technical health of a stock are aligned in the same direction.  The managers therefore attempt to be early in identifying technical triggers that are confirming fundamental catalysts, and enabling them to buy stocks with lower risk and yet a high potential reward.  The unique risk management approach includes the use of option hedges, stop losses that are based upon technical analysis, a large cash position, and not taking earnings risks.  These risk mitigators create a low volatility return profile while still allowing for double digit annual returns.The active management style helps the managers adjust the fund's exposure quickly, extract alpha during periods of flat market performance, and stay engaged and aware of any potential market turns.
