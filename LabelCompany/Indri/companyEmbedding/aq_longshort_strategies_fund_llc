Forms of Letters from the Fund
to Investors in connection with acceptance of offers of tender

P-->EX-992nd�Page�of�5TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�2nd
UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C.


This letter is being sent to you if you tendered
your entire interest in the Fund.



Dear Investor:
UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund") has received and
accepted your tender request. Enclosed is a statement showing the breakdown of
your capital withdrawal and the manner in which it is being distributed, in
accordance with the tender offer. 
Since you have tendered your entire investment, you have been
paid 90% of the amount requested, in accordance with the terms of the tender
offer. The funds were wired directly into your UBS Financial Services brokerage
account if you have a UBS Financial Services account. If you do not have a UBS
Financial Services account, the funds were mailed directly in the form of a
check to you at your mailing address as listed in the Fund's records.

The remaining 10% of the amount requested is a contingent
portion of the repurchased interest and is valued based on the unaudited
estimated net asset value of the Fund as of December 31, 2005, and is subject to
year-end audit adjustments which may cause a change in the value of the
contingent portion of the repurchased interest. The contingent portion, together
with interest, will be paid (subject to audit adjustment) within approximately
ten days after the conclusion of the 2005 year-end audit, or on such earlier
date as the Fund's Directors may determine, according to the terms of the tender
offer. We expect the audit to be completed by the end of February 2006.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact the
Fund's Administrator, PFPC Inc., at (877) 431-1973. 
Sincerely,
UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C.

of your tender request.
For the tender period ending Wednesday, December 21, 2005,
approximately $[________] of Interests in the Fund were submitted for redemption
and the offer was oversubscribed. Because of the oversubscription, the Fund will

terms of the Fund�s Offer to Purchase. Enclosed is a statement showing the
breakdown of your capital withdrawal in accordance with the tender offer.

tender offer. The funds were wired directly into your UBS Financial Services
brokerage account. If you do not have a UBS Financial Services account, the
funds were mailed directly in the form of a check to you at your mailing address
as listed in the Fund's records. Please note that because a portion of your
capital remains with the Fund, you are still an investor in the Fund.

The next tender offer period is expected to commence in May

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact the
Fund's Administrator, PFPC Inc., at (877) 431-1973.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Members and Board of Directors of                                        
UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C.                                                       

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund"), including the schedule of portfolio
investments,  as of December 31, 2004, and the related  statements of operations
and cash flows for the year then ended and the statements of changes in members'
capital  for each of the two years in the period  then  ended.  These  financial
statements are the responsibility of the Fund's  management.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.     

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as a basis  for  designing  audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Fund's internal control over
financial  reporting.  Accordingly,  we express no such  opinion.  An audit also
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.  Our  procedures  included  confirmation  of
investments owned as of December 31, 2004, by correspondence  with management of
the investment  funds. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.                                                                    

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C. at December
31,  2004,  the results of its  operations  and its cash flows for the year then
ended and the changes in its  members'  capital for each of the two years in the
period  then  ended,  in  conformity  with U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

 NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                    YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004

1.    ORGANIZATION                                                              

      UBS M2 Fund,  L.L.C.  (the "Fund") was  organized  as a limited  liability
      company  under the laws of  Delaware  on  September  4, 2002.  The Fund is
      registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
      Act"), as a closed-end,  non-diversified,  management  investment company.
      The Fund's investment  objective is to seek capital  appreciation over the
      long term.  The Fund is a  multi-manager  fund that  seeks to achieve  its
      objective  by  deploying  its  assets  among a select  group of  portfolio
      managers who primarily  employ  long/short  equity  strategies,  including
      those  involving  foreign  issuers.  Generally,  such  portfolio  managers
      conduct their investment  programs through  unregistered  investment funds
      (collectively,  the  "Investment  Funds"),  in which the Fund invests as a
      limited partner,  member or shareholder  along with other  investors.  The
Fund commenced operations on February 1, 2003.                      

      The Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors") has overall responsibility
      to manage and  control the  business  affairs of the Fund,  including  the
      exclusive  authority to oversee and to establish  policies  regarding  the
      management,  conduct and operation of the Fund's  business.  The Directors
      have engaged UBS Fund Advisor,  L.L.C.  ("UBSFA",  the "Adviser" and, when
      providing    services   under   the    Administration    Agreement,    the
      "Administrator"),   a  Delaware  limited  liability  company,  to  provide
      investment  advice  regarding the selection of Investment  Funds and to be
responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.              

      The Adviser is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of UBS Americas,  Inc.,
      which is a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of UBS AG, and is  registered  as an
     investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

      Initial and additional  applications  for interests by eligible  investors
      may be  accepted  at such  times  as the  Adviser  may  determine  and are
      generally  accepted  monthly.  The Fund  reserves  the right to reject any
application for interests in the Fund.                              

      The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase  interests  pursuant to
      written tenders to Members.  These  repurchases will be made at such times
      and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors, in their complete
      and  exclusive  discretion.  Members  can only  transfer  or assign  their
      membership  interests  (i) by  operation  of law  pursuant  to the  death,
      bankruptcy,  insolvency  or  dissolution  of a  Member,  or (ii)  with the
      written approval of the Directors, which may be withheld in their sole and
absolute discretion.                                                

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                           
A.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION                                           

      Net asset value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction of the
      Adviser as of the close of  business  at the end of any  fiscal  period in
      accordance  with the  valuation  principles  set forth  below or as may be
      determined  from time to time  pursuant  to  policies  established  by the
      Directors.  The Fund's  investments in Investment Funds are subject to the
terms and conditions of the respective operating agreements and     

                                                                               6

                                                    YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)                               
A.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)                               

      offering memoranda,  as appropriate.  The Fund's investments in Investment
      Funds are  carried  at fair  value as  determined  by the  Fund's pro rata
      interest in the net assets of each Investment Fund. All valuations utilize
      financial  information  supplied  by each  Investment  Fund and are net of
      management and  performance  incentive fees or allocations  payable to the
      Investment   Funds'   managers  or  pursuant  to  the  Investment   Funds'
      agreements.  The  Fund's  valuation  procedures  require  the  Adviser  to
      consider  all relevant  information  available at the time the Fund values
      its portfolio. The Adviser and/or the Board will consider such information
      and  consider  whether  it  is  appropriate,  in  light  of  all  relevant
      circumstances, to value such a position at its net asset value as reported
      or  whether to adjust  such  value.  The  underlying  investments  of each
      Investment  Fund are  accounted  for at fair  value as  described  in each
      Investment  Fund's  financial  statements.   (See  Schedule  of  Portfolio
Investments)                                                        

      Distributions  received or withdrawals from Investment  Funds,  whether in
      the form of cash or  securities,  are first  applied as a reduction of the
investment's cost.                                                  

B.    INCOME RECOGNITION                                            

      Interest  income is  recorded  on the accrual  basis.  Realized  gains and
      losses from Investment Fund  transactions are calculated on the identified
cost basis.                                                         

C.    FUND COSTS                                                    

      The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business,  including,  but not
      limited to, the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to portfolio
      transactions and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees; accounting
      and auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset
      value; costs of insurance;  registration  expenses;  certain  organization
      costs; due diligence,  including travel and related expenses;  expenses of
      meetings  of   Directors   and   Members;   all  costs  with   respect  to
      communications  to Members;  and other  types of expenses  approved by the
Directors. Offering costs are charged to capital as incurred.       

D.    INCOME TAXES                                                  

      No provision  for the payment of Federal,  state or local income taxes has
      been provided, since the Fund is not subject to income tax. Each Member is
      individually  required  to report on its own tax return  its  distributive
share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.                         

      The Fund has  reclassified  $7,258,096  and $82,756 from  accumulated  net
      investment loss and accumulated net realized gain from  investments to net
      capital  contributions  during  the year  ended  December  31,  2004.  The
      reclassification   was  to  reflect,  as  an  adjustment  to  net  capital
      contributions,  the  amount  of  taxable  income  or loss  that  have been
allocated to the Fund's Members and had no effect on net assets.    

                                                                               7

                                                    YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)                               
E.    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS                                     

      Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested in a PNC Bank,  NA
      account that pays money market  rates and are  accounted  for at cost plus
      accrued  interest,  which  is  included  in  interest  receivable  on  the
Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.              

F.    REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS                                         

      From  time to time the Fund  may  enter  into  repurchase  agreements.  In
      connection  with  such  transactions  it is the  Fund's  policy  that  its
      custodian take  possession of the underlying  collateral  securities,  the
      fair  value  of which  exceeds  the  principal  amount  of the  repurchase
      transaction,  including  accrued  interest,  at all  times.  If the seller
      defaults,  and the fair value of the collateral  declines,  realization of
      the  collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.  As of December 31,
2004 there were no open repurchase agreements.                      

G.    USE OF ESTIMATES                                              

      The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with U.S. generally
      accepted accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the amounts  reported in the financial  statements
      and accompanying  notes. The Adviser believes that the estimates  utilized
      in preparing the Fund's  financial  statements are reasonable and prudent;
however, actual results could differ from these estimates.          

3.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS                                                

      The Adviser provides  investment advisory services to the Fund pursuant to
      an Investment Manager Agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the Fund pays
      the Adviser a monthly fee (the "Investment  Management Fee") at the annual
      rate of 1.45% of the Fund's net assets,  excluding assets  attributable to
      the Adviser and the  Administrator.  The  Administrator  provides  certain
      administrative  services  to the  Fund,  including,  among  other  things,
      providing office space and other support  services.  In consideration  for
      such  services,  the  Fund  pays  the  Administrator  a  monthly  fee (the
      "Administrator  Fee") at an annual rate of 0.30% of the Fund's net assets,
      excluding  assets  attributable to the  Administrator's  and the Adviser's
      capital account.  The Administrator Fee and the Investment  Management Fee
      will be paid to the  Administrator  out of the Fund's  assets and  debited
      against the Members' capital accounts,  excluding net assets  attributable
      to the Administrator's and the Adviser's capital account. A portion of the
      Investment  Management Fee and the  Administrator  Fee is paid by UBSFA to
its affiliates.                                                     

      UBS Financial Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS
      Americas,  Inc., acts as a placement  agent for the Fund,  without special
      compensation  from the Fund, and will bear its own costs  associated  with
      its  activities as placement  agent.  Placement  fees, if any,  charged on
      contributions are debited against the contribution  amounts to arrive at a
      net subscription  amount.  The placement fee does not constitute assets of
the Fund.                                                           

                                                                               8

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                    YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)                                    

      The net increase (or decrease) in Members' capital derived from operations
      (net income or loss) is allocated  to the capital  accounts of all Members
      on a pro-rata  basis,  other than the  Investment  Management  Fee and the
      Administrator Fee which are similarly  allocated to all Members other than
the Adviser or Administrator as described above.                    

      In order to achieve a more equitable distribution of the impact of certain
      initial  organization  and offering costs, the Fund has either credited to
      or debited against the Members'  capital  accounts the sum of such initial
      costs based on each individual Member's percentage of capital in the Fund.
      The  reallocation  of these costs will occur for the first  twelve  months
after the initial closing date of the Fund.                         

      Each Director who is not an "interested person" of the Fund, as defined by
      the 1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer of $5,000 plus a fee for each
      meeting  attended.  Any  Director who is an  "interested  person" does not
      receive  any  annual  or other  fee  from  the  Fund.  All  Directors  are
      reimbursed by the Fund for all  reasonable out of pocket  expenses.  Total
      amounts  expensed  by the Fund  related  to  Directors  for the year ended
December 31, 2004 were $21,457.                                     

4.    ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES                                         

      PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as the custodian
      (the "Custodian") of the Fund's assets and provides custodial services for
the Fund.                                                           

      PFPC Inc.  (also an affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as  Accounting  and
      Investor Servicing Agent to the Fund and in that capacity provides certain
      administrative,   accounting,  record  keeping,  tax  and  Member  related
      services.  PFPC Inc.  receives a monthly fee primarily  based upon (i) the
      average net assets of the Fund subject to a minimum  monthly fee, and (ii)
      the aggregate net assets of the Fund and certain  other  investment  funds
      sponsored   or  advised  by  UBS   Americas,   Inc.  or  its   affiliates.
      Additionally,  the Fund reimburses certain out of pocket expenses incurred
by PFPC Inc.                                                        

5.    CREDIT FACILITY                                                           

      Effective  July 2, 2004 the Fund,  along with other UBS  sponsored  funds,
      entered into a $75,000,000  committed,  unsecured revolving line of credit
      with  Harris  Trust  and  Savings   Bank.   Under  the  most   restrictive
      arrangement,  the Fund may borrow an amount that  combined  with the other
      borrowings of the Fund would not exceed 20% of its net assets.  The Fund's
      borrowing  capacity  is also  limited to the portion of the unused line of
      credit at any  point in time.  The Fund is only  liable  under the line of
      credit to the extent of its own borrowing thereunder. The interest rate on

      The  allocated  taxable  income is reported to the Fund by the  Investment

      The  agreements  related to  investments  in Investment  Funds provide for
      compensation  to the general  partners/managers  in the form of management
      fees of  between  1% and 2% (per  annum)  of net  assets  and  performance
      incentive  fees or  allocations  ranging  from  15% to 20% of net  profits
      earned. The Investment Funds provide for periodic  redemptions,  with lock
      up  provisions  of up to  two  years  from  initial  investment.  Detailed
information about the Investment Funds' portfolios is not available.

8.    INDEMNIFICATION                                                           

      In the ordinary  course of business,  the Fund may enter into contracts or
      agreements  that contain  indemnifications  or  warranties.  Future events
      could occur that lead to the  execution  of these  provisions  against the
      Fund.  Based on its  history  and  experience,  management  feels that the
likelihood of such an event is remote.

      invests  trade  various  financial  instruments  and  enter  into  various
      investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are
      not  limited to,  short  selling  activities,  writing  option  contracts,
      contracts for  differences,  and equity swaps.  The Fund's risk of loss in
      these  Investment  Funds is limited to the value of these  investments  as
reported by the Fund.

      (a)   Ratio of total  expenses  to average net assets does not include the

related to the underlying Investment Funds.             

*     Annualized.                                                   

      **    Total  return  assumes a purchase  of an interest in the Fund at the
            beginning of the period and a sale of the Fund  interest on the last
            day of the  period  noted  and does not  reflect  the  deduction  of
            placement fees, if any, incurred when subscribing to the Fund. Total
            returns for a period of less than a full year are not annualized. An
            individual  member's ratios and return may vary from the above based
on the timing of capital transactions.                  

      ***   The average net assets used in the above  ratios are  calculated  by
            adding any withdrawals payable effective at the end of the period to
the net assets for such period.

         assurance  and related  services by the principal  accountant  that are
         reasonably  related to the performance of the audit of the registrant's

         Item are  $4,500  for 2003 and  $4,500  for  2004.  Audit-related  fees
         principally  include  fees  associated  with  reviewing  and  providing

Tax Fees

--------------                                                                  

    (d)  The  aggregate  fees  billed in each of the last two  fiscal  years for
         products and services provided by the principal accountant,  other than

         $3,000  for 2003 and  $7,000  for  2004.  Fees for all  other  services
         include fees for administrative  services associated with preparing the

         registrant's  investment  adviser (not including any sub-adviser  whose
         role is primarily  portfolio  management and is  subcontracted  with or
         overseen by another investment  adviser),  and any entity  controlling,
         controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser that
         provides  ongoing  services to the  registrant  ("Service  Affiliates")
which were required to be pre-approved by the audit committee.

    (e)(1)    The  registrant's  audit  committee   pre-approves  the  principal
              accountant's  engagements for audit and non-audit  services to the
              registrant,  and certain non-audit  services to service Affiliates
              that are required to be  pre-approved,  on a  case-by-case  basis.
              Pre-approval  considerations include whether the proposed services
              are  compatible  with   maintaining  the  principal   accountant's
independence.                                       

    (e)(2)    There were no services described in each of paragraphs (b) through
              (d) of  this  Item  that  were  approved  by the  audit  committee
              pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X,
because such services were pre-approved.            

(f)  Not applicable.                                                    

    (g)  The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's  accountant for
         services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to Service Affiliates
         for each of the  last  two  fiscal  years  of the  registrant  was $1.2
million for 2003 and $1.5 million for 2004.                   

    (h)  The  registrant's  audit  committee  of  the  board  of  directors  HAS
         considered  whether  the  provision  of  non-audit  services  that were
         rendered to Service  Affiliates that were not pre-approved  pursuant to
         paragraph  (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with
maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS. 

Schedule of Investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers as of the close of
the  reporting  period is included as part of the report to  shareholders  filed
under Item 1 of this form.                                                      

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END       
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES. 
The  registrant  is a fund of  funds  that  invests  primarily  in  unregistered
investment vehicles that have investors other than the registrant,  and in other
registered  investment  companies  ("Investment  Funds").  The Fund may invest a
majority of its assets in non-voting securities of Investment Funds.            

The registrant has delegated voting of proxies in respect of portfolio  holdings
to UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.  (the  "Adviser"),  to vote the Fund's  proxies in
accordance with the Adviser's proxy voting  guidelines and procedures.  However,
Investment  Funds  typically do not submit  matters to investors for vote. If an
Investment  Fund submits a matter to the registrant for vote (and the registrant
holds voting  interests in the  Investment  Fund),  the Adviser will vote on the
matter in a way that it believes is in the best interest of the  registrant  and
in  accordance  with  the  following   proxy  voting   guidelines  (the  "Voting
Guidelines"):                                                                   

       o     In voting  proxies,  the  Adviser  is guided by  general  fiduciary
             principles.  The Adviser's goal is to act prudently,  solely in the
best interest of the registrant.                      

       o     The Adviser attempts to consider all factors of its vote that could
             affect  the value of the  investment  and will vote  proxies in the
             manner that it believes will be consistent with efforts to maximize
shareholder values.                                   

       o     The Adviser, absent a particular reason to the contrary,  generally
             will vote with  management's  recommendations  on routine  matters.
Other matters will be voted on a case-by-case basis.  

The Adviser  applies its Voting  Guidelines in a manner designed to identify and
address  material  conflicts that may arise between the Adviser's  interests and
those of its  clients  before  voting  proxies  on behalf of such  clients.  The
Adviser  relies on the following to seek to identify  conflicts of interest with
respect to proxy voting and assess their materiality:                           

       o     The Adviser's  employees are under an obligation (i) to be aware of
             the  potential for conflicts of interest on the part of the Adviser
             with respect to voting proxies on behalf of client accounts both as
             a result of an employee's personal relationships and due to special
             circumstances  that may arise  during the conduct of the  Adviser's
             business,  and (ii) to bring  conflicts  of  interest of which they
      become aware to the attention of certain designated persons.

       o     Such  designated  persons  work with  appropriate  personnel of the
             Adviser to determine whether an identified  conflict of interest is
             material. A conflict of interest will be considered material to the
             extent that it is  determined  that such conflict has the potential
             to influence the Adviser's decision-making in voting the proxy. All
             materiality  determinations  will be based on an  assessment of the
             particular  facts and  circumstances.  The Adviser shall maintain a

P-->N-CSR20th�Page�of�22TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
written record of all materiality determinations.     

       o     If it is  determined  that a conflict of interest is not  material,
             the Adviser may vote proxies  notwithstanding  the existence of the
conflict.                                             

       o     If it is  determined  that a conflict of interest is material,  the
             Adviser's legal department works with appropriate  personnel of the
             Adviser to agree upon a method to resolve such conflict of interest
             before voting  proxies  affected by the conflict of interest.  Such
methods may include:                                  

             o disclosing the conflict to the  registrant's  Board and obtaining
the consent from registrant's Board before voting;

             o engaging  another party on behalf of the client to vote the proxy
on its behalf;                                    

             o engaging a third party to  recommend  a vote with  respect to the
             proxy based on application of the policies set forth herein; or

             o such   other   method   as  is  deemed   appropriate   under  the
circumstances given the nature of the conflict.   

       o     The Adviser shall  maintain a written  record of the method used to
resolve a material conflict of interest.              

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES. 

Not yet applicable.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS. 

There have been no material  changes to the procedures by which the shareholders
may  recommend  nominees to the  registrant's  Board,  where those  changes were
implemented  after the  registrant  last provided  disclosure in response to the
requirements of Item  7(d)(2)(ii)(G)  of Schedule 14A (17 CFR  240.14a-101),  or
this Item.                                                                      

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
