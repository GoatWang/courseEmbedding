Publisher's Description▼▲
Filled with broken hearts and black ravens, Edgar Allan Poe’s ghastly tales have delighted readers for centuries. Born in Boston in 1809, Poe was orphaned at age two. He was soon adopted by a Virginia family who worked as tombstone merchants. In 1827 he enlisted in the Army and subsequently failed out of West Point. His first published story, The Raven, was a huge success, but his joy was overshadowed by the death of his wife. Poe devoted his life to writing and his tragic life often inspired his work. He is considered to be the inventor of detective fiction and the father of American mystery writers. His work continues to influence popular culture through films, music, literature, and television.


Author Bio▼▲
Jim Gigliotti is a freelance writer based in Southern California. A former editor at the National Football League, he has written more than 50 books for all ages. His writing credits include biographies for young readers on Olympian Jesse Owens and baseball star Roberto Clemente.

 Jim's Bio
                                                    Jim added 
                                                    2 photos and 7 videosFull-time voice actor located in the San Francisco Bay Area. Represented by Stars, The Agency.   I have provided voices, narration and characters to numerous video game projects, commercials, eLearning modules, high-tech, industrial and medical narrations. There are a few examples here and at my linkedin page - https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimedgarvoices  My basic vocal tone is warm, articulate and mid-range. However, I've done work that not even my parents recognized and some of my evil characters even scare me.  Quick response for auditions and always interested in new projects.

Changing the Game with Oracle Endeca Information Discovery


On this new product explanation video, the production team wanted to create a conversation that would go over the reasons to use Oracle Endeca. As my "boss", voice actor Bob Makohin starts off the dialogue, and I'm the younger, tech-knowledgeable guy who has the experience and answers for him.

Autodesk Vault Professional - Why Go Pro?


On this "whiteboard" style illustrated product release video, I got to work once again with the talented team behind this intricate video. This is a good example of my more conversational/instructional read.
