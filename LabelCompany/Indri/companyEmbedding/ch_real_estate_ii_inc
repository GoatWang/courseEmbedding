CH Products 
Flight Sim Yokes and Rudders
Since the mid 1980's, CH 
	Products has been manufacturing high quality joysticks and peripherals for 
	the PC Gaming Industry. Fueled by unprecedented technological growth and the 
	subsequent birth of the Flight Simulation genre, CH Products began 
	developing fully programmable joysticks to satisfy the dynamic needs of the 
	industry. Twenty years later, CH Products is recognized worldwide as the 
	premiere manufacturer of high-end flight simulation controllers. 
	Authentically modeled from actual cockpit instruments, CH Products' 
	replicated controllers provide an experience that's second only to flying.  
	
CH Products Yokes and 
	Rudders are normally ready to ship within one business day (usually the 
	same day).  If you are not completely satisfied, return them within 30 
	days for your full money back!

Our Return Policy
If you need to return your merchandise
for any reason, please notify
MyPilotStore within 30 days of receipt. You can do this by entering the
MyPilotStore Web site and filling out the  merchandise return
form.  No returns will be accepted if the  merchandise return
form has not been completed.

General Return Policy: 


Items must be in new and original condition.
Item must be returned 
  within thirty (30) days of receipt of goods unless otherwise noted below.
All returns must include a 
  Return Merchandise Authorization Number (RMA#) (request 
	RMA#). 

  
All returns must be 100 percent
    complete and contain ALL original 
  manufacturer boxes and manufacturer packing
    materials.
Returns must have original UPC codes on the manufacturer
    boxes and contain all manuals, blank warranty cards and other accessories and documentation 
  that was originally provided by the manufacturer. 
Items Damaged in 
	Transit: All damage claims must be reported to us within 7 days of 
	receiving the merchandise.  Please save all of the shipping boxes if 
	the item(s) were damaged in shipping.  The shipping companies 
	(UPS/FedEx) will come out to inspect the merchandise and the boxes in which 
	they were shipped. 
Please call or email our customer service department for 
	any Damaged / Defective items and we will work to make sure 
	the problem is promptly resolved.
You are responsible for 
  the return shipping.
Items returned that are 
  not in the original or damaged manufacturer packaging are subject to a minimum 15% restocking fee.
Please allow approximately 
  10 business days for your return to be processed once it has arrived at the 
  warehouse.
Holiday Purchases:  
	Items purchased after November 15th can be returned through January 10 of 
	the following year (or 30 days, whichever is later) for 
  credit or exchange unless otherwise noted below.

Product /Category 
Specific Return Policy:
SOFTWARE / VIDEO:  Opened Software and Videos
    may be exchanged within 30 days of your product's shipping date, for the same item
    only. No refunds are available for these items, if opened. 
CHARTS:  Because of the time 
  sensitive nature, none of the FAA, NavCanada, or Jeppesen charts can be returned.  
  Jeppesen chart subscriptions that are cancelled after the first set has been 
  shipped will receive a pro-rated refund based on the time remaining. 
MAGAZINES:  Magazine subscriptions 
  cannot be cancelled or returned once they have been sent to the publisher.  
	Any address changes should be directed to the publisher.
CLOSEOUTS:  Closeout items are marked 
	as "all sales final" and cannot be returned under any circumstance.  Any 
	defects should be directed to the manufacturer under warranty service.
SPECIAL ORDER:  Products specifically 
	noted as "Special Order" cannot be returned for credit.  
CUSTOM MADE:
	 Custom made products 
	such as Seat Covers, Cabin Covers, Sun Shades, or Model Airplanes cannot 
	be returned or cancelled once they have been sent to be custom 
	manufactured.
APPAREL/CREW SHIRTS:  Any
	Van Heusen 
	or crew shirt that is not returned in the original folded condition will be 
	subject to a minimum $6.00 re-stocking fee.  Any garnment that has been 
	laudered is not returnable.
BUNDLES:  Some products are bundled together and 
	sold as one item (i.e. Flight Simulator bundles).  In these cases, 
	substitutions cannot be made and returns can only be accepted as a complete 
	bundle with all pieces originally shipped.  
GARMIN GPS:  
	Garmin GPS units that have not been opened can be returned for a full refund 
	within 30 days from the date of shipment receipt.  Non-defective Garmin 
	GPS units which have been opened are subject to a partial refund of 
	90% of the sale price.  If the software update has been used, the unit 
	is no longer eligible for a refund.
SPOT / SPOT PHONE:  Once the SPOT Satellite 
	Tracker or the SPOT Global Phone have been activated, they are no longer 
	eligible for return.
FLIGHT SIMULATOR 
	HARDWARE:  Flight Simulator Hardware from CH Products or 
	Saitek that have not been opened can be returned for a full refund within 30 
	days from the date of shipment receipt.  Non-defective Flight Simulator 
	Hardware from CH Products or Saitek which have been opened are 
	subject to a partial refund of no more than 85% of the sale price.   
ADVANCED COCKPIT PANEL:  This item cannot be 
	returned once any of the break-away tabs have been removed.
RELIEFBAND, TRAVELJOHN, LITTLEJOHN:  For sanitary 
	and hygiene reasons, we are unable to accept a return on these items once 
	they have been opened.  
GIFT CARD:  Once a gift card has been issued, 
	it may not be returned.  There are no expiration dates on gift cards.

Calculating Your Refund
When the item is returned in
its original condition with all original packaging, your credit card will be credited for the price of the
purchase and any taxes, excluding shipping costs and re-stocking fees. If the return is due to a  MyPilotStore error, the return shipping charges will be waived. 
Many times we charge a 
discounted shipping cost for the original shipment.  If you return an item 
and the outbound shipping cost was greater than you paid, the difference will 
be deducted from your return.  For example, if we charged you $4.95 for 
shipping and our actual shipping cost was $8.50 we will deduct $3.55 ($8.50 
minus $4.95) from the value of the return.

If you need clarification on 
this return policy, please
email us at service@MyPilotStore.com.

SELL QUICKER AND FOR MORE MONEY
Our research model is proprietary and based on an analysis of actual agent performance.

It's this final step that sets us apart, this step accounts for more money in your pocket, a faster closing and a smoother transaction. 





WHAT OUR CLIENTS SAY




Lisa A****

"I am impressed with these results!!  Thank you for guiding me in the right direction.
I just got off the phone with Sherry and we are meeting at my house this afternoon.
Thank you!"





Kim

"Thank you for your help. I have met with the selected agent and found her to be just what I was looking for.

							Your web site saved me dozen of phone calls and interviews. I am so very glad to have found your site and will recommend you to anyone who is looking for their own agent.
Thank you so much and great job!"
Best wishes,





Alicia

"Thanks - your service has been a lifesaver! Alice Switzer (your recommendation) has worked like a dream, and we've sold our house - closing is next week :-) Even with last minute problems with the house discovered during inspection,

							and a really difficult buyer's agent to deal with, she pulled out the sale. We love her!
Thanks again for your service - I've mentioned it to several people (well, anyone willing to listen to our house-selling saga!).

							Our first realtor (Channay G*****) was a train wreck, and a total waste of 6 months of trying to sell the house. Anyway, enough venting, thanks!"





Maryann

"After the first email I got from your organization I contacted a realtor on my own.  I had already spoken with her before you started sending me the actual referrals, but we had not made a solid decision.

							And then you sent me Karl Miller, and he has been just fantastic.
We have decided to work with Karl, based initially on your recommendation, but mostly because he is SO good at communication and following up.

							He's got great energy and enthusiasm, and I think we will be quite happy with the results of our choice.
Thanks again for your persistence and for your help.  This house-selling endeavor is stressful, and it's wonderful whenever reliable help comes along."
All the Best,





Lisa & David C******

"I intended initially to respond to everyone that had contributed to our selection process in the search for a listing agent, but have been covered up and have not had the time to do so as of yet.  We listed with Dustin Sherlin.  His marketing program and his sales record placed him high on our list, and the exit clause in his contract was what clinched it for us.  At his direction, we had the house painted in neutral colors and then staged.  We just listed the house at the beginning of the month and had three showings in the first week.

							He is talking with a serious buyer now and I am finishing up a minor drywall repair in the garage so that that customer can come back to view it again.
							We are very happy with your recommendation!"
Thank you,

They Sell Quicker
On average, the agents that we work with can sell your home 4 weeks faster than their peers can.  Top agents know how to effectively stage and price a home to minimize days on market without compromising on the sales price.



They Sell For More
The agents selected by EffectiveAgents.com are better at negotiating and pricing, plain and simple.  On average, our agents sell for 9% more than the average agent.  At the end of the day, that's a lot of moola.



They Are More Experienced
More sales = More experience.  Every time an agent sells a property, they go through a unique set of obstacles. By its very nature this type of experience can't really be taught, it's earned.



They Are Sophisticated Marketers
Top selling Realtors know what sells homes, they invest time and money in their web presence, advertising, social media and  professional photography.

Why choose EffectiveAgents.com?


We work everywhere
Even though we've got our "heads in the cloud", we know that real estate is local.  Members of our staff are constantly reviewing the performance of agents all over the country, making sure that we've got every street corner in the United States covered.



Since 2008
We've been connecting top performing agents with buyers and sellers since 2008.  What's that mean to you?   Simple, over the years we've learned a lot, we've learned how to filter out inaccurate data recognize anomalies and get to the truth... because accuracy matters.



Concierge level service
As soon as we receive your information you will get an email from your Transaction Concierge.  They are available Monday through Friday to answer your questions, schedule meetings with agents and to act as your personal advocate, all at no cost.





Selling a home is a complex process.

There are so many moving parts; inspections, insurance requirements, legal or title issues, financing considerations, zoning problems, heck, even personality conflicts can muck up a closing.  Sometimes it's frustrating because the real estate agents that we entrust with such large transactions, let us down.  In fact, only 67% of sellers in 2015 would "definitely use their agent again".
One in three sellers will probably not reuse their agent, that's sad. It's also why we exist.

Based on NAR's own data, one in three sellers will probably not reuse their agent, that's sad.  It's also why we exist.  We found a better way to locate and hire talented real estate agents; based on their actual track record.

Why choose EffectiveAgents.com?


We're Unbiased
Acceptance into our platform is somewhat of a badge of honor.  Every day we make agent recommendations all across the United States, connecting consumers with the very best agents in every local region.



We're Data Driven
You aren't going to get referrals that don't make sense.  If you only sell million dollar homes, our system will automatically filter appropriate buyers and sellers to you. There's no wasted time on referrals that aren't the right fit.



No Results = No Cost
If you do not close one of our referrals, there's no fee.  It's that simple.  There are no monthly fees, whatsoever. The only fee is a straight forward referral fee that's only due when you earn a commission.










Agent FAQ



Can I boost my ranking on your website?
Yes you can and, no, we won't do it for you.  The only way to boost your ranking is to sell more real estate, quicker, in the specified market area in which you desire boosted rankings.




Is there a monthly fee?
There are no monthly fees, the only fee you pay is our broker to broker referral fee of 25% which is due if and when you successfully close a transaction for one of our mutual clients.




I am a new or part-time agent, can I still sign up?
You can register but you will not receive referrals from our platform until you are identified as a top agent by our algorithm. Our suggestion is to only register once you have achieved some degree of market dominance. We do not make referrals to agents that are not in the top 5% in terms of overall sales in a given region.

Save Money
It's a well-known fact that the best real estate agents can negotiate better.  The agents we suggest can save you thousands compared to their less competent and experienced peers.



SAVE TIME
Experienced agents have connections with top tier lenders, home inspectors, attorneys and title companies that will work diligently to ensure that your purchase is smooth and effortless.



Save Aggravation
There's no reason to go-it-alone.  Buying a home is a complicated and expensive undertaking.  A buyer's agent can guide you through a successful purchase one step at a time.



GET ACCESS
If you're in the market for a home then using a buyer's agent is the best way to access the massive pool of homes that are on the market. Only a licensed REALTOR® can get you the access you need.

If you're buying, you need a buyer's agent.

Home buyers should always have their own agent, always, always, always.  And not just any agent, a good agent.. because having a buyer's agent connects you to the transaction in the best possible way.  The seller's agent cannot possibly represent your best interests when they have previously promised their clients that very same loyalty.
Having a buyer's agent connects you to the transaction in the best possible way.

Buyers agents work diligently to give you access to all of the homes that meet your purchase criteria and, best of all, their services are free to the buyer.  Most people don't realize that only the seller directly pays a commission.
