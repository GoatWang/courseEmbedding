                  Applied® (NYSE: AIT) is one of North America’s largest industrial distributors of bearings, power transmission components, hydraulic components and systems, pneumatic components and systems, industrial rubber products, linear components, tools, safety products, general maintenance and a variety of material handling products. We also provide customized mechanical, fabricated rubber and fluid power shop services, as well as services to meet storeroom management and maintenance training needs.

As one of North America's largest industrial distributors, Applied is a vital link between a full scope of suppliers' capabilities and a broad range of customers' needs. We excel in the areas of product selection and application, system-wide logistics and engineered systems.
 
We understand that partnering with the right industrial distributor is critical to your bottom line. Applied works closely with our customers to understand their needs and processes, and we use that knowledge to provide custom-fit products and services.

The Applied network of more than 400 service center locations, 5,000 employee-associates, nine strategic distribution centers, and more than 40 specialty repair and rebuild shops ensures that the products and support you need are always close by. With locations throughout the U.S., Puerto Rico, Mexico, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, product, expertise and support are never far away.

And while we may be national, our thinking is local, with knowledge of local markets and local companies. We are a familiar face in hometowns just like yours, supporting the communities in which we live.

Our business partners appreciate and acknowledge our pursuit of providing the best service to our customers. Our success is measured by quality recognition awards from customers, suppliers, leading publications and governmental agencies alike
