 | Source: Rodan & Fields, LLC





SAN FRANCISCO, June 30, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rodan & Fields, LLC ("Rodan + Fields"), a leading prestige skincare brand and unique technology-driven social enterprise platform, today announced that Louis J. Lavigne, Jr. has been appointed to its Board of Directors as an independent director, effective June 23, 2015.

	"Lou's demonstrated financial expertise and broad leadership experience will prove critical to Rodan + Fields as we continue to globalize our business," said Amnon Rodan, chairman of Rodan + Fields' Board of Directors. "Lou's appointment underscores the Company's commitment to operational excellence in support of the tens of thousands of Independent Consultants who have helped us become one the largest and fastest growing prestige skincare brands in the U.S."

	Mr. Lavigne brings more than 35 years of financial leadership experience to Rodan + Fields' Board. Currently, he is the managing director of Lavrite, LLC, a consulting firm specializing in corporate finance, accounting, growth strategy and management. Prior to Lavrite, Mr. Lavigne spent 23 years as executive vice president and chief financial officer at Genentech, Inc., retiring in March 2005. At Genentech, he oversaw the company's financial, corporate relations and information technology groups, was a member of the executive committee and chairman of the company's 401k plan committee. During his tenure, Mr. Lavigne played a key role in the growth of Genentech's revenue, which increased from $40 million when he became controller in 1983 to more than $6.6 billion in 2005. Prior to Genentech, he held various financial management positions with Pennwalt Corporation.

	"Rodan + Fields is a powerful brand that has disrupted the traditional go-to market approach with a unique technology-driven, micro enterprise business model," said Mr. Lavigne. "I look forward to working with Rodan + Fields to continue the company's momentum and growth as we redefine the future of skincare and social commerce."

	Mr. Lavigne is a board member and chairman of the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland, the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospitals and the UCSF Children's Hospitals Foundation. He also serves on the boards of Accuray, Inc.; Depomed, Inc.; DocuSign, Inc.; NovoCure, Limited; and Zynga, Inc. In addition, he is the managing member of Spring Development Group, LLC, a member of the Pacific SW Network of Audit Committee Chairs and serves on the faculty of the GLG Institute.

	Mr. Lavigne received an M.B.A. from Temple University and a B.S. in business administration from Babson College. He is a trustee of Babson College and Babson Global.

About Rodan + Fields

	Founded by Dr. Katie Rodan and Dr. Kathy Fields, Rodan + Fields' dermatology-inspired skincare products and proprietary, technology-driven social enterprise platform are changing the way people engage in the skincare category, shop for products and care for their skin. In 2007, the company made the unprecedented move out of department stores and into the world of social commerce in order to realize the doctors' vision for providing the closest alternative to a professional skincare experience outside of a medical office and, in the process, empowering entrepreneurial opportunity. Products are available through Rodan + Fields Independent Consultants and at www.rodanandfields.com.

Rodan + Fields, Tupperware Announce Board Appointments


July 10, 2015
Leave a comment






Kitchenware seller Tupperware Brands and skincare company Rodan + Fields have both made recent board appointments with an eye toward future growth.
Corporate finance consultant Louis J. Lavigne Jr. is the newest member of the board at Rodan + Fields. Lavigne, currently Managing Director of consulting firm Lavrite LLC, spent 23 years as Executive Vice President and CFO at Genentech Inc., a leading biotech company. In addition to overseeing the company’s financial, corporate relations and information technology groups, Lavigne sat on the executive committee and chaired the company’s 401(k) plan committee.
“Lou’s demonstrated financial expertise and broad leadership experience will prove critical to Rodan + Fields as we continue to globalize our business,” said Amnon Rodan, Chairman of the Board.
Tupperware has tapped corporate executive Richard T. Riley as its 12th board member. Riley’s leadership experience spans several industries, but he is currently independent Chairman of the Board of Cimpress, N.V., an international market leader in personalized products and services for small businesses. He previously held senior executive positions at Lojack Corp., New England Business Service Inc., and Rapidforms Inc., after beginning his career at Arthur Andersen & Co.
“We’re delighted to add Richard to our board,” said Tupperware Chairman and CEO Rick Goings. “His breadth of knowledge in global and emerging markets will contribute valuable expertise to our leadership team.”
