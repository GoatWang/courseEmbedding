Bio: Glen Hauenstein, PresidentBy Delta Air Lines · posted March 10, 2016 









 

Glen Hauenstein is President of Delta Air Lines, a position he assumed May 2, 2016. Glen was previously Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer.
As President, Glen oversees a team responsible for Delta’s marketing, network, revenue management, reservation sales, customer care, customer engagement and loyalty strategies. Glen also oversees Delta’s community engagement campaign, which inspires and enables thousands of employees to become more involved in the communities where they live and work.
Since joining Delta in August 2005, Glen has masterminded the transformation of the airline’s network from a primarily domestic operation to a nearly even mix of international and domestic service. He led a team in building a network that includes Delta flights to six continents and extended reach through a leading trans-Atlantic joint venture with Air France-KLM and Alitalia and a newly formed joint venture with Virgin Atlantic Airways. During this time, Delta substantially improved its revenue performance compared to its competitors and redesigned scheduling practices to build a consistently profitable network.
Under Glen’s leadership, Delta added more than 70 destinations to its worldwide network, including the first nonstop service to Africa by a U.S. carrier in nearly 20 years; substantially increased reach in Asia; invested in equity stakes in GOL and Aeroméxico to significantly enhance Delta’s presence in the fast-growing Latin region; and established a leading presence in New York at both LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport. He also oversaw Delta’s historic expansion at LaGuardia, which added 100 flights and 30 new destinations at New York’s premiere airport for business travelers, and the establishment of the trans-Atlantic joint venture with Virgin Atlantic that significantly increased Delta’s footprint on highly important business routes between the U.S. and the U.K.
Additionally, he has directed significant enhancements to Delta’s product both on the ground and in the air through the implementation of a new design standard for Delta Sky Clubs, the introduction of Sky Decks in Atlanta and New York-JFK, the launch of Economy Comfort seats and Wi-Fi service across all two-class aircraft, and the installation of full flat-bed seats across its widebody fleet. Under his leadership, Delta has also implemented significant enhancements to its technology and eCommerce capabilities, including the introduction of the popular Fly Delta app.
Before joining Delta, Glen served as Vice General Director for Alitalia, serving in the dual role of Chief Commercial Officer and Chief Operating Officer. In his role as Chief Commercial Officer, Glen led a major restructuring of Alitalia's route network, which improved schedule connectivity by more than 50 percent. Under Glen's leadership, Alitalia's revenues grew nearly 20 percent while the aircraft fleet was reduced by more than 10 percent.
Prior to joining Alitalia in 2003, Glen was Senior Vice President – Network for Continental Airlines, where he was responsible for planning and execution of the airline's schedule, fleet, pricing and revenue management strategies. Glen joined Continental in 1987 as International Controller.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
