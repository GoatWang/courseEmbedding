Baker also serves on the board of overseers of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota and on the executive committee of the Minnesota Business Partnership, an organization of CEOs from Minnesota’s top 100 companies focused on further enhancing the region’s quality of life. He is a board member of Parent Aware for School Readiness (PASR), a nonprofit organization to support the statewide expansion of Parent Aware, Minnesota’s Quality Rating and Improvement System. Baker and his wife Julie also chaired the 2012 Twin Cities United Way fundraising campaign.[citation needed]

Greetings, and welcome to Ecolab's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Monahan, Senior Vice President of External Relations. Mr. Monahan, you may begin.
Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.
Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's first quarter conference call. With me today is Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO, and Dan Schmechel, our CFO. As discussed, in our results along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor.
Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials stating that this teleconference, the discussion and the slides, including estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under Item 1A, Risk Factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.
Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, continued new business gains and product introductions drove acquisition adjusted fixed currency growth in our Global Institutional, Global Industrial and Other segments during the first quarter. These were partially offset by a narrowing sales decline in the Energy segment.
Product innovation and ongoing cost efficiency work more than offset the impact of higher-than-forecast delivered product costs, as well as soft economies and challenging end markets. These, along with lower interest expense, a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding, yielded the first quarter's 4% adjusted earnings per share increase.
Moving on to some highlights from the quarter and as discussed in our press release, consolidated acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales for our Global Institutional, Global Industrial and Other segments grew 3%, but were partially offset by a narrowing Global Energy sales decline. Regional fixed currency sales growth was led by Latin America and North America.
Reported operating margins decreased 20 basis points. Adjusted fixed currency operating margins decreased 10 basis points, as higher Energy segment profits and the price and volume increase were more than offset by the impact of higher delivered product costs, which include a $0.04 per share unfavorable currency hedge year-on-year comparison, representing a 5 percentage point negative impact to EPS growth in the quarter. Adjusted fixed currency operating income rose 2%.
The operating income gain, along with lower tax rate, lower interest expense and fewer shares outstanding, yielded a 4% increase in first quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share. We continue to see sluggish economic growth, higher delivered product costs and gradually improving fundamentals in the energy markets, and we expect these to generally continue through the balance of the year. We are, again, working aggressively to drive our growth, winning new business using our innovative new products and a sharp focus on sales execution, as well as driving pricing and cost efficiencies to grow our top and bottom lines at improved rates.

We expect improving volume growth and pricing across all of our business segments, and look for that to overcome delivered product cost headwinds, which slow as the year progresses, and yield operating income growth. We expect this focus on top line growth and margin expansion will yield full year adjusted diluted earnings per share, which we forecast in the $4.70 to $4.90 per share range in 2017, rising 8% to 12%, with the second half results outpacing the first half. We expect second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the $1.08 to $1.15 range, up 0% to 6%.
And now here's Doug Baker with some comments.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Thank you, Mike. So, the first quarter was certainly not our prettiest, but better than it looks and it does set us up for the full year delivery. Most things are on track, pricing, new business, innovation, investments, industrial business acceleration, energy recovery and FX stabilization, but we did have a few surprises.
Raws moved faster than forecast in the quarter, and we do believe will be net higher for the year. The good news is, our pricing also has traction and we believe will catch up on a dollar basis this year. Institutional sales were also soft. They were softer than expected, but they're better than they look.
So, if you take and adjust the base business for Swisher exits, which we have done because of margin and other issues, we're really growing at about 5% in North America and 4% globally. That's still slower than last year and slower than we expected. The issue primarily is that U.S. restaurant same-store consumption is down. (05:14) you got to go sell more business. We're not going to fix the U.S. foodservice market by ourselves and the division is already all over this driving significant new business campaigns, and we've got the right team to do this.
In total, Q1 was solid, not brilliant, but leaves us in position to deliver the year. The most important perspective on 2017 to understand is that the second half EPS ramp up is not nearly as steep as it appears. We need to do 14% EPS in the second half to reach our midpoint or $4.80. The first half run rate is really an 11% when you control for hedge and other non-recurring install and other expenses. So, we still have a step-up, but it's much more manageable moving from an 11% to a 14% than what may appear to be from like a 4% or 5% to a 14%.
So, the step-up requires sales to move from 2.5% in the first half to 5% in the second half, which I believe is quite doable. Here are couple of facts. Energy trajectory this year, 0% growth really in the first half, we expect them to grow at least at 5% in the second half. If you assume that, then II&O (06:27) needs to go from 3.5% in the first to 4% in the second.
We already have Industrial sales trajectory moving, it's accelerating. Institutional in the second half will lap the Swisher exits, and we've got a clearer view of timing on known wins and losses throughout the businesses, all of which are quite favorable to us. Net, we're making progress. We believe we're on track to go deliver a solid year. And so while Q1 won't win many style points, we do believe we're going to deliver a more Ecolab-like performance in 2017.
So, with that, I'll turn it back to Mike.
Michael J. Monahan - Ecolab, Inc.
Thanks, Doug. That concludes our formal remarks. As a final note before we start Q&A, we plan to hold our annual tour of our booth at the National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago on Monday, May 22. Looking further ahead, we also plan to hold our 2017 Investor Day on Thursday, September 7. If you have any questions, please contact my office.
And now, operator, please begin the question-and-answer period.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.
Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I guess, I'd love to get some more color on the Institutional business and the deceleration there. If Swisher bleeding off some of the lower margin volumes there is a big piece of it, I would have thought maybe that margins would have been better, and yet they were down quite a bit. So, any more color on the revenue, and any color on the margin to help us think how that trends the rest of the year? Thank you.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah, I think within the Institutional margin, you've got some of the noise I referred to earlier. You certainly have some impact from hedging, not in the U.S. margin particular, but U.S. global or in Institutional global. And you also have investments that have been made, particularly in plant equipment, to enable a new platform for solids, which is now coming online. It's in the margin, but not yet fully or even partially utilized in some cases, as we're rolling that out late in the second quarter. That's also making it a little worse. And then we have a few rollouts, where we've got the mechanical equipment expense or the ME expense in the business, but not the sales yet.
So, I would say if you look at Institutional margin, it looks like it's down, but there's a number of things, which really, I think, mask the underlying trend in their margin. And we expect, over the year, that their margin is going to start showing daylight between this year and last year. Pricing in Institutional was the best performer last year, and they're continuing on a very solid track this year. So, we're not really worried, ultimately, in Institutional margins.
Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC
And just the – any more color on the revenue deceleration?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Well, Gary, I mean it really comes down to mostly same store's consumption in U.S. restaurant. And that we've dealt with many times in the past. Restaurants come in and out in terms of how successful they're being. I don't think we're the only ones feeling this. We've tended to manage this better than others. The division got on it early. They have a number of what I would call high-energy new business efforts underway that are gaining traction, and that's the only way you sell through this is you got to go gain more business. We, by ourselves, can't force the restaurants to consume more, and they're really just reflecting the softness in their business.
Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. And then the quick follow-up. With Energy it sounds like on the verge of rebounding, can you just review for us how you're thinking today about operating leverage coming back to the business? I know there's some cost you'd stepped aside from that's probably come back, but how strong could incremental margins be as we look to the next 18 months and the revenue rebounds there? Thank you.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah. Typically, what we've seen in the past and what we expect this year is, let's call this the very early innings of a recovery. And we typically see really margin recovery and a lot of flow-through more in year two than in year one. And that's simply because as you're starting to see volume increase, you're simultaneously seeing some of the raw materials increase, pricing lags a bit. And so you end up with increasing sales, but not significant and sometimes even near-term decelerating margin before it starts expanding again.
You also have some costs you've got to add back. The largest cost this year that we're going to have to add back is compensation. So, it's a business because of performance, it hasn't earned bonus over the last several years. They are on track to earn bonus this year, and so we've got to rebuild that. We're also rebuilding some other comp where it matters because the industry heats up, it becomes much more competitive.

In total, for the year, I think we're pretty much where we thought we would be last call, and that is we're going to have some year-on-year sales growth in this business. Really, it's going to be a second half story as I alluded to in my opening remarks. And we also expect to be about even to have some minor potential accretion on the operating income line, too, as we start rebuilding comp and that somewhat offsets the volume benefit that we're going to see.

Our next question is from the line of John Quealy with Canaccord. Please proceed with your questions.
John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon. First question, diving back into the foot traffic topic. Inside Specialty and quick serve, did you also see that foot traffic issue or was it, as you've reported, more of a timing issue off a tough comp last year?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah. In Specialty, it's more a timing issue, and it's not even just the comp. We've got a lot of new business that's being put on in Specialty right now. They're going to have a very solid year. The quarter is really just sort of an aberration. We've gone through this. As I've always described, that's sort of a – the way they feed their village is through hunting elephants, and they've landed several, but they just haven't brought them back to the village. They're coming.
So, even there you've got some of the pressure as a consequence of they've installed a lot of these accounts, but they haven't yet started consuming our product in the first quarter. They're starting to in the second quarter, as they had to run out the old competitive product first. So, that also put pressure on the first quarter margin. There's going to be a little less pressure from that in the second quarter but still some, and all that pressure goes away in the second half as we realize the full effects of the new business volume in Specialty.
John Salvatore Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And as a follow-up, Doug, a broader question, more on people. Sounds like you're adding and rebuilding some channel in the core businesses. Equipment Care seems like it's constrained a bit just trying to get talent for those folks and then Energy, we're adding back some compensation. When you think about broader compensation costs for the platform into 2018 in what could be a rising wage environment, talk about the puts and takes and how you're planning for that. Thanks, guys.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah. I don't think we're going to see dramatic wage inflation in 2018 versus 2017. I mean, it's been fairly steady even over the last couple of years. I mean, many of the markets that we compete in are pretty full employment. And we've got several things going for us. One, we've got a great employment brand story. We've got great track record of growth. We're on the right stuff, stuff that matters to people who are joining the workforce in terms of our ability to talk about clean water, safe food, abundant energy and healthy environments. It really does resonate with people we're trying to attract.
And in terms of how do you offset the wage pressure, it's really through efficiency programs. So, as we've talked, we've invested a lot in field technology. That's bearing fruit and enabling us to help our team do more and handle more as we take the admin off them and automate that kind of work. We have many more programs like that now that we have the installed base, the field technology in their hands, and that's in the base business or the run rate.
So, those are really the steps we have to take, but I wouldn't be signaling that there's going to be some fundamental shift in wage pressures. We've had wage pressure. We expect to continue to have some wage pressure, but I don't think it's going to be at a dramatically different trajectory.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Sure. Now that you've broken out the Life Sciences business, can you maybe talk about medium-term expectations for revenue growth in that segment? And also, would you describe it as an above-average margin business, a business for you today or – what are your outlooks on margin as well?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah, Life Sciences business chase (16:30) is a big market. It's very well designed for us. It's dominated by large multinationals who have significant hygiene needs, as you might imagine. With a change in their business model, where they're going from long-run to shorter-run drugs and even cosmetics, changeover is important. And so our ability to help manage changeover time, water consumption, hygiene, all fits very much their needs, and our ability to do it consistently across the globe is also important.
So, as we look at this, it already is a higher-than-average margin business. We would expect it to remain so, given the fit for what we do and the critical needs that our customers have in this area. It's going to act a bit like Kay and then it's going to be lumpy, meaning we're going after large customers. They aren't all going to come on smoothly, so I think you're going to see some knockout quarters and other quarters that may be single digits, not double digits.
But in total, our expectation for this business is it's a double-digit organic growth business. We will look to see if there are smart acquisitions to be made. But that's to be seen. We're not relying on it. Fundamentally, we've got the capability we need and we can build what we don't, and we're getting after this. So, we're quite excited about this market and the potential.
David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Sure. And as a follow-up, Europe appeared to be a pretty weak region for you in the first quarter. Would you put Europe in that category of things that you expect to have a second half improvement? Or is this a bit more macro related and should continue to be sluggish here for the full year?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
No, I think Europe will do better as the year goes on. I mean, Europe is a combination of somewhat the environment, but I would also say, I think, there's some things we can do better in Europe. And certainly, we've got a couple of businesses pulling down the overall. I mean, as it stands, what I would say is, we expect Europe to have modest sales growth and modest OI ratio improvement for the year. And what we're going to work hard to do is improve that outlook as we go forward. I don't think it's going to dominate the news in terms of company performance, and I think the forward quarter is going to be better than this one.

Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.
Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hi. This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I just wanted to ask for a little more color on the growth trajectory within Industrial and just any changes that you're seeing in terms of lapping the headwinds, whether it's in heavy or mining.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah, I would say heavy, in total, I'll get down to organic, had growth in this quarter and we expect it to accelerate. Mining narrowed its decline, I mean it was low single digits, better than the fourth, which is clearly better than the third. We'd expect mining to start showing growth maybe as early as this quarter, more likely in the third quarter. So, I'm not sure it's all that important, but it's clearly making the progress we expect. And we expect heavy to continue to accelerate throughout the year. The comps for water, for heavy and mining, in particular, improve throughout the year. And so, we'd expect you're going to see overall acceleration in water as a consequence.

Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay, thanks. And then I know it's a bit early with the Anios deal, but just some early thoughts on how that integration is going and how you guys are looking at the opportunity set?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Under the heading you got to get the big ones right, we are. So, we really – we've liked Anios and admired it for a long time and for good reason. I think everything that we're learning is what a quality company and business it is. It's a lot easier to integrate a business that operates well because in all, the new stuff that you can bring to them and also the ideas you can take from them for the other businesses, it's going on a firm foundation. That's certainly what we have there. So, yeah, Anios, it's growing. We're seeing the operating leverage we expected. We're on track. We believe to deliver good synergy numbers. My hope is that we exceed it this year, we'll see. But yeah, we feel very good about it, still early days, but it's off to the right start.

Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you. Any thoughts on competing against Diversey or GE Water under the new owners? I'm curious whether that's behind the back half of the year new win improvement that you're talking about.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Well, I would certainly say I think anytime a company goes through a transition like the one that either GE Water or Diversey has to go through, i.e., a big ownership change, certainly causes distraction. We've seen it in the past. We expect to see it going forward, and we aren't shy about working to capitalize on it. We feel it's our responsibility. So, we have – let's just say, I talked about the Institutional efforts. We have very strong efforts everywhere to get after new business. We had a good first quarter from a new business standpoint. We had a very significant ratio against our key competitors in terms of win/loss, I would say stronger ratios than we had in 2016, which were quite strong as well, so we're all over this. I wouldn't say that's the reason we're confident we can accelerate, but it's certainly another, I guess, thought to put in the back. So, we'll accelerate.

And then costs are up for caustic, chlorine, propylene derivatives. Is that a big part of the cost headwind that you're talking about in the release? Or is it just one other thing among a lot of things?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah, I think caustic and propylene, in particular, caustic's up this year for us. It's a main raw material in our Institutional F&B businesses, in particular. We also have propylene, which is expected to peak in the second quarter as new capacity comes on, as we go forward. And I think propylene run-up was the surprise that we had early in this year versus expectations. Caustic, we expected to see go up, and it did go up.

Our next question is from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC
Good afternoon. So, two questions. One, can you give a little bit more detail on the retention issues you flagged with the technicians for the equipment repair services business? And secondly, with the run rate that you're seeing in the back half of this year, to get there, you flagged a bunch of sort of one-off-ish factors that you think will slip away and let the underlying momentum show up. As we're thinking about the bridge into 2018, do you think the back half is a good run rate? Or should some of these one-off lumpiness factors come back into the bridge?

Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Well, I'll do the second first question. No, I think the second half, it'd be a more realistic run rate model for what we would expect in 2018 in the first. I mean, the first had – the single largest impact is hedging, and hedging is going to account for literally like a 4.5 point with a 5-point drag on EPS, 5 percentage points, 500 basis points in the first quarter.
It's going to be 4 in the second, so 4.5 for the first half all by itself. It does go away. It's simply – these were foreign hedges that we put on in a rising dollar environment. It's really not that there are huge negative costs in the first half. We're just comparing against a year-ago period, where you had very favorable contributions from the hedging activity as the dollar was rising.
So, you got to go – we normalize, we look at our GP progression ex-hedge to understand really what's going on underneath, and it's all the stuff you would expect, which is why we're very quite confident in the second half. So, we do not expect next year to have year-on-year hedging impacts, simply because we aren't benefiting this year from them. So, there's nothing really to compare against.
The others were sort of oddities, and normally you don't get this many stacked up, but a lot of it's good news. We're investing in new technologies for institutional solids. We have a lot of new business wins, where we have a lot of installs focused on a specific quarter, where we're not realizing the volume from those installs, but you're realizing the cost. We typically don't have this many stacked up at one time and in a couple quarter period. I don't mind it, but it does make GP look artificially low for a period of time, and we know that goes away. Based on our history, this is unusual. If it happened again, I would explain it again and be happy about it again.
In terms of GCS, it's really not a retention change. Retention's always been a bit of a challenge there in the field workforce. We spend more than other people training our team. They get poached at times by competitors. There's not a change in retention of our employee base. What's changed is just how fast we've been able to add on new people to replace those that are leaving. And there, we got a little bit behind in Q4 and are catching up on Q1. I don't think this is going to be an ongoing challenge for the business. It's just a bit of a near-term challenge.

Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. Your QSR trends were a little slow this quarter compared to last year and some recent trends. Can you talk a little bit about that? A lot of new restaurant chains that are opening up and taking share away from old chains and just tell us how you're positioned with the new chains.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah. No, I think our QSR business, I'm not worried about at all. You're right, the quarter was a little bit soft in terms of growth rate, I mean, but it's still growing at what five and change. But it's going to accelerate throughout the year. We've sold a bunch of business in that – in QSR. And we've rolled it out a lot of it, we're going to start seeing the volume coming in, in the second quarter, and we'll enjoy 100% of it kind of at run rate in the second half. So, it's just a timing issue. It's nothing fundamentally wrong or to worry about our QSR business.
P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
And also, your Energy business, the peak was in 2014. Do you see that business going back to that level at some point? I'm not looking for a year or a date. Or is there something change structurally in that business, where customers are using less chemicals per barrel of oil or something like that? Is it all cyclical or you think there may be some structural change that has happened? Thank you.

Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah. I don't think we've seen the peak sales and OI in our Energy business for all time by any stretch. So, yeah, I think ultimately we'll reach and I would expect to exceed those levels down the road. Has there been change in the industry? Yeah, I would say all kinds. And in some areas, yeah, it's more efficient, we're more efficient. It can take less chemical in some cases, but there are other applications that take more. The net story that we've always talked about, which is easy oil transitioning to harder-to-get oil is still fundamentally the driver and that has not changed. So, that market continues to become more attractive over time as exploration picks up, which really isn't this year, but we think more meaningfully in 2018 and really in 2019.
They're going to have to go after the harder-to-find oil because the easy oil's gone and when they do that, the average, if you will, consumption of our technology per barrel will continue to rise and that's the fundamentals in the business. So, we plan on continuing to gain share. The market will recover. It's not going to be identical to the business that we had in 2014 because that industry continues to evolve and will continue to evolve, but I think we're in great shape to evolve with it and continue to increase our competitiveness.

Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thank you. Can you just walk us through the recent improvements in Food & Beverage? And also whether or not you believe you'll see the full benefits of the strengthening North American sales team throughout the balance of this year? Or do you think that's all going to also be a theme in 2018 as well?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah, look, I mean, several things. Yeah, I think F&B you saw acceleration. We expect continued improvement throughout the year as we go forward. So, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half. The team has been investing in more corporate account head count, I think, wisely. That business has been successful over a long period of time, probably analysis the team did said hadn't been expanding the corporate accounting probably as fast as we've been expanding share and if we want to continue to have capacity there, we got to add to it which they've been doing. And I think it's already showing that it was the right move. So, I don't know, I remain – yeah, I would expect that business to be better this year, and knowing what we know now, I would say we should at least hold that growth rate moving into 2018.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. And just very quickly on the Pest Elimination business, you mentioned you saw strong growth in North America and APAC, but can you just comment on the key puts and takes in Latin America and then Europe in both the short and long term? And also, just the overall longer-term view of that business, is that a segment which you'd consider doing M&A in, as well as any other initiatives? Thank you.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah, well, we love the Pest business, and so absolutely, on your M&A question, and we've done M&A and we would be a happy acquirer of a good business at a reasonable price. It's the second part of that equation that's been hard to find recently. People have been paying, in our mind, too rich of multiples in pest. Pest is attractive for many reasons, but one of its real attractiveness is its return on invested capital. It doesn't require a lot of capital. The only way you screw that equation up is you pay too much for a business. Now you've got too much invested and you've lost the heart or the secret to that business, in a sense. So, we're going to be wise people as it comes to M&A.

In terms of what's going on, it's really more a Europe story. Latin America's a relatively small business, and Europe is just sort of – you get paid as you serve. Our service calendar was a little out of whack in the first quarter. There's catch-up activity underway in the second quarter, and so I'm confident ultimately that all comes back around and I'm not really worried about the Pest business. I think those guys are doing the right things and they've got good momentum.

Our next question is from the line of Tim Mulrooney with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions.
Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC
Yeah. Good morning. I know the drilling business was up double digits in the fourth quarter. How did that do in the first quarter?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah. It was up double digits in the first quarter. I mean, grew faster, obviously, than in the fourth.
Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. Did the completion business, the other part of WellChem, did that follow suit in the first quarter? Is that continuing to improve as well, or is that piece of the business still in kind of a holding period?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah, WellChem was up just north of 20% in the first quarter. We expect it to continue to accelerate based on our projection of what's going to happen in terms of rigs and rig activity.
Tim M. Mulrooney - William Blair & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks. And just one more, shifting gears to your Global Industrial margins. It looked like they took a step back in the first quarter, I think down 60 basis points on a fixed currency basis. Was that driven by the re-segmentation? Or just generally, what are the main puts and takes there?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah. I would say the big noise in the Industrial business was hedge, particularly in the water business. If you get out – so in water, I think it was off 70 basis points, and 50 basis points of that was a hedge. So, that's the dominant story there. And that's a little bit just kind of one-time comparison. If you take it out, you start seeing the natural trajectory you would expect to see in our Industrial gross profit margin. They are getting pricing. Pricing accelerated in the first quarter for our Industrial businesses versus what they were able to get last year, so they're on track in terms of doing what they need to do to offset raws. Once the hedge comes off, which is after second quarter, I think you'll see a more natural view of their GP.

Our next question is from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your questions.
Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hi, good afternoon. Doug, this may be the first press release I've ever seen that referred to the Angolan kwanza as a component of the FX impact. Wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about within the Energy business, North America growing faster than international. How does that really affect the business? Is it really just where – in drilling and completion, where you guys have a significantly higher share within North America or does that extend to the production chemicals as well or the downstream piece? And then also curious about the margin impact of that. Is the international side higher margin than the North American side of Energy?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah, there's not a significant gross profit difference one to the other. And so here's what's going on. I mean, you would see this in other Energy-related businesses. So, North America went into whatever you want to call that, a recession, clearly much earlier than the balance of the world, and they're coming out of it earlier than the other parts of the world. So, if you will, the Vs just aren't lined up, U.S. versus international. It's really driven by structure of the industry.

Much of the international business or big hunks of it are owned by governments. It's used to pay their bills. So, when oil dropped, they actually worked to up their production. That works for a while, but without new CapEx, you can't keep at that pace forever. So you're starting to see that curtail and it will continue to curtail until they start drilling again. U.S. business dropped off dramatically in terms of its productivity when the oil price dropped because it's more privately owned, and so it reacts to the market and doesn't chase lower-margin business with more dollars, which other parts of the world will. But now you're seeing it rebound as the oil price rebounds and they're starting to chase the opportunity.
The big picture in the oil market, I would say, is that you're starting to see a rebalance of supply and demand. So, demand this year is projected to be 1.2% growth, and production right now in the first quarter was down 0.4%. So, that's the stuff that everybody needed to see. We're going to see oil bounce around, we always thought, we talked $45 to $55. We didn't expect a big recovery this year in terms of oil price. We think that's more a 2018 story. We also don't see oil falling off a cliff either. And so I think there's slow improvement in activity, which we're seeing is – what we're going to continue to see until we start seeing prices more in the 60s and north, and there's a great deal of confidence that that's really going to stay.
When you see that, I think you're going to see a big upturn in activity, and that's when you're going to see even faster growth than we're projecting now for our business. Good news is, though, our Energy business, it's no longer a drag on the business. I think it'd be minorly accretive, but just being neutral is a significant improvement over the last two years and going forward, this business can be a very strong piece of our growth story.
Michael J. Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC
All right. And then turning over to the Institutional division, I was wondering if you could comment on the impact of the travel ban as well as the strong dollar on the hospitality industry and the tourism industry in North America.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah, I don't – I would say this. Room demand isn't – it slowed a bit in North America. It was better in Europe and parts around the world, so I just don't think the lodging isn't really the story. I really think it's what we talked about earlier. What we saw that was unusual and correlates with sort of what we see in our metrics was consumption was down in U.S. restaurants.
It wasn't negative, it was just much slower growth than we've seen in the past. And that's a hole or volume that we thought we were going to see that we didn't see, but we believe it's overcome-able by getting after and stepping on new business activity, which the team's done. And I would just say this, our U.S. Institutional team is very strong, they're very good when focused and they're very focused.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please proceed with your questions.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Yes. Thank you. The first question is just around M&A. Given some of the larger assets have changed hands already, maybe just refresh us on your ability or appetite to do a larger deal versus sort of return of cash at this stage.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah, on our appetite, we'd be very comfortable doing a deal of size as long as we feel it's going to be a good deal for us. The story about the asset, just as when is quite complicated. So, I would just say that doesn't change my view. I think I even said a year ago, I'd be surprised if we do a big deal in the very near term and quite surprised if we don't do one over the next five, six years. I think that my view still holds there. So, our appetite isn't diminished at all. I think we just go in eyes wide open and try to fully understand what the risks are and the challenges are in any deal and as a consequence, what price makes sense.

Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Great. And just a follow-up, you mentioned earnings were back-end loaded. Obviously, there's a lag in terms of your pricing. Could you just remind us, how many of your contracts are cost-plus? Is there a greater lag on pricing in certain segments or business lines versus others? Thank you.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Really in Energy, it's about 30%. Water's just a little south of that in terms of percent. Those are where we have the big cost-plus contracts, there's a few others spattered across the other segments, but they're not significant. But, yeah, those will always lag. I mean, they lag going down, and they lag going up simply because you've got to realize the cost in your business before you're going to be – before you're able to price for them.

Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. A lot of the questions have been answered, but let me just follow up on the strength that you guys are seeing in Paper and textile, particularly Paper, the market that I know you weren't very enamored with when you bought Nalco. But since they've been doing better and picking up momentum over the last several quarters, so I'm just wondering if it's just better execution or if the market's coming back and kind of what you're feeling about that business these days.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Well, since all my prior stance seems to have worked, I'm going to tell you I'm still not enamored with the business because it seems to spur them on. Now I would say that's not really – where we were on that is, I just said as a stand-alone, we probably wouldn't have bought it. But as a business that came along, it was a pretty darn good business in many respects.
We haven't changed our feeling on it. It's got a great team, and I think the team has gotten better. So, how are they growing it? It's called the old-fashioned way. New business, they've had new technology. They're gaining share, they're doing smart things in terms of getting their portfolio to be more focused on where you see growth in that industry like tissue, towel and boxes versus newsprint and other materials, so those have been smart moves. They don't happen overnight, so it's been an ongoing effort.
So, yeah, you've seen sales acceleration. As they keep selling new business, they're going to keep seeing sales acceleration. And I think they've managed the challenges successfully. So, I don't – that's the story there. Textile is not that fundamentally different. If you sell new business, good things happen, and if you don't, they don't.

The restaurant comment you made about sort of foot traffic not coming back as strongly or being maybe not down, but certainly slower. We've heard some version of that, not just from you, but from other industry participants. Going back to really the recession, if not all the way back to 9/11, is there a secular trend here that people are just not eating out as much around the world? And should we start thinking about this industry as basically being a flattish industry, where any growth you guys get is a bonus or not?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, same-store sales, look, I don't think is the singular metric that drives our business – or, excuse me, traffic. Traffic's been down, I think, every year since 2008. I keep asking the team, is there one person left to walk into our restaurant based on these metrics. Clearly, if you look at the sales in that industry, they were also up over most of those years. And yeah, there are changes going on in that industry. They're not dramatic. I don't think they're going to hit huge inflection points, but we watch them. So, certainly there's higher percent of takeout than there was 10 years ago. I'd expect in 10 years, there'll be even a higher takeout than there is right now. So, you see some of these changes over time.

With that said, the challenges in that industry simultaneously continue to increase. People continue to get into that business, start new concepts, grow their business, food safety, clean labels, i.e., organic food without additives and the like. All these things are also impacting that business and our customers, and our ability in food safety is more important even today than it was 5 years ago and 10 years ago. So, I guess – I think when I take all of the shifts that are going on in that industry and net it out, it's still quite an attractive market for us, both in the U.S. and around the world. And we have significant share possibilities, not only in the U.S., but in particular, around the world, that we continue to get after.

Last question, sort of, bookkeeping question, what should be the tax – what's a good tax rate assumption for you guys for the year? Is it the 25% that you did in this quarter?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah. I think we've said 24% to 25%.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC
24% to 25%. Okay. Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on Energy, in particular, around the pricing, clearly you guys have had to concede a little bit of price and I think that was even a bit of a factor in 1Q. Doug, I was just wondering, when the price comps and the healthier customers get to the point where that could inflect at least neutral, if not positive, is that part of your forecast for the rest of this year when you talk about the flat – the top line being flat to up modestly?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yes. So, last year, we talked, we had probably lost about 3 points of top line to price in that business. And it started getting modestly better as we went throughout the year last year. We saw continued improvement in the first quarter. Second half, I would say it would be neutral to positive on price.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Interesting. And then just regarding the double-digit increases on the drilling side of the business, there's just been this trend in the industry to make kind of the fracked wells, in particular, in North America consume more sand and make them much more efficient than they've been even a year or two ago. Does the same go for chemical? Are you – is your double-digit increases in your drilling revenues driven by the number of wells or the amount of chemical that's consumed by the new technologies being used in the wells?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah. I would say, right now, it's more a reflection of rig count increase and activity increase. Yeah. I would say several things. I mean, what we've been working on products and programs and have them, that reduces the need for companies conducting a frac in terms of how much water they need, how much sand they need, et cetera, to conduct this. Less is better.
And we'd rather cannibalize ourselves than get cannibalized. Some instances, it takes less chemical, and there are other applications where it would take more of our product to get that same result. I think, over time, I mean, this kind of shifting of how much technology it takes to get an end result, I think, if you look over any long period of time, it typically gets more efficient. We would expect that to continue to be true, but challenges continue to grow. And so the need for technology evolves.
So, I had somebody try to say that fracking's going to disappear, and I do not think that's the way to think about it. It's going to continue to evolve and change, but there are plenty of opportunities for us to introduce new programs that bring great benefit to those conducting a frac that's going to represent new opportunity for us even as others may dissipate slightly.

Our next question is from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Hi. Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered. I just have a couple nits I want to ask about. Doug, how do you feel about the organic growth in the Healthcare business? It's definitely on a better trajectory than it's been prior to this Anios acquisition. How do you feel about the existing business and the ability to improve the growth over there over the next several years?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah, well, Healthcare, yeah, clearly has improved. I mean, it's a 5% underlying organic rate, if you peel out Anios and the other. And, look, I think the team's doing a very good job. I mean they went through and are doing a lot of integration work that started even before, obviously, the close of Anios. They continue to drive and accelerate their underlying business. So, the work that we did and the work that team did around getting clarity around the program, clarity around the message for customers, adding resources where they needed them, we've continued to add additional talent into that team and it's paying dividends. So, where am I? Yeah, I'm proud that the team's been able to build this up to 5%. And then the other side of me is greedy, and I think that team's capable of doing even more, and it's only because I think they're great. So, 5% is good, 7% is better, that's our focus.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. And just a follow-up, where does the Swisher integration stand? We're still calling out costs for the integration and stuff on that a little while after I would have expected.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah, us too. It took us longer to exit the hygiene business than we had planned, which delayed our exit from a number of facilities because we had to continue to operate it until we could move it. And so it was a couple quarters after we had thought we were going to be able to move it. So, that delayed a number of things. That's why you're seeing some of the charges come through now versus, say, third quarter of last year, et cetera. In total, I think the Swisher noise is really going to be out of the business come third quarter as we go through. So, then it's just going to be a completely natural part. The exiting and the comparison with hygiene and all the other stuff will be out of the base.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.

Our next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your questions.
Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - G.research LLC
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Doug, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the different categories in Food & Beverage, mostly trends that you see in dairy, in farms, in protein. Can you help me understand what is happening there?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Well, the most significant probably underlying change would be in dairy. Clearly, dairy was under a lot of pressure. The market's improved somewhat. I don't know that all dairy producers would call it a victory yet, but it certainly helps as we've gone through. Food continues to be pressured by consolidation. There's a lot of, obviously, big headline acquisitions that have been made in that industry. Some others that seem to be contemplated, but not consummated. And brewery beverage is strong and that's more a continuing story. So, the inflection one would be mostly in our dairy business.
Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - G.research LLC
Do you see that decline in dairy being impacted by the fact that there is negative advertisement, justifyingly so, about cow's milk? It's not supposed to be good for you. Is that having an impact?

Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
I don't – you know what, I don't believe so. I honestly haven't seen those advertisements, but of course, I live in a state that borders Wisconsin, so we wouldn't likely be airing them in this market. So, anyway, no, I would say if anything dairy has gotten better because it was so depressed. I have not seen any impact from the advertising you talked about.
Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - G.research LLC
Okay. And then lastly, you said that the world of energy has changed a lot since 2014 and you expect that it will become substantially bigger over time. How about the margin? Has the change affected the margins in one direction or another?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
I don't think we feel that our ability to earn the type of margins that we were earning or targeted has changed. So, the margins have been most impacted near term just by loss of volume on a fixed overhead base, particularly in plants. And so I think as this business comes back, which we expect it to, as we continue to roll out technology and the needs for technology continue to grow as old oil becomes new oil, which is harder oil and needs more technology, we think we'll continue to see margin expansion.
Now, that's all predicated on us being a great value-added supplier to our customers. Only reason people are going to pay margin to us is if they get great value, and I think our team understands that. Stuff we have on the drawing board, we are quite pleased with. Stuff that we're launching, we think has got great runway. So, I mean, we remain bullish about this business.
Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - G.research LLC
Okay, great. Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hi, Doug. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. I was wondering if you could describe some of the strategic rationale for carving out the Life Sciences division. Earlier you gave some pretty favorable organic growth estimates. I was just wondering if you could also add in maybe some of the industry structures, the competitors you'll be going against and maybe your thoughts on inorganic opportunities in that new sub-segment.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Well, the reason we broke it out is it creates focus. So, previously, we've been serving the Life Sciences industry in part from the F&B business and in part from the Healthcare business. And both were doing a good job with the tools at hand, but neither had a complete set of tools. So, if anything, once we decided to do it, we wondered why it took us so long. That's a shot at myself. So, getting focused, I mean, think the Kay business going after QSR, textile, going after textile, we have many examples of this. That's how we succeed. So, now we've got a freestanding business. It was a significant investment last year and we're still paying some of the incremental investment this year in the first half before we fully lap it.
And the second, has enabled us to have dedicated corporate account teams, dedicated marketing teams, dedicated corporate account finance teams to really understand how to develop and position programs to specifically meet this industry's need.
The structure is multinationals, which is what we like, fragmented competitive set, which is what we like. So, by and large, what we're competing against is a lot of regional folks who are offering services to this industry.
And so our ability to put together a global program we believe will give us the same kind of advantage here that it does in other industries we serve because certainly the pharma need for consistency, you might imagine, would be fairly high in areas that we're serving. So, I don't know if that helps give you color. Big business, plenty of opportunity. We can grow without doing M&A. If we see M&A that works, we'll certainly be quite open to it.

Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.
That's great. And then just you cited higher delivered cost across to your segments. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on this specific breakdown on 1Q and maybe the cadence of expectations, how you'd plan to address those for the remainder of the year.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah. I think if you look at – it's kind of a combination of just underlying commodity costs starting to rise and then transaction costs and foreign currency that – because a lot of these are U.S. dollar denominated, so if I'm buying them in reals, et cetera, I got to pay a higher price given the devaluation over time. We see that rising, ironically peaking around the second quarter. Part of this is the propylene conversation we had earlier, but still being somewhat a year-on-year drag in three and four, which is not at the same level, but overcome by pricing.
And I talked earlier that we have pricing traction. Pricing is never easy. We're getting it. Institutional, I think was ahead on ramping up its pricing activity last year, trying to get in front of the caustic moves and some of the other stuff they knew was coming. And you see the Industrial businesses now accelerating their pricing activity, which they need to do, given the increased raw materials facing them. So, I guess, we're confident we're going to end up with some daylight between the costs we realize incremental on raws and FX related to raws and the pricing that we're going to get.
Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.

Thank you. Our final question today is from the line of Dan Dolev with Instinet. Please go ahead with your questions.
Dan Dolev - Instinet LLC
Hey, thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about, is there any chance that some of the weakness in Institutional could be because of a tougher competitive environment? I mean, specifically, we know at least some companies that used to be traditionally in other businesses like uniform rental are starting to make a bigger push into like hygiene and some of your legacy product. Can you maybe talk about that competitive environment? Thanks.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah, I guess – no, I would not say – I mean, look, we do a lot of analysis on our business to understand retention, new business, acquisition and sort of current customer consumption. Retention really – I mean, if you look at our historic retention rates, I mean, we're under – we're better retention rates than we've been historically in that business.
So, if it was competitive activity, you would see it in worsening retention rates, and that's just not what we're seeing as really the story. The big dip is in kind of same-store consumption. It's not a loss of product placements, if you will, in those units. It's a loss of consumption across those products. And that's the story. So, we aren't – we don't believe that we're infallible or unbeatable or anything else, we pay a lot of attention to competition. I just don't think that's the story.
Dan Dolev - Instinet LLC
But do you even see that traditional uniform rental competitor in – when you compete for business, or are they not in the same categories?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Ecolab, Inc.
Yeah, I don't know that that's really a huge piece of emphasis for them, to be quite honest. I mean, they just made a large acquisition. They've been quite successful in the businesses they're in. I just – I don't know that that's really an avenue they're going. I don't know that it lends itself. I mean, that's a little bit – they're a much better executor, I would say. They're a good company, does a very good job in the businesses they're in, but it's hard to take people in one set of business and make them kitchen hygiene people just because they're in the back of the restaurant. That was Swisher's play. It wasn't very successful, although I grant you, and I think the company you're talking about is a much better executor.

Dan Dolev - Instinet LLC
I agree with that. Thank you very much.

Greetings, and welcome to Ecolab's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Michael Monahan, Senior Vice President, External Relations. Thank you. You may begin.
Michael J. Monahan - Senior Vice President External Relations
Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ecolab's first quarter conference call. With me today are Doug Baker, Ecolab's Chairman and CEO; and Dan Schmechel, our CFO.
A discussion of results, along with our earnings release and the slides referencing the quarter's results and our outlook, are available on Ecolab's website at ecolab.com/investor. Please take a moment to read the cautionary statements on these materials, stating that this teleconference, the discussion and slides include estimates of future performance. These are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projected.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ are described in the section of our most recent Form 10-K under item 1A, risk factors, and in our posted materials. We also refer you to the supplemental diluted earnings per share information in the release.
Starting with a brief overview of the quarter, continued attractive new account gains and new product introductions drove good fixed currency sales growth in our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments during the first quarter, nearly offsetting a decline in Global Energy sales.
New business and ongoing cost efficiency work led the strong adjusted fixed currency operating margin expansion, more than offsetting the impact of soft economies, weak oil prices and currency headwinds. These, along with fewer shares outstanding, drove the adjusted earnings per share increase before currency translation.
While 2016 is proving to be a challenging year, we continue to focus on the same fundamental strategies that have successfully driven our strong growth record, providing the best products and service for our customers to give them the best results and lowest operating costs. They delivered again in the first quarter, and we expect them to deliver for the full year 2016.
Looking to the second quarter, we expect our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments to continue to show solid acquisition adjusted fixed currency growth, outpacing their markets in soft international economies, as they leverage investments we have made to further improve sales and service force effectiveness and profitability and more than offset lower results from our Global Energy business.
We look for the second quarter earnings per share to be in the $1.03 to $1.11 per share range, with that range including approximately $0.08 per share or 7% of unfavorable currency translation and impact from the Venezuela deconsolidation, as we continue to aggressively drive business growth.

For the full year, the Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments are expected to continue to show solid fixed currency growth. Global Energy segment expectations have softened. Global Energy sales are expected to be on the lower end of our range, down upper single digits versus last year. While the dollar has weakened somewhat, at this early point in the year, we are maintaining our earnings per share forecast for 2016 to reflect the uncertain currency trends and business environment.
Net, we continue to expect to outperform our markets in 2016, while also investing in the key drivers for future, sustainable above-average earnings growth. We expect our consolidated results to show improving comparisons in the second half and continue to look for adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $4.35 to $4.55 range.
Moving to some highlights from the first quarter. And as discussed in our press release, reported first quarter earnings per share were $0.77. On an adjusted basis, excluding special gains and charges and discrete tax items from both years, first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share decreased 4% to $0.77, reflecting an $0.11 or 14% currency headwind.
The adjusted earnings per share growth was driven by delivered product and other cost savings, cost efficiencies and the lower share count. Our consolidated fixed currency acquisition adjusted sales were modestly lower, as our Global Institutional, Industrial and Other segments grew 4%, but were offset by lower Global Energy sales. Regional sales growth was led by Latin America and Europe. Adjusted fixed currency operating margins showed strong growth, expanding 60 basis points.
In 2016's difficult environment, we are focused on driving new business gains by helping customers to lower their costs. We are using our industry-leading product innovation and service strengths to help customers achieve the best results and lowest operating costs and, through these, aggressively drive new account gains across all of our segments. We expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share in the $1.03 to $1.11 range, reflecting a currency translation and Venezuela deconsolidation drag of approximately $0.08 or 7%. Consolidated results are expected to improve with the second half outperforming the first half. We look for our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share in the $4.35 to $4.55 per share range.
In summary, despite a very challenging global economic and market environment, we expect to continue to deliver solid fundamental results in 2016. We remain confident in our business, our markets and our people as well as our capacities to meet our aggressive growth objectives over the coming years.
And now, here's Doug Baker with some comments.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everybody. Look, we had a solid quarter. We're on track for a full year delivery within our forecasted range. All of our sectors are handily outperforming their markets and competition, and we continue to gain share in all of these areas.
For the year, there are natural puts and takes. We look at our Institutional, Industrial and Other business segments. They have been above expectations at this point, driven by new business, innovation, cost savings, very good execution. This is driving improving top line and improved margin performance. Energy is heading to the lower side of our expectation in spite of share gains and savings initiatives, and this is really driven by an even tougher market than expected. This will pass. We continue to believe, though, that the upturn is really a 2017, not a 2016 story, i.e. the oil and gas market upturn.
If we froze FX at today's rates, FX would be less of a negative than planned, would be roughly $0.28 versus $0.38 negative. But given the fluidity of the FX situation, Brazil political environment, you've got the British exit vote, China, etc., we think it's too early and unwise to bake this into our forecast. Importantly, our forecast also continues to include significant investments in systems, R&D, talent initiatives which are all in total greater than last year, which I would remind you was greater than the prior year, and is, I think, a very strong indication of our confidence in the future which is high and we believe for good reason.

So, as we look at the future, we know that the temporary double headwinds of energy and FX will abate. We don't know exactly when, but they will pass. Even with them, we've been doing well and outperforming markets. We do know though that our plan and our position, we think, are spot on for the future. So, clean water, safe food, abundant energy and healthy environment is even more relevant going forward than it has been in the past 5 or 10 years.
We have a stronger competitive advantage position now, we believe, given our recent new innovations and our focus on driving excellent outcomes at low cost because of reduction in footprints on CO2 and water. We also have very strong execution momentum. Our teams are on it. They're doing a great job. They're driving new business. We had another very strong new business quarter in the first quarter, and we have promising new business bets in businesses like life sciences and geographies like MEA, and there are plenty more.
And finally, we got a culture in the team that knows how to deliver. For all these reasons, we feel very good about where we are, how we're going to get through the year, the position that we're going to be in to drive continued growth beyond.
So, that's my opening. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike, who will move on into Q&A.
Michael J. Monahan - Senior Vice President External Relations
Thanks, Doug. That concludes our formal remarks. Operator, would you please begin the question-and-answer period?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question is from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC
I guess, the first question. Oil has rebounded a lot off the lows. It doesn't sound like, from you or others, that that's going to be enough to really impact the trend in the Energy business. But how should we think about raw materials? It seems like that's probably somewhat more of a headwind by the second half of the year, assuming prices hold. And is it fair to say that the Energy business isn't seeing any real benefit yet from the move off the bottom? Thanks.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think the recent move in oil price, I think, look, the best predictions I read forecasted that oil would move up in anticipation of increased demand for the summer. It was likely going to weaken over the summer because really what needs to drive the fundamental price of oil is a rebalancing of supply and demand. And nobody really believed that was going to happen until towards the end of this year. And until that happens, you're not going to really, we believe, have sustained improvement in oil price or increase – maybe we shouldn't call it improvement – increase in oil price.
In terms of raw materials, I guess our forecast has always had two views; one, that raws likely move before we see the impacts of higher oil prices in our energy services business. That's in our forecast. So, in the back half, we have some uptick in raws included, not monstrous because we still have favorability in the first half, but that abates and goes away as we think the energy market starts correcting and healing.
So that's our view right now. I don't think you're going to see material increase in activity, which is what's really needed to drive our energy services volume until at the earliest very late this year, but most likely we aren't going to see the impact until 2017.
Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Great. And then the follow-up. You cited that energy is maybe a little bit weaker, but have you seen anything else change much in the last quarter? And I guess, I'm just thinking through the thought process of not flowing through the FX. I understand there's a lot of uncertainty, but a lot of data has pointed to weaker global growth. Are you seeing that impacting the businesses or are you staying conservative at this point? Thank you.

Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think if you look in our total business mix, we called out mining is under a lot of pressure, which isn't a real surprise given everything else you read. And this is really the water technologies that we sell into the world's mining operations. I mean, that business is down double digits. So, you'll see spotty things. China, particularly on the heavy industrial side, is soft.
So, our business reflects what you're going to read day-to-day about the global economy. But overall, the model, as it has always proven, is fairly resilient. And so, we have puts and takes. We also have pretty strong business performance from Institutional in North America, in particular. There are oil dividends, which we've talked about, which are certainly lower raw materials which you see flowing through our II&O segments, which is one of the reasons gross profit is up.
The other reason, obviously, is innovation. So, I mean I don't think the other surprises are really outliers nor will they dictate, I think, the year. And even the energy market softness, I would say it's worse than we anticipated. I would still think Energy is likely going to come in with the range we talked about. It's just going to be at the bottom end of it.
Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thank you.

Our next question is from Nate Brochmann with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.
Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC
Yeah. Good. Hello, everyone. So, Doug, just kind of following up on that with the energy question, like, do you feel that, like at this point, while we might have the lingering behavioral impacts and obviously still some pricing pressure as you help out your customers, but do you feel like at this point that you kind of, that we're in the later innings of getting your arms around kind of that we're getting close to a true bottom in that?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, we're certainly in the later innings. I'm not unwise enough to pretend to know if the bottom is 30 days ago or 90 days in front of us or 6 months in front of us. But certainly, we're in the later innings. And I think the data I pay most attention to is where are we on the supply/demand curve. There's virtually no inventory storage capabilities globally for oil, so this thing reacts wildly to very small changes in supply and demand. And that is still projected to start coming in very near balance at the end of the year, and I believe ultimately that's going to be the data that dictates when this thing completely turns. So we're, what are we, 18 months into this? And we're saying probably have six to nine months to go, so certainly we're in the later innings.
Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay. Great. And then, with the other businesses, too, like particularly on the Institutional side, on a relative basis, I definitely get the relative strength compared to the industry trends. But with the end markets still kind of being a little bit sluggish, I was wondering what it's going to take to get that Institutional business more in that sustained 6%-plus growth range that I know that we're hopeful for. Like, do we need the end markets to do that? Or are there certain initiatives in place that do that by themselves even in the sluggish end market environment? Thanks.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I would say in Institutional Nate, I mean, the Institutional business itself or even the sector, Institutional business was north of 6% last year. It was 5% in this quarter, but expected to be 6%-plus for the year. And that was really a quarter phenomenon. That business is operating in the 6% to 8% band that we've talked about, and I think the team has done a good job and the team will tell you and I'll tell you they still have a lot of opportunity to get after growth opportunities and margin opportunities, particularly outside of North America, which they're focusing on. So that business is running as well as it's run in terms of its financial performance for many, many years.

Our next question is from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC
Good afternoon. Two quick ones. Can you flesh out a little bit the comments about Latin America? And secondly, can you give us an update on how you're thinking about the M&A pipeline, particularly any chances to increase your footprint in the emerging markets?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I'll do it. The expanded footprint in emerging markets, we've operated now obviously for a while, and we talked about 160 before the merger, and we're 170-plus post merger. However, we didn't have equal capabilities in all these markets. And in particular, we made a break-out investment move in MEA about 18 months ago. And this cost us margin obviously last year and even a little bit early this year, but it has driven improved results. Previously, we really ran MEA as part of Europe.
Our history, whenever we make these break-out organizational moves, we did it with food, retail, breaking it out from KAY QSR. We did it many years ago with healthcare outside of what was then called EPP, which is our janitorial business. There are plenty other examples here. Both participants benefit, improved focus, and I think you're seeing that MEA has accelerated since we've broken it out, We have increased focus. We have a handle on our supply chain challenges and opportunities. And I would also point out Europe has done better since we've taken MEA out as well. Just simply it drives increased focus on the region that's left. So, that would be a good example of how we are investing in what we think are critical markets long term.
Latin America, we grew by basically 10%, or 9% I guess in the quarter. We continue to do well in a region that's obviously under a lot of pressure, Brazil being the most notable headline owner right now. And I would say it's two things. I think we've always tried to focus on what matters most in these areas. Our food and beverage business, which is important throughout all those economies, is up 19%. Even our paper business, through some big wins, is having a very strong quarter. Water is up double digit down in that market as well, and we believe those businesses in particular are going to be very strong players in Latin America for a long time to come, and that's what our focus has been and is paying off.
Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC

Our next question is from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Sure. Within the Energy segment, did you see any change in client behavior around pricing? And just to check, would you still expect pricing in the production side of that segment to still see a modest decline in 2016?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well, I just – we didn't see a change in customer behavior towards pricing, which would be accepting price increases. So, no, they are under pressure and this is not unusual, and they are certainly putting pressure on us. You got competitive pressure as well. Pricing still remains, in total, in the low-single digits and we expected to be there for the year, but it's real pressure and a challenge.
And what I would say is that's an average. So, you've got some much more material givebacks in certain situations in other areas where we've been able to hold price either because we have very, very unique technology and a high need, or it's a customer not under the same pressure given their geographic position. So, I would expect you'll continue to see that.
I think the other things that we're seeing in that market, I don't know if they're surprising, customers are turning off programs and services. We've expected some. We're seeing a little more than we expected, but that's always a temporary issue. And so, people will take some risks, particularly in North America, where the huge market pressure is really coming to bear.

And the business outside of North America continues to perform at a much higher rate, simply because the market really reacts here and everywhere else. People are typically pumping oil to meet builds, not necessarily to meet capital demands and trying to make money. So, we'd expect to continue to see that. We're remaining physically disciplined.
Some of the pain is self-induced. Last year, we had only $4 million in bad debt write-offs. In the Energy business, we expect it to be greater this year, but still in the single-digit millions, which is pretty low given the size of that business. And a lot of it is because the Energy team has been very, very acutely aware of the risks there. We're putting customers on cash-on-demand quite early. We're staying out of some bankruptcy situations, customers where we don't believe there's a future either before or after bankruptcy, we are walking from if they won't go to cash on delivery, etc.
So, those are the type of steps that we're taking, and they accentuate some short-term pain. But ultimately, even within the year, we think they're going to be fiscally responsible moves because we're just going to avoid some big write-offs and other challenges.
David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Sure. Thank you for the – for all that color. Just a quick add-on to that. Since you spoke about the trends outside the U.S. being positive, what was the net new business contribution or the share gain contribution that you saw in Energy in the first quarter? Thank you.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, net, $55 million, roughly.
David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you very much.

Our next question is from John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Hi. Good afternoon. First question. In Energy, can we hold EBIT margins here in the back half of the year? Or can you, big picture, just quantify that for us? Are we – or is this a good rate for the foreseeable future?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Look, I mean, the first quarter seasonally is always the low margin. I mean, for the year, the margin is going to be greater than what Energy showed in the first quarter.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Okay. And the bigger picture issues, we're in a better oil environment, so we don't really need to revise longer-term assumptions downward, I guess, is my broader question there.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
No, I – look, I mean, we're going through a world-class correction in the oil market. And if you compare it to the last four corrections, which typically were more of a 12 months to 18 months and this is certainly going to be – exceed 24 months in our forecast, this is a more severe correction. But, no, coming out of this, we – look, the demand for oil has not really been the question.
What's happened is we've been in an oversupply situation, which has crushed price and now will crush activity which will lead to under supply. And I mean, that's what we believe is going to happen. And you're going to see prices move up, activity increase and the demand for our services increase as well. Right now, everybody is focusing on the easiest oil they can find. And to meet future demand, they're going to have to start reverting and getting back after the harder oil, which is what ultimately drives higher demand in our portfolio. We believe that story is intact.
John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And very quickly as a follow-up under the healthcare business just holding its own. Is this going to be a type of year where we're just looking for, sort of, sideways healthcare? Or are we going to hit an inflection point at some point on the acquired divestiture adjusted change? Thank you, guys.

Michael J. Monahan - Senior Vice President External Relations
Yeah. Healthcare, I think, is going to strengthen throughout the year. They had a very, very good new business quarter in the first quarter, second best that they have and measured. So, we feel good about what's going on. They are now – the recall that really started last year in the third quarter, is fully behind them. And while that wasn't a huge top line hit, it was a huge hit in terms of focus and energy of the group. And now, that's fully done, fully resolved and moving forward. I expect good things out of healthcare this year. They'll continue to improve. It's not going to be a dramatic inflection in one quarter, but I think you'll see sequential improvement.

Our next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah, hi. Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just to, I guess, make sure we're all on the same page on the Energy side, can you just remind us of the mix in your Energy business again between downstream, production and so forth at the beginning of the year? And then, what's baked into each of those categories in terms of assumptions to get you to your lower end of upper-single digit decline for this year?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well, the WellChem is about 10%, heading to 8%. The production, or OFC business, is about 60% and downstream is 30%. And downstream is growing. WellChem is going to be under pressure again this year. It's likely going to bake towards the second half because it's starting to run into where they were down 50% in the third and fourth quarter. As you go forward, the OFC business will be under some pressure, but the drama isn't anywhere near what you see in WellChem.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And I guess...
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Last year, we were down 8% in total. And we said this year that we would expect to be not to have as much top line pressure, but it may get to 8%. What I've indicated is we're at the lower end of our expectations, so high-single digit sales declines this year like last year, maybe a little less, but in line with that.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.
And I guess, if you were to try and characterize the main differential between when you gave the guidance in late February versus today, like, I guess, which one area gets moved to get you to that lower end and maybe more?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I would say WellChem is going to be a little worse than we thought and OFC is going to be a little worse than we thought. Downstream is going to be in line with what we thought.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit, I think you mentioned in your comments, the new business bets like life sciences. I was wondering if you were – if you could elaborate a little bit more on that and maybe if there's any other new businesses like this that you're referring to.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I'll elaborate on life sciences. Life sciences is a business that we competed in for a long time, but we did it as part of the work in our F&B business and some of the function was driven out of our healthcare business. We've taken those two pieces of business and created a focused division on the life sciences market, i.e. pharma, cosmetics, etc.
The changes in that business and their needs match very much what we can do. So, it's a market that's dominated by large multinationals. They're getting to shorter runs, need to run at higher efficiencies, cleaning in place technologies is important in that market and the core competencies that we have. So, a lot of the things that we do there match well.

I would say, when this business is run as a small piece of two other businesses, it performed well, we believe, with focused, enhanced capabilities, R&D, etc., that we are going to be able to up the performance of this business handily, just as we've done in other markets like food, retail, etc. in the past.

Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Hi. Thank you very much. Hey, Doug, you had a very strong free cash flow quarter in the beginning of the year. Was there anything unusual or any pull forwards over there?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
One, I mean, the first quarter historically is our low first – lowest cash flow quarter. Last year was more the anomaly, and we talked about it. That working capital – some anomalies in working capital last year really hid the underlying performance, and we said that you would expect to see improvements starting second, third and fourth quarter in 2015 and you did.
And so, this year, we're going against a last year what I would call unusual negative cash flow performance. This year is a little stronger than maybe normal, but it's really driven by excellent working capital. We put real focus on it after last year's frankly unacceptable first quarter. And I think you're just seeing that discipline and focus carry through. Part of it is a conversation I had around energy where I think that team in a very difficult environment has done a heck of a job on receivables, in particular, which we needed to because otherwise you're going to walk right into a problem. So, that's really what's going on.
So, strong underlying earnings. The business is performing well. It gets masked principally by FX. And Energy is going to go through ups and downs. I'm not going to walk away from the downs. But last year, get out of FX, we're up 12%. And I think if you look at our cash flow, you'll see the underlying strength and that's more indicative of what the business is doing even with Energy.
Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great. And just as a follow-up, can you give us an update on Swisher? I know it's not huge, but is the revenue coming in kind of the way that you expected you're expecting some kind of erosion? And how long do you think it will take to get the margins more in line with the historical Ecolab margins?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think the Swisher acquisition is going as expected. And remember, our expectations are quite high in terms of ultimate return. We did expect to see sales erosion. We are seeing it. It's in line with expectations. Importantly, the most critical and strategic part of their business, we're doing a great job securing. It's not all done. We're continuing to work on that.
In terms of getting after cost structure, the team has made a lot of progress. And if anything, I think we will end up ahead of plan as we move forward. It hasn't shown up yet really in the P&L. That would be probably more in the second half. But in the whole scheme of things, it's not monstrously materially material, but it'll show up in the Institutional results but really not until the second half. Right now, it's a drag, but it'll turn into a positive, but not until the second half, probably.

Our next question is from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thanks. Hey, Doug, back to Energy, just the cadence of earnings of Q2 through Q4, I know you discussed margins, but what's the actual operating profit cadence do you expect for the rest of the year?

Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I need dollars, guys. Just give us a second, David. Sorry. I wanted to get – we had a bunch of percentages. It's probably a little easier to give you absolute direction. So, we would expect second quarter profit is going to be greater than first quarter. Still under pressure, but not nearly as much pressure as we were in terms of percentage in the first quarter. Almost half as much pressure on the percent.
We are going to start seeing, we think, profits flatten out in the second half. And the question as they flatten in the third, it's probably more a fourth quarter scenario that we'll start seeing year-on-year flattening on profits as you start running against the base and you start having some sales stabilization and volume stabilization in the new business that we continue to put on start showing up. So, that's the expectation.
So, I would say pressure in the first three quarters for sure. It's just going to be pressure that continues to become less severe as the year goes on, part because of base, part because we'll start seeing some new business, but mostly base.
David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just on the overall gross margin, nice expansion in Q1. You expect expansion in Q2. Would you expect expansion in the back half of the year as well, or would that be more flattish given the direction of raw materials?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We would expect probably not the same level as gross profit expansion in the back half as the first, but we will continue to see improvement throughout the year.

Our next question is from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Great. Thanks for taking this. I guess, maybe a little bit of color, Doug, on what's driving the sequential improvement and, I guess, implicit margin performance? I mean, they were down pretty significantly in this quarter. Is that just easier comps or recovering pricing, raw materials? Just to understand some of the drivers, I think, would be helpful.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
First of all, the story is not that different, but the margin commentary I just had on gross profit was whole company, so.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Yeah, I'm talking Energy.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, okay. So if you want to get into that, that's what I thought. So Energy, you got seasonal volume where first quarter is our lowest volume on in whatever environment you want to go in the Energy business. And so in a flat environment, without any share gain, you're going to see a step-up in second and then a minor step-up again in the third and fourth quarter just from seasonality.
You have a market which isn't been stable, but we think stabilizes later in the year, not improves, as you go through. And so, we think that seasonality comes through. And then the other issue is share and we continue to gain share. And our net ahead, as we go through this, and while it's a tough environment, we continue to see the few things that are happening in the world are coming our way and we are getting some of the existing fields to move our way.
And so, it's a combination of those two things that we think leads to a minor improvement when you start looking at year-on-year. And you got to remember, last year, the second half, we really had a lot of the market decline in the second half, not all of it, but a lot of it, a lot more than the first half.
Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)

Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. And then, just in terms of the other businesses, it looks like healthcare, maybe Energy and let's add paper, these things all have either sequential improvement or looking for growth in the back half of the year. Are there any markets where you are seeing any other signs of weakness creeping in that we need to be watching out for that maybe don't have better growth prospects as we move into the year?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think the markets besides Energy where we're under the most pressure would be mining and heavy industry, steel, etc., around the world. I would say mining is probably getting down towards the bottom, right. It was fairly negative in the fourth and much more negative in the first. We're forecasting kind of flattening and then improvement in mining as we go forward, as we start running into the base, but it's not that big of a business. And the heavy industry stuff will start running into the base as well, so I don't think there – this is like the puts and takes we have all the time. So I don't know that it demands increased scrutiny from you. Trust me, it's getting plenty from us.

Our next question is from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC
Good afternoon. A lot of them have been answered already, but I just want to follow up on the specialty or the KAY part of the Institutional business. We've seen growth there sort of slow down to mid-single digit levels. This business used to perform at high-single digit, low-double digit growth. Is it just it's kind of getting to the scale where it's more difficult to grow at the rates you used to grow, or is it market is still a little bit weaker? Can you talk a little bit about just what the expectation out of the business should be going forward?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think that business is going to continue to perform. Look, it will have its double-digit quarters. But mostly, it's going to be growing in the high-single digits. And what really drives it, as I've always described that business, sort of feeds a village via elephants. And so, it's a market that's dominated by large players. And when you sell one, you have a big, fairly significant ramp-up. You annualize against it and you continue to see ramp-up. So, it's a little different cadence than many of our other businesses.
But that business is I think in great shape and doing the right things. The opportunities in that business are fairly significant because there is real pain in the industry, particularly in North America as a consequence of wage pressure and ACA requirements. And so increasingly customers are going to look to take labor out. Whatever the economists want to say, they're going to take labor out, and that's a great opportunity for our QSR business, in particular.
Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC
Sounds good. Then, if you look at, you mentioned along with new business wins, some cost efficiencies have helped you with profitability. Is this part of a specific restructuring program that you have? Is it an ongoing sort of control of discretionary expenses in a difficult time? Can you talk about these cost efficiencies and how much of a runway, I guess, you have left?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well, as I've described, I think we have a lot of runway left on continuing to improve our efficiency as an organization. As I've tried to state before, the word synergy has a half-life. And after a point in time, you don't get to talk about cost savings and synergies any more. But there's no way you put together two companies the size we did in 150 countries and have all your synergies worked out in 36 months without taking monster risk. And we don't like to take stupid risks.

And so, there is a lot still to be mined from the combination of Nalco and Champion as we go forward as there always is in a company, even without that just getting better, new technology drives new opportunities. So yeah, we're quite confident. I mean, if you look at our track record before we did the Nalco merger, we had routine margin expansion for a number of years and we would expect you're going to see regular margin expansion going forward, even if we call it cost savings instead of synergy.

Our next question is from John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
Thank you. If I wanted to look at the sequential earnings change in Global Energy, do you have the restated fourth quarter earnings that would compare? So, I'm looking at your current earnings, the first quarter 2015, the $104.2 million, that's about $25 million lower than what you originally reported a year ago. So, with the rebasing and the Venezuelan deconsolidation, what's the fourth quarter that we would use for a sequential comparison?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
What is it, $125 million? We would say $125 million on both. And so, if you look at Q4 and Q1, I mean, we do this as a matter of routine to look both year-on-year and sequentially. The biggest driver in terms of this is volume. Some of that's seasonal and some of it is market, but that would account for the vast majority. Simply, you don't have the same coverage in your plants and everything else, which is why first quarter broadly is always a low-margin quarter for us and it's a low-margin quarter for Energy as well. And then, it was exacerbated by further market declines as you go in.
I would also point out fourth quarter, as we've said, during the fourth quarter had a number of one-time positive events in it. All of them legitimate, but that would probably be accounted for almost $14 million of the $125 million that just weren't going to recur, which we called out in that fourth quarter. And it was simply we sold some inventory that was out there at one time, which were smart moves economically for the company, were legitimate deals. But you don't get to sell that inventory over and over again, so it took risk off the table and triggered a sale and some gross profit realization as a consequence of that.
So, those things are also part of the story. And then, we also had a one-timer negative in the first quarter in Angola that was fairly substantial that needs to be accounted for. When you take those things, the whole thing makes sense. But the fourth quarter was a little bit overstated, and the first quarter is probably – is really reflective of low seasonality. And we will see improved margin in Energy going forward simply because volume will be greater in the out-quarters than it was in this quarter, and you'll have better overhead coverage.
John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC
And then, the other segment which has the 16% sales margins this quarter; you're getting almost up to the Institutional area now in terms of margins. And we don't have a lot of good history of that segment, given it usually was good margins on pest, offset by investment in GCS. But as GCS ramps its margins now, how high does that other segment get do you think?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, look, GCS makes money now so we actually have a margin on the positive there and they've done a good job driving that. I think pest has always been a good profit business. Our pest business as you've seen has reaccelerated. If you recall, a couple years ago, we said we'd put it in a shop and are reinvesting in pest in a number of areas, which we've done. And to the team's credit, they've taken that reinvestment and delivered on the top line performance that they committed to. So, that grew nearly double digits in the first quarter, which is what we had historically expected out of pest, but then didn't see for quite a while. GCS, I mean, out of that thing, I think you can see regularly high teens may be approaching. Our goal as a corporation is 20%, so I'm not going to really be happy until everybody is there.

Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC
I was wondering, Doug, if you could talk about the new Synergex sanitizer product for clean-in-place applications. That's kind of your workhorse in the F&B market. Can you talk about some of the risks and the opportunities as you're introducing the next-generation product in that market?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Look, I guess, there's always risk if you introduce anything, but there's greater risk if you introduce nothing. So, this is one of our core platforms. It's the heart of CIP. And so, while we'll talk about what sales are for specific product, it sort of understates its overall importance. And so, this is the next platform of antimicrobial as we move forward. And we need to continue to bring broad-based kill, the absence of bioaccumulation, all the things that we think are very important to have going forward. And this is the state-of-the-art antimicrobial, we believe, in that marketplace and is very important to us, continuing to drive our advantage in that market. So, we've got the best antimicrobial suite. It just got better with this introduction.
Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Right. And then, I was curious, also, you mentioned that you were going to be – or you were splitting the Europe business from the MEA business. Was wondering if you could comment on the margin profile of those two businesses as separated and how they have trended over the past few years, particularly with all the work that you've done in the Europe region.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We've reported regularly that we continue to improve Europe. And what we've given you historically is kind of apples and apples to our Renaissance program. Europe is now high-single digit margin business in total, and MEA is virtually double that. So, MEA is a strong region in terms of OI margin. If anything, we've reduced it in the near term as we up investments in G&A. We've split this out two years ago. We've added a number of key division leadership position, added corporate account positions, added supply chain positions so we have better ability to get product to customers in that region, done a number of things which have put us in a better stead to drive growth which is a real focus in that place. And we'll drive margin after we get growth really cooking. But really, right now, it's growth first.

Our next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Sterne, Agee. Please proceed with your question.
Hamzah Mazari - CRT Capital Group LLC
Good afternoon. Just a question on M&A and balance sheet. Maybe, given the current leverage, a little over two times, how are you thinking about appetite to do a larger deal? And would it be fair to say that you're looking outside Energy versus continuing to build Energy? Thank you.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think in terms of our capability to do an outside deal we don't think is governed by our balance sheet at this point in time. So, we said our goal is to get down to roughly a 2 times EBITDA margin, and that's where we are. We think that's the right balance between financial efficiency and also strategic capability, i.e., capitalize or jump quickly if you needed to.

In terms of what we're looking at, I think our focus has been water because we believe it's a great opportunity. We continue to look there. You've seen recent Institutional and F&B deals. If they continue to have promising bolt-ons, we'll continue to do that. And then, I think healthcare broadly is an area that we're still very interested in. We think that's a great market for us, and we aim to win in that market. And I would say, typically, what we've set our minds to, we do. It sometimes takes us longer than we would like. You certainly saw that in GCS, but we get there. And we ended up persevering, and we are going to have a great healthcare business. So, those are areas we're looking at.
In terms of Energy, we've said we don't want to be dramatically bigger than we are in Energy. We've said that for a while. But with that, where there are promising properties or new technologies that we think we can develop into promising annuity streams, we'll do it. We just announced one late last year, a Canadian technology that we bought for that very reason because the Energy team, I think, has a very good vision of how to drive that technology into an annuity stream that helps customers and helps us.
So, that's how we look at it. Right now, the market, there are deals going down for prices that honestly we wouldn't pay. And we're going to remain disciplined. We did before. We did the Nalco deal after the froth was over, and let me try to be smart stewards of shareholder money as we go forward.

Our next question is from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.
Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. So, you just answered my M&A question. So, moving to pest and equipment, is the 9% top line growth something that you are looking at going forward and will eventually – and if you could give us a feel for the timing, will we see that kind of a growth rate on healthcare?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well, I would say we expect – I would say it's probably better to count on upper-single digits in our Other segment. We do think that's quite real, quite sustainable. They'll pop into double-digit land on some occasional quarters, and they'll be a little lower on some quarters just because of what happens at times. But, yeah, we think the pest and even the Equipment Care business have a long road at high-single digit type growth and may be typically popping even over our 6% to 8% kind of target.
Healthcare, ultimately, I think is the same type of business. I think it – our aim is to get that business, probably combine with life sciences to be upper-single digit business on an organic basis. Obviously, we may have additional M&A activity in that business and that would push it above that for periods of time.
Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company
Do you need the M&A, Doug, in order to get to that 6% to 8% growth target? Or can you do it on your own, the way the business is right now?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I don't – no, we don't believe we're missing something fundamental preventing us from doing it. And I think when you look at a lot of the underneath economics, that business is getting better and I think that team is on it and starting to get traction on the areas they need to get on and after, kind of the place where we have a unique difference, can own and protect and build, and that business is growing very handily and becoming a larger piece of that portfolio, which is what has to happen for you to see the big numbers out of that business. So, no, we don't need anything, but that doesn't mean if there's an attractive property or technology, we would be open to it just as we are in the other businesses.

Our next question is from Chris Evans with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Doug, a quick question on Energy. Does the shift to these easier oil plays that you cited earlier, does that challenge your return to your prior Energy earnings levels?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, the shift is somewhat temporary and mostly notable in saving the shale play and everything else. And if anything, it's a gain that runs out. So, in this very tough economic environment, what folks have done is basically gone to focus on the wells that are easiest to extract and cheapest to extract. That's how they're keeping cash flow going to pay their bills and hopefully survive until the price recovers. And when price recovers and demand needs to be met because you've got a lot of capital that's been pulled out of that business, they're going to have to go back to the other wells. And so, the shift is inevitable. You can't meet the demand for oil next year with just easy oil. So, I mean, this will happen. And so, then you will see the natural cadence occur in this business again.
Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks. Appreciate the answer. And then, staying with Energy just for another one. Could you just bridge me the 15% sales decline to the 42% EBIT in terms of maybe volume price?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I mean, I don't have, like, the bridge in front of me. It's, look, in that and almost any business, when you have significant deleveraging in a business, you have almost this immediate significant impact on OI because there's no time to take out overhead. And I wouldn't anyway because a lot of this is just seasonally. So, you get under-absorption in the plants that just immediately, instead of going into inventory, hits your OI line. I mean, this is just basic P&L stuff, but 15% is a significant volume hit. We've been under pressure there.
We did not build inventory. We're trying to be disciplined on inventory and the other stuff, so we took it on the chin. Last year, if you recall, we were building inventory year-on-year in Energy because it took us a while to turn off the spigot in reaction to the market. So, you've got even probably more outsized year-on-year impact from absorption than you would under normal times.
Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got you. So this was just the volumes. No impact from any pricing decline.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, but in line with what I talked and not materially different from the other quarters.

Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Perfect. Thank you. Can you just comment on your recent new business launches within the water segment in terms of recent growth contribution? And also, any color on the cadence of the potential ramps for the new platforms which you mentioned for the second half of the year?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I'm sorry. Can you repeat the second half of the question?
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Just any color on the cadence of the potential ramps of the new platforms, which you've mentioned in your release for the second half of the year?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So in the water business, I mean, we have continued expansion drive of our 3D TRASAR units, which continues to go well and move. We've also launched Solids, we've talked about, for the light side of the business. Let me just turn on to my page where we've got – so our expected revenue on new launches for water are going to be around $25 million to $30 million this year. They will build throughout the year. Typically, the way I would think about a launch, when we launch a program it typically takes five years for us to reach peak annual sales, so it's not this monster ramp-up. The technology also has legs, and we will often be selling technology for at least 10 years before we replace a platform or do other things.

And this certainly is obviously longer-lived technology than Apple probably talks about. So, in terms of expected sales from our cooling water product line around 3D TRASAR, we'll end up at $30 million ultimately this year, but our five-year expected sales out in 2020, 2021 would be around $100 million.
Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Perfect. That's helpful. And just very quickly, on the food and beverage side, you've mentioned penetrating your existing customers fairly well across your portfolio. One of the things you just actually just discussed, but you've also had some new business wins despite a tough environment. Can you just really quickly parse out what you believe are the Ecolab-specific trends here versus what you're seeing in the actual end market and how you're comping versus that? Thank you.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well I mean, I believe our F&B business was up 4% in first quarter. And certainly, I don't think the food market, this is the heavily processed food, dairy market in particular is our focus in these markets. It includes protein and other areas, but those businesses are under pressure. And so, there's no doubt in my mind we're outperforming the market and the pressure comes in twofold. One, there are the consumer demand pressure as people move to different parts of the store to procure food. And second, there's been quite a bit of M&A activity in that market, which means ultimately they consolidate and take out manufacturing facilities, which reduces temporarily total opportunity for us.
Long term though, the drivers in F&B I think are in excellent shape. It's called population and food safety. And the population will grow around the world. The middle class will grow. Expectation for food quality will continue to increase, particularly in emerging markets. And food safety is only going to get more challenging. That's why there's a lot of conversation in the U.S. about local farming. Local farming is not going to feed 9 billion people, and it's also not by any means the most sustainable way to farm. What you're going to want to do is farm where stuff naturally grows. So, you're not going to see bananas growing in Manhattan anytime soon. It doesn't make any sense. It would be local, but it wouldn't be very sustainable. And so ultimately, I think you're going to still see long-distance shipping of food to, in particular, feed the Asian population growth. And long distance equals time, and time is the enemy of food safety.
And so if anything, we think the demands for food safety technology are going to grow faster than the food demand, which is ultimately going to be driven by the two components I talked about, population growth and middle-class expectation growth. So, I like our food and beverage business, new technology, team's on it. We're outperforming the market. I think that business gets better. And the water technology coupling we have is spot on for that business, and it's a huge way to leverage our installed base in F&B.

Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thanks. Doug, just to get a better feel for the Industrial segment, I'm curious, a nice couple hundred basis points fixed currency margin expansion year-over-year. You said volume gains, pricing, cost savings and lower product costs. I was just wondering, are those in order of magnitude, and how it spreads across the sub segments of the business? And then, lastly, what we should look for as we move through the year as what the bigger drivers are in the Industrial segment? Thanks so much.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. It's like an ingredient list. It's in order of magnitude. And so, what we've said is the one area, raw material benefits are expected to decline as the year moves on and possibly even move into slightly negative territory by year-end. But the balance of it, volume, pricing, cost savings are going to be tools that will remain in our quiver that we will use.

Just of the subcategories in your Industrial segment, which do you feel will drive the business overall through the balance of the year? Which of those.
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think F&B and core water. I mean, core water is up 6%. It was mining that was down, and that business continues to strengthen. That's even with the pressure in steel and other areas. And so, China's tough, but there's always something going on in the world. But water we think continues to strengthen. They've got good innovation. They're on the new business. F&B is in solid shape. I mean, those are the large businesses in Industrial. Textile improved, had a pretty strong first quarter and we would expect to have a strong year as we go forward. So, it's pretty good I think across the segment. We're in pretty good shape.
Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)

Our next question is from Dan Dolev with Nomura Asset Management. Please proceed with your question.
Dan Dolev - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to make clear that I understand. So, in late February, you spelled out 9% to 13% constant currency EPS growth. What is the constant currency EPS growth as of today for the year? What is the expectation in constant currency terms?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I would say at this point in time, we haven't really, as I said, reflected a change in currency and we haven't changed our range. So it wouldn't have changed.
Dan Dolev - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Got it. So, the math that I went through to get you to 6% to 10%, you're saying that's not the right math at this point?
Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, here's the thing. I guess, what we've said is if we snapped a line right now and froze all rates at the rate you see today and that was the end rate for the year, you're going to have $0.10 less currency headwind than we forecast in late February. But given all the stuff going on in the world, we don't think booking that at this point in time is wise. There's a lot of things that can change, including currency as the year goes on and there's just too much time remaining in the year in a very dynamic environment to go snap the line on one of multiple variables. So, what we've basically said is we have not changed our expected currency outcome for the year even though we recognize and admit that today's rates would indicate it's $0.10 better.
So, yeah, if you want to go do that math, but there's a lot of things going in here. We haven't increased our range either at this point in time. And I think as the year goes, we'll continue to try to be transparent in what our expectations are and what the underlying assumptions leading to our forecasted range. And from there, right, we're going to just watch multi-variable inputs and see how it all turns out, but I would expect to deliver on our range.
Dan Dolev - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Got it. Just one follow-up and more long-term reflective. The analysis that we did for our initiation work two years ago, we looked at your margin growth for the last few years, including and excluding the synergies, including – excluding all the synergies that you got from Nalco and Champion, which were a lot, you were probably getting 10 basis points to 15 basis points of margin growth per our math. In Q1, you got about 20 basis points. I assume there was some energy impact. Do you still stand behind that 20% margin? And how are you going to get there by 2020?

Douglas M. Baker, Jr. - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think when we launched the 20% margin, we did that at an investor conference. It was $20 million in sales, 20% margin – OI margin and 20% return on invested capital. I was very clear at that time that we weren't going to hit all three by 2020 because, if you did the math, it would imply much more than 15% EPS growth. And what we said is we believe all three are achievable, they're achievable within sight of 2020, but they weren't all going to occur by 2020. And that's still true. If you go to just the last two years, if 2016 expected FX hit, not a dime better, you've got 2015 and 2016, we'd lose $1.5 billion in sales in two years just from currency translation and over $250 million in OI.
I mean, that's what those rates mean. So, they chew up the bulk of the synergies you might have from one of those deals. With that, we continue to deliver positive EPS growth as we go through it. I will also say we also believe that translation FX, not transaction. Transaction FX, we never talk about. It's almost equal in size, but we think that's a real impact in the business that has to be dealt with because it's the equivalent of inflation basically. So, we don't talk about it. We only talk about translation because translation is sort of goofy. If I was headquartered in Munich last year, I would have been up 26% EPS with everything happening exactly the same except I'm consolidating into euro, not into dollars.
Our business isn't any better. Our share is not any better. Our margins aren't any better. Nothing's better except I translate into a more favorable currency. And so, this stuff flips back and forth. So, our margin improvement, yeah, I think is real. At fixed currency, it was more like 60%, not 20%, and we expect to have continued fixed margin growth year in, year out. And one year, it's going to look like 200% because currency is going to go in our favor, and I will tell you it's still only 60% because really you got to look at this the way the margin's really coming, country by country and currency by currency. That's the way we ultimately realize it over any period of time that matters to a corporation, right. So, that's how we look at it.

There are no further questions at this time. At this point, I'd like to turn the call back over to Michael Monahan for closing comments.
Michael J. Monahan - Senior Vice President External Relations

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
