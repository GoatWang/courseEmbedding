Variable Annuities


We understand that your investment and retirement plans are unique and may change over time. Regardless of where you are along life's journey, Jackson® provides variable annuity options designed to help you pursue your financial goals.
The variety of investment choices and tax deferral* featured in each of our variable annuity offerings can support your investing and retirement objectives. It's important to work with your financial professional to select a variable annuity that suits your individual financial needs and comfort with risk.

*Tax deferral offers no additional value if an annuity is used to fund a qualified plan, such as a 401(k) or IRA. It also may not be available if the annuity is owned by a "non-natural person" such as a corporation or certain types of trusts.



What is a Variable Annuity? Variable annuities are long-term, tax-deferred investments designed for retirement, involve investment risks and may lose value. Earnings are taxable as ordinary income when distributed and may be subject to a 10% additional tax if withdrawn before age 59½.






Elite Access®


An investment only variable annuity (IOVA) designed to help increase return potential and manage risk through a diversified variable annuity investment platform. Elite Access features traditional investments, alternative assets and strategies, tactical and risk management, and asset allocation portfolios — all optimized through the benefit of tax deferral.

Perspective II®


Introduction
The Pursuit of Retirement Freedom. Today, with many people living longer, healthier, and more active lives, retirement has become a turning point — not an end point. But the prospect of a longer retirement raises important questions about whether traditional retirement income streams — such as Social Security, pensions, and personal savings — will be sufficient for you to sustain a comfortable lifestyle as you age.
With these challenges in mind, Jackson® offers Perspective II, one of America's top-selling* variable annuities that offers you the freedom to create your own distinctive portfolio plan with quality investments, optional benefits†, and tax deferral‡. It's a retirement investment vehicle designed to let you adapt your investment choices to your evolving needs and goals. 

*LIMRA Secure Retirement Institute U.S. Individual Annuities Sales Survey, Third Quarter, 2016. Jackson was first in total annuity sales out of 63 participating companies that provided LIMRA with quarterly data.
†Optional benefits are available for an extra charge in addition to the ongoing fees and expenses of the variable annuity.
‡Tax deferral offers no additional value if an annuity is used to fund a qualified plan, such as a 401(k) or IRA, and may not be available if the annuity is owned by a "non-natural person" such as a corporation or certain types of trusts.



What is a Variable Annuity? Variable annuities are long-term, tax-deferred investments designed for retirement, involve investment risks and may lose value. Earnings are taxable as ordinary income when distributed and may be subject to a 10% additional tax if withdrawn before age 59½.

					With increasing life expectancy and more time spent in retirement, it's important to establish a steady income stream you won't outlive. Jackson's optional suite of living benefits can provide lifetime income** to help sustain your retirement lifestyle.
				
All Perspective II Optional Benefits

**On the contract anniversary on or immediately following the owner's (or older joint owner's) attained age 59½, the for-life guarantee becomes effective provided: 1) the contract value is greater than zero and 2) the contract has not been annuitized. If the owner (or older joint owner) is age 59½ on the effective date of the endorsement, then the for-life guarantee becomes effective on that date.



Death Benefits: A Legacy You Can Pass On


					If leaving an inheritance for future generations is a priority, consider an investment strategy that help grow your legacy. Plan to leave more than a memory with a death benefit backed by Jackson.
				
All Perspective II Optional Benefits

††Death benefits terminate if the contract value falls to zero.



Tax Advantages: An Advantage You Can Plan For

Before investing, investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the variable annuity and its underlying investment options. The current contract prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses, which are contained in the same document, provide this and other important information. Please contact your representative or the Company to obtain the prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses carefully before investing or sending money.
The latest income date allowed is age 95, which is the required age to annuitize or take a lump sum. Please see the prospectus for important information regarding the annuitization of a contract.
We reserve the right to refuse any subsequent premium payments, subject to state applicability.
Optional benefits may be elected at issue and, once elected, may not be cancelled or changed. Optional benefits are available for an extra charge in addition to the ongoing fees and expenses of the variable annuity. Only one optional living benefit and one optional death benefit may be elected per contract. May not be available in all states or on all products, and state variations may apply. The long-term advantage of the optional benefits will vary with the terms of the benefit option, the investment performance of the variable investment options selected, and the length of time the annuity is owned. As a result, in some circumstances the cost of an option may exceed the actual benefit paid under the option.
Guarantees are backed by the claims-paying ability of Jackson National Life Insurance Company® or Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York® and do not apply to the principal amount or investment performance of a variable annuity's separate account or its underlying investments.

Perspective II®


Investment Options
Freedom to Choose. Your investment options are only as good as the freedom to use them. That's why we don't methodically insert you into restrictive allocation models that take away your power to make decisions. Rather, at Jackson, you can build a diversified* portfolio that's customized for your individual priorities and preferences. With more than 90† investment options, we provide access to world-class money managers, Jackson-exclusive investments, optional guarantees‡, tax advantages, and the freedom to adapt your investing strategy for your evolving needs and goals.

*Diversification does not assure a profit or guarantee against loss.
†Select up to 99 investments and adjust options or allocations up to 15 times each contract year without transfer fees. To prevent abusive trading practices, Jackson restricts the frequency of transfers among variable investment options including trading out of and back into the same subaccount within a 15 day period.
‡Optional benefits may be elected at issue and, once elected, may not be cancelled or changed. Optional benefits are available for an extra charge in addition to the ongoing fees and expenses of the variable annuity. Only one optional living benefit and one optional death benefit may be elected per contract. May not be available in all states or on all products, and state variations may apply. The long-term advantage of the optional benefits will vary with the terms of the benefit option, the investment performance of the variable investment options selected, and the length of time the annuity is owned. As a result, in some circumstances the cost of an option may exceed the actual benefit paid under the option.



What is a Variable Annuity? Variable annuities are long-term, tax-deferred investments designed for retirement, involve investment risks and may lose value. Earnings are taxable as ordinary income when distributed and may be subject to a 10% additional tax if withdrawn before age 59½.

American Funds


American Funds Insurance Series®
American Funds, part of Capital GroupSM, has helped investors pursue long-term investment success since 1931. Its consistent approach — in combination with The Capital SystemSM — seeks to achieve superior results over time.
The Capital System combines individual accountability with teamwork. Each fund is divided into portions that are managed independently by investment professionals with diverse backgrounds, ages and approaches. An extensive global research effort is the backbone of our system. Investment decisions are based on a long-term perspective, which American Funds believes aligns with the interests of investors.



Primary Risks and Disclosure


Performance depends on the changes in market and economic conditions in the selection and percentages of allocations among Underlying Funds.
Rising interest rates will generally cause the prices of bonds and other debt securities to fall. Falling interest rates may cause an issuer to redeem, call or refinance a security before its stated maturity, which may result in the fund having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities. Longer maturity debt securities may be subject to greater price fluctuations than shorter. Bonds and debt securities are subject to credit risk including the deterioration of credit strength or failure to make a timely payment resulting in default.
This portfolio could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed-income security, or the counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase agreement, or a loan of portfolio securities, is unable or unwilling to make timely principal and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations.
Investing in emerging markets may involve greater risks than investing in developed countries, including the possibility of industry concentration, nationalization, taxes and transaction costs, lower trading volumes, and less liquid securities, resulting in higher volatility.
The price of equity or equity-related securities will fluctuate and can decline and reduce the value of a portfolio investing in these securities.
Fixed income prices respond to changing economic environments, including interest rate changes and credit risk perceptions of individual issuers, which can negatively affect the price and income level.
Investments in foreign securities are subject to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency values, political, less publicly available information, social and economic developments, and possible imposition of foreign withholding taxes on income payable on the securities. They may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. markets.
Growth stocks are generally priced based on future or anticipated earnings and susceptible to larger price swings and greater potential for loss than other types of stocks.
A portfolio that invests in high-yield bonds, lower-rated bonds, and unrated securities are broadly referred to as "junk bonds" and are considered below "investment-grade" by national ratings agencies. They are subject to the increased risk of an issuer's inability to meet principal and interest payment obligations.
When interest rates increase, fixed-income securities generally will decline in value. Long-term fixed-income securities normally have more price volatility than short-term fixed-income securities. Some equity securities may also be sensitive to interest rate changes.
Investments in securities that are difficult to purchase or sell (illiquid or thinly-traded securities) may reduce returns if the Fund is unable to sell the securities at advantageous times or prices. Illiquid securities may also be difficult to value.
The manager's investment techniques could fail to achieve the Fund's investment objective or negatively affect the Fund's investment performance.
The price of securities of mid-capitalization companies tends to fluctuate more widely and erratically than those of larger, more established companies.
Investing in smaller, newer companies generally involves greater risks than investing in larger, more established ones and are subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than larger, more established companies or market averages.












BlackRock


Who Is BlackRock?
In a world that is shifting and changing faster than ever before, investors who want answers that unlock opportunity and uncover risk entrust their assets to BlackRock. As an independent, global investment manager, BlackRock has no greater responsibility than to its clients.
It's why many of the world's largest pension funds and insurance companies trust BlackRock to understand their unique objectives and why advisors and individual end investors partner with BlackRock to help them build the more dynamic, diverse portfolios these times require.
BlackRock has built its offering around its clients' greatest needs: providing breadth of capabilities — and depth of knowledge — across active and passive strategies. This is combined with a singular focus on delivering strong, consistent performance and an ability to look across asset classes, geographies and investment strategies to find the right solutions.
With deep roots in every region across the globe, some 100 investment teams in 27 countries share their best thinking to gain the insights that can change outcomes. And, with a passion to understand risk in all its forms, BlackRock's 1,000+ risk professionals dig deep to find the numbers behind the numbers and bring clarity to the most daunting financial challenges. That shapes and strengthens the investment decisions that BlackRock — and its clients — are making.



Primary Risks and Disclosure


Rising interest rates will generally cause the prices of bonds and other debt securities to fall. Falling interest rates may cause an issuer to redeem, call or refinance a security before its stated maturity, which may result in the fund having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities. Longer maturity debt securities may be subject to greater price fluctuations than shorter. Bonds and debt securities are subject to credit risk including the deterioration of credit strength or failure to make a timely payment resulting in default.
Borrowing may exaggerate or reduce returns or cause the Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.
Trading options, futures contracts and other derivative financial instruments, and some over-the-counter securities entails credit and settlement risk on the counterparties.
This portfolio could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed-income security, or the counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase agreement, or a loan of portfolio securities, is unable or unwilling to make timely principal and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations.
The Portfolio's net asset value could decline as a result of changes in the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. Certain countries may impose restrictions that block principal and interest payments to investors outside the country.
This portfolio invests in derivative instruments such as swaps, options, futures contracts, forward currency contracts, indexed and asset-backed securities, to be announced (TBAs) securities, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, and certain exchange-traded funds that involve risks including liquidity, interest rate, market, currency, counterparty, credit and management risks, mispricing or improper valuation, low correlation with the underlying asset, rate, or index and could lose more than originally invested.
The price of equity or equity-related securities will fluctuate and can decline and reduce the value of a portfolio investing in these securities.
Fixed income prices respond to changing economic environments, including interest rate changes and credit risk perceptions of individual issuers, which can negatively affect the price and income level.
This portfolio focuses on particular countries, regions, industries, and sectors and may be subject to greater risks of adverse developments in such areas.
Investments in foreign securities are subject to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency values, political, less publicly available information, social and economic developments, and possible imposition of foreign withholding taxes on income payable on the securities. They may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. markets.
Growth stocks are generally priced based on future or anticipated earnings and susceptible to larger price swings and greater potential for loss than other types of stocks.
Greater emphasis or programmed concentration on investments in a particular industry may result in significant share value fluctuation in response to events affecting that industry.
When interest rates increase, fixed-income securities generally will decline in value. Long-term fixed-income securities normally have more price volatility than short-term fixed-income securities. Some equity securities may also be sensitive to interest rate changes.
Large capitalization stocks as a group could fall out of favor with the market, causing the fund to underperform funds that focus on other types of stocks.
Reverse repurchase agreements, loans of portfolio securities, dollar rolls, buy backs, futures, forwards, and the use of when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment transactions, and other derivatives, may give rise to a form of leverage, thereby amplifying the Fund's gains and losses and making the Fund more volatile.
The manager's investment techniques could fail to achieve the Fund's investment objective or negatively affect the Fund's investment performance.
Rising interest rates tend to extend the duration of mortgage-related securities, making them more sensitive to changes in interest rates and exhibit additional volatility. When interest rates decline, borrowers may pay off their mortgages sooner than expected, which can reduce the returns.
This portfolio is more vulnerable to the price movements of natural resources and factors that particularly affect the oil, gas, mining, energy, chemicals, paper, steel, or agriculture sectors than a more broadly diversified portfolio.
The Fund is considered nondiversified and may invest in a limited number of issuers. With a smaller number of different issuers, there is more risk than holding a larger number of issuers, since any changes may cause greater fluctuation of total return and share price of a nondiversified portfolio.
If the counterparty defaults on its obligation, the Fund may suffer delays, incur costs, or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security in either situation and the market value of the security declines, the Fund may lose money.
Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities held by the Fund with an agreement to repurchase the securities at an agreed-upon price, date, and interest payment. The other party may fail to return the securities in a timely manner or at all, resulting in a loss to the Fund.
A short sale may be affected by selling a security that the fund does not own. If the price of the security sold short increases, the fund would incur a potentially unlimited loss ; conversely, if the price declines, the fund will realize a gain.
These investments are subject to the risk that a governmental entity may delay or refuse to pay interest or repay principal on its sovereign debt, due, for example, to cash flow problems, insufficient foreign currency reserves, political considerations, the relative size of the governmental entity's debt position in relation to the economy or the failure to put in place economic reforms required by the International Monetary Fund or other multilateral agencies. There is no legal process to collect all or part of the principal or interest due.

Causeway Capital Management LLC


Causeway Capital Management LLC is a global equity manager wholly owned by its employees. Causeway began operations in June 2001, and manages assets on behalf of corporations, pension plans, public retirement plans, Taft-Hartley pension plans, endowments and foundations, mutual funds, charities, superannuation, sovereign wealth funds, private funds and trusts, wrap fee programs and other institutions located in the US, Canada and overseas. Causeway manages five main equity strategies: non-U.S. developed, global developed, emerging markets, global/international opportunities (developed and emerging) and global absolute return.
Causeway's developed market investment philosophy is consistent with the principles of long-term value investing. These strategies apply an active, bottom-up, research-intensive approach to stock selection. When constructing our value equity portfolios, we have no constraints versus the benchmark, other than those imposed by a specific client mandate. We believe that stocks derive their value from the contribution of yield and the profitable reinvestment of retained earnings over time. Causeway's analytical process identifies underpriced stocks of high-quality companies exhibiting superior financial strength compared to peers. Most of our portfolio companies pay generous dividends or repurchase significant quantities of outstanding shares, thereby paying investors to wait until the market recognizes their fair values.
Causeway has a 23-person investment staff including eight fundamental analysts and eight fundamental portfolio managers; four quantitative analysts and three quantitative portfolio managers. Each individual on the fundamental team has global industry-specific research responsibilities. Causeway applies this global knowledge across all geographic regions to determine expected returns for holdings and prospective purchases. Proprietary risk modeling allows Causeway to measure and control risk in client portfolios. In our developed market strategies, we define risk as volatility of returns (standard deviation), not deviation of return from the benchmark. One of our primary goals when constructing value equity portfolios is to maximize returns, while minimizing risk. In addition to measuring and modulating risk, Causeway's quantitative portfolio managers oversee the broadly-diversified emerging markets equity strategy.
Causeway is 100% employee-owned and headquartered in Los Angeles, California.

Dimensional Fund Advisors


Dimensional is a different kind of investment firm. Our confidence in the capital markets frees us to think differently about investing and push the frontiers of innovation. Over the years, we have translated financial research into real world investment solutions, and through our approach, investors may seek to capture what the market offers in all its dimensions.
In 1981, we launched our first strategy based on research documenting the stronger performance of US small cap stocks. Our second strategy, a short-term fixed income portfolio launched in 1983, applied Eugene Fama's term structure research. Later, a comprehensive analysis of prices and other research deepened our strategy repertoire. This evolution reflects an abiding belief in the principles of modern finance and the efficacy of capital markets.
We see markets as an ally, not an adversary. Rather than trying to take advantage of the ways markets are mistaken, we take advantage of the ways markets are right — the ways they compensate investors. The firm designs portfolios to help our investors capture what the market offers in all its dimensions. Dimensional is owned primarily by employees and directors, and manages assets for institutional investors and the clients of registered financial advisors. From offices in Austin, Santa Monica, London, Sydney, Vancouver, Amsterdam, and Berlin, our professional staff supervises portfolios and services clients twenty-four hours a day.

Micro-cap stocks involve substantially greater risks of loss and price fluctuations because their earnings and revenues tend to be less predictable (and some companies may be experiencing significant losses), their share prices tend to be more volatile, and their markets less liquid than companies with larger market capitalizations.
The price of securities of mid-capitalization companies tends to fluctuate more widely and erratically than those of larger, more established companies.
Investing in smaller, newer companies generally involves greater risks than investing in larger, more established ones and are subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than larger, more established companies or market averages.












DoubleLine


DoubleLine is an independent, employee-owned money management firm, founded in 2009. The firm is organized as a multi-vehicle holding company, which consolidates essential services while ensuring a proper division between its fixed income and equity businesses. DoubleLine Capital LP focuses on the firm's fixed income business, DoubleLine Equity LP focuses on the firm's equity business, and DoubleLine Group LP serves as the consolidating vehicle to house personnel who provide services to both DoubleLine Capital LP and DoubleLine Equity LP. All three vehicles are under the common control of DoubleLine Capital GP LLC, as general partner.
The firm offers a wide array of investment strategies run by an experienced team of portfolio managers that has worked together for many years, employing active risk management, in-depth research, and innovative product solutions. The firm's core competencies are within the following asset classes:

Mortgage-Backed Securities: Agency and Non-Agency;
Asset-Backed Securities/Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities/Structured Products;
Core Fixed Income and Asset Allocation;
Emerging Markets Fixed Income;
Global Developed Credit;
U.S. Government; and
U.S. Equities.

The firm was founded to offer investment services with a cardinal mandate: the delivery of superior risk-adjusted fixed income returns to clients; performing on this mandate depends on the avoidance of risk-taking that has led to catastrophic principal losses, even under bond managers once reputed for conservative stewardship. The firm's enhanced return deliverable does not lie in some "black box"; it is in its professionals' minds, embedded through a process of problem-solving together for many years. Through shared equity interest, the firm's investment professionals are closely integrated because most have a stake in the success of the firm's products. Further, since the firm assembled an employee-owned partnership, no outside decision makers come between itself and its clients.
The firm utilizes a team-based approach in managing portfolios. The firm's portfolio managers average over 20 years of experience in the industry, and sit together with the research analysts and traders on an integrated trading desk to facilitate the sharing of information and ideas, on a daily basis. The DoubleLine Mortgage-Backed Securities team's investment philosophy and process were created by the lead portfolio managers, Jeffrey Gundlach and Philip Barach, over the course of their 22+ years at their previous firm.

Rising interest rates will generally cause the prices of bonds and other debt securities to fall. Falling interest rates may cause an issuer to redeem, call or refinance a security before its stated maturity, which may result in the fund having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities.

Bonds and debt securities are subject to credit risk including the deterioration of credit strength or failure to make a timely payment resulting in default.

During periods of falling interest rates, a debt security with a high stated interest rate may be prepaid before its expected maturity date and the Fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in a lower yielding security.
Securities held by the Fund could underperform other funds investing in similar asset classes or comparable benchmarks because of the portfolio managers' choice of securities or sectors for investment.

Since the Fund can only distribute what it earns, the Fund's distributions to shareholders may decline when interest rates fall.
Inflation-indexed securities have a tendency to react to changes in real interest rates, which represent nominal (stated) interest rates lowered by the anticipated effect of inflation. In general, the price of an inflation-indexed security can decrease when real interest rates increase, and it can increase when real interest rates decrease. Interest payments on inflation-indexed securities will fluctuate as the principal and/or interest is adjusted for inflation and can be unpredictable.
When interest rates increase, fixed-income securities generally will decline in value. Long-term fixed-income securities normally have more price volatility than short-term fixed-income securities. Some equity securities may also be sensitive to interest rate changes.
Investing according to specific, mechanical criteria applied on a specific date each year may prevent a Portfolio from responding to market fluctuations or changes in the financial condition or business prospects of the selected companies during the year.

Companies involved in restructurings such as mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, liquidations, spin-offs, or tender or exchange offers and distressed companies present significant risks that any restructuring may not be successful and become reduced in value or worthless.
Investing in smaller, newer companies generally involves greater risks than investing in larger, more established ones and are subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than larger, more established companies or market averages.
Value stocks may not increase in price if other investors fail to recognize a company's value or the factors that are expected to increase the price of a security do not occur.

				number of issuers. With a smaller number of different issuers, there is more risk than holding a larger number of issuers, since any changes may cause greater fluctuation of total return and share price of a nondiversified portfolio.
This investment may be closely linked to the performance of the real estate markets and may rise and fall more than the value of shares of a fund invested in a broader range of companies.
Investing in smaller, newer companies generally involves greater risks than investing in larger, more established ones and are subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than larger, more established companies or market averages.

Primary Risks and Disclosure


Performance depends on the changes in market and economic conditions in the selection and percentages of allocations among Underlying Funds.
Alternative investment strategies such as leveraging, arbitrage and commodities investing are subject to greater risks and volatility than more traditional investment offerings. Although asset allocation among different asset categories generally limits risk and exposure to any one category, the risk remains that management may favor an asset category that performs poorly relative to the other asset categories. The subaccounts expect to invest in positions that emphasize alternative investments or nontraditional asset classes or investment strategies and, as a result, are subject to the risk factors of those asset classes. Some of those risks include general economic risk, geopolitical risk, commodity-price volatility, counterparty and settlement risk, currency risk, derivatives risk, emerging markets risk, foreign securities risk, high-yield bond exposure, noninvestment-grade bond exposure commonly known as "junk bonds," index investing risk, industry concentration risk, leveraging risk, market risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, real estate investment risk, sector risk, short sales risk, temporary defensive positions, and large cash positions.
This portfolio expects to invest in positions that emphasize alternatives or nontraditional asset classes or investment strategies and, as a result, are subject to the risk factors of those asset classes. Some of those risks include: general economic, geopolitical, commodity-price volatility, counterparty and settlement, currency, derivatives, emerging markets, foreign securities, high-yield bond exposure, noninvestment grade bond exposure commonly known as "junk bonds," index investing, industry concentration, leveraging, market, prepayment, liquidity, real estate investment, sector, short sales, temporary defensive positions, and large cash positions.
Convertible securities have both debt and equity characteristics. Equities may have greater potential growth, but also higher volatility. The value of the convertible and debt securities may fall when interest rates rise. Longer duration securities may be more volatile and sensitive to interest rate changes than the underlying common stock.
This portfolio could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed-income security, or the counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase agreement, or a loan of portfolio securities, is unable or unwilling to make timely principal and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations.
This portfolio invests in derivative instruments such as swaps, options, futures contracts, forward currency contracts, indexed and asset-backed securities, to be announced (TBAs) securities, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, and certain exchange-traded funds that involve risks including liquidity, interest rate, market, currency, counterparty, credit and management risks, mispricing or improper valuation, low correlation with the underlying asset, rate, or index and could lose more than originally invested.
Investing in emerging markets may involve greater risks than investing in developed countries, including the possibility of industry concentration, nationalization, taxes and transaction costs, lower trading volumes, and less liquid securities, resulting in higher volatility.
The price of equity or equity-related securities will fluctuate and can decline and reduce the value of a portfolio investing in these securities.
An exchange-traded fund ("ETF") may fail to accurately track the market segment or index it is meant to track or trade at a discount to its net asset value "NAV". Shareholders of the Fund will bear their proportionate share of the ETF fees in addition to their fund fees.
Fixed income prices respond to changing economic environments, including interest rate changes and credit risk perceptions of individual issuers, which can negatively affect the price and income level.
Investments in foreign securities are subject to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency values, political, less publicly available information, social and economic developments, and possible imposition of foreign withholding taxes on income payable on the securities. They may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. markets.
Growth stocks are generally priced based on future or anticipated earnings and susceptible to larger price swings and greater potential for loss than other types of stocks.
A portfolio that invests in high-yield bonds, lower-rated bonds, and unrated securities are broadly referred to as "junk bonds" and are considered below "investment-grade" by national ratings agencies. They are subject to the increased risk of an issuer's inability to meet principal and interest payment obligations.
When interest rates increase, fixed-income securities generally will decline in value. Long-term fixed-income securities normally have more price volatility than short-term fixed-income securities. Some equity securities may also be sensitive to interest rate changes.
The Sub-Adviser uses the principal and other investment strategies to seek to achieve the Fund's investment objective, which may cause the Fund to underperform other funds with similar investment objectives.
Investments in securities that are difficult to purchase or sell (illiquid or thinly-traded securities) may reduce returns if the Fund is unable to sell the securities at advantageous times or prices. Illiquid securities may also be difficult to value.
If the Fund acquires shares of investment companies, including ones affiliated with the Fund, shareholders bear both their proportionate share of expenses in the Fund (including management and advisory fees) and, indirectly, the expenses of the investment companies.
The manager's investment techniques could fail to achieve the Fund's investment objective or negatively affect the Fund's investment performance.
A short sale may be affected by selling a security that the fund does not own. If the price of the security sold short increases, the fund would incur a potentially unlimited loss; conversely, if the price declines, the fund will realize a gain.
Investing in smaller, newer companies generally involves greater risks than investing in larger, more established ones and are subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than larger, more established companies or market averages.
Value stocks may not increase in price if other investors fail to recognize a company's value or the factors that are expected to increase the price of a security do not occur.

Obligations issued by agencies and instrumentalities of the U.S. Government vary in the level of support they receive from the U.S. Government, and the maximum potential liability of the issuers may greatly exceed their current resources.

Rising interest rates will generally cause the prices of bonds and other debt securities to fall. Falling interest rates may cause an issuer to redeem, call or refinance a security before its stated maturity, which may result in the fund having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities. Longer maturity debt securities may be subject to greater price fluctuations than shorter. Bonds and debt securities are subject to credit risk including the deterioration of credit strength or failure to make a timely payment resulting in default.
The value of commodity-linked derivatives will fluctuate based on changes in the underlying commodity or related index and may entail greater volatility from causes, including drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs, and international economic, political, and regulatory developments.

They are subject to the increased risk of an issuer's inability to meet principal and interest payment obligations.
Inflation-indexed securities have a tendency to react to changes in real interest rates, which represent nominal (stated) interest rates lowered by the anticipated effect of inflation. In general, the price of an inflation-indexed security can decrease when real interest rates increase, and it can increase when real interest rates decrease. Interest payments on inflation-indexed securities will fluctuate as the principal and/or interest is adjusted for inflation and can be unpredictable.
When interest rates increase, fixed-income securities generally will decline in value. Long-term fixed-income securities normally have more price volatility than short-term fixed-income securities. Some equity securities may also be sensitive to interest rate changes.
Reverse repurchase agreements, loans of portfolio securities, dollar rolls, buy backs, futures, forwards, and the use of when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment transactions, and other derivatives, may give rise to a form of leverage, thereby amplifying the Fund's gains and losses and making the Fund more volatile.

If the counterparty defaults on its obligation, the Fund may suffer delays, incur costs, or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security in either situation and the market value of the security declines, the Fund may lose money.
The value of Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) generally fluctuates in response to changes in real interest rates, which are, in turn, tied to the relationship between nominal interest rates and the rate of inflation. If nominal interest rates increased at a faster rate than inflation, then real interest rates might rise, leading to a decrease in the value of inflation-protected securities.
Obligations issued by agencies and instrumentalities of the U.S. Government vary in the level of support they receive from the U.S. Government, and the maximum potential liability of the issuers may greatly exceed their current resources.

The Fund is considered nondiversified and may invest in a limited number of issuers. With a smaller number of different issuers, there is more risk than holding a larger number of issuers, since any changes may cause greater fluctuation of total return and share price of a nondiversified portfolio.













T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc.


When Thomas Rowe Price, Jr. founded his own investment advisory firm in 1937, he offered investors a new service-investment counseling- and charged asset-based fees for his advice. His growth stock investment philosophy was unprecedented as well. Growth stock investing focuses on well-managed companies whose earnings are expected to grow faster than both inflation and the overall economy. This approach assumes that the market will reward such earnings growth with higher stock prices. Since their beginnings as a small investment house with an unconventional view, T. Rowe Price has grown into a diversified investment management firm serving investors around the world.
T. Rowe Price delivers investment management excellence through a consistent, risk-aware, and long-term approach across a broad range of asset classes. We deliver world-class service and guidance through dedicated, objective, and seasoned professionals.
T. Rowe Price strives for superior investment performance for its clients but remains conservative in the best sense -- carefully weighing risks versus potential reward and eschewing investment trends that, in their view, lack long-term merit.



Primary Risks and Disclosure



Convertible securities have both debt and equity characteristics. Equities may have greater potential growth, but also higher volatility. The value of the convertible and debt securities may fall when interest rates rise. Longer duration securities may be more volatile and sensitive to interest rate changes than the underlying common stock.
This portfolio could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed-income security, or the counterparty to a derivatives contract, repurchase agreement, or a loan of portfolio securities, is unable or unwilling to make timely principal and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations.
The price of equity or equity-related securities will fluctuate and can decline and reduce the value of a portfolio investing in these securities.
Fixed income prices respond to changing economic environments, including interest rate changes and credit risk perceptions of individual issuers, which can negatively affect the price and income level.
Growth stocks are generally priced based on future or anticipated earnings and susceptible to larger price swings and greater potential for loss than other types of stocks.
When interest rates increase, fixed-income securities generally will decline in value. Long-term fixed-income securities normally have more price volatility than short-term fixed-income securities. Some equity securities may also be sensitive to interest rate changes.
Large capitalization stocks as a group could fall out of favor with the market, causing the fund to underperform funds that focus on other types of stocks.
The manager's investment techniques could fail to achieve the Fund's investment objective or negatively affect the Fund's investment performance.
The price of securities of mid-capitalization companies tends to fluctuate more widely and erratically than those of larger, more established companies.
Rising interest rates tend to extend the duration of mortgage-related securities, making them more sensitive to changes in interest rates and exhibit additional volatility. When interest rates decline, borrowers may pay off their mortgages sooner than expected, which can reduce the returns.
Writing call options can reduce the risk of owning equity securities, but it limits the opportunity to profit from an increase in the market value of stocks. Unusual market conditions may reduce the effectiveness of the Fund's options strategies and may not reduce the Fund's volatility to the extent desired.
Obligations issued by agencies and instrumentalities of the U.S. Government vary in the level of support they receive from the U.S. Government, and the maximum potential liability of the issuers may greatly exceed their current resources.
Value stocks may not increase in price if other investors fail to recognize a company's value or the factors that are expected to increase the price of a security do not occur.

The price of equity or equity-related securities will fluctuate and can decline and reduce the value of a portfolio investing in these securities.
Fixed income prices respond to changing economic environments, including interest rate changes and credit risk perceptions of individual issuers, which can negatively affect the price and income level.
Investments in foreign securities are subject to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency values, political, less publicly available information, social and economic developments, and possible imposition of foreign withholding taxes on income payable on the securities. They may be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. markets.
Since the Fund can only distribute what it earns, the Fund's distributions to shareholders may decline when interest rates fall.
When interest rates increase, fixed-income securities generally will decline in value. Long-term fixed-income securities normally have more price volatility than short-term fixed-income securities. Some equity securities may also be sensitive to interest rate changes.
Large capitalization stocks as a group could fall out of favor with the market, causing the fund to underperform funds that focus on other types of stocks.
The manager's investment techniques could fail to achieve the Fund's investment objective or negatively affect the Fund's investment performance.
An investment in a money market portfolio is not insured or guaranteed by a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although such funds seek to preserve the value of the Fund's investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market mutual fund.
Rising interest rates tend to extend the duration of mortgage-related securities, making them more sensitive to changes in interest rates and exhibit additional volatility. When interest rates decline, borrowers may pay off their mortgages sooner than expected, which can reduce the returns.
Investment of more than 25% of total assets in securities issued by banks would entail the risk of the factors influencing the health of the banking industry, affecting performance such as economic trends, industry competition and governmental actions, as well as factors affecting the financial stability of borrowers. Bank securities typically are not insured by the federal government.
Obligations issued by agencies and instrumentalities of the U.S. Government vary in the level of support they receive from the U.S. Government, and the maximum potential liability of the issuers may greatly exceed their current resources.
Value stocks may not increase in price if other investors fail to recognize a company's value or the factors that are expected to increase the price of a security do not occur.

†The freedom mentioned herein is not related to our LifeGuard Freedom Suite of living benefits.
‡Withdrawals that exceed the free withdrawal may be subject to withdrawal charges and excess interest adjustments (interest rate adjustment in New York), where applicable, which may reduce the contract value.
§Systematic investment programs do not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. They involve continuous investing regardless of fluctuating price levels. You should consider your ability to continue investing through periods of fluctuating market conditions. May not be available in all states.
**If fixed account restrictions are imposed, the owner may elect automatic rebalancing, but the 1-Year Fixed Account may not be included in the allocation.
††There may be periods when Jackson restricts the amount of premium payments into, and the amount and frequency of transfers between, into and from, any fixed account option; to close any fixed account option; and to require transfers from a fixed account option. If the transfer restriction is imposed, then transfers from the 1-Year Fixed Account in the first contract year may not exceed one-third of the value of the fixed account; if the maximum transfer amount has been transferred in the previous contract year, in the following contract year transfers may not exceed one-half of the value of the fixed account. If the maximum transfer amount has been transferred in both of the two prior contract years, the remaining value of the fixed account may be transferred the next contract year. Transfers may not begin until 12 months after the last transfer. The interest rate credited to the fixed account is backed by the claims-paying ability of Jackson National Life Insurance Company or Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York. Withdrawals from a fixed account prior to the end of the fixed period may be subject to withdrawal charges and excess interest adjustments (interest rate adjustments in New York), where applicable, which may reduce the contract value. Excess interest adjustments (interest rate adjustments in New York) do not apply on the 1-Year Fixed Account option.
‡‡If the 4-Year withdrawal charge option is elected, subsequent premium payments are only allowed in the first contract year. The additional charge is only for the first four years. If elected maximum issue age is 85.




What is a Variable Annuity?
Variable annuities are long-term, tax-deferred investments designed for retirement, involve investment risks and may lose value. Earnings are taxable as ordinary income when distributed and may be subject to a 10% additional tax if withdrawn before age 59½.

Before investing, investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the variable annuity and its underlying investment options. The current contract prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses, which are contained in the same document, provide this and other important information. Please contact your representative or the Company to obtain the prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses carefully before investing or sending money.

Optional benefits may be elected at issue and, once elected, may not be canceled. Only one optional living benefit and one optional death benefit may be elected per contract. May not be available in all states or on all products, and state variations may apply. The long-term advantage of the optional benefits will vary with the terms of the benefit option, the investment performance of the variable investment options selected and the length of time the annuity is owned. As a result, in some circumstances, the cost of an option may exceed the actual benefit paid under the option. The standard and optional death benefits are terminated if the contract value falls to zero.
Guarantees are backed by the claims-paying ability of Jackson National Life Insurance Company® or Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York® and do not apply to the principal amount or investment performance of a variable annuity's separate account or its underlying investments.
Tax deferral offers no additional value if an annuity is used to fund a qualified plan, such as a 401(k) or IRA, and may be found at a lower cost in other investment products. It also may not be available if the annuity is owned by a "non-natural person" such as a corporation or certain types of trusts.

Investment Company Act of 1940 – Section 24(f)(2) and Rule 24f-2


RESPONSE OF THE CHIEF COUNSEL’S    OFFICE
      DIVISION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

      Jackson National Life
IM Ref. No.  20156231348



Your letter dated June 16, 2015 requests our assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission" or "SEC") under Section 6(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act"), Section 24(f)(2) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") or Rule 24f-2 thereunder, against Jackson National Life Insurance Company, Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York (together, "Jackson") or certain sub-accounts of certain Jackson separate accounts and feeder funds in which they invest (described further below) in connection with variable insurance products sponsored by Jackson, if Rule 24f-2 registration fees are calculated and paid in the manner described in your letter and summarized below. 
 You state the following:
Jackson offers variable insurance products ("VIPs") through several of its separate accounts (the "Separate Accounts").  Selected sub-accounts of the Separate Accounts (the "Divisions") invest in underlying funds (the "Underlying Funds") that are separate series structured as feeder funds (the "Feeder Funds", and, together with Jackson and the Divisions, the "Requestors") of open-end management investment companies in a master-feeder arrangement. The Divisions invest substantially all of their assets in the Feeder Funds in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(E) of the 1940 Act. The Feeder Funds are managed by SEC-registered investment advisers that are affiliates of Jackson. Each Feeder Fund, also in reliance on Section 12(d)(1)(E), invests substantially all of its assets in shares of a corresponding series of an unaffiliated registered management investment company (each a "Master Fund" and collectively, the "Master Funds").
 The contract owners' interests in the Divisions are registered as securities under the 1933 Act. The shares of each Feeder Fund and the shares of each corresponding Master Fund also are registered under the 1933 Act. Each Division’s assets, other than cash, will consist solely of shares of its corresponding Underlying Fund, whose sole portfolio holding, other than cash, will be shares of the Master Fund in which it invests as a Feeder Fund. The Separate Accounts are unit investment trusts ("UITs") registered under the 1940 Act, and the Feeder Funds and the Master Funds are series of open-end management investment companies registered under the 1940 Act. The Separate Accounts, Feeder Funds and Master Funds are therefore subject to Section 24(f) of the 1940 Act.
 You propose that each Division and Feeder Fund, in calculating its portion of annual share registration fees required by Section 24(f)(2) of the 1940 Act and Rule 24f-2 thereunder, should be permitted to exclude from the aggregate sales price of its securities the aggregate net sales price of Master Fund shares that are, in effect, sold through the Feeder Fund to the Division, under circumstances where registration fees have been paid on the aggregate net sales of Master Fund shares to the Feeder Fund in accordance with Rule 24f-2 and Form 24F-2. You assert that such calculation and payment would be consistent with the purposes of Section 24(f) of the 1940 Act and Rule 24f-2 thereunder.
Analysis
 Section 6(b) of the 1933 Act generally requires a registrant to pay to the Commission a fee to register the securities it proposes to offer. Section 24(f) of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder modify the 1933 Act registration provisions for certain registered investment companies. Section 24(f) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, provides that an open-end management company or UIT shall be deemed to have registered an indefinite amount of securities upon the effective date of its registration statement and shall pay a registration fee based on the aggregate sales price for which the company’s securities were sold pursuant to a registration of an indefinite amount of securities under Section 24(f)(2) during the previous fiscal year, which is then reduced by the aggregate redemption or repurchase price of the securities of the company during that year and by the aggregate redemption or repurchase price of any securities of the company that were not used in prior years. Rule 24f-2 requires an open-end management company to file a Form 24F-2 accompanied by a registration fee not later than 90 days after the end of any fiscal year during which it has publicly offered its securities.
 The Commission and its staff have consistently taken the position that share registration fees under Section 24(f)(2) of the 1940 Act need only be paid once in certain circumstances where an investment vehicle is effectively limited to a single substantive share issuance, notwithstanding the fact that its structure may involve multiple share issuances. In adopting Form 24F-2 in 1995, the Commission codified interpretive advice previously given to the American Council of Life Insurance (the "ACLI Letter")[1] that registered investment companies (such as the Underlying Funds) in which variable insurance contract premiums are invested through unmanaged insurance company separate accounts are not required to pay registration fees on securities they sell to the separate accounts.[2] In its adopting release, the Commission stated that the ACLI Letter was intended ". . . to prevent payment of registration fees under the [1933 Act] for the same aggregate proceeds from investors in variable insurance products that results in ‘double counting’ of assets on which such fees are paid."[3] To that end, Instructions B.5 and C.4 to Form 24F-2 make clear that an underlying fund that files a notice under Rule 24f-2 generally is not required to include securities sold to an unmanaged separate account (typically organized as a UIT) that issues interests that are registered under the 1933 Act and on which registration fees have been or will be paid. Therefore, the underlying fund generally is not required to pay a registration fee for those securities, provided that such an underlying fund relying on this exemption does not include shares redeemed or repurchased from such unmanaged separate accounts for purposes of netting sales under Rule 24f-2.[4]
 In a 2012 letter to GMO Trust (the "GMO Letter"),[5] the staff stated that it would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Section 6(b) of the 1933 Act, Section 24 of the 1940 Act or Rule 24f-2 thereunder, against funds in a master-feeder structure if the funds excluded the net sales price of shares of each master fund sold to corresponding feeder funds when calculating aggregate sales proceeds for purposes of Form 24F-2. Among other things, the staff conditioned its no-action assurances on the representation that each feeder fund was a feeder fund in a master-feeder structure and would invest substantially all of its assets in a corresponding master fund. You assert that it would be consistent with our position in the GMO Letter and Section 24(f) and Rule 24f-2 if each Division and Feeder Fund, in calculating its respective portion of annual share registration fees, excluded from the aggregate sales price of its securities the aggregate net sales price of Master Fund shares that are, in effect, sold through the Feeder Fund to the Division, under circumstances where registration fees have been paid on the aggregate net sales of Master Fund shares to the Feeder Fund in accordance with Rule 24f-2 and Form 24F-2. In particular, you note that such treatment would avoid the payment, in effect, of triple Rule 24f-2 registration fees for the same aggregate proceeds from contract owners of VIPs that are invested in the Divisions that in turn purchase Feeder Fund (and, indirectly, Master Fund) shares. Your request is conditioned on representations that are designed to ensure that each Division and Feeder Fund is a conduit for investment in the corresponding Master Fund, and that appropriate share registration fees are in fact paid.
Based on the facts and representations in your letter, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Section 6(b) of the 1933 Act, Section 24(f)(2) of the 1940 Act, or Rule 24f-2 thereunder against any of the Requestors if Rule 24f-2 registration fees are calculated and paid in the manner described in your letter and summarized above. Our position is based particularly on your representations that:

 The Separate Accounts will be registered as UITs under the 1940 Act;


 The Feeder Funds and the Master Funds will be registered as open-end management investment companies under the 1940 Act;


 All interests in the top two tiers of this three-tiered structure will serve as conduits to the contract owners’ interests and benefits under the VIP funded through the various entities;


 Each Division will invest exclusively in a corresponding Feeder Fund;[6]


 Under normal circumstances, each Feeder Fund will invest at least 95% of its assets in the shares of the corresponding Master Fund, with any remaining assets held in cash;


 If a Division or Feeder Fund avoids a registration fee on any sales of its securities (the "Non-Fee Securities") by excluding the net sales price of any Master Fund shares from the amount of that Division’s or Feeder Fund’s sales that are reported in Item 5(i) of Form 24F-2, redemptions or repurchases of such Non-Fee Securities will not be used for purposes of determining the redemption or repurchase price reported for that Division or Feeder Fund in Items 5(ii) and 5(iii) of Form 24F-2;


 If either the Division or the Feeder Fund incurs registration fees, thereby permitting the two other entities to avoid registration fees with respect to any related securities they issue, redemptions or repurchases of such Non-Fee Securities will not be used for purposes of determining the redemption or repurchase price reported for such two other entities in Items 5(ii) and 5(iii) of Form 24F-2; and


 In all cases, the Division, the Feeder Fund, or the Master Fund will pay the registration fees that the other two entities have excluded from their payments. Each Division, Feeder Fund and Master Fund shall request and obtain confirmation, in writing prior to the payment deadline, of the identity of the entity making the payment and of the actual payment, and the entities shall remain liable for payment of the applicable Rule 24f-2 fees until payment has been made.

 This response expresses our view on enforcement action only and does not represent any legal or interpretive position on the issues presented. Because our position is based upon all of your facts and representations, any different facts or representations may require a different conclusion.

Annuities



SALES OF FIXED AND VARIABLE ANNUITIES
There are two major types of annuities: fixed and variable. Fixed annuities guarantee the principal and a minimum rate of interest. Generally, interest credited and payments made from a fixed annuity are based on rates declared by the company, which can change only yearly. Fixed annuities are considered “general account” assets. In contrast, variable annuity account values and payments are based on the performance of a separate investment portfolio, thus their value may fluctuate daily. Variable annuities are considered “separate account” assets.
There is a variety of fixed annuities and variable annuities. One  example, the equity indexed annuity, is a hybrid of the features of  fixed and variable annuities. It credits a minimum rate of interest,  just as other fixed annuities do, but its value is also based on the  performance of a specified stock index—usually computed as a fraction of  that index’s total return. The financial services overhaul enacted into  law in July 2010 included language keeping equity indexed annuities  under state regulation. Variable annuities are subject to both state  insurance regulation and federal securities regulation.
Annuities can be deferred or immediate. Deferred annuities generally  accumulate assets over a long period of time, with withdrawals taken as a  single sum or as an income payment beginning at retirement. Immediate  annuities allow purchasers to convert a lump sum payment into a stream  of income that begins right away. Annuities can be written on an  individual or group basis. (See the Premiums by Line table, page____.)

PREMIUMS BY LINE
Measured by premiums written, annuities are the largest life/health product line, followed by life insurance and health insurance (also referred to in the industry as accident and health). Life insurance policies can be sold on an individual, or "ordinary," basis or to groups such as employees and associations. Accident and health insurance includes medical expense, disability income and long-term care. Other lines include credit life, which pays the balance of a loan if the borrower dies or becomes disabled, and industrial life, small policies whose premiums are generally collected by an agent on a weekly basis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*    Under  ACCESS TO YOUR  MONEY,  with the  subsection  entitled  "5% FOR LIFE
     GUARANTEED  MINIMUM  WITHDRAWAL  BENEFIT  WITH  BONUS  AND  ANNUAL  STEP-UP
     ("LIFEGUARD  ADVANTAGE"),"  please  replace  the text box  within the BONUS
subsection with the following.                                        

       -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The bonus equals 6% (5% if this GMWB is added to the Contract PRIOR TO
    APRIL 30, 2007) and is based on a sum that may vary after this GMWB is
       added to the Contract (the "Bonus Base"), as described immediately below.

               *    WHEN THIS  GMWB IS ADDED TO THE  CONTRACT,  the  Bonus  Base
equals the GWB.                         

               *    WITH  A  WITHDRAWAL,  if  that  withdrawal,  and  all  prior
                    withdrawals  in  the  current  Contract  Year,  exceeds  the
                    greater  of the GAWA and the RMD,  as  applicable,  then the
                    Bonus Base is set to the  lesser of the GWB  after,  and the
                    Bonus Base before,  the withdrawal.  Otherwise,  there is no
      adjustment to the Bonus Base with withdrawals.

                             *    All withdrawals count, including: systematic
                                 withdrawals; RMDs for certain tax-qualified
                                Contracts; withdrawals of asset allocation
                                   and advisory fees; and free withdrawals under
   the Contract.

                           *    A withdrawal in a Contract Year during the
                              Bonus Period (defined below) precludes a
                   bonus for that Contract Year.

               *    WITH A PREMIUM  PAYMENT,  the Bonus  Base  increases  by the
                  amount of the premium net of any applicable premium taxes.

               *    WITH ANY STEP-UP (IF THE GWB INCREASES  UPON  STEP-UP),  the
                    Bonus Base is set to the  greater of the GWB after,  and the
Bonus Base before, the Step-Up.         

THE BONUS BASE CAN NEVER BE MORE THAN $5 MILLION.                 

       The Bonus is available for a limited time (the "Bonus Period"). The Bonus
      Period runs from the date this GMWB is added to the Contract through the
earliest of:                                                      

               *    The tenth Contract  Anniversary  after the effective date of
the endorsement;                        

               *    The Contract  Anniversary  on or  immediately  following the
                    Owner's (if joint Owners, the oldest Owner's) 81st birthday;
or                                      

*    The date Contract Value is zero.             

   Spousal continuation of a Contract with this GMWB does not affect the
    Bonus Period; Contract Anniversaries are based on the Contract's Issue
Date.                                                             

    The bonus is applied at the end of each Contract Year during the Bonus
       Period, if there have been no withdrawals during that Contract Year. When
the bonus is applied:                                             

               *    The GWB is  recalculated,  increasing by 6% (5% if this GMWB
                    is added to the  Contract  PRIOR TO APRIL  30,  2007) of the
Bonus Base.                             

               *    The GAWA is then recalculated, equaling the greater of 5% of
  the new GWB and the GAWA before the bonus.

Applying the bonus to the GWB does not affect the Bonus Base.     
       -------------------------------------------------------------------------

*    Under APPENDIX C, please replace Example 8 with the following.   

 EXAMPLE 8: UPON APPLICATION OF THE GUARANTEED WITHDRAWAL BALANCE BONUS,
 YOUR GWB AND GAWA ARE RE-DETERMINED. (THIS EXAMPLE ONLY APPLIES IF YOUR
ENDORSEMENT CONTAINS A GUARANTEED WITHDRAWAL BALANCE BONUS PROVISION.)

          +    Example  8a: If at the end of a  Contract  Year in which you have
               taken no  withdrawals,  your GWB is  $100,000,  your bonus is 6%,
   your bonus base is $100,000, and your GAWA is $5,000:

               *    Your new GWB is  recalculated  to equal  $106,000,  which is
                    equal to your GWB plus 6% of your  bonus  base  ($100,000  +
$100,000*0.06 = $106,000).              

               *    Your GAWA for the next year is recalculated to equal $5,300,
                    which  is  the   greater  of  1)  your  GAWA  prior  to  the
                    application  of the bonus  ($5,000) or 2) 5% of your new GWB
($106,000*0.05 = $5,300).               

               *    After the application of the bonus, if you continued to take
                    annual  withdrawals  equal to your  GAWA,  it would  take an
                    additional  20 years to deplete your GWB  ($106,000 / $5,300
                    per year = 20  years),  provided  that  there are no further
                    adjustments  made to  your  GWB or your  GAWA  (besides  the
                    annual   reduction   of  your  GWB  by  the  amount  of  the
                    withdrawal)  and that the withdrawals are taken prior to the
                    Latest Income Date.  However, if you have elected a For Life
                    GMWB and the For Life  Guarantee  is in effect,  withdrawals
                    equal to your GAWA could  continue for the rest of your life
                    (or in the case of Joint  Owners,  until the first  death of
                    the Joint  Owners  or until the death of the last  surviving
                    Covered  Life if your  endorsement  is a For Life  GMWB with
                    Joint  Option),  even  beyond  20 years,  provided  that the
              withdrawals are taken prior to the Latest Income Date.

          +    Example  8b: If at the end of a  Contract  Year in which you have
               taken no withdrawals, your GWB is $90,000, your bonus is 6%, your
bonus base is $100,000, and your GAWA is $5,000:  

               *    Your  new GWB is  recalculated  to equal  $96,000,  which is
                    equal to your  GWB plus 6% of your  bonus  base  ($90,000  +
$100,000*0.06 = $96,000).               

               *    Your GAWA for the next  year  remains  $5,000,  which is the
                    greater  of 1) your  GAWA  prior to the  application  of the
                    bonus  ($5,000)  or 2) 5% of your  new GWB  ($96,000*0.05  =
$4,800).                                

               *    After the application of the bonus, if you continued to take
                    annual  withdrawals  equal to your  GAWA,  it would  take an
                    additional  20 years to deplete  your GWB  ($96,000 / $5,000
                    per year = 20  years),  provided  that  there are no further
                    adjustments  made to  your  GWB or your  GAWA  (besides  the
                    annual   reduction   of  your  GWB  by  the  amount  of  the
                    withdrawal)  and that the withdrawals are taken prior to the
                    Latest Income Date.  However, if you have elected a For Life
                    GMWB and the For Life  Guarantee  is in effect,  withdrawals
                    equal to your GAWA could  continue for the rest of your life
                    (or in the case of Joint  Owners,  until the first  death of
                    the Joint  Owners  or until the death of the last  surviving
                    Covered  Life if your  endorsement  is a For Life  GMWB with
                    Joint  Option),  even  beyond  20 years,  provided  that the
              withdrawals are taken prior to the Latest Income Date.

Item 28.         Indemnification                                                

Provision is made in the Company's Amended By-Laws for indemnification by the   
Company of any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party 
to a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action by reason of the   
fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company, 
against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid  
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with
such action, suit or proceedings, to the extent and under the circumstances     
permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Michigan.              

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of  
1933 ("Act") may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of 
the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Company has 
been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such 
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,        
therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against 
liabilities (other than the payment by the Company of expenses incurred or paid 
by a director, officer or controlling person of the Company in the successful   
defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer
or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the   
Company will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled  
by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the     
question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as         
expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such     
issue.

History[edit]
Jackson was named after Andrew Jackson, the 7th President of the United States.[1] Jackson was founded in 1961 in Jackson, Michigan, and moved to its headquarters in Lansing, Michigan in 1976. In the early years, the company focused on offering term insurance to individuals as an alternative to whole life products. Jackson was an early adopter of the independent distribution model, eliminating its captive agency sales force in 1970 to sell products through independent agents. By 1984, Jackson had grown to $1 billion in assets. The company's growth attracted the attention of Prudential plc, which acquired Jackson in 1986.
Since the mid-1990s, Jackson has focused on diversification of products and distribution channels. In 1995, the company launched its first variable annuity and began selling guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements through its Institutional Products Department. In 1996, Jackson introduced its first fixed index annuity (FIA). In 1998, National Planning Holdings (NPH), Jackson's affiliated independent broker-dealer network, was formed with the launch of National Planning Corporation and the acquisition of SII Investments, Inc. In 2000, NPH acquired INVEST Financial Corporation and Investment Centers of America.
In March 2003, Jackson entered the registered investment adviser channel with the launch of Curian Capital LLC. Jackson's acquisitions of Life Insurance Company of Georgia in 2005 and SRLC America Holding Corp. (SRLC) in 2012 each added 1.5 million in-force life insurance and annuity policies to Jackson's books. SRLC is the Swiss holding company of Reassure America Life Insurance Company, which was the US primary operating company of Swiss Re's Admin Re business unit.

Jackson National Life Insurance Company (often referred to as simply Jackson) is a U.S. company that offers annuities for retail investors and fixed income products for institutional investors. Jackson subsidiaries and affiliates provide specialized asset management and retail brokerage services. Jackson is a subsidiary of the British insurer, Prudential plc, which acquired the company for $608 million in 1986. That company is unrelated to the American insurance conglomerate, Prudential Financial.
Founded in 1961, Jackson is headquartered in Lansing, Michigan. The company and its affiliates also have offices in Denver, Colorado; Nashville, Tennessee; El Segundo, California; Chicago, Illinois; Tampa, Florida; Appleton, Wisconsin; Purchase, New York; and Bismarck, North Dakota.
Jackson markets its products in 49 states and the District of Columbia through independent and regional broker-dealers, wirehouses, financial institutions and independent insurance agents. A subsidiary of Jackson, Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York, markets products similarly within the state of New York.

History[edit]
Jackson was named after Andrew Jackson, the 7th President of the United States.[1] Jackson was founded in 1961 in Jackson, Michigan, and moved to its headquarters in Lansing, Michigan in 1976. In the early years, the company focused on offering term insurance to individuals as an alternative to whole life products. Jackson was an early adopter of the independent distribution model, eliminating its captive agency sales force in 1970 to sell products through independent agents. By 1984, Jackson had grown to $1 billion in assets. The company's growth attracted the attention of Prudential plc, which acquired Jackson in 1986.
Since the mid-1990s, Jackson has focused on diversification of products and distribution channels. In 1995, the company launched its first variable annuity and began selling guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements through its Institutional Products Department. In 1996, Jackson introduced its first fixed index annuity (FIA). In 1998, National Planning Holdings (NPH), Jackson's affiliated independent broker-dealer network, was formed with the launch of National Planning Corporation and the acquisition of SII Investments, Inc. In 2000, NPH acquired INVEST Financial Corporation and Investment Centers of America.
In March 2003, Jackson entered the registered investment adviser channel with the launch of Curian Capital LLC. Jackson's acquisitions of Life Insurance Company of Georgia in 2005 and SRLC America Holding Corp. (SRLC) in 2012 each added 1.5 million in-force life insurance and annuity policies to Jackson's books. SRLC is the Swiss holding company of Reassure America Life Insurance Company, which was the US primary operating company of Swiss Re's Admin Re business unit.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
