NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Barnes & Noble, Inc. (NYSE: BKS), the nation’s largest 
      retail bookseller and a leading retailer of content, digital media and 
      educational products, today announced the appointment of Mary Amicucci 
      as Chief Merchandising Officer, effective immediately. Ms. Amicucci 
      previously held the role of Vice President of Adult Trade & Children’s 
      Books and will continue to report directly to Jaime Carey, Chief 
      Operating Officer.
    


      “We are thrilled to announce that Mary Amicucci has been promoted to 
      Chief Merchandising Officer. Mary has a proven track record of success 
      and leadership of our physical book business, making her the perfect 
      choice for this position,” said Mr. Carey. “She has already made an 
      outstanding contribution to our merchandising efforts and we’re excited 
      to see what she will achieve in this new role.”
    

      Ms. Amicucci served as Vice President, Children’s Books since 2010 and 
      was promoted to Vice President, Adult Trade & Children’s Books in 2013, 
      where she was responsible for leading merchandising plans and marketing 
      strategies. In her new role, she will oversee the planning of all 
      merchandising initiatives and will also be responsible for managing and 
      developing talent across all of the merchandising groups within the 
      Company, including Books, Toys & Games, Gift, Newsstand and Music/DVD.
    

      Ms. Amicucci joined Barnes & Noble from The Children’s Place Retail 
      Stores, Inc., where she held the position of Vice President, Planning 
      and Allocation. She was responsible for the strategic development of 
      that company’s sales, markdown, inventory management plans and margin 
      for both the retail stores and the e-commerce business. In addition to 
      her eight years at The Children’s Place, Ms. Amicucci has also held 
      buying positions at May Company Department stores, Ames Department 
      stores, and Maurices, Inc.
