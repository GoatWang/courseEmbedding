President Obama for instance, has made numerous changes in immigration,bringing positive conclusions to the key issues encountered by the U.S. immigrant community including undocumented alienism, lack of work permits, insurances, driver licenses and green card statuses. Excited to be a part of this shifting landscape is Sherin Thawer, a business litigation lawyer, and immigration expert from Texas-the Lone Star State.Thawer started the Law Offices of Sherin Thawer & Associates, back in 2000 to bring her business litigation expertise to the immigration field. “My law firm was initially formed to offer business litigation services. But I began to be more involved in immigration cases and 14 years later, I’m knee deep in immigration practice and committed to helping different individuals with their immigration issues,” says Thawer. Currently, Sherin Thawer & Associates, the full-service immigration firm handles cases that range from family and employment based immigration cases to deportation and removal proceedings.Sherin Thawer agrees that the immigration reforms, brought by President Obama have mainly be of an assistance the South Asian community. Through the President’s Deferred Actions for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), Thawer’s law firm has been able to help a lot of adolescent individuals in conquering their dreams such as attending colleges, obtaining their driver’s licenses and being able to gain authorized employment authorizations in the United States. “Most of the South Asian children who came to the states as minors are struggling to obtain status here because either their parents do not have a green card status or their cases are messed up. This is really unfair for them. But through DACA, these children don’t have to face any restrictions to obtain the best of education and employment in the U.S.,” notes Thawer.With its headquarters in Irving, Texas,Sherin Thawer & Associates not only has a strong local presence, but also a global stand. Through teleconferences and emails, the firm helps many people hailing from countries like India, Dubai, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and many others. Even though the Attorneys are not afforded to personally acquaint many Clients, they are able to assist them in their immigration cases. “Clients come to us for only one reason, to win the case. In the end, they do not want to hear anything else. Thus, as an attorney, it is very important for me to make sure my case is perfectly handled before it goes to trial,” says Thawer.The law firm’s success stories can be briefed in a case study, which involved a LA-based Guajarati family who has been struggling to obtain their green card status for almost 27 years. Initially, the family filed for asylum through a local attorney that produced no result. Subsequent to multiple appeals in Immigration Court, the family got stuck at the circuit court, where their case remained pending for years. Finally when they approached Sherin Thawer & Associates, Thawer proposed a specifically carved out solution involving an appeal for a deportation termination. Same has enabled the case to attain a successful closure, bringing the Legal Permanent Residency status to the entire family.Going forward, Sherin Thawer &Associates aims to stand by their motto, ‘Will to Win,’ to attain successful results in each and every Client’s case. At the end of the day, Sherin Thawer looks forward to one thing—to apply the law in a way which only provides for the best possible solution.Sherin Thawer Law OfficeRinna S. ratedLAW OFFICES OF SHERIN THAWER, PCBy Mariola Michalska, Associate AttorneyIS A RECESSION GOOD TIME FOR A DIVORCE? - 04/23/13In the times of recession, many couples are suffering from the consequences of flawed financial decisions or because of overall economics in the country. But, can the recession be a good time in which to bring divorce proceedings? Absolutely.There's the attorneys theory, that money provides the soft fatty tissue that insulates the marital skeleton; once it's cut back and people get a good look at the guts of their relationship, they want out. And there's the marriage-counselor theory, that couples who were never quite on the same page in the checkbook finally get pushed off the ledger by endless arguing over their declining resources. And the therapist theory, that financial worries cause stress, stress can cause depression, etc.In a normal economy, couples typically build equity in their homes, then divide that equity in a divorce, either after selling the house or with one partner buying out the other’s share. But after the recent boom-and-bust cycle, more couples own houses that neither spouse can afford to maintain, and that they cannot sell for what they owe. For couples already under stress, the family home has become a toxic asset.For the majority of the population, the principal marital assets, the 401(k) and the marital home have lost much of their value. Without equity in the marital home and encumbered by substantial credit card debt, the parties are left to fight about who gets stuck paying the bills. In some cases, unable to distribute the debt or sell the marital home, the estranged spouses are forced to become adverse roommates. However, the recession affects the upper and middle classes differently: for the well-to-do, the recession offers an opportunity to end the marriage at bargain basement prices as property will be distributed at lower valuations. If you are a business owner, a low valuation of assets will be in your favor in a divorce.   If you the owner of a business and the business is a very substantial asset of the marriage, in a recession the values of most assets decrease. (The fair market value of a business is determined by the price someone is willing to pay in a bona fide arm's length transaction.) In a recession there is a lack of faith in the economy overall. Even if the business is sound, it may be valued substantially lower during a recession than its value during good economic times. It is usual in divorce cases that the owner of the business will be awarded the business (after it has been appraised) and the other spouse will be given assets, or cash, to offset the value of the business. Thus, in a recession the payout figure to the other spouse for the business should be less than during good times and the advantage to the business owner is that after the recession the value of the business should rise again.The Law Offices of Sherin Thawer, P.C., is a general practice law firm that is ready to help you during difficult times.

Office open Monday-Saturday.Sherin Thawer Law OfficeSam F. rated                           OBSTACLES FOR THE LAID OFF H1B EMPLOYEEBy Sherin Thawer of the Law Offices Of Sherin Thawer, P.C. “Will to Win” company.            Persons working under a nonimmigrant visa status in the U.S. are facing many difficulties.  They are threatened by job loss due to the current economic crisis that may impact their visa status as well.   Recently, we have received numerous inquiries on this subject and would like to share a few with our loyal Fun Asia listeners.During these times of economic crisis, many of our listeners are facing the possibility of losing their jobs.  Those that are working under a nonimmigrant visa status, have the added burden of the impact the job loss will have on their current status.  Several listeners have sent us inquiries regarding this issue and we would like to address some of the most common situations.What happens if I find another H1B employer during the time I was laid off, as my company informs me that they have sent USCIS a letter revoking my HIB petition?   Recently, it has taken quite some time for USCIS to process H1B revocation notices.  This is not to say that this is their policy but it’s due to their system.  We recommend the H1B should try to obtain another job and file the H1B transfer petition as soon as possible.Can I apply for an adjustment of status other than H1B if I am being laid off?An H1B employee may be able to apply for another status, depending on a person's individual circumstances and the visa’s eligibility requirements. Viable options may include but not limited to F-1 (student status); H-4 or F-2 (dependent of an H1B or F-1 spouse, respectively); B-2 (tourist)/ B-1 (business status), and E2/EB5 investment visas.                                                                                                                                                                         I have recently been laid off and was told that my employer is obligated to continue   paying me until USCIS revokes the petition. Is this true?No, according to the Department of Labor policy an employer must continue to pay the H1B worker until there is a “bona fide” termination of the employment relationship. It is not specified exactly what forms a “bona fide termination,” but the common perspective is that termination occurs on the same day the employer notifies the H1B employee that the position has been terminated and all requirements for payment of wages terminate on the date of employment termination.

One of our latest success stories is about Mr. Asif AliMr. Asif Ali entered the United States, a long time ago in the year of 1994. In 2006, Mr. Ali’s employer filed an I-140 Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker for his benefit. However, the I-140 was denied because of Mr. Ali’s unauthorized employment for the period of time from 1994 to 2006. Mr. Ali retained an attorney to file his 245(i) Adjustment of Status pursuant to the Life Act, but Mr. Ali’s previous attorney forwarded erroneous documents to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). His application was rejected. Then, the same attorney filed an appeal but sent it to the wrong address.Consequently, Mr. Ali retained the legal services of the Law Offices of Sherin Thawer P.C., to file an appeal based on an ineffective assistance of previous attorney and from the USCIS’ incorrect decision. Ms. Sherin Thawer filed a comprehensive appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and promptly sent a notice to the USCIS regarding same. Ms. Thawer requested that the service reexamine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, and an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked. Based on the well thought-out legal strategy, abundance of essential case law supporting same, and attached evidence, the USCIS considered the appeal. As a result, the USCIS reopened Mr. Asif Ali case and forwarded same for further consideration. The successful appeal has given Mr. Ali great opportunity to prove his case and much deserved piece of mind.We would like to once again congratulate the Asif Ali on his success.The Law Offices of Sherin Thawer, P.C. is a full service law firm that is ready to help you during difficult times.

Mrs. Ferdous mentioned her daughter, Ms. Farzana Naim, when she initially filed the I-140 Application. However, USCIS did not mention Farzana Naim at the time of interview for Mr. and Mrs. Ferdous because she had aged out. Therefore, Ms. Thawer filed a CSPA (Child Status Protective Act) Application for Farzana Naim on the basis that she was initially mentioned in I-140 filing. However, USCIS did not response to that CSPA for more than six (6) months.At last, Ms. Sherin Thawer SUED the U.S. CONUSLATE OFFICE IN BANGLADESH as an action in Federal Court in the Northern District of Texas against all six (6) agencies – United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation, et al.

This story first began on or about August or September of 1998, when Mr. Raj Ahuja entered the United States without inspection. He was immediately detained immediately by the US Customs Border Patrol in El Paso, TX. He was later released on bond. Unaware he had just signed a voluntary departure order, he went on to establish a life in the United States. He was assured by his lawyers everything was taken care of.On October 9, 2004, Mr. Ahuja married USC, Ms. Nandita Krishna. They had met through a mutual friend and it was love at first sight. They later had two children, one son who is now seven years old, and one daughter who is now six years old.The ugly troubles of immigration resurfaced eight years ago when Mr. Ahuja attempted to apply for status. They hired someone who deceived them into thinking Mr. Ahuja could gain a green card by spending thousands of dollars. After realizing, something is desperately wrong, they approached Attorney Sherin Thawer for a second opinion on October 23, 2012. ICE officers had been calling Mr. Ahuja to come to their office. Mr. and Mrs. Ahuja frightened and not sure what this would mean, hired Law Offices of Sherin Thawer & Associates to represent them. On, December 3, 2012, the clients appeared for their interview whereby Mr. Ahuja was taken into ICE custody as service records indicated an outstanding in Absentia Order from December 3, 1998 and he was ordered removed. Ms. Thawer and her team expeditiously worked day and night 24/7 to ensure his release. The office filed a Motion to Reopen an In absentia Order and Request for Emergency Stay of Removal Mr. Ahuja’s case. In a matter of one week, ICE counsel agreed with Ms. Thawer’s arguments and filed a non-opposition response, favoring Mr. Ahuja’s case. He was released from Custody on December 12, 2012.Mr. Ahuja is now qualified for work authorization permit and adjustment of status in forthcoming.

I was a victim of robbery [at gun point] at my work. Police are not able to get the robbers yet.I consulted with Sharin Thawer law Office on U-Visa and got the right suggestions towards filling U-Visa. I had to get signature from Police Department that would verify authenticity of the crime. But, I ran into the most difficult phase of my life for not being able to get the signature from Dallas Police Department for more than a year. But to be honest, with the help of Sharin Thawer Law Office, Sharin managed to get the signature and now I am very happy and most hopeful towards my case going into right directions. I highly recommend anyone with similar cases to get consultation from this office.Before I went to this office, I had visited multiple law firms, they didn't even have any concert idea to suggest me and were hesitant to suggest me to further my case.But, Sharin did suggest me to move further with U-Visa and I am happy with her work and very happy to move on with the case with this office.Nayar & McIntyre, LLPJoseph M. ratedI decided to put comments after receiving great services from Nayar & Mclntyre, LLP law firm.

When buying a policy, the person agrees to pay a premium, which is small, regular payment based on the losses that may occur. If the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy, the premium is usually higher. Premiums are often paid monthly, and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured item.Many types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item. The amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible. In the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers, the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what. If the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount, the insurance company does not pay anything. If the cost is greater than the deductible, the policyholder only pays the deductible, while the insurance pays the rest. Generally, the deductible amount is related to your premium, with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium, and vice-versa.Insurance Agents
Selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage. This is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation. Agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most. Based on their needs and individual risk, agents can often give potential customers a quote, which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy. This is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost, because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time. Insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly. Credit scores play a major role in insurance scores, but past insurance-claim history is also taken into account.While agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance, some sell several different types of insurance. Agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently, selling policies from several different insurers.Insurance ProductsAlmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances. Insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed. Some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all use.Automotive Insurance
Millions of Americans drive a car to get from place to place each day, so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types. In most states, the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car, up to a certain amount. Most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance, which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault. Liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident. It's important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others, not the policyholder themselves. In addition to liability insurance, car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident. For this purpose, liability, vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policy.Insurance can also be purchased for other vehicles, like motorcycles, ATVs, boats or RVs, and generally functions similarly to car insurance. Policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous, or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle. Many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles, ATVs, boats and RVs.Homeowners Insurance
Your home, condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for, so it makes sense to get it insured. Homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself, but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well. Many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policy.Like auto insurance, homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items. The primary coverage type is for the dwelling, insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it. Policies may also cover property within the home, with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets. Personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for, much like auto insurance.Property insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control. These are known as perils, and may include fire, flooding, natural disasters and other catastrophic events. You may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a high-risk area. Flood insurance is an exception, however, and can be purchased through the government-sponsored National Flood Insurance Program. Your lender may require this if you live in a flood-prone area.Health Insurance
To help pay for medical expenses, many people rely on their health insurance. With the passing of the Affordable Care Act, almost every American is required to enroll in a health care plan, or they face a penalty. Health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance, although it is probably used to cover expenses more often, since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine. Health insurance also operates on a premium-deductible model, and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle. For example, if you visit doctors very infrequently, you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible. On the other hand, people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible. Dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by law.Life Insurance
When someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work, it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones. Many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost. Life insurance comes in two basic types: term and universal. With a term life insurance plan, you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time, usually 10 years or more. If you die at any point in that timeframe, your family receives a death benefit. If you're still around when the term is over, the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing. Universal life covers your entire life, and usually delivers a minimum benefit at death.Travel insurance
Travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel, whether it's losing luggage or medical treatment abroad. Travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations. Travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage. Specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks, like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation. Blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trip.Pet insurance
Pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog, cat or other domestic animal. Medical care for animals can be very costly, particularly because insurance for them is rare. By paying into a premium, you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication. While virtually unheard of a few years ago, pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to rise.Umbrella insurance
Umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies, usually home or auto insurance. Consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover. For example, most car insurance liability policies cover at least $25,000 per person or $50,000 per accident. But if the accident involves a very valuable car, or the victim is willing to pursue legal action, insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost. You may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policy.Insurance Claims BasicsTo receive a payout for an insurance policy, the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company. The basics of the process are straightforward, but can vary depending on the type of insurance.Claims Adjusters and Examiners
A claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company, and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided. An adjuster inspects claims related to property damage, as in the case of auto or home insurance policies. Claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance, and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedures.How To Make a Claim
Filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing, but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses. It's important to note that in the case of emergencies, you should always call 911 first. The safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insurance.Auto Insurance Claim: If you're involved in an accident, you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation. You can file a claim upon obtaining the police report. It's also a good idea, if possible, to take your own notes at the scene. The most important things to record are what happened before the accident, the date and time, traffic signs in the area and road conditions. Also be sure to get the other driver's name, address, license plate number and insurance information. Even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process. Once you have this documentation, call your insurance company right away.
Homeowners Insurance Claim: In the case of damage, take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved. Take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible. If any of your possessions were damaged, use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim. Once an adjuster has made their own report, review it for accuracy.
Life Insurance Claim: Send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan, as well as a certified copy of the policyholder's death certificate. With the proper information, life insurance claims are generally straightforward. Problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy. In this case, an attorney may be needed to settle the claim.Finding Discounts on InsuranceInsurance is a wise investment, but it can make a dent in your monthly budget. Thankfully, there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you need.Shop and Compare
Perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible. Even after you've chosen a plan and started paying into it, consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy. Consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy. While traditional agents can still find a good deal, independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs. The Internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before. Potential customers can often get free quotes online very quickly.Buy Only What You Need
Insurance agents will often try to "upsell" on various extra products that may be useful for certain people, but are generally excessive for the average consumer. Stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs. For example, if the annual cost of your auto insurance is 10 percent or more of the total value of your car, drop all but the most essential coverage. This is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings. Otherwise, you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash. It can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policy.Take Advantage of Discounts
Insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances. In one of the most basic discounts, many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home, auto and life insurance policies from the same provider. Car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course. For those with teenagers on their plan, good grades can earn a small discount as well. Insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums. Some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel, federal employees, teachers, first responders and their families.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Brown William carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
Brown William currently holds license 789975, 310206 (Electrical, General Building Contractor, Plumbing), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Brown William



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Brown William



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.
Brown William has a $12,500 bond with Wesco Insurance Company. 











What else should I know before hiring Brown William



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
