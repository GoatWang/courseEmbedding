Overview
Aetos Capital (“Aetos”) provides customized portfolio solutions to institutional investors.  Our investment professionals bring deep experience across a broad range of asset classes including hedge funds, public and private equity, credit and real estate.  As dedicated fiduciaries, we employ a disciplined approach to asset allocation, manager selection, and portfolio construction that emphasizes comprehensive risk management at every step.
At Aetos, we are committed to providing our clients with exceptional service that is highly customized to meet their long-term investment goals.  To this end, we remain a wholly independently-owned, SEC-registered investment advisor1 with offices in New York and California. Since inception, we have grown steadily and organically to become the multi-billion dollar firm we are today.
______________
1 SEC registration does not imply in any manner whatsoever that Aetos has been sponsored, recommended, or approved, or that its abilities or qualifications have in any respect been passed upon by the United States or any agency or any office thereof.


















Approach | Aetos Capital



















































Approach
Investment Process





Building portfolios that seek to preserve capital and maximize alpha
At Aetos, we take a differentiated approach to identifying the fundamental sources of alpha, driven by our understanding of the nature of market inefficiencies and the potential rewards for providing liquidity.  We leverage this understanding to construct portfolios that are designed to preserve capital and maximize alpha generation over a wide range of market environments.
Our approach is both long-term and tactical.  We make core allocations to our highest-conviction managers that we believe are best-equipped to navigate through market cycles.  At the same time, our research team identifies developments in financial and economic conditions that create near-term investment opportunities, allowing us to make adjustments to our clients’ portfolios in the context of their longer-term goals.

History
Core Principles
Advantage





Advantage
Below are four key factors that we believe differentiate Aetos from our peers:
Fiduciary Perspective
Aetos’ Co-Founder Anne Casscells brings a unique perspective to investing, having previously served as Chief Investment Officer of Stanford Management Company.  Our senior investment professionals also average more than 20 years of hedge fund investing experience as fiduciaries, in addition to deep capital markets expertise across asset classes, securities, and investment strategies.
Knowledge Sharing/“Extension of Staff”
At Aetos, we pride ourselves on the high level of knowledge transfer with our clients’ investment staffs, whereby individuals have access to senior Aetos investment leadership.  In addition to portfolio details, we share economic and market insights across traditional and alternative strategies, as well as provide training and education on best practices across areas such as strategy allocation, investment and operational due diligence, and risk management.
Significant Investor in Hedge Funds and Other Alternative Investment Strategies
Aetos is large enough to access the most sought-after hedge funds, yet nimble enough to identify unique alpha sources and make investments of meaningful size.  Our size and industry stature often enable us to negotiate favorable terms on behalf of clients.
Customized Investment Solutions
Creating customized portfolios is in Aetos’ DNA, starting with our first portfolio in 2001.  Currently, approximately 80% of our current assets under management are in highly customized mandates, including multi-strategy and specialty portfolios structured according to our clients’ investment needs.
















History | Aetos Capital



















































Firm
History
Core Principles
Advantage





History
Aetos was founded in 2001 by Anne Casscells, formerly the Chief Investment Officer of the Stanford Management Company, and Michael Klein, formerly the President of Morgan Stanley’s institutional funds business. With decades of deep capital markets and related fiduciary experience, our founding partners and broader team bring together a unique and complementary set of talents and skills.
Aetos was founded on the premise of working with institutions to create best-in-class investment programs, complementing their internal resources. Our goal is to provide a solution for institutions to invest in a superior risk-adjusted way, as well as to serve as an extension of our clients’ staff, seeking to provide high-touch service and to serve as a trusted partner.
















Investment Process | Aetos Capital



















































Approach
Investment Process





Investment Process
Aetos implements a fundamentally-based investment process, coupled with a disciplined approach to strategy allocation, manager selection and portfolio monitoring. Risk management is incorporated throughout every step of our investment process, and is an integral component of manager evaluation and portfolio construction from start to finish.
Strategy Allocation

Analyze fundamental data and capital market trends to assess relative attractiveness of various investment strategies
Anticipate shifts in public policy (including fiscal and monetary policy) and determine potential impacts on investor portfolios
Perform in-depth primary research on high-priority topics to form timely and differentiated views on market themes

Manager Evaluation and Selection

Combine qualitative and quantitative analysis of managers to assess competitive advantage and ability to generate alpha
Engage managers at multiple levels of seniority and responsibility (holistic team perspective)
Perform extensive diligence on managers’ operational, business and legal infrastructures
Employ proprietary and third-party reference check systems

Portfolio Construction

Construct diversified, high-conviction portfolios using “core/satellite/opportunistic” model, aiming to be relatively concentrated by manager and well-diversified by strategy
Tailor portfolio exposures specifically to client objectives
Utilize constrained mean-variance optimization techniques, stress tests and VaR analyses

Manager and Portfolio Monitoring

Perform detailed monthly reviews of manager performance, positions, and risk exposures based on quantitative data and regular conversations with managers
Assess material operational developments through continuous monitoring
Supplement monthly manager reviews with comprehensive formal updates on an annual basis

Liquid Alternative ETFs: WisdomTree DYLS and DYB






























































                            WisdomTree now has the WisdomTree Dynamic Long/Short U.S.
                            Equity Fund (DYLS) and the WisdomTree Dynamic Bearish U.S. Equity Fund (DYB) enabling
                            investors to access the advantages of alternative investment strategies with all
                            the benefits of exchange-traded funds.
                            


WisdomTree Dynamic Long/Short U.S. Equity Fund

DYLS is a primarily long1
                                    strategy that is designed to add short2 exposure to hedge risk and reduce
                                    the net long exposure. The Fund can be 100%, 50%, or 0% net long, depending on market
                                    conditions. 
                                


WisdomTree Dynamic Bearish U.S. Equity Fund


                                    DYB is able to be net short or market neutral when the market environment 
                                    is considered poor or mixed, and can have a small net long position when 
                                    the environment is deemed more attractive. The Fund can be 25% net long, 0% net long or 100% net short.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.WISE (9473), or visit wisdomtree.com to view or download a prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.

                                        There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. The Fund invests in derivatives, including as a substitute to gain short exposure to equity securities. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. Derivatives used by the Fund to offset its exposure to market volatility may not perform as intended. The Fund may engage in “short sale” transactions and will lose value if the security or instrument that is the subject of a short sale increases in value. A Fund that has exposure to one or more sectors may increase the Fund’s vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. The composition of the respective Index underlying each Fund is heavily dependent on quantitative models and data from one or more third parties and the Index may not perform as intended. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets.  Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.
                                             
                                        
                                        Neither WisdomTree Investments, Inc. nor its affiliates, nor Foreside Fund Services, LLC., or its affiliates provide tax advice.

        Regardless of whether you believe markets are efficient or return premiums exist, in any given year smart beta indexes that focus on capturing return premiums or “factors” are either going to out- or underperform market cap-weighted indexes. Over long periods, we feel that focusing on fundamentals and rebalancing back to those fundamentals at periodic intervals can add value over complete market cycles, partly by tilting toward known return premiums. In 2015, value and size (i.e., small caps) underperformed, but momentum, quality and low volatility outperformed.1   
Now the question is what factors will perform best in 2016 and whether the answer changes depending on the direction of the market. WisdomTree recently created the WisdomTree Dynamic Long/Short U.S. Equity Index (WTDLS), designed to generate alpha at the core with a multi-factor stock selection model along with the ability to hedge market risk dynamically. 
Key Features to WisdomTree Approach 
WisdomTree has been a pioneer in fundamental indexing for almost a decade, typically focusing on signal factors such as value, quality and size; but now we are pleased to introduce this new multi-factor approach. The WisdomTree Dynamic Long U.S. Equity Index (WTDL) is the long component of WTDLS and comprises approximately 100 stocks with the highest combined fundamentals, which are low volatility weighted and rebalanced quarterly. 
•	Fundamental Selection: Stocks are graded on a combination of growth, quality and value factors, and the most attractive stocks in each sector are selected for inclusion. It is important to note that each sector has its own unique factor scoring system, because we believe a different set of fundamentals may potentially work better in one sector as opposed to another. By combining quality and value factors, which we believe complement each other, we hope to smooth the return variance in the short term, while still tapping into the long-term return premiums. 
 
•	Low-Volatility Weighting: In each sector, the Index assigns higher weights to stocks that exhibit lower volatility characteristics, as measured by the stocks’ standard deviation and beta to the market. We know that low volatility weighting has historically worked as a single factor, so we believe applying it to a multi-factor selection model will also add value.  
 
•	Sector-Neutral Capping: The Index targets a sector-neutral allocation when compared to the largest 500 U.S. stocks by market capitalization. We believe this keeps the Index properly diversified and eliminates the potential for the fundamental selection or low-volatility weighting to significantly over- or under-weight certain sectors. We are confident about the stock selection and weighting process, so we wanted to rely on that to drive the relative return differentials instead of taking sector bets against a cap-weighted index.
To get a sense of the outcome from the selection and weighting process, we compared WTDL against popular market cap-weighted style and factor indexes. 
 
Index Valuations

For definitions of terms and indexes in the chart, visit our glossary. 
 
•	Attractive across Multiple Valuation Measures: We find it impressive, but not surprising, that WTDL scored high on multiple valuation measures. As of 12/31/2015, WTDL had the highest dividend yield; it also showed similar price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios as the S&P 500 Value Index, both indicators highlighting its tilt toward value. WTDL had the second-highest quality metrics, defined by return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA), a very close second only to the MSCI USA Quality Index, which focuses more directly on that factor. Lastly, WTDL had higher profit margins than the S&P 500 Index and very similar growth expectations. 
 
Dynamic Hedging Indicator
The above table highlights how WTDL had diversified exposure across multiple factors—but what if markets are choppy? For one thing, the low-volatility weighting methodology could help smooth the returns and lower market drawdowns, but a primary driver will be the dynamic hedging indicator.  
The dynamic hedging indicator uses growth and quality indicators such as profit margins and popular valuation measures to determine the hedge ratio or short percentage. So when the fundamentals, or profits, of the universe are deteriorating, the dynamic indicator would look to hedge the portfolio or increase the short percentage. Similarly, as valuations become more stretched, adding risk to the portfolio, the indicator would look to hedge as well. 
While our hedging indicator will certainly not get every market downdraft timed perfectly, it did start getting more bearishly positioned toward the end of 2015 and signaled to be 100% hedge for January 2016, making the net equity exposure for WTDLS 0% (or market neutral). We believe the factor diversity and dynamic equity exposure this index provides deserve a second look, given the recent market volatility and uncertainty for 2016.
