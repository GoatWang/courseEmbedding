Exact Sciences is fueled by passion, innovation and Madison’s entrepreneurial spirit. People join Exact Sciences to generate real change. And together we have, pairing creativity with rigorous science to produce Cologuard®, then proving its performance in one of the largest clinical trials of its kind.
We began with strong science and successfully applied it to the development of a test that is changing human behavior—how people are screened for today’s second deadliest cancer. We built a flexible lab and customer care center that can be scaled to take on other cancers through early detection. And we did it all because of the remarkable people of Exact Sciences.
There is a new model for success. Meet the leadership team that is making it happen.
