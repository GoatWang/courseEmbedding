Portfolios - Fairview Capital           Top MenuHomeClient LoginSchwab Client LoginWealth Management SiteContactNavigation  Fairview Capital Prudent Stewardship of Significant Wealth    Portfolios We craft client investment portfolios to suit their long-term financial goals. The balance between liquidity requirements and return objectives establishes parameters for the portfolio allocation targets. It’s essential to fully and honestly define these guidelines at the outset in order to avoid the need to make changes during the inevitable periods of broad market volatility. Episodes of market panic, exemplified in recent years, will continue to occur periodically in the future as well. It’s best to prepare before the storm.Our investment strategies are based upon our internally-managed Equity portfolio, which itself is comprised of a select group of investments chosen by the Fairview Capital research team (please refer to the Process tab for additional information).For clients seeking broad diversification and tax efficiency at low cost, Fairview offers a highly customized portfolio. This Wealth Management Account supplements Fairview’s domestic Equity portfolio with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to gain exposure to global fixed income, international and emerging market equities, international and domestic real estate, commodities, and gold.After a thorough review of investment objectives, income needs, and overall risk tolerance, we establish target allocation levels for each asset class, along with an acceptable tolerance range, for Wealth Management Account portfolios.We monitor the portfolios, and when any asset class exceeds or falls below the ranges that we have established as acceptable, we rebalance back to the target allocation. The elegance of this model lies in its low cost and simplicity. Because we are using index ETFs, the management cost is very low; the rebalancing process then encourages the discipline of selling high and buying low.Our core mission and fiduciary obligation is to optimize client outcomes, and this Wealth Management Account firmly meets our criteria. We maintain focus on our core expertise, which is fundamental research and stock-picking across the broad spectrum of the U.S. equity markets. Clients then obtain indexed exposure to a diversified range of international and domestic assets, along with our high-touch service, at a cost that we believe is substantially more attractive than competitive offerings.Fairview principals have a significant portion of their financial net worth invested in the very same securities owned by our clients, thus reflecting a close alignment of interests.

Risk - Fairview Capital           Top MenuHomeClient LoginSchwab Client LoginWealth Management SiteContactNavigation  Fairview Capital Prudent Stewardship of Significant Wealth    Risk Investors recognize the inverse relationship between risk and reward: the greater the potential reward, the greater the inherent risk. The reward component generally is well understood. Specifically, investors experience reward when an asset serves the intended function of preserving value or generating income and/or capital appreciation.Risk, though, is more nuanced. Frequently, investors associate risk with volatility. We counsel clients to differentiate between the two concepts. Volatility simply represents the change in the value of an asset. On a day-to-day or month-to-month basis, nearly all asset prices fluctuate. Some asset values change more than others (stocks v. bonds, for example) and some periods present more volatility than others (epitomized by the sharp ascent and steep decline of the “dot com” era). Volatility usually proves to be a temporary phenomenon.We view risk, on the other hand, as the potential for a permanent loss of capital. Unlike the temporary decline in value resulting from periodic volatility, the permanent impairment of capital can structurally disrupt progress toward investment goals. As long as one doesn’t need to sell when prices are low, then volatility can be endured—thus the rationale for establishing liquidity needs at the inception of the relationship. Volatility actually is the friend of long-term investors who seek to acquire assets when prices are low, then dispose of them when prices are high.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
