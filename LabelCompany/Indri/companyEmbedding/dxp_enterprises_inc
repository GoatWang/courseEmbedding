$238.5 million in sales, a sequential increase of 7.3 percent


GAAP diluted EPS of $0.17


$15.5 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
        amortization (“EBITDA”), a sequential increase of 4.6 percent,
        adjusting for the one-time sale of Vertex


 HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      DXP Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: DXPE) today announced financial
      results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. The following are
      results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three
      months ended March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2016, where appropriate. A
      reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures is in the back of this
      press release.
    

DXPE 2017 First Quarter Financial Highlights:



        Sales increased 7.3 percent to $238.5 million, compared to $222.3
        million for the fourth quarter of 2016 and $253.6 million for the
        first quarter of 2016, a decrease of 5.9 percent compared to the first
        quarter of 2016. Adjusting for the sale of Vertex, sales decreased 3.0
        percent.
      

        Earnings per diluted share was $0.17 based upon 18.2 million diluted
        shares, compared to $0.42 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016,
        based on 17.4 million diluted shares. In the first quarter of 2016,
        the loss per diluted share was $0.35 on 14.5 million shares.
      

        Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
        (EBITDA) was $15.5 million, or 6.5 percent of sales, compared to $20.4
        million for the fourth quarter of 2016, a decrease of 24.2 percent.
        The decrease includes a $5.6 million gain on the sale of Vertex.
        Excluding the gain, EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $14.8 million or
        6.7 percent of sales. Adjusting for the one-time sale of Vertex, first
        quarter 2016 EBITDA sequentially increased 4.6 percent.
      


David R. Little, Chairman and CEO remarked, “Our first quarter results
      reflect momentum building in our business. We are pleased with DXP’s
      first quarter sales results which included sequential sales and
      operating income growth across all three business segments. Total DXP
      EBITDA also increased sequentially, adjusting for the one-time sale of
      Vertex. We are encouraged by the sequential increases and believe we
      could be in the early stages of a cyclical recovery. Thank you to all
      our customers and DXPeople for the support and effort. DXP’s first
      quarter 2017 sales were $238.5 million, or a 7.3 percent increase over
      the fourth quarter. DXP’s industrial end markets, which is 51 percent of
      our business, appears to have found some legs and shows signs of
      positive upward movement. Oil and gas, which is the remaining 49 percent
      of DXP, found a bottom in the third quarter of last year and is showing
      signs of gradual improvement. During the first quarter, sales were
      $148.7 million for Service Centers, $49.1 million for Innovative Pumping
      Solutions and $40.8 million for Supply Chain Services. Business segment
      operating income increased 13 percent sequentially and 57 percent
      year-over-year.
    

      We continue to anticipate a better fiscal year 2017. As such, we remain
      focused on improving our ability to serve existing and new customers,
      continuing to focus on enhancing and improving our operational
      execution, investing in products and people and strategically aligning
      DXP for the future.”
    

Mac McConnell, CFO added, “Our first quarter sequential sales growth of
      7.3 percent was great to see after experiencing continual declines since
      the fourth quarter of 2014. We turned this into a 9 percent sequential
      increase in operating income during a period where DXP has seasonally
      higher expenses. Total debt outstanding as of March 31, 2017 was $228.0
      million. As discussed during our Q4 earnings call, we look forward to
      and anticipate refinancing our debt structure in the near future. This
      should provide DXP with more flexibility as we move towards growth. We
      are excited by the tone at DXP and anticipate that this should begin to
      show in our financial results.”
    

      We will host a conference call regarding 2017 first quarter results on
      the Company’s website (www.dxpe.com)
      Monday, May 15, 2017 at 4 pm CST. Web participants are encouraged to go
      to the Company’s website at least 15 minutes prior to the start of the
      call to register, download and install any necessary audio software. The
      online archived replay will be available immediately after the
      conference call at www.dxpe.com.
    

DXP Enterprises 2017 first quarter business segment results:



Service Centers’ revenue for the
        first quarter was $148.7 million, a 6.5 percent sequential increase
        and decline of 11.2 percent over the same period in 2016. Operating
        income margin was 9.0 percent, a 27 basis point improvement over the
        fourth quarter of 2016.
      

Innovative Pumping Solutions’
        revenue for the first quarter was $49.1 million, a 7.8 percent
        sequential increase and 3.4 percent increase year-over-year with a 7.2
        percent operating income margin, a 178 basis point improvement from
        the fourth quarter.
      

Supply Chain Services’ revenue for
        the first quarter was $40.8 million, a 9.8 percent sequential increase
        and 5.5 percent increase year-over-year with a 10.0 percent operating
        income margin.
      


Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      DXP supplements reporting of net income (loss) with non-GAAP
      measurements, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. This
      supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a
      substitute for the unaudited GAAP measurements. Additional information
      regarding EBITDA referred to in this press release is included below
      under "--Unaudited Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information."
    

      The Company believes EBITDA provides additional information about: (i)
      operating performance, because it assists in comparing the operating
      performance of the business, as it removes the impact of non-cash
      depreciation and amortization expense as well as items not directly
      resulting from core operations such as interest expense and income taxes
      and (ii) the performance and the effectiveness of operational
      strategies. Additionally, EBITDA performance is a component of a measure
      of the Company’s financial covenants under its credit facility.
      Furthermore, some investors use EBITDA as a supplemental measure to
      evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in the industry.
      Management believes that some investors’ understanding of performance is
      enhanced by including this non-GAAP financial measure as a reasonable
      basis for comparing ongoing results of operations. By providing this
      non-GAAP financial measure, together with a reconciliation from net
      income, the Company believes it is enhancing investors’ understanding of
      the business and results of operations, as well as assisting investors
      in evaluating how well the Company is executing strategic initiatives.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
