The Dubious Promotion of Herbalife's Niteworks
Stephen Barrett, M.D. 
Herbalife would like you believe that taking Niteworks™ will benefit your heart. The product was formulated 
 by Louis J. Ignarro, PhD., professor 
 of molecular and medical pharmacology at the UCLA School of Medicine, who shared the 1998 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his research concerning 
 nitric oxide as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system [1,2]. This article tells why I believe that Niteworks is being promoted 
 with improper claims and Ignarro's conduct has been highly questionable.
 
Ingredients and Claims 
Niteworks, which has been marketed since 2003, is a powdered mixture, each dose of which contains 500 mg of vitamin C, 200 international units of vitamin E, 400 micrograms of folic acid, 50 mg of lemon balm extract, 10 mg of alpha lipoic acid, 300 mg of l-taurine, and 5.2 grams of a proprietary blend of l-arginine and l-citrulline [3]. The list price is $89.95 for a 30-day supply. The label, shown below, carries Ignarro's signature and endorsement states that the product is a dietary supplement. 



 



Herbalife's  Web site says that Niteworks "supports energy, vascular and circulatory health"; "promotes a healthy cardiovascular system; "enhances blood flow to support function of the heart, brain and other organs"; and helps you wake up feeling rejuvenated." [4] An Herbalife fact sheet states: 

Discoveries relating to Nitric Oxide led to Dr. Louis Ignarro and two other scientists winning the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1998. Herbalife teamed with Dr. Ignarro to develop Niteworks™, a lemon-flavored powder mix. Niteworks™ is formulated to help you create more life-supporting Nitric Oxide during the night, when Nitric-Oxide levels are naturally at their lowest. . . . 
 Through vascular nutrition, you can increase the production of Nitric Oxide, which “exercises” or expands your vessels, increasing their youthful elasticity. In addition, Nitric Oxide is an important biological messenger that causes a cascade of benefits at the cellular level, which can improve circulatory, immune and nervous-system function. Nitric Oxide influences the functioning of virtually every organ in the body, including the lungs, liver, kidneys, stomach, brain and, of course, the heart [3]. 

In 2010, I noticed that Herbalife's "Product Details" listed "Keep blood vessels toned, flexible and youthful for improved circulation" as a key benefit. However, there is little scientific support for this claim. Some studies of arginine supplementation have found possible benefit, some have found none, and some have found possible harm. As far as I know, the full Niteworks formula has not been tested in a clinical trial that looked for a protective effect against cardiovascular disease. 
Ignaro's Promotion
In June 2003, Ignarro was featured  at Herbalife's Extravaganza in Las Vegas, where he talked to thousands of enthusiastic Herbalife distributors for more than an hour. As part of Ignarro's introduction, Herbalife's CEO MIchael O. Johnson played a video  in which Ignarro said: "We've done a lot of work to show that one does not have to take prescription drugs to be effective in treating cardiovascular disease. One can just engage in natural sorts of things—dietary supplements . . . exercise, diets that are low in fat, and so on. All of these things increase or enhance nitric acid production in the body; and the more nitric oxide that is produced, the more protection you have against cardiovascular disease." [5] The video ended with a plea from Ignarro "take this message to tens of millions of people out there."


Ignarro's walk to the stage was accompanied by loud music, rhythmic clapping, and audience cheering that resembled what happens when boxers and wrestlers are introduced at championship events. Before and after speaking, Ignarro spent several minutes giving autographs to distributors who pressed toward him with papers held high. His talk covered his research; the physiological characteristics of nitric oxide; his Nobel award; his beliefs about Niteworks; and what taking the product has done for him, his wife, and his friends. During parts of his talk, he seemed euphoric. 
	 The audience lapped it all up; many portions of his talk were met with applause and enthusiastic shouts.

The "scientific" part of Ignarro's talk was centered around a slide show titled "No More Heart Disease: 
	 The Nitric Oxide Story." After promising to provide "easy steps you can take to prevent cardiovascular disease," and "what 
	 we can do to reverse this process," he stated that Herbalife's "Cellular Nutrition Program nourishes all the cells in the body" and that 
	 nitric oxide can do the same. He went on to describe how nitric oxide allows cells to "communicate" with each other and can help prevent a wide variety of diseases. He claimed that among other things, it can help lower blood pressure, improve blood flow, inhibit clotting (to prevent strokes and heart attacks); prevents against early stages of atherosclerosis; prevent vascular complications of diabetes; protect against ulcers and Alzheimer's disease; and affect erectile function.

Ignarro further claimed that "cardiovascular disease is associated with localized nitric oxide deficiency," and that production can be increased by a low-fat diet, mild-to-moderate exercise, smoking cessation, and better "cellular nutrition." Niteworks, he said, contains the amino acid arginine, which the body converts to nitric oxide; citrulline, which the body "recycles" to arginine; and the antioxidant vitamins A and C, which protect against the destruction (oxidation) of nitric oxide. Although arginine is found in common foods (such as meat, poultry, fish, nuts, cereals, milk and certain vegetables), Ignarro told the audience: 

You probably don't get sufficient amounts of arginine from your diet. . . . To really get the increased production of nitric oxide that I'd like to see . . . you'd probably have to eat the whole leg of a cow every day or as a barrel of fish. . . . So you should supplement your diet with arginine . . . and the same thing goes for citrulline, which is  another amino acid. It's found together with arginine but is present in much smaller amounts. That's why it's particularly important to supplement with citrulline. And, of course, our Niteworks product contains both arginine and citrulline. 

After finishing his "chemistry lesson," Ignarro focused on the personal experience of himself, his wife and his friends. Among other things, he bragged that after taking Niteworks, he and his wife greatly improved their treadmill performance and that he slept better and generally felt better. He also said that  friends had lowered their blood pressure and become less depressed, that "everyone" he knows who took the product had reported substantial benefits; and that he really believes that "soon there will be no more heart disease." (This statement was followed by a standing ovation from the audience.) The fact that mouse studies and haphazardly collected  anecdotes do not provide an adequate basis for Ignarro's conclusions was not mentioned to the audience.
A few months after the Extravaganza, the Washington Post published an article in which Ignarro told the reporter that the ingredients in Niteworks generate nitric oxide slowly over a prolonged period so that it can be provided when the body needs it. However, he said that this had been shown so far only in animal studies and test-tube studies with human cells. Ferid Murad, M.D., Ph.D., who directs the Institute of Molecular Medicine at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston and shared the Nobel Prize with Ignarro, said that Niteworks' blend of ingredients makes sense, except for l-citrulline, which he said acts only marginally in recycling l-arginine and is probably in the product for patenting reasons. Murad also said that Niteworks' $90-per-month price was obscene because the vitamins C and E are available for pennies a day and arginine is obtainable for about a dollar a day [6]. 
Questionable Conduct 
In May 2004, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published an article by Ignarro and 11 co-authors about a study in which mice with high cholesterol levels who exercised and were given arginine, vitamin C, and vitamin E were compared to sedentary mice and to mice who exercised but did not get the supplements. The researchers found that the supplemented mice developed fewer problems with their coronary arteries [7]. Scientific journals require authors to disclose any financial interest they have in the subject matter they write about. However, the article did not disclose Ignarro's tie to Herbalife or his financial interest in a product related to the study. In fact, the lack of disclosure and extent of the connection did not come to light until David Evans, an investigative reporter for Bloomberg News, learned how much amount of money was involved as reported in documents submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of Herbalife's application to become a publicly-held company. After further investigation, Evans reported:

In January 2003, Ignarro and David Brubaker formed a consulting company called Healthwell Ventures LLC to receive royalties for the sale of Niteworks. Brubaker told Evans that Herbalife pays Healthwell 1% of Niteworks sales revenue. Since June 2003, Healthwell has received  $1 million, some of which represented an advance payment.
When the mouse study was published, UCLA issued a press release in which Ignarro claimed that "what's good for mice is good for humans" and that the study "shows that supplements work well even in the absence of exercise." The release didn't name Herbalife and didn't disclose Ignarro's financial interest in Niteworks. 
Pharmacologist Robert Furchgott, Ph.D., who also shared the 1998 Nobel Prize with Ignarro said that Ignarro's claims of effectiveness are improperly founded. "They jumped the gun,'' he said." I haven't seen any properly controlled studies. It just seems to me a mouse model isn't transferable to humans.'' He also said, "I think with the sort of money they're raking in, they could have done some human studies."
Former New England Journal of Medicine editor Marcia Angell, M.D., agreed that Ignarro needs more than mouse studies to support his claims. "There's a way to find out if it works in humans,'' by conducting clinical trials on people, she said. "You can't assume it will work for people.'' [8] 

Brubaker, who was also an Herbalife distributor, sells Niteworks and other products  from his HealthWellLife Web site from 2004 through 2007. Shortly before Evans's exposé was published, I downloaded a video  that contained Ignarro's Las Vegas presentation followed by an invitation to order Niteworks via Brubaker's toll-free number. Ignarro's presentation, combined with the introduction shown at the Extravaganza, has also been promoted through the Herbalife Broadcast Network (HBN), which Herbalife International uses to communicate with its distributors.
Ignarro notified the journal editor that he thought that disclosing his financial connection to Herbalife was unnecessary because (a) the study was conceived before he teamed up with Herbalife and (b) he had only played a minor role as a reviewer of the article [9]. However, I believe that (a) the connection was established before the article went to press and (b) if Ignarro did enough to get his name on the article, he did enough to require a disclosure. Moreover, the news release associated with the article should have made the disclosure.
In  2012, a Pershing Square Capital Management report  noted that since 2004, Herbalife had paid Ignarro and his affiliated consulting firm more than $15 million since 2004 [10]. In 2013, the Los Angeles Times noted Herbalife's support of UCLA medical school's Center for Human Nutrition [11].
Competition
Ferid Murad, Ph.D., the third scientist who shared the 1998 Nobel award, has cast his lot with another manufacturer. In December 2004, Leiner Health Products announced that it had created Cardio Discovery™, which it said was "based on 28 years of research by Nobel Prize winner Dr. Ferid Murad."  A company press release stated: "Cardio Discovery helps support the cardiovascular system by increasing production of nitric oxide. Naturally produced in the body, nitric oxide helps to maintain the flexibility of veins and arteries so that blood flows freely. Cardio Discovery contains the amino acids l-arginine and l-glutamine. l-arginine is one of the body’s key nutrient sources for nitric oxide production, which is necessary for the maintenance of a healthy cardiovascular system." [12] The list price was $32/month, but some distributors were discounting it. Now called Cardio Support, the product retails for $39.95.
Applicable Laws
Under federal law, products (except for devices) intended for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease are drugs, and all drugs must be labeled with adequate directions for use. Labeling includes any written, printed, or graphic material that accompanies a product; and intended use is determined by the facts at hand. Drugs not generally recognized as safe and effective by experts are considered “new” drugs that cannot be marketed in interstate commerce without FDA approval. It is a federal crime to market a new drug that lacks approval or does not bear adequate directions. The 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) permits dietary supplements to be marketed with "structure/function" claims that are truthful and supported by scientific evidence [13,14]. It appears to me that Niteworks is intended for the prevention of disease but is not generally recognized by experts as safe and effective for this purpose. I also believe that many of the claims made by Herbalife and Ignarro go beyond what DSHEA permits for a dietary supplements. Thus, for example, the claim that Niteworks can lead to "no more heart disease" appears to be illegal as well as preposterous. 
In 1985, the California Attorney General sued Herbalife International and its founder/president Mark Hughes for making false claims about several products. The case was settled in 1986 with a consent agreement under which the defendants paid $850,000 in penalties and were permanently barred from making unsubstantiated health claims for any product [15]. 
In 2003, the  Federal Trade Commission took action against the marketers of another arginine-containing product (HeartBar) that was claimed to protect its users against cardiovascular disease [16]. The consent agreement [17] prohibits unsubstantiated representations that any such product: 

 Substantially decreases leg pain for people with cardiovascular disease;
Reverses damage or disease to the heart caused by high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, estrogen deficiency, or any other medical condition or health risk;
Prevents age-related vascular problems, including "hardening of the arteries" and plaque formation, or reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular disease;
Reduces or eliminates the need for surgery, such as a coronary bypass or angioplasty, or for medications, such as nitroglycerin, in patients with cardiovascular disease; or
Improves endurance, circulation, and energy for the general population.

Arginine Research
As far as I know, Niteworks has never been studied studied  in humans to determine whether it can help people with cardiovascular disease. But three studies suggest that one of its key ingredients—arginine—might do more harm than good for people with impaired artery function: 

One study found that giving 9 grams of arginine per day for 4 days to 28 patients with coronary artery disease did not improve the function of the inner lining (endothelium) of their arteries  [18]. 
Another study found that  subjects with peripheral artery disease who took arginine supplements for 6 months did worse than that imilar people who received a placebo [19].
The third study found that  9 grams of arginine given every day for 6 months did not improve arterial functioning among 153 people who had suffered a heart attack. But during or shortly after the trial, death occurred in six of the arginine-takers but none of the placebo-takers [20].

The Herbalife Science Web site  mentions a clinical trial in which 16 healthy elderly men who exercised regularly were given either Niteworks or a placebo for three weeks. The study was supported by an NIH grant and done at UCLA's Center for Human Nutrition. The researchers reported that the men who received Niteworks were able to do strenuous exercise a bit longer before they got tired [21]. Whether this finding has any practical significance remains to be seen. 
The Bottom Line 
Niteworks is  promoted as a powerful preventive against cardiovascular disease even though, as far as I know, the product has never been studied for this purpose in humans. Nobel Prize winner Louis Ignarro, Ph.D, who has a substantial financial interest in the matter, is using his prestige to facilitate the sales process. Although research into nitric oxide may lead to some practical use of arginine supplementation, it seems unlikely to result in "no more heart disease." Meanwhile, I believe it is foolish to spend $90 a month for a product that is overpriced, has no proven value, and might even be harmful.

Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (1998)


Louis J. Ignarro (born May 31, 1941) is an American pharmacologist. For demonstrating the signaling properties of nitric oxide, he was co-recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Robert F. Furchgott and Ferid Murad.
Currently, he is professor of pharmacology at the UCLA School of Medicine's department of molecular and medical pharmacology in Los Angeles, which he joined in 1985. Before relocating to California, he was a professor of pharmacology at Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, for 12 years. Ignarro has also previously worked as a staff scientist, research department, for the pharmaceutical division of CIBA-GEIGY Corporation in New York.
Ignarro has published numerous research articles. He received the Basic Research Prize of the American Heart Association in 1998. This was in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the advancement of cardiovascular science. That same year, he was inducted into the National Academy of Sciences and the following year, into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Because nitric oxide is indirectly involved in the action of this drug, he is sometimes referred to as the "Father of Viagra".[1]
He is the founder of the Nitric Oxide Society, and founder and editor-in-chief of Nitric Oxide Biology and Chemistry.[2] Ignarro holds a B.S. in pharmacy, Columbia University, 1962, and a Ph.D. in pharmacology, University of Minnesota, School of Medicine, 1966. He also received a postdoctoral fellowship in chemical pharmacology from National Institutes of Health in 1968. He is a member of the scientific committee of Nicox, a French pharmaceutical company, a member of the Board of Directors of Antibe Therapeutics,[3] a Canadian drug discovery company, a member of the Board of Directors of Operation USA, a non-profit organization, and a member of the Nutritional Advisory Board for Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company.

Personal life[edit]
Louis J. Ignarro was born in 1941 in Brooklyn, New York. His parents were Italian immigrants and his father was a carpenter in Torre del Greco, near Naples. Ignarro grew up in Long Beach, NY, which is a suburb of New York City, NY on the south shore of Long Island, NY. Ignarro received his first chemistry set as a gift at the age of 8.[4]
Ignarro is married and lives in Beverly Hills, CA.[4] He is an avid cyclist and marathoner, having completed 13 marathons.[5][6] Ignarro has published multiple books for lay audiences about health and wellness focusing on the benefits of increasing nitric oxide production. He is a frequent public speaker on these and related topics.
Academic career[edit]
Ignarro attended Central Grade School and Long Beach High School. A strong interest in science led Ignarro to Columbia University where he studied chemistry and pharmacology and in 1962 received a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. Ignarro then attended the University of Minnesota where he received a Ph.D. in pharmacology. His university studies also concentrated in chemistry, enzymology and cardiovascular physiology, which resulted in several published papers. While at the University of Minnesota, Ignarro studied under eventual Nobel Prize-winning chemist Paul Boyer.[4]
Ignarro's work continued at the NIH in the fields he'd studied, collaborating with many other scientists to discover regulatory mechanisms of the cardiovascular system that would lead to his most famous work. This was his first time to apply his education outside of an academic setting. In 1968, Ignarro left the NIH to work for Geigy Pharmaceuticals. With this company, Ignarro helped develop new drugs and was able to continue research into new areas of pharmacology including cyclic GMP. After Geigy merged with Ciba Pharmaceuticals, Ignarro decided to move back to the world of academia, this time as a professor.[4]
In 1973, Ignarro accepted the position of Assistant Professor of pharmacology at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, LA. Tulane was chosen partially because it would provide a good environment for continued research into cyclic GMP. While studying cyclic GMP, Ignarro read a paper by Ferid Murad, who demonstrated that nitric oxide elevates cyclic GMP levels. Ignarro then speculated that nitric oxide could be the key to relaxing vascular smooth muscles. In turn, this led to his extensive research on the subject. Ignarro's research demonstrated that nitric oxide serves the functions of vasorelaxant and inhibitor of platelet aggregation, with both effects mediated by cyclic GMP.
Ignarro continued his research at Tulane. In 1984 he realized that the properties of nitric oxide were the same as those seen in the endothelium derived relaxing factor previously-identified by Robert Furchgott 3 years earlier. The exact nature of the EDRF was up to this point unknown. Interestingly, Furchgott and Ignarro came to similar conclusions about nitric oxide as the EDRF around the same time and both presented evidence at conferences during 1986 demonstrating nitric oxide's role as EDRF.[4]
During the decades since Ignarro and Furchgott's initial research, thousands of studies have been published about the effects of nitric oxide as the endothelium derived relaxing factor. This has led to the development of erectile dysfunction drugs such as Viagra and nutritional supplements designed for cardiovascular health and athletic performance. In 1985, Ignarro moved from New Orleans to Los Angeles where he accepted a position at the UCLA School of Medicine and continues to research and teach.[4]
Herbalife relationship[edit]
Ignarro has worked as a paid consultant for Herbalife since 2003 and later became a member of the company's Scientific Advisory Board. He has collaborated in developing nutritional supplements for cardiovascular health and athletic performance. Ignarro first worked with Herbalife to develop Niteworks, a dietary supplement designed to boost the body’s own production of nitric oxide.[7] Ignarro endorsed this product in exchange for a royalty agreement reported to have earned his consulting firm over $1 million in the first 12 months.[8] Ignarro has continued to work with Herbalife to develop additional supplements focusing on nutrients such as Omega-3 fatty acid and CoQ10. As of 2012, Herbalife has made payments to Ignarro and his affiliated consulting firm of over $15 million.[9]
In 2003, Ignarro published a study based on ingredients found in Niteworks in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, where, as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, he can submit papers without review and without disclosing his financial interest to the publication. After Ignarro's ties to Herbalife were revealed, the journal issued a correction to the article, citing Ignarro's undisclosed "conflict of interest." [8] UCLA conducted its own investigation and determined that Ignarro did not act improperly. Ignarro has publicly acknowledged the conflict of interest as a mistake and has continued to publish extensively on the subject of nitric oxide.[10]
Ignarro appears in videos promoting Niteworks and other Herbalife products, and is a frequent speaker at Herbalife events. Since partnering with Herbalife, Ignarro has spoken to more than 5,000,000 people worldwide about nitric oxide and cardiovascular health.[10]
Famous quotes[edit]
While testifying before Congress in 2000, Ignarro remarked: "Only in America could the son of an uneducated carpenter receive the Nobel Prize in Medicine".[11][12]

Notable awards
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (1998)


Louis J. Ignarro (born May 31, 1941) is an American pharmacologist. For demonstrating the signaling properties of nitric oxide, he was co-recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Robert F. Furchgott and Ferid Murad.
Currently, he is professor of pharmacology at the UCLA School of Medicine's department of molecular and medical pharmacology in Los Angeles, which he joined in 1985. Before relocating to California, he was a professor of pharmacology at Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, for 12 years. Ignarro has also previously worked as a staff scientist, research department, for the pharmaceutical division of CIBA-GEIGY Corporation in New York.
Ignarro has published numerous research articles. He received the Basic Research Prize of the American Heart Association in 1998. This was in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the advancement of cardiovascular science. That same year, he was inducted into the National Academy of Sciences and the following year, into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Because nitric oxide is indirectly involved in the action of this drug, he is sometimes referred to as the "Father of Viagra".[1]
He is the founder of the Nitric Oxide Society, and founder and editor-in-chief of Nitric Oxide Biology and Chemistry.[2] Ignarro holds a B.S. in pharmacy, Columbia University, 1962, and a Ph.D. in pharmacology, University of Minnesota, School of Medicine, 1966. He also received a postdoctoral fellowship in chemical pharmacology from National Institutes of Health in 1968. He is a member of the scientific committee of Nicox, a French pharmaceutical company, a member of the Board of Directors of Antibe Therapeutics,[3] a Canadian drug discovery company, a member of the Board of Directors of Operation USA, a non-profit organization, and a member of the Nutritional Advisory Board for Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company.

Personal life[edit]
Louis J. Ignarro was born in 1941 in Brooklyn, New York. His parents were Italian immigrants and his father was a carpenter in Torre del Greco, near Naples. Ignarro grew up in Long Beach, NY, which is a suburb of New York City, NY on the south shore of Long Island, NY. Ignarro received his first chemistry set as a gift at the age of 8.[4]
Ignarro is married and lives in Beverly Hills, CA.[4] He is an avid cyclist and marathoner, having completed 13 marathons.[5][6] Ignarro has published multiple books for lay audiences about health and wellness focusing on the benefits of increasing nitric oxide production. He is a frequent public speaker on these and related topics.
Academic career[edit]
Ignarro attended Central Grade School and Long Beach High School. A strong interest in science led Ignarro to Columbia University where he studied chemistry and pharmacology and in 1962 received a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. Ignarro then attended the University of Minnesota where he received a Ph.D. in pharmacology. His university studies also concentrated in chemistry, enzymology and cardiovascular physiology, which resulted in several published papers. While at the University of Minnesota, Ignarro studied under eventual Nobel Prize-winning chemist Paul Boyer.[4]
Ignarro's work continued at the NIH in the fields he'd studied, collaborating with many other scientists to discover regulatory mechanisms of the cardiovascular system that would lead to his most famous work. This was his first time to apply his education outside of an academic setting. In 1968, Ignarro left the NIH to work for Geigy Pharmaceuticals. With this company, Ignarro helped develop new drugs and was able to continue research into new areas of pharmacology including cyclic GMP. After Geigy merged with Ciba Pharmaceuticals, Ignarro decided to move back to the world of academia, this time as a professor.[4]
In 1973, Ignarro accepted the position of Assistant Professor of pharmacology at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, LA. Tulane was chosen partially because it would provide a good environment for continued research into cyclic GMP. While studying cyclic GMP, Ignarro read a paper by Ferid Murad, who demonstrated that nitric oxide elevates cyclic GMP levels. Ignarro then speculated that nitric oxide could be the key to relaxing vascular smooth muscles. In turn, this led to his extensive research on the subject. Ignarro's research demonstrated that nitric oxide serves the functions of vasorelaxant and inhibitor of platelet aggregation, with both effects mediated by cyclic GMP.
Ignarro continued his research at Tulane. In 1984 he realized that the properties of nitric oxide were the same as those seen in the endothelium derived relaxing factor previously-identified by Robert Furchgott 3 years earlier. The exact nature of the EDRF was up to this point unknown. Interestingly, Furchgott and Ignarro came to similar conclusions about nitric oxide as the EDRF around the same time and both presented evidence at conferences during 1986 demonstrating nitric oxide's role as EDRF.[4]
During the decades since Ignarro and Furchgott's initial research, thousands of studies have been published about the effects of nitric oxide as the endothelium derived relaxing factor. This has led to the development of erectile dysfunction drugs such as Viagra and nutritional supplements designed for cardiovascular health and athletic performance. In 1985, Ignarro moved from New Orleans to Los Angeles where he accepted a position at the UCLA School of Medicine and continues to research and teach.[4]
Herbalife relationship[edit]
Ignarro has worked as a paid consultant for Herbalife since 2003 and later became a member of the company's Scientific Advisory Board. He has collaborated in developing nutritional supplements for cardiovascular health and athletic performance. Ignarro first worked with Herbalife to develop Niteworks, a dietary supplement designed to boost the body’s own production of nitric oxide.[7] Ignarro endorsed this product in exchange for a royalty agreement reported to have earned his consulting firm over $1 million in the first 12 months.[8] Ignarro has continued to work with Herbalife to develop additional supplements focusing on nutrients such as Omega-3 fatty acid and CoQ10. As of 2012, Herbalife has made payments to Ignarro and his affiliated consulting firm of over $15 million.[9]
In 2003, Ignarro published a study based on ingredients found in Niteworks in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, where, as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, he can submit papers without review and without disclosing his financial interest to the publication. After Ignarro's ties to Herbalife were revealed, the journal issued a correction to the article, citing Ignarro's undisclosed "conflict of interest." [8] UCLA conducted its own investigation and determined that Ignarro did not act improperly. Ignarro has publicly acknowledged the conflict of interest as a mistake and has continued to publish extensively on the subject of nitric oxide.[10]
Ignarro appears in videos promoting Niteworks and other Herbalife products, and is a frequent speaker at Herbalife events. Since partnering with Herbalife, Ignarro has spoken to more than 5,000,000 people worldwide about nitric oxide and cardiovascular health.[10]
Famous quotes[edit]
While testifying before Congress in 2000, Ignarro remarked: "Only in America could the son of an uneducated carpenter receive the Nobel Prize in Medicine".[11][12]

Notable awards
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (1998)


Louis J. Ignarro (born May 31, 1941) is an American pharmacologist. For demonstrating the signaling properties of nitric oxide, he was co-recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Robert F. Furchgott and Ferid Murad.
Currently, he is professor of pharmacology at the UCLA School of Medicine's department of molecular and medical pharmacology in Los Angeles, which he joined in 1985. Before relocating to California, he was a professor of pharmacology at Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, for 12 years. Ignarro has also previously worked as a staff scientist, research department, for the pharmaceutical division of CIBA-GEIGY Corporation in New York.
Ignarro has published numerous research articles. He received the Basic Research Prize of the American Heart Association in 1998. This was in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the advancement of cardiovascular science. That same year, he was inducted into the National Academy of Sciences and the following year, into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Because nitric oxide is indirectly involved in the action of this drug, he is sometimes referred to as the "Father of Viagra".[1]
He is the founder of the Nitric Oxide Society, and founder and editor-in-chief of Nitric Oxide Biology and Chemistry.[2] Ignarro holds a B.S. in pharmacy, Columbia University, 1962, and a Ph.D. in pharmacology, University of Minnesota, School of Medicine, 1966. He also received a postdoctoral fellowship in chemical pharmacology from National Institutes of Health in 1968. He is a member of the scientific committee of Nicox, a French pharmaceutical company, a member of the Board of Directors of Antibe Therapeutics,[3] a Canadian drug discovery company, a member of the Board of Directors of Operation USA, a non-profit organization, and a member of the Nutritional Advisory Board for Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company.

Personal life[edit]
Louis J. Ignarro was born in 1941 in Brooklyn, New York. His parents were Italian immigrants and his father was a carpenter in Torre del Greco, near Naples. Ignarro grew up in Long Beach, NY, which is a suburb of New York City, NY on the south shore of Long Island, NY. Ignarro received his first chemistry set as a gift at the age of 8.[4]
Ignarro is married and lives in Beverly Hills, CA.[4] He is an avid cyclist and marathoner, having completed 13 marathons.[5][6] Ignarro has published multiple books for lay audiences about health and wellness focusing on the benefits of increasing nitric oxide production. He is a frequent public speaker on these and related topics.
Academic career[edit]
Ignarro attended Central Grade School and Long Beach High School. A strong interest in science led Ignarro to Columbia University where he studied chemistry and pharmacology and in 1962 received a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. Ignarro then attended the University of Minnesota where he received a Ph.D. in pharmacology. His university studies also concentrated in chemistry, enzymology and cardiovascular physiology, which resulted in several published papers. While at the University of Minnesota, Ignarro studied under eventual Nobel Prize-winning chemist Paul Boyer.[4]
Ignarro's work continued at the NIH in the fields he'd studied, collaborating with many other scientists to discover regulatory mechanisms of the cardiovascular system that would lead to his most famous work. This was his first time to apply his education outside of an academic setting. In 1968, Ignarro left the NIH to work for Geigy Pharmaceuticals. With this company, Ignarro helped develop new drugs and was able to continue research into new areas of pharmacology including cyclic GMP. After Geigy merged with Ciba Pharmaceuticals, Ignarro decided to move back to the world of academia, this time as a professor.[4]
In 1973, Ignarro accepted the position of Assistant Professor of pharmacology at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, LA. Tulane was chosen partially because it would provide a good environment for continued research into cyclic GMP. While studying cyclic GMP, Ignarro read a paper by Ferid Murad, who demonstrated that nitric oxide elevates cyclic GMP levels. Ignarro then speculated that nitric oxide could be the key to relaxing vascular smooth muscles. In turn, this led to his extensive research on the subject. Ignarro's research demonstrated that nitric oxide serves the functions of vasorelaxant and inhibitor of platelet aggregation, with both effects mediated by cyclic GMP.
Ignarro continued his research at Tulane. In 1984 he realized that the properties of nitric oxide were the same as those seen in the endothelium derived relaxing factor previously-identified by Robert Furchgott 3 years earlier. The exact nature of the EDRF was up to this point unknown. Interestingly, Furchgott and Ignarro came to similar conclusions about nitric oxide as the EDRF around the same time and both presented evidence at conferences during 1986 demonstrating nitric oxide's role as EDRF.[4]
During the decades since Ignarro and Furchgott's initial research, thousands of studies have been published about the effects of nitric oxide as the endothelium derived relaxing factor. This has led to the development of erectile dysfunction drugs such as Viagra and nutritional supplements designed for cardiovascular health and athletic performance. In 1985, Ignarro moved from New Orleans to Los Angeles where he accepted a position at the UCLA School of Medicine and continues to research and teach.[4]
Herbalife relationship[edit]
Ignarro has worked as a paid consultant for Herbalife since 2003 and later became a member of the company's Scientific Advisory Board. He has collaborated in developing nutritional supplements for cardiovascular health and athletic performance. Ignarro first worked with Herbalife to develop Niteworks, a dietary supplement designed to boost the body’s own production of nitric oxide.[7] Ignarro endorsed this product in exchange for a royalty agreement reported to have earned his consulting firm over $1 million in the first 12 months.[8] Ignarro has continued to work with Herbalife to develop additional supplements focusing on nutrients such as Omega-3 fatty acid and CoQ10. As of 2012, Herbalife has made payments to Ignarro and his affiliated consulting firm of over $15 million.[9]
In 2003, Ignarro published a study based on ingredients found in Niteworks in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, where, as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, he can submit papers without review and without disclosing his financial interest to the publication. After Ignarro's ties to Herbalife were revealed, the journal issued a correction to the article, citing Ignarro's undisclosed "conflict of interest." [8] UCLA conducted its own investigation and determined that Ignarro did not act improperly. Ignarro has publicly acknowledged the conflict of interest as a mistake and has continued to publish extensively on the subject of nitric oxide.[10]
Ignarro appears in videos promoting Niteworks and other Herbalife products, and is a frequent speaker at Herbalife events. Since partnering with Herbalife, Ignarro has spoken to more than 5,000,000 people worldwide about nitric oxide and cardiovascular health.[10]
Famous quotes[edit]
While testifying before Congress in 2000, Ignarro remarked: "Only in America could the son of an uneducated carpenter receive the Nobel Prize in Medicine".[11][12]

Notable awards
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (1998)


Louis J. Ignarro (born May 31, 1941) is an American pharmacologist. For demonstrating the signaling properties of nitric oxide, he was co-recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Robert F. Furchgott and Ferid Murad.
Currently, he is professor of pharmacology at the UCLA School of Medicine's department of molecular and medical pharmacology in Los Angeles, which he joined in 1985. Before relocating to California, he was a professor of pharmacology at Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, for 12 years. Ignarro has also previously worked as a staff scientist, research department, for the pharmaceutical division of CIBA-GEIGY Corporation in New York.
Ignarro has published numerous research articles. He received the Basic Research Prize of the American Heart Association in 1998. This was in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the advancement of cardiovascular science. That same year, he was inducted into the National Academy of Sciences and the following year, into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Because nitric oxide is indirectly involved in the action of this drug, he is sometimes referred to as the "Father of Viagra".[1]
He is the founder of the Nitric Oxide Society, and founder and editor-in-chief of Nitric Oxide Biology and Chemistry.[2] Ignarro holds a B.S. in pharmacy, Columbia University, 1962, and a Ph.D. in pharmacology, University of Minnesota, School of Medicine, 1966. He also received a postdoctoral fellowship in chemical pharmacology from National Institutes of Health in 1968. He is a member of the scientific committee of Nicox, a French pharmaceutical company, a member of the Board of Directors of Antibe Therapeutics,[3] a Canadian drug discovery company, a member of the Board of Directors of Operation USA, a non-profit organization, and a member of the Nutritional Advisory Board for Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company.

Personal life[edit]
Louis J. Ignarro was born in 1941 in Brooklyn, New York. His parents were Italian immigrants and his father was a carpenter in Torre del Greco, near Naples. Ignarro grew up in Long Beach, NY, which is a suburb of New York City, NY on the south shore of Long Island, NY. Ignarro received his first chemistry set as a gift at the age of 8.[4]
Ignarro is married and lives in Beverly Hills, CA.[4] He is an avid cyclist and marathoner, having completed 13 marathons.[5][6] Ignarro has published multiple books for lay audiences about health and wellness focusing on the benefits of increasing nitric oxide production. He is a frequent public speaker on these and related topics.
Academic career[edit]
Ignarro attended Central Grade School and Long Beach High School. A strong interest in science led Ignarro to Columbia University where he studied chemistry and pharmacology and in 1962 received a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. Ignarro then attended the University of Minnesota where he received a Ph.D. in pharmacology. His university studies also concentrated in chemistry, enzymology and cardiovascular physiology, which resulted in several published papers. While at the University of Minnesota, Ignarro studied under eventual Nobel Prize-winning chemist Paul Boyer.[4]
Ignarro's work continued at the NIH in the fields he'd studied, collaborating with many other scientists to discover regulatory mechanisms of the cardiovascular system that would lead to his most famous work. This was his first time to apply his education outside of an academic setting. In 1968, Ignarro left the NIH to work for Geigy Pharmaceuticals. With this company, Ignarro helped develop new drugs and was able to continue research into new areas of pharmacology including cyclic GMP. After Geigy merged with Ciba Pharmaceuticals, Ignarro decided to move back to the world of academia, this time as a professor.[4]
In 1973, Ignarro accepted the position of Assistant Professor of pharmacology at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, LA. Tulane was chosen partially because it would provide a good environment for continued research into cyclic GMP. While studying cyclic GMP, Ignarro read a paper by Ferid Murad, who demonstrated that nitric oxide elevates cyclic GMP levels. Ignarro then speculated that nitric oxide could be the key to relaxing vascular smooth muscles. In turn, this led to his extensive research on the subject. Ignarro's research demonstrated that nitric oxide serves the functions of vasorelaxant and inhibitor of platelet aggregation, with both effects mediated by cyclic GMP.
Ignarro continued his research at Tulane. In 1984 he realized that the properties of nitric oxide were the same as those seen in the endothelium derived relaxing factor previously-identified by Robert Furchgott 3 years earlier. The exact nature of the EDRF was up to this point unknown. Interestingly, Furchgott and Ignarro came to similar conclusions about nitric oxide as the EDRF around the same time and both presented evidence at conferences during 1986 demonstrating nitric oxide's role as EDRF.[4]
During the decades since Ignarro and Furchgott's initial research, thousands of studies have been published about the effects of nitric oxide as the endothelium derived relaxing factor. This has led to the development of erectile dysfunction drugs such as Viagra and nutritional supplements designed for cardiovascular health and athletic performance. In 1985, Ignarro moved from New Orleans to Los Angeles where he accepted a position at the UCLA School of Medicine and continues to research and teach.[4]
Herbalife relationship[edit]
Ignarro has worked as a paid consultant for Herbalife since 2003 and later became a member of the company's Scientific Advisory Board. He has collaborated in developing nutritional supplements for cardiovascular health and athletic performance. Ignarro first worked with Herbalife to develop Niteworks, a dietary supplement designed to boost the body’s own production of nitric oxide.[7] Ignarro endorsed this product in exchange for a royalty agreement reported to have earned his consulting firm over $1 million in the first 12 months.[8] Ignarro has continued to work with Herbalife to develop additional supplements focusing on nutrients such as Omega-3 fatty acid and CoQ10. As of 2012, Herbalife has made payments to Ignarro and his affiliated consulting firm of over $15 million.[9]
In 2003, Ignarro published a study based on ingredients found in Niteworks in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, where, as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, he can submit papers without review and without disclosing his financial interest to the publication. After Ignarro's ties to Herbalife were revealed, the journal issued a correction to the article, citing Ignarro's undisclosed "conflict of interest." [8] UCLA conducted its own investigation and determined that Ignarro did not act improperly. Ignarro has publicly acknowledged the conflict of interest as a mistake and has continued to publish extensively on the subject of nitric oxide.[10]
Ignarro appears in videos promoting Niteworks and other Herbalife products, and is a frequent speaker at Herbalife events. Since partnering with Herbalife, Ignarro has spoken to more than 5,000,000 people worldwide about nitric oxide and cardiovascular health.[10]
Famous quotes[edit]
While testifying before Congress in 2000, Ignarro remarked: "Only in America could the son of an uneducated carpenter receive the Nobel Prize in Medicine".[11][12]

Notable awards
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (1998)


Louis J. Ignarro (born May 31, 1941) is an American pharmacologist. For demonstrating the signaling properties of nitric oxide, he was co-recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Robert F. Furchgott and Ferid Murad.
Currently, he is professor of pharmacology at the UCLA School of Medicine's department of molecular and medical pharmacology in Los Angeles, which he joined in 1985. Before relocating to California, he was a professor of pharmacology at Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, for 12 years. Ignarro has also previously worked as a staff scientist, research department, for the pharmaceutical division of CIBA-GEIGY Corporation in New York.
Ignarro has published numerous research articles. He received the Basic Research Prize of the American Heart Association in 1998. This was in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the advancement of cardiovascular science. That same year, he was inducted into the National Academy of Sciences and the following year, into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Because nitric oxide is indirectly involved in the action of this drug, he is sometimes referred to as the "Father of Viagra".[1]
He is the founder of the Nitric Oxide Society, and founder and editor-in-chief of Nitric Oxide Biology and Chemistry.[2] Ignarro holds a B.S. in pharmacy, Columbia University, 1962, and a Ph.D. in pharmacology, University of Minnesota, School of Medicine, 1966. He also received a postdoctoral fellowship in chemical pharmacology from National Institutes of Health in 1968. He is a member of the scientific committee of Nicox, a French pharmaceutical company, a member of the Board of Directors of Antibe Therapeutics,[3] a Canadian drug discovery company, a member of the Board of Directors of Operation USA, a non-profit organization, and a member of the Nutritional Advisory Board for Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company.

Personal life[edit]
Louis J. Ignarro was born in 1941 in Brooklyn, New York. His parents were Italian immigrants and his father was a carpenter in Torre del Greco, near Naples. Ignarro grew up in Long Beach, NY, which is a suburb of New York City, NY on the south shore of Long Island, NY. Ignarro received his first chemistry set as a gift at the age of 8.[4]
Ignarro is married and lives in Beverly Hills, CA.[4] He is an avid cyclist and marathoner, having completed 13 marathons.[5][6] Ignarro has published multiple books for lay audiences about health and wellness focusing on the benefits of increasing nitric oxide production. He is a frequent public speaker on these and related topics.
Academic career[edit]
Ignarro attended Central Grade School and Long Beach High School. A strong interest in science led Ignarro to Columbia University where he studied chemistry and pharmacology and in 1962 received a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. Ignarro then attended the University of Minnesota where he received a Ph.D. in pharmacology. His university studies also concentrated in chemistry, enzymology and cardiovascular physiology, which resulted in several published papers. While at the University of Minnesota, Ignarro studied under eventual Nobel Prize-winning chemist Paul Boyer.[4]
Ignarro's work continued at the NIH in the fields he'd studied, collaborating with many other scientists to discover regulatory mechanisms of the cardiovascular system that would lead to his most famous work. This was his first time to apply his education outside of an academic setting. In 1968, Ignarro left the NIH to work for Geigy Pharmaceuticals. With this company, Ignarro helped develop new drugs and was able to continue research into new areas of pharmacology including cyclic GMP. After Geigy merged with Ciba Pharmaceuticals, Ignarro decided to move back to the world of academia, this time as a professor.[4]
In 1973, Ignarro accepted the position of Assistant Professor of pharmacology at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, LA. Tulane was chosen partially because it would provide a good environment for continued research into cyclic GMP. While studying cyclic GMP, Ignarro read a paper by Ferid Murad, who demonstrated that nitric oxide elevates cyclic GMP levels. Ignarro then speculated that nitric oxide could be the key to relaxing vascular smooth muscles. In turn, this led to his extensive research on the subject. Ignarro's research demonstrated that nitric oxide serves the functions of vasorelaxant and inhibitor of platelet aggregation, with both effects mediated by cyclic GMP.
Ignarro continued his research at Tulane. In 1984 he realized that the properties of nitric oxide were the same as those seen in the endothelium derived relaxing factor previously-identified by Robert Furchgott 3 years earlier. The exact nature of the EDRF was up to this point unknown. Interestingly, Furchgott and Ignarro came to similar conclusions about nitric oxide as the EDRF around the same time and both presented evidence at conferences during 1986 demonstrating nitric oxide's role as EDRF.[4]
During the decades since Ignarro and Furchgott's initial research, thousands of studies have been published about the effects of nitric oxide as the endothelium derived relaxing factor. This has led to the development of erectile dysfunction drugs such as Viagra and nutritional supplements designed for cardiovascular health and athletic performance. In 1985, Ignarro moved from New Orleans to Los Angeles where he accepted a position at the UCLA School of Medicine and continues to research and teach.[4]
Herbalife relationship[edit]
Ignarro has worked as a paid consultant for Herbalife since 2003 and later became a member of the company's Scientific Advisory Board. He has collaborated in developing nutritional supplements for cardiovascular health and athletic performance. Ignarro first worked with Herbalife to develop Niteworks, a dietary supplement designed to boost the body’s own production of nitric oxide.[7] Ignarro endorsed this product in exchange for a royalty agreement reported to have earned his consulting firm over $1 million in the first 12 months.[8] Ignarro has continued to work with Herbalife to develop additional supplements focusing on nutrients such as Omega-3 fatty acid and CoQ10. As of 2012, Herbalife has made payments to Ignarro and his affiliated consulting firm of over $15 million.[9]
In 2003, Ignarro published a study based on ingredients found in Niteworks in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, where, as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, he can submit papers without review and without disclosing his financial interest to the publication. After Ignarro's ties to Herbalife were revealed, the journal issued a correction to the article, citing Ignarro's undisclosed "conflict of interest." [8] UCLA conducted its own investigation and determined that Ignarro did not act improperly. Ignarro has publicly acknowledged the conflict of interest as a mistake and has continued to publish extensively on the subject of nitric oxide.[10]
Ignarro appears in videos promoting Niteworks and other Herbalife products, and is a frequent speaker at Herbalife events. Since partnering with Herbalife, Ignarro has spoken to more than 5,000,000 people worldwide about nitric oxide and cardiovascular health.[10]
Famous quotes[edit]
While testifying before Congress in 2000, Ignarro remarked: "Only in America could the son of an uneducated carpenter receive the Nobel Prize in Medicine".[11][12]

Nobel Prize Laureate on Nitric Oxide
Dr. Louis J. Ignarro is a Distinguished Professor of Pharmacology at the UCLA School of medicine. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1998 for his discovery of the importance of nitric oxide to the cardiovascular system. He earned his B.S. in pharmacy from Columbia University and a PhD, in pharmacology from the University of Minnesota.


From Dr. Ignarro's book. "No More Heart Disease" he wrote, "Repairing the damage wrought by cardiovascular disease without risky and often ineffective surgery had long been considered impossible... Now we know we can reverse cardiovascular impairment naturally - with the body's internally manufactured wonder drug, Nitric Oxide."
He continues, "In 1988, a British scientist, Salvador Moncada, identified the substance that converts to Nitric Oxide in the endothelium - an amino acid called L-arginine. "I recommend that you take a high dose of supplemental L-arginine to insure that adequate amounts make their way into the endothelial cells, leading to increases in your levels of your bodily produced nitric oxide."
He concludes, "Nitric Oxide research is ongoing in a number of areas, showing promise in fields in addition to cardiovascular disease. People with (or at risk for) the following conditions are already benefiting or might soon be helped, by the ongoing studies of Nitric Oxide. Diabetes, Erectile dysfunction, Rheumatoid arthritis, Cancer, Ulcers, Urinary incontinence, Alzheimer's disease, Infections, Inflammatory diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease) and Multiple sclerosis

Research Interests
The principal objective of my research program is to elucidate the mechanisms of regulation and modulation of nitric oxide (NO) production and cytotoxicity in macrophages, vascular cells, and tumor cells. This laboratory employs a wide variety of techniques and procedures to answer important and timely questions pertaining to the biochemistry, molecular biology, and pathophysiology of NO. Enzyme protein purification and characterization, extensive cell culture systems, physiologic methods for assessment of organ and tissue functions, various molecular biology techniques (Northerns, Westerns, Southerns, gel shift assays, and related procedures), and various analytical techniques (HPLC, chemiluminescence, spectroscopy) are techniques routinely employed. We make the effort to develop any technique that is required to answer important research questions.

NO is one of the simplest molecules in nature but is synthesized by a complex enzymatic process. NO synthase is a homodimeric flavo-hemoprotein that catalyzes the 5-electron oxidation of L-arginine to NO + L-citrulline. This enzymatic reaction is similar to that catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 system, and requires numerous cofactors including calmodulin, NADPH, flavins, heme and tetrahydrobiopterin. NO synthase exists as three different isoforms; endothelial, neuronal and inducible. Endothelial and neuronal NO synthase are constitutively present in select cell types and is activated by intracellular calcium, which promotes the binding of calmodulin to the enzyme and thereby activates it. The inducible NO synthase already has calmodulin tightly bound as a subunit and, therefore, requires no calcium for enzyme activation; it is already activated as it is being synthesized from its mRNA. NO is a very small, lipophilic, readily diffusible, chemically unstable molecule with a very short half-life (seconds) and produces effects immediately and locally.

NO elicits physiological (vasodilation, anti-platelet effects, neurotransmitter functions) and pathophysiological actions (septic shock, acute and chronic inflammation, destruction of invading bacteria, viruses and tumor cells). Two different constitutively present isoforms of NO synthase (endothelial and neuronal NOS) are responsible for biosynthesis of small physiologically important amounts of NO. Such small amounts of NO are completely non-cytotoxic. An inducible isoform of NO synthase, which a distinct gene product from the constitutive isoforms, is responsible for high-output production of NO. Generation of large amounts of NO is associated with cytotoxicity and pathophysiology. Examples include induction of NO synthase in vascular smooth muscle resulting in profound vasorelaxation and hypotension, the characteristics of endotoxin shock; induction of NO synthase in brain microglia and astrocytes thereby resulting in production of large amounts of NO which permeate nearby oligodendrocytes resulting in impaired myelin production, the hallmark feature of multiple sclerosis; induction of NO synthase in joint tissues resulting in acute and chronic inflammation, characteristic signs of arthritic disease.

Research efforts in this laboratory are directed toward better understanding the factors that influence NO production and cytotoxicity. Studies are focused on the transcriptional regulation of inducible NO synthase and the involvement of NF-kB and other transcription factors in the inducible expression of the NO synthase gene. Separate projects focus on the mechanism by which oxidative stress triggers activation of NF-kB and induction of host-defense proteins. The relationship between oxidative stress and signal transduction in inducible gene expression is a major area of current focus. Additional projects address the roles of phosphorylation and proteolysis in gene transcription. Pertaining to the cytotoxic actions of NO, studies focus on the chemistry of NO as a reactive species with iron and copper, and how such reactivity alters cell function. The double-edged role of NO as both a protective species and deleterious species is intriguing and under investigation in various cell types including tumor cells as NO appears to have potent tumoricidal activity.

Additional specific aims focus on (1) co-induction of NO synthase and arginase and arginine transporters in macrophages and vascular cells to understand the factors affecting arginine availability for NO synthase catalyzed NO production; (2) mechanisms by which certain combinations of lipopolysaccharide plus cytokines cause rapidly developing death in certain cell types but not others; (3) mechanisms by which NO injures target cells and microorganisms without injuring cells that produce NO; (4) elucidation of the role of tetrahydrobiopterin as a cofactor for NO synthase; (5) elucidation of the mechanism by which NO causes a negative feedback effect on NO synthase to inhibit its own synthesis; (6) elucidation of the mechanism by which NO activates guanylate cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of cyclic GMP, an important second messenger that mediates the physiological actions of NO; (7) determination of the factors that affect the transcriptional expression and posttranslational modifications of guanylate cyclase.

This laboratory made the original observations that NO is a vasodilator (1979) and inhibitor of platelet aggregation (1981), that NO elicits its biological actions via the second messenger cyclic GMP (1979-1981), that NO activates guanylate cyclase by heme-dependent mechanisms (1982), that the endothelium-derived relaxing factor is NO, that NO is the neurotransmitter in nonadrenergic-noncholinergic neurons innervating the erectile tissue of the penis and is responsible for penile erection (1990), that NO is a negative feedback modulator of NO synthase (1992), and that aspirin and related drugs interfere with the inducible expression of the NO synthase gene (1995).

Therefore, this laboratory is committed to continued and persistent research into the biology and chemistry of NO.

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STORENo More Heart Disease: How Nitric Oxide Can Prevent  Even Reverse   Heart Disease And Strokeby Ignarro, Louis J.Dr. Louis Ignarro discovered "the atom" of cardiovascular health--a tiny molecule called Nitric Oxide.  NO, as it is known by chemists, is a signaling molecule produced by the body, and is a vasodilator that helps control blood flow to every part of the body.  Dr. Ignarro's findings led to the development of Viagra.  Nitric Oxide has a beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system as well.NO relaxes and enlarges the blood vessels, prevents blood clots that trigger strokes and heart attacks, and regulates blood pressure and the accumulation of plaque in the blood vessels.  Dr. Ignarro's current research indicates that Nitric Oxide may help lower cholesterol by facilitating the actions of statin drugs like Lipitor.  The goal of the regimen presented in NO More Heart Disease is to age proof the cardiovascular system, keeping the vascular network clean and elastic through enhanced NO productivity.  The plan is easy-to-follow without extreme lifestyle adjustments, involving taking supplements to stimulate Nitric Oxide production, incorporating NO friendly food into the diet, and a moderate exercise program.HeartCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
