Career[edit]
Clark earned his B.A. in Theology from Maryknoll College in 1966, his Ph.D. in philosophy from Columbia University in 1971, and his J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1972. From 1972 to 1974, Professor Clark was an associate with the Boston law firm of Ropes and Gray, where he practiced commercial and corporate law. After this, Clark spent four years on the faculty of Yale Law School, where he became a tenured professor. In 1979, he returned to Harvard Law School as a professor of law.
Clark has also consulted for law firms and government agencies, and he testified before various Congressional committees and subcommittees on regulation of financial institutions.
Clark was the Dean and Royall Professor of Law at Harvard Law School from 1989 through July 2003. Under Clark's leadership as Dean, the Harvard Law School was said to have "more than quadrupled its endowment, strengthened its curriculum and research programs, expanded the faculty and significantly improved its student-faculty ratio."
In November 2002, Clark announced plans to conclude his service as Dean on June 30, 2003. Elena Kagan was named as the next Dean of the Harvard Law School, beginning July 1, 2003.
On December 16, 2003, Time Warner announced that its Board of Directors elected Clark to join on the Board in January 2004 and serve on its Nominating and Governance Committee and its Audit and Finance Committee.[1]
Personal life[edit]
Clark was born in 1944 in New Orleans, Louisiana. He is married to Kathleen Tighe Clark and they have two children.

Under Clark's leadership as Dean, the Harvard Law School was said to have "more than quadrupled its endowment, strengthened its curriculum and research programs, expanded the faculty and significantly improved its student-faculty ratio."
In November 2002, Clark announced plans to conclude his service as Dean on June 30, 2003. Elena Kagan was named as the next Dean of the Harvard Law School, beginning July 1, 2003.

Although a handful of books and articles have been written about American literary Minimalism during the last forty years, the mode remains misunderstood. When in a 2011 interview in The Paris Review author Ann Beattie was asked how she felt about being “classed as a minimalist,” she began her answer: “none of us have ever known what that means.” Her response brings into focus the lack of agreement or clarity about the sources and definitions of literary Minimalism. Robert C. Clark’s American Literary Minimalism fills this significant gap. Clark demonstrates that, despite assertions by many scholars to the contrary, the movement originated in the aesthetic programs of the Imagists and literary Impressionists active at the turn of the twentieth century. The genre reflects the philosophy that “form is thought,” and that style alone dictates whether a poem, story, or novel falls within the parameters of the tradition. The characteristics of Minimalist fiction are efficiency, frequent use of allusion, and implication through omission. Organizing his analysis both chronologically and according to lines of influence, Clark offers a definition of the mode, describes its early stages, and then explores six works that reflect its core characteristics: Ernest Hemingway’s In Our Time; Raymond Carver’s Cathedral; Jay McInerney’s Bright Lights, Big City; Susan Minot’s Monkeys; Sandra Cisneros’s Caramelo; and Cormac McCarthy’s The Road. In his conclusion, Clark discusses the ongoing evolution of the category.


Robert C. Clark received his PhD in English from the University of Georgia. His recent publications include articles on Ernest Hemingway, Alice Dunbar-Nelson, María Cristina Mena, and Raymond Carver. His current research deals with transpacific minimalism, naturalism, and fiction of the twenty-first-century global financial crisis. He teaches at the University of West Alabama.


	“Robert Clark’s American Literary Minimalism is an excellent, rich, and long overdue study because it takes the reader through what Clark sees as the nexus that creates the style, past Ernest Hemingway and then into Carver, and on through McInerney, Minot, Cisneros, and McCarthy. It gives the reader a bevy of ideas to pull from in any subjective definition of ‘minimalism,’ and makes clear what Clark himself finds important.”	—Linda Wagner-Martin, author of A History of American Literature: 1950 to the Present“More of a literary mode than a movement, minimalism has always gotten short shrift, for reasons that are obvious enough: there seems something deceptively paradoxical about going into depth into a style that prides itself on brevity and concision. Robert Clark’s American Literary Minimalism goes a long way toward redressing that presumption while also correcting the prejudices that proliferated against the mode throughout the 1980s. Clark makes an important argument about the tradition of minimalism, linking Raymond Carver in particular to the ‘no scrollwork’ school of Hemingway and demonstrating, through accompanying readings of Susan Minot, Sandra Cisneros, and Cormac McCarthy, that notions of omission, precision, and economy are expressed through a far wider variety of means and themes than the stereotype of Kmart realism or dirty realism or any other reductive term critics could conjure up.”—Kirk Curnutt, author of The Cambridge Introduction to F. Scott Fitzgerald and Wise Economies: Brevity and Storytelling in American Short Stories"....  Clark’s showcase of minimalism in American fiction holds much value for those enrolled in creative writing courses, who will benefit from the foundation in minimalism Clark provides, and those in American literature courses that cover the works critiqued. Summing Up: Recommended. Upper-division undergraduates." —CHOICE
