INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY



At Alpha Windward, we believe that fundamental quantitative methodologies outperform traditional approaches to investing.  The rapid and substantial growth of investment information available to the financial community has created a critical need to process and analyze information about securities with greater precision, efficiency, and insight.  It has also provided Alpha Windward with the opportunity to make better investment decisions by combining quantitative modeling with fundamental analysis in order to optimize overall returns on a risk-adjusted basis.
We believe that equities are the best long-term asset class and that time in the markets, not market timing, is the key to growing investment assets.  Diversification across asset classes and among securities is also an important investment strategy.  Asset allocation and comprehensive securities selection are critical components of the portfolio construction process at Alpha Windward.  Overall portfolio risk and variability of returns from year to year are reduced by maintaining a well-diversified investment program.

INVESTMENT PROCESS





Alpha Windward offers separate account management as well as a pooled-equity fund, the Carr Total Return Fund.  We manage client investment portfolios by integrating our state-of-the-art proprietary research, portfolio construction, trading, accounting and monitoring functions on a highly sophisticated and secure computer network.  We consider Alpha Windward to be second to none in our innovative systems and streamlined trading procedures.  Our clients’ returns are greater because of our focus on cost and because we leverage our expertise in statistical modeling to optimize investment decisions.
We begin our investment by importing independent external data from Compustat, Ford, Value-Line and Zacks. Our own multi-factor ranking system (MFRS), using a form of artificial intelligence, ranks stocks by their respective Alphas.  Comparing the new ranks to those in the current portfolio generates buy/hold/sells lists.  The ensuing electronic basket trading is entirely computerized and benefits our clients by ensuring accuracy and tightly controlling transactions and administrative costs.
Communicating with our clients to their satisfaction informs and enhances our approach to managing their investments.  We seek to understand our clients’ goals, tolerance for risk, and need for information, in order to ensure that our decisions are fully congruent with their expectations.  When clients or other interested parties call us, Alpha Windward’s principals respond personally.

'Dunkirk' is a spectacular World War II epic
On a towering IMAX screen the film swallows you whole, and puts you in the middle of the action - on land, on sea and in the air . It's one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers.
During the just-completed fiscal year, Microsoft took home 62 cents of every dollar of sales in gross profit, down from more than 80 cents in 2010. Microsoft reported non-GAAP net income of $7.7 billion, or 98 cents a share, on revenue of $24.7 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter. After languishing for years, Microsoft shares have climbed more than 33 percent in the past year. Looking at the stock's movement on the chart, Microsoft Corporation recorded a 52-week high of $73.45.Move over Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp.is coming for your throne in the sky."They are the undisputed No. 2 in the hyperscale public cloud market, and it will be extraordinarily hard for anyone to catch them", Mr. Reback said. Its investment stood at $16,637,000 an increase of $6,218,000 as of quarter end. For those investing in Microsoft, Q4 numbers boil down to $0.83 cents a share on an operating income of $5.3 billion.Yes, the biggest contributor to Microsoft's $23 billion in for the fourth quarter and its $90 billion for fiscal 2017 remained its More Personal Computing division (Windows, devices and gaming).Worldwide shipments of traditional PCs-desktop, notebook, workstation- totaled 61.1 million units in the second quarter, a 4.3 percent decline from a year ago, according to Gartner Inc.

Surface revenue decreased 2% mainly due to product lifecycle transitions.In other Microsoft Corporation news, insider Jean Philippe Courtois sold 26,694 shares of the firm's stock in a transaction on Wednesday, May 3rd.It's a good time to review what is included in Microsoft's commercial cloud category and how those services are doing.ILLEGAL ACTIVITY NOTICE: "Gilman Hill Asset Management LLC Purchases 390 Shares of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)" was posted by BBNS and is owned by of BBNS.The Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 are both over a year and a half old now, and the 'refreshed' Surface Book with Performance Base didn't fully compensate for the declining interest in those models; the heavily discounted prices on the Pro 4 and first-gen Surface Book in recent weeks will also have had an impact on revenues. The company's revenue for the quarter was up 6.3% compared to the same quarter a year ago. For the next financial year, analysts expect that the business will post sales of $103.16 billion per share, with estimates ranging from $100.67 billion to $105.37 billion.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
