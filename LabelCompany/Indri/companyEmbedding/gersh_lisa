The former executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and NBCUniversal will head Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle company

Lisa Gersh has found a new home at goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle and e-commerce company.
The former executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and NBCUniversal will head the expansion of the digital brand, founded in 2008. As CEO, she will oversee exclusive fashion collaborations with top designers, including Stella McCartney and Diane Von Furstenburg, and eventually will introduce goop's own label. More pop-up stores and live events are also in the works.
"Lisa is a visionary leader with unparalleled creativity and savvy," said Paltrow in a statement. "She's the perfect person to build on the momentum we have already created at goop and to diversify our opportunities to bring goop's positive energy directly to consumers in what they read, what they try, what they buy and how they live."
"Gwyneth Paltrow and her team took an inspired idea and turned it into a multiplatform lifestyle brand with a large and devoted audience," added Gersh. "As a fan since its launch, I've admired the inimitable voice and style Gwyneth has infused into goop and the business she's built. It's rare to work with such an inspired founder and a digitally native company, a brand that thinks digitally from an organic point of view and successfully fuses content and revenue-generating retail. Building on goop's unique success, we'll continue to invest in the company, expand globally and launch new product lines and partnerships. The future of commerce is all tied to best-in-class, trusted, distinctive, curated content.
"I also like businesses with multiple revenue streams; advertising, designer collaborations and direct-to-consumer retail all provide strong monetization opportunities for goop. I'm incredibly excited to work with Gwyneth and the goop team to play a role in this next stage."
Gersh's CEO role was last held by Sebastian Bishop, who left goop in April.

History[edit]
The company was founded, in 1997 by Martha Stewart,[3] as an umbrella for the various media and merchandising ventures linked to the Martha Stewart brand. It went public on the NYSE on October 19, 1999. The stock opened at $18 a share, but shot up to $38 a share, making Stewart an instant billionaire.
She served as president, chairwoman and CEO of the company until being forced to resign as a result of the ImClone insider trading case. As part of an agreement with the SEC, she was banned from serving in any role that would allow her to prepare, audit or disclose financial results of a public company until August 2011.[4] In effect, this banned her from serving as an officer of her own company. However, she still owns a 96 percent controlling interest.
Stewart rejoined the board of directors of her namesake company in September 2011[5] and became its chairwoman once again in May 2012.[6]
On December 4, 2015, it was announced that Sequential Brands Group acquired Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.[7] As a result of its acquisition, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia requested that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) suspend trading & de-list the company's common stock.[7][8]

Four newspaper columns — ask Martha, Living, Weddings and Everyday Food — are distributed to newspapers throughout the United States via the New York Times Syndicate. Current books are published through Random House's Clarkson Potter division; earlier titles were offered through subsidiaries of Time Warner prior to Stewart's spin-off of her business ventures from its corporate umbrella. Publishing activities are a major source of income for the company, and accounted for roughly 60% of total revenue in 2005.
Television and radio[edit]
Television[edit]
On 15 November 2005 Martha Stewart named NBC's Sheraton Kalouria as President of Television[10] for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (MSLO), he was responsible for development and production of global programming for cable, broadcast, syndication and DVD as well as managing MSLO's development in the area of digital content for video on demand,[11] web and mobile platforms.

Although MSLO retained no technical ownership stake in NBC's program The Apprentice: Martha Stewart, the company, its magazines, and various business ventures were prominently featured in each episode. Mark Burnett, who produced the series, is also co-producer of the company's daily talk show, Martha.
DVD[edit]
MSLO began marketing instructional DVDs in late 2005 through a partnership with Warner Bros., with the first five offerings oriented toward cooking and holiday and special event planning.
Radio[edit]
MSLO operates a satellite radio channel, Martha Stewart Living Radio, on Channel 110 of SiriusXM Satellite Radio. Among programs on the channel there was a weekday-evening talk show co-hosted by Martha Stewart's daughter Alexis Stewart, Whatever with Alexis and Jennifer. Alexis left the radio show in June 2011 leaving Jennifer Koppelman-Hutt as the sole host. The show was cancelled in December 2011 and Koppelman-Hutt was terminated.
Internet and direct Commerce[edit]
The company's Internet and Direct Commerce segment currently includes its website marthastewart.com and a direct to consumer flower business, marthastewartflowers.com. Through an agreement with Touchpoint, it designed a line of customizable greeting cards under the Marthascards banner, which were sourced and fulfilled by Touchpoint. This agreement was replaced by a new program with Kodak EasyShare Gallery in 2006.
In November 2006, MSLO announced their launch of Martha's Circle which is a lifestyle oriented blog ad-network[12] whose charter members include Apartment Therapy, Smitten Kitchen, and Charles & Hudson.
Historically, the company also produced a print and online catalog, Martha by Mail, which was launched in 1997 and later rebranded as Martha Stewart: The Catalog for Living. Following Stewart's public fallout and the dot-com bubble burst in 2002, the company decided to discontinue both the online and print editions in 2003. The final print catalog was mailed in January 2004, and the online store closed in June of that year.
Merchandising[edit]
MSLO additionally offers various home goods through its mass-market Martha Stewart Everyday brand in Kmart stores throughout the United States, and at Sears Canada in Canada. Furniture and paint are part of the company's specialty-retail oriented Martha Stewart Signature brand through a partnership with Bernhardt Furniture Company and previously with Sherwin-Williams. In October 2006, the company announced a new agreement with Lowe's to develop an exclusive interior paints line, which replaced its previous contract with Sherwin-Williams. The new line of paints, Martha Stewart Colors, launched in April 2007.
In April 2006, the company also announced its plans to develop a new, upmarket merchandise line with Macy's, Inc. (at the time named Federated Department Stores) launched in Macy's stores in 2007. The company has also announced its intention to design a new paper-based crafts product line, Martha Stewart Crafts, with EK Success, initially planned for release in time for the Holiday 2006 season, which later debuted in early 2007 at Michael's stores.
In Fall of 2009, Stewart announced the development of a line of outdoor furniture, indoor organization, kitchen cabinets, and decor products at Home Depot.
On December 7, 2011, JCPenney announced the acquisition of 16.6 percent of the company's stock. JCPenney plans to put "mini-Martha Stewart shops" in many of its stores in 2013, as well as starting a web site together.[13]
Wine[edit]
On September 14, 2007, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced that it inked a partnership with E & J Gallo Winery to produce a wine brand with the label "Martha Stewart Vintage" for sale in 6 cities, January. The 15,000 cases to be sold include: 2006 Sonoma County Chardonnay, 2005 Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon and 2006 Sonoma County Merlot (for Atlanta, Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; Denver, Phoenix, and Portland, Oregon).
Martha Stewart also signed a contract with Costco Wholesale Corp. to offer a series of food products developed from MSLO’s library of recipes.
Acquisition of Emeril Lagasse Franchise[edit]
On February 19, 2008, MSL Omnimedia announced that the company had reached an agreement with celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse to purchase certain business assets for $50 million: $45 million in cash and $5 million in stock.[14] With the exclusion of Emeril Lagasse’s restaurant chain and his foundation, the deal consists of the rights to television programs such as Essence of Emeril and Emeril Live, Emeril Lagasse’s Cookbook library, the emerils.com website, and kitchen and food products.
Controversies[edit]
Investor's lawsuit[edit]
On August 6, 2002, a class action was filed against Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. for misleading investors by issuing materially false and misleading statements, and its officers using insider information to avoid losses. A settlement of $30 million was approved in 2007.[15] In 2004, the company previously recognized as expense its estimate of annualsubscription-acquisition costs ratably throughout the year. After reviewing this matter with its independent certified public accounting firm and its auditcommittee, the company determined on October 26, 2004 to change the method of accounting for interim period expense recognition of its subscription acquisition costs. The company recognized subscription-acquisition costs in the period in which the acquisition efforts took place and restated the financial statements.[16]
Macy's lawsuit[edit]
In December 2013, Macy's sued Martha Stewart and Penney after the two companies decided, in 2011, to partner up and open up what would be called Martha Stewart home shops. Macy's sued Martha Stewart for "breach of contract" and sued Penney for "interfering with its agreement with Martha Stewart". Both of these lawsuits were combined in December 2013.[17] Macy's goal was to stop Penney from selling Martha Stewart merchandise that was supposed to be sold exclusively at Macy's.[18]
Macy's settled a portion of its lawsuit with Martha Stewart Omnimedia over a home products deal, however, Macy's continues to sue J.C. Penney Company Inc.[19] Stewart did not disclose the terms of the settlement.[17] This lawsuit cost between "$7 million and $8 million in legal costs", according to CEO Dienst.[9]

On December 7, 2011, JCPenney announced the acquisition of 16.6 percent of the company's stock. JCPenney plans to put "mini-Martha Stewart shops" in many of its stores in 2013, as well as starting a web site together.[13]
Wine[edit]
On September 14, 2007, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced that it inked a partnership with E & J Gallo Winery to produce a wine brand with the label "Martha Stewart Vintage" for sale in 6 cities, January. The 15,000 cases to be sold include: 2006 Sonoma County Chardonnay, 2005 Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon and 2006 Sonoma County Merlot (for Atlanta, Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; Denver, Phoenix, and Portland, Oregon).
Martha Stewart also signed a contract with Costco Wholesale Corp. to offer a series of food products developed from MSLO’s library of recipes.
Acquisition of Emeril Lagasse Franchise[edit]
On February 19, 2008, MSL Omnimedia announced that the company had reached an agreement with celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse to purchase certain business assets for $50 million: $45 million in cash and $5 million in stock.[14] With the exclusion of Emeril Lagasse’s restaurant chain and his foundation, the deal consists of the rights to television programs such as Essence of Emeril and Emeril Live, Emeril Lagasse’s Cookbook library, the emerils.com website, and kitchen and food products.
Controversies[edit]
Investor's lawsuit[edit]
On August 6, 2002, a class action was filed against Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. for misleading investors by issuing materially false and misleading statements, and its officers using insider information to avoid losses. A settlement of $30 million was approved in 2007.[15] In 2004, the company previously recognized as expense its estimate of annualsubscription-acquisition costs ratably throughout the year. After reviewing this matter with its independent certified public accounting firm and its auditcommittee, the company determined on October 26, 2004 to change the method of accounting for interim period expense recognition of its subscription acquisition costs. The company recognized subscription-acquisition costs in the period in which the acquisition efforts took place and restated the financial statements.[16]
Macy's lawsuit[edit]
In December 2013, Macy's sued Martha Stewart and Penney after the two companies decided, in 2011, to partner up and open up what would be called Martha Stewart home shops. Macy's sued Martha Stewart for "breach of contract" and sued Penney for "interfering with its agreement with Martha Stewart". Both of these lawsuits were combined in December 2013.[17] Macy's goal was to stop Penney from selling Martha Stewart merchandise that was supposed to be sold exclusively at Macy's.[18]
Macy's settled a portion of its lawsuit with Martha Stewart Omnimedia over a home products deal, however, Macy's continues to sue J.C. Penney Company Inc.[19] Stewart did not disclose the terms of the settlement.[17] This lawsuit cost between "$7 million and $8 million in legal costs", according to CEO Dienst.[9]

History[edit]
The company was founded, in 1997 by Martha Stewart,[3] as an umbrella for the various media and merchandising ventures linked to the Martha Stewart brand. It went public on the NYSE on October 19, 1999. The stock opened at $18 a share, but shot up to $38 a share, making Stewart an instant billionaire.
She served as president, chairwoman and CEO of the company until being forced to resign as a result of the ImClone insider trading case. As part of an agreement with the SEC, she was banned from serving in any role that would allow her to prepare, audit or disclose financial results of a public company until August 2011.[4] In effect, this banned her from serving as an officer of her own company. However, she still owns a 96 percent controlling interest.
Stewart rejoined the board of directors of her namesake company in September 2011[5] and became its chairwoman once again in May 2012.[6]
On December 4, 2015, it was announced that Sequential Brands Group acquired Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.[7] As a result of its acquisition, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia requested that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) suspend trading & de-list the company's common stock.[7][8]

Four newspaper columns — ask Martha, Living, Weddings and Everyday Food — are distributed to newspapers throughout the United States via the New York Times Syndicate. Current books are published through Random House's Clarkson Potter division; earlier titles were offered through subsidiaries of Time Warner prior to Stewart's spin-off of her business ventures from its corporate umbrella. Publishing activities are a major source of income for the company, and accounted for roughly 60% of total revenue in 2005.
Television and radio[edit]
Television[edit]
On 15 November 2005 Martha Stewart named NBC's Sheraton Kalouria as President of Television[10] for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (MSLO), he was responsible for development and production of global programming for cable, broadcast, syndication and DVD as well as managing MSLO's development in the area of digital content for video on demand,[11] web and mobile platforms.

Although MSLO retained no technical ownership stake in NBC's program The Apprentice: Martha Stewart, the company, its magazines, and various business ventures were prominently featured in each episode. Mark Burnett, who produced the series, is also co-producer of the company's daily talk show, Martha.
DVD[edit]
MSLO began marketing instructional DVDs in late 2005 through a partnership with Warner Bros., with the first five offerings oriented toward cooking and holiday and special event planning.
Radio[edit]
MSLO operates a satellite radio channel, Martha Stewart Living Radio, on Channel 110 of SiriusXM Satellite Radio. Among programs on the channel there was a weekday-evening talk show co-hosted by Martha Stewart's daughter Alexis Stewart, Whatever with Alexis and Jennifer. Alexis left the radio show in June 2011 leaving Jennifer Koppelman-Hutt as the sole host. The show was cancelled in December 2011 and Koppelman-Hutt was terminated.
Internet and direct Commerce[edit]
The company's Internet and Direct Commerce segment currently includes its website marthastewart.com and a direct to consumer flower business, marthastewartflowers.com. Through an agreement with Touchpoint, it designed a line of customizable greeting cards under the Marthascards banner, which were sourced and fulfilled by Touchpoint. This agreement was replaced by a new program with Kodak EasyShare Gallery in 2006.
In November 2006, MSLO announced their launch of Martha's Circle which is a lifestyle oriented blog ad-network[12] whose charter members include Apartment Therapy, Smitten Kitchen, and Charles & Hudson.
Historically, the company also produced a print and online catalog, Martha by Mail, which was launched in 1997 and later rebranded as Martha Stewart: The Catalog for Living. Following Stewart's public fallout and the dot-com bubble burst in 2002, the company decided to discontinue both the online and print editions in 2003. The final print catalog was mailed in January 2004, and the online store closed in June of that year.
Merchandising[edit]
MSLO additionally offers various home goods through its mass-market Martha Stewart Everyday brand in Kmart stores throughout the United States, and at Sears Canada in Canada. Furniture and paint are part of the company's specialty-retail oriented Martha Stewart Signature brand through a partnership with Bernhardt Furniture Company and previously with Sherwin-Williams. In October 2006, the company announced a new agreement with Lowe's to develop an exclusive interior paints line, which replaced its previous contract with Sherwin-Williams. The new line of paints, Martha Stewart Colors, launched in April 2007.
In April 2006, the company also announced its plans to develop a new, upmarket merchandise line with Macy's, Inc. (at the time named Federated Department Stores) launched in Macy's stores in 2007. The company has also announced its intention to design a new paper-based crafts product line, Martha Stewart Crafts, with EK Success, initially planned for release in time for the Holiday 2006 season, which later debuted in early 2007 at Michael's stores.
In Fall of 2009, Stewart announced the development of a line of outdoor furniture, indoor organization, kitchen cabinets, and decor products at Home Depot.
On December 7, 2011, JCPenney announced the acquisition of 16.6 percent of the company's stock. JCPenney plans to put "mini-Martha Stewart shops" in many of its stores in 2013, as well as starting a web site together.[13]

Martha Stewart also signed a contract with Costco Wholesale Corp. to offer a series of food products developed from MSLO’s library of recipes.
Acquisition of Emeril Lagasse Franchise[edit]
On February 19, 2008, MSL Omnimedia announced that the company had reached an agreement with celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse to purchase certain business assets for $50 million: $45 million in cash and $5 million in stock.[14] With the exclusion of Emeril Lagasse’s restaurant chain and his foundation, the deal consists of the rights to television programs such as Essence of Emeril and Emeril Live, Emeril Lagasse’s Cookbook library, the emerils.com website, and kitchen and food products.

Alexis left the radio show in June 2011 leaving Jennifer Koppelman-Hutt as the sole host. The show was cancelled in December 2011 and Koppelman-Hutt was terminated.
Internet and direct Commerce[edit]
The company's Internet and Direct Commerce segment currently includes its website marthastewart.com and a direct to consumer flower business, marthastewartflowers.com. Through an agreement with Touchpoint, it designed a line of customizable greeting cards under the Marthascards banner, which were sourced and fulfilled by Touchpoint. This agreement was replaced by a new program with Kodak EasyShare Gallery in 2006.
In November 2006, MSLO announced their launch of Martha's Circle which is a lifestyle oriented blog ad-network[12] whose charter members include Apartment Therapy, Smitten Kitchen, and Charles & Hudson.
Historically, the company also produced a print and online catalog, Martha by Mail, which was launched in 1997 and later rebranded as Martha Stewart: The Catalog for Living. Following Stewart's public fallout and the dot-com bubble burst in 2002, the company decided to discontinue both the online and print editions in 2003. The final print catalog was mailed in January 2004, and the online store closed in June of that year.
Merchandising[edit]
MSLO additionally offers various home goods through its mass-market Martha Stewart Everyday brand in Kmart stores throughout the United States, and at Sears Canada in Canada. Furniture and paint are part of the company's specialty-retail oriented Martha Stewart Signature brand through a partnership with Bernhardt Furniture Company and previously with Sherwin-Williams. In October 2006, the company announced a new agreement with Lowe's to develop an exclusive interior paints line, which replaced its previous contract with Sherwin-Williams. The new line of paints, Martha Stewart Colors, launched in April 2007.
In April 2006, the company also announced its plans to develop a new, upmarket merchandise line with Macy's, Inc. (at the time named Federated Department Stores) launched in Macy's stores in 2007. The company has also announced its intention to design a new paper-based crafts product line, Martha Stewart Crafts, with EK Success, initially planned for release in time for the Holiday 2006 season, which later debuted in early 2007 at Michael's stores.
In Fall of 2009, Stewart announced the development of a line of outdoor furniture, indoor organization, kitchen cabinets, and decor products at Home Depot.
On December 7, 2011, JCPenney announced the acquisition of 16.6 percent of the company's stock. JCPenney plans to put "mini-Martha Stewart shops" in many of its stores in 2013, as well as starting a web site together.[13]
Wine[edit]
On September 14, 2007, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced that it inked a partnership with E & J Gallo Winery to produce a wine brand with the label "Martha Stewart Vintage" for sale in 6 cities, January. The 15,000 cases to be sold include: 2006 Sonoma County Chardonnay, 2005 Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon and 2006 Sonoma County Merlot (for Atlanta, Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; Denver, Phoenix, and Portland, Oregon).
Martha Stewart also signed a contract with Costco Wholesale Corp. to offer a series of food products developed from MSLO’s library of recipes.
Acquisition of Emeril Lagasse Franchise[edit]
On February 19, 2008, MSL Omnimedia announced that the company had reached an agreement with celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse to purchase certain business assets for $50 million: $45 million in cash and $5 million in stock.[14] With the exclusion of Emeril Lagasse’s restaurant chain and his foundation, the deal consists of the rights to television programs such as Essence of Emeril and Emeril Live, Emeril Lagasse’s Cookbook library, the emerils.com website, and kitchen and food products.
Controversies[edit]
Investor's lawsuit[edit]
On August 6, 2002, a class action was filed against Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. for misleading investors by issuing materially false and misleading statements, and its officers using insider information to avoid losses. A settlement of $30 million was approved in 2007.[15] In 2004, the company previously recognized as expense its estimate of annualsubscription-acquisition costs ratably throughout the year. After reviewing this matter with its independent certified public accounting firm and its auditcommittee, the company determined on October 26, 2004 to change the method of accounting for interim period expense recognition of its subscription acquisition costs. The company recognized subscription-acquisition costs in the period in which the acquisition efforts took place and restated the financial statements.[16]
Macy's lawsuit[edit]
In December 2013, Macy's sued Martha Stewart and Penney after the two companies decided, in 2011, to partner up and open up what would be called Martha Stewart home shops. Macy's sued Martha Stewart for "breach of contract" and sued Penney for "interfering with its agreement with Martha Stewart". Both of these lawsuits were combined in December 2013.[17] Macy's goal was to stop Penney from selling Martha Stewart merchandise that was supposed to be sold exclusively at Macy's.[18]
Macy's settled a portion of its lawsuit with Martha Stewart Omnimedia over a home products deal, however, Macy's continues to sue J.C. Penney Company Inc.[19] Stewart did not disclose the terms of the settlement.[17] This lawsuit cost between "$7 million and $8 million in legal costs", according to CEO Dienst.[9]

History[edit]
The company was founded, in 1997 by Martha Stewart,[3] as an umbrella for the various media and merchandising ventures linked to the Martha Stewart brand. It went public on the NYSE on October 19, 1999. The stock opened at $18 a share, but shot up to $38 a share, making Stewart an instant billionaire.
She served as president, chairwoman and CEO of the company until being forced to resign as a result of the ImClone insider trading case. As part of an agreement with the SEC, she was banned from serving in any role that would allow her to prepare, audit or disclose financial results of a public company until August 2011.[4] In effect, this banned her from serving as an officer of her own company. However, she still owns a 96 percent controlling interest.
Stewart rejoined the board of directors of her namesake company in September 2011[5] and became its chairwoman once again in May 2012.[6]
On December 4, 2015, it was announced that Sequential Brands Group acquired Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.[7] As a result of its acquisition, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia requested that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) suspend trading & de-list the company's common stock.[7][8]

Four newspaper columns — ask Martha, Living, Weddings and Everyday Food — are distributed to newspapers throughout the United States via the New York Times Syndicate. Current books are published through Random House's Clarkson Potter division; earlier titles were offered through subsidiaries of Time Warner prior to Stewart's spin-off of her business ventures from its corporate umbrella. Publishing activities are a major source of income for the company, and accounted for roughly 60% of total revenue in 2005.
Television and radio[edit]
Television[edit]
On 15 November 2005 Martha Stewart named NBC's Sheraton Kalouria as President of Television[10] for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (MSLO), he was responsible for development and production of global programming for cable, broadcast, syndication and DVD as well as managing MSLO's development in the area of digital content for video on demand,[11] web and mobile platforms.

The rivalry between domestic diva Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow amped up Monday when the Oscar-winning actress hired Lisa Gersh to be the CEO of Goop, her fledgling lifestyle and e-commerce company.
Gersh is the former chief of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, who exited in early 2013 after only a year on the job.
Paltrow, 42, has been using the 6-year-old Goop to move slowly but steadily into Stewart’s sweet spot — that is, handing out advice on home, food and fashion.
In fact, Goop, which Paltrow and Gersh prefer to present with a lowercase “g,” sometimes publishes recipes adapted from Stewart.
Stewart, 73, has been curtly dismissive of Paltrow’s efforts to crack the personal lifestyle multimedia genre that Stewart has pioneered with books, magazines, Web properties and TV shows.
In a recent interview, Stewart said Paltrow should pipe down and stick to acting.
“She just needs to be quiet,” Stewart was quoted as telling Net-A-Porter’s Porter magazine. “She’s a movie star. If she were confident in her acting, she wouldn’t be trying to be Martha Stewart.”
Paltrow started Goop in London but recently moved the company to the US and is clearly intent on expanding what has been a money-losing e-commerce company.
“Lisa is a visionary leader with unparalleled creativity and savvy,” Paltrow said in making the announcement. “She’s the perfect person to build on the momentum we have already created at goop and to diversify our opportunities to bring goop’s positive energy directly to consumers in what they read, what they try and what they buy and how they live.”
Gersh, 55, who worked at NBC before MSLO and co-founded Oxygen Media, hinted that part of her job at Goop would be to bring new products to market. But she did not say if any of those new products would be a magazine.
Moving into print would make Paltrow even more of a rival to Stewart.
“Building on goop’s unique success, we’ll continue to invest in the company, expand globally and launch next product lines and partnerships. The future of commerce is all tied to best in class, trusted, distinctive curated content.”
Goop had 2012 revenues of $1.9 million and posted a loss of $40,000 in that year, according to documents on file with Companies House in Britain, which tracks corporate results.
Paltrow and Goop’s previous CEO, Sebastian Bishop, who left earlier this year, pulled in combined salaries of almost $600,000 in 2012, the last year for which figures are available. The filing for 2013 is overdue, according to Companies House.
With its move to the US, Goop recently incorporated in New York.
Goop also recently engaged in a legal battle with Charles Plotkin, a Hunter College professor and nutritional guru, over its use of the “Diet Detective” phrase that Plotkin claims the company used without permission.
The suit, filed in Manhattan state court, was recently settled, according to Plotkin, who on Monday declined to divulge details.
Goop also contributed about $6,000 to three charities: the Sandy Hook Foundation, the Pencils of Promise and the Edible Schoolyard Project.

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.
