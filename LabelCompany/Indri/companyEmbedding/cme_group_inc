CME Group Inc. (Chicago Mercantile Exchange & Chicago Board of Trade) is an American financial market company operating the world's largest options and futures exchange. It owns and operates large derivatives and futures exchanges in Chicago, New York City, and exchange facilities in London, using online trading platforms.[3][4] It also owns the Dow Jones stock and financial indexes, and CME Clearing Services, which provides settlement and clearing of exchange trades. The exchange-traded derivative contracts include futures and options based on interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange, energy, agricultural commodities, rare and precious metals, weather, and real estate.[5] It has been described by The Economist as "The biggest financial exchange you have never heard of."[6]
The corporate world headquarters are in Chicago in The Loop. The corporation was formed by the 2007 merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). On March 17, 2008, CME Group announced it had acquired NYMEX Holdings, Inc., the parent company of the New York Mercantile Exchange and Commodity Exchange, Inc (COMEX). The acquisition was formally completed on August 22, 2008.[7] The four exchanges now operate as designated contract markets (DCM) of the CME Group.[8]
On February 10, 2010, CME announced its purchase of 90% of Dow Jones Indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[9] Dow Jones Indexes subsequently became S&P Dow Jones Indices, in which CME has a 24.4% ownership interest.[10]
On October 17, 2012, CME announced it was acquiring the Kansas City Board of Trade for $126 Million in cash. KCBOT is the dominant venue for the sale of hard red winter wheat. The Chicago Board of Trade is the leading trade platform for soft red winter wheat.[11]

CME recently unveiled four new palm contracts, which will be added to its suite of agricultural products. These newly introduced contracts will start trading on Jul 11, 2016, upon completion of all relevant regulatory review periods.The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) securities exchange provider is the most diverse world leader in the derivates market. CME Group will be able to expand its offerings within the palm derivatives complex with the newly launched contracts. The contracts will not only for trade on CME Globex, but will also be submitted for clearing through CME ClearPort. Notably, these contracts will be listed with and adhere to the rules and regulations of CME Group.Precisely, these four new contracts are USD Malaysian Crude Palm Oil Calendar futures (CPO), the USD Malaysian Palm Olein Calendar futures (OPF), the USD Malaysian Crude Palm Oil Average Price option (POO), and the Bursa Malaysia Crude Palm Oil-Gasoil Spread futures (POG).Along with the increased awareness, the company’s clients have displayed genuine interest in utilizing cleared futures for risk management. We believe that these contracts will offer flexibility and efficiency to clients, which in turn, will lead to the effective management of exposure to price volatility in the global palm oil market. CME Group, along with its partners Bursa Malaysia Derivatives (“BMD”) and Thomson Reuters will remain focused on forming a compelling suite of palm products. Hence, market participants will receive assistance with their hedging and trading needs.BMD’s Crude Palm Oil futures contract (FCPO) will be utilized in the company’s new palm products, thereby acknowledging and strengthening FCPO's position as the global price benchmark. The combination of the new palm products and FCPO will furnish the required risk management tools for the commodity industry, globally.Since the launch of its suite of Crude Palm Oil Swaps and Palm Olein Swaps in 2013, the company has witnessed the clearing of more than 170,000 contracts or more than 4.25 million metric tons). In May 2016, the company reported a record month-end closing open interest of 17,120, across both products.CME GROUP INC PriceCME GROUP INC Price | CME GROUP INC QuoteCME Group remains committed toward the launch of new products, as well as diversifying derivative product lines. To this end, the company recently launched physically delivered European Union Wheat futures and option. The future contracts would start trading from Sep 12, 2016 and will be listed under the rules and regulations of Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the finance sector are Bats Global Markets BATS, Markel Corp.

products. These fees include per contract charges for trade execution, clearing and CME Globex fees. Fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded, the method of trade and the trading privileges of the customer making the trade.
Generally, members are charged lower fees than non-members. Certain of our customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our efforts to encourage increased liquidity in our markets. Our markets also generate valuable data and
information regarding pricing and trading activity in our products. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers. See Item 7.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, page 56, for the average daily volume of contracts traded in our four principal product lines for the last three years. Although dislocations in credit
and lending markets have significantly impacted our interest rate complex, our other product lines, especially equity indexes, showed solid volume growth in 2008. Looking forward, we will continue to focus on expense discipline while providing
customers with the best ways to manage risk at a time of economic uncertainty.  Interest Rate Products. Our interest rate products enable
banks and other financial institutions worldwide to hedge interest rate risks, and in turn help to reduce the overall cost of borrowing and financing. Our interest rate products allow our customers to execute transactions across the entire U.S.
dollar-denominated yield curve using some of the worlds most actively traded futures and options products. Customers may manage short-, medium- and long-term interest rate risk using our products based on Eurodollars, U.S. Treasuries, swaps
and other dollar-related instruments. As a result of our acquisition of CBOT, our interest rate products include CBOTs thirty-year U.S. Treasury bond futures and options on futures; ten-year, five-year and two-year U.S. Treasury note futures
and options; and interest rate swap futures and options and federal funds futures and options.  Fifty-two percent of our overall annual trading volume in
2008 and 38% of our clearing and transaction fees was based upon our interest rate products. The overall volume of our interest rate product line was down compared with 2007. The decrease was as a result of decreased trading in our Eurodollar
options contract due to increased volatility in the relationship between the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the overnight federal funds effective rate, declining correlations between risk free Treasury rates and spread products, a
slowdown in corporate debt and mortgage originations, industry consolidation, declining assets under management, a severe decrease in mortgage-related structured product transactions and pressure resulting from failures in the repo market.
 In 2009, we believe that our interest rate product line will continue to be negatively impacted by the current state of the economy and a zero interest
rate policy. We believe that this decline could be partially offset by the increased Treasury issuances and the need to manage the associated interest rate risks as well as transitions to exchange traded and cleared products by over-the-counter
participants in response to heightened concerns about counterparty risk and the need for greater balance sheet efficiencies.  Equity
Products. Our equity products permit investors to obtain exposure, for hedging or speculative purposes, to changes in the weighting of one or more equity market sectors more efficiently than by buying or selling the underlying securities. By
allowing investors to effectively manage stock market risks, our equity products increase investor confidence and overall participation in these important markets.  We are a leading equity index marketplace, offering futures and options products (including our E-mini contracts) on key benchmark equity indexes covering small-, medium- and large-cap companies in the U.S., Europe and Asia. These include
the Standard & Poors, Dow Jones, NASDAQ, Nikkei, MSCI and FTSE/Xinhua indexes, and others. We have exclusive licensing arrangements with Standard & Poors Corporation (S&P), NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. (NASDAQ OMX) and
Dow Jones & Company, Inc. (Dow Jones), which allow us to offer futures and options on futures on their indexes, including our contracts based on the S&P 500 Index, the NASDAQ-100 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. For a
detailed description of these licensing arrangements, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Item 1. BusinessLicensing Agreements.

Trading in these products represented 31% of our total trading volume and 32% of our clearing and transaction fees during
2008.  We believe our leading market position in equity products is a result of the liquidity of our markets, the status of the S&P 500, the
NASDAQ-100 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes as the principal U.S. financial standards for benchmarking stock market returns, and the appeal to investors and traders of our E-mini products and other equity products and our CME Globex
platform. These investors include public and private pension funds, investment companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and other financial services companies that benchmark their investment performance to different segments of the equity
markets.  We believe future growth in our equity products will come from increased counterparty credit concerns, continued education of our customers as to
the benefits of our equity product portfolio to serve their risk management needs and the benefits of futures products over cash equities. We believe that our equity volumes may also be impacted by the trading volume levels of the underlying markets
as well as their level of volatility.  Foreign Exchange Products. We became the first exchange to introduce financial futures when we
launched foreign exchange futures in 1972. Our foreign exchange market serves as an effective and efficient means of risk transfer for the global foreign exchange market, bringing together a broad array of client segments by offering investment as
well as risk management opportunities. Our customers benefit from dealing anonymously in a fully transparent market, where large and small customers have equal access to the same prices and deep pool of liquidity. Our foreign exchange products
provide the tools and resources to hedge foreign exchange risk, facilitating cross-border trade and commerce while mitigating the risks to profitability due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. Our foreign exchange market attracts both
buy- and sell-side investors, including commercial and investment banks, hedge funds, commodity trading advisors, proprietary trading firms and individual investors. Approximately 95% of our foreign exchange products are traded electronically on the
CME Globex platform, ensuring that business is transacted quickly with maximum operational efficiency.  Today, we offer approximately 40 foreign exchange
futures and approximately 30 foreign exchange options on futures products, covering major as well as a broad array of emerging market currency pairs in more than 20 different currencies.  In 2008, we saw an average daily volume of 623,000 foreign exchange contracts per day, with a notional value of $84.5 billion a day. Trading in our foreign exchange products represented 5% of our total trading volume
in 2008 and 7% of our clearing and transaction fees.  We believe future growth in our foreign exchange product line will come from expanding and
diversifying our product suite and customer base. For example, trading in volatility-based options on six of our foreign exchange options began in March 2008. We are expanding our foreign exchange options product suite to appeal to a broader array
of customer segments, and we expect continued strong growth in the electronic execution of foreign exchange options on CME Globex in 2009. As we expand our global footprint in the foreign exchange market, we expect increased trading volume from
customers outside of the United States. We also expect an increased demand in the over-the-counter market for cleared products, which we are targeting. Firms, however, have reduced their foreign exchange trading volume in light of the current
economic conditions and consolidation within the industry.  Commodity and Alternative Investment Products. Our commodity products help
establish benchmark prices and play an important role in risk management. These products provide hedging tools for our customers who deal in tangible physical commodities, including agricultural producers of commodities, food processors and
consumers of energy. Commodity products were our only products when our exchange first opened for business. We have maintained a strong franchise in our commodity products, including futures contracts based on cattle, hogs, pork bellies, lumber,
dairy products, soybeans, corn, wheat, oats and rough rice. Following our acquisition of NYMEX, we also offer contracts based on crude oil, natural gas, heating oil, gasoline, copper and aluminum as well as other soft commodities. Our energy
products offer a way for producers, marketers and refiners to manage fuel price risk in a volatile, growing market faced with mounting regulatory and market pressures. In September 2008, we sold the CBOT metals trading complex to NYSE Euronext.
 We also provide our customers with non-traditional, alternative investment products to diversify and manage their risk. Our real estate products provide
opportunities for risk protection, and extend to the real estate industry the same financial tools that our previous innovations have brought to agriculture and finance. By providing a means of hedging exposure to real estate prices, customers can
diffuse the potential impact of sustained declines in real estate prices. We also are the only regulated exchange that offers risk management products on the weather market through our weather contracts based on aggregate temperatures in more than
40 cities around the world as well as hurricane, snowfall and frost indexes.  Commodity and alternative investment products accounted for 12% of our
trading volume and 23% of our clearing and transaction fees during 2008.

We continue to execute our strategy of growing our customer base and providing side-by-side access to our commodity
markets. We believe the changing perception of commodities as an asset class provides an opportunity for growth in our markets. We also anticipate growth in our energy products as a result of price volatility, increased use of CME ClearPort due to
credit concerns and continued enhancements to our product portfolio. However, we believe that increases in volume may be offset by the negative impact of the current economic situation.  Market Data and Information Products. Our markets generate valuable information regarding prices and trading activity in our products that we believe enhances the appeal of our products. The
dissemination of real-time data generates revenues and supports our customer base with timely market information. We sell our market data, which includes information about bids, offers, trades and trade size in our products, to banks,
broker-dealers, pension funds, investment companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, individual investors and other financial services companies or organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions. We distribute our
market data directly to our electronic trading customers as part of their access to our markets through our electronic facilities. We also distribute market data via dedicated networks to quote vendors who consolidate our market data with that from
other exchanges, other third party data providers and news services, and then resell their consolidated data. Revenues from market data products totaled $279.5 million, or 11% of our total revenues, in 2008.  Sophisticated quantitative approaches to risk management as well as customer time sensitivity have created new needs, uses and demands for trading-related data and
analytics. This timely information has become even more important in light of the volatility and uncertainty in todays markets. We continue to enhance our current market data and information product offerings by creating new value-added
services to complement our market data products, including databases, analytical tools and other services to assist end-users. In 2008, we launched the latest version of E-quotes, a real-time streaming market data application that offers quotes,
charting, advanced analytics and news on CME Group traded products. E-quotes will enable users to access prices for all CME Group listings. Additionally, to expand our market data product offerings, in 2008 we purchased CMA. CMA provides credit
market pricing data and intra-day services to increase productivity, efficiency and speed of transactions in the over-the-counter markets.  As part of our
market data and information products business, we also supply services to S&P and OneChicago, our joint venture with the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (CBOE) and Interactive Brokers Group, in connection with the usage reporting, contract
administration and associated billing and revenue collection for the display and integration of their market data into our standard market data distribution. We are the exclusive distributor of Dow Jones Index data from our market data distribution
platform. We also provide access to all prices for products listed on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange and the Kansas City Board of Trade, which are available for electronic trading on CME Globex.  We believe that there has been a decline in subscriptions of market data due primarily to the consolidation of many of our customers and related headcount reductions as
a result of the current financial crisis. For example, the number of subscriptions for devices for CME and CBOT market data combined decreased from 293,000 at December 31, 2007 to 290,000 December 31, 2008. To the extent that our customers
continue to consolidate, we could experience further declines in our market data revenues derived from such subscriptions. Products  STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px">We believe that the range and diversity of our products contribute significantly to our success.

Sixty percent of our overall annual trading volume in 2007 was based upon our interest rate products. The overall volume
of our interest rate product line was up 73% compared to 2006 primarily due to our merger with CBOT Holdings.  We intend to increase our revenues from our
interest rate product sector by leveraging cross marketing opportunities between CME and CBOT interest rate products, enhancing electronic liquidity in existing interest rate futures and options products, and extending into the execution and
clearing of over-the-counter U.S. dollar and non-dollar interest rate derivative products through our launch of CME Swaps on Swapstream.  Equity

These products are designed to address the growing demand for equity derivatives and
electronically traded products.  Our total trading volume for equity products rose 53% in 2007, to 667.9 million contracts. Trading in these products
represented 30% of our total trading volume during 2007.  We believe our leading market position in equity products is a result of the liquidity of our

In 2007, we saw an average daily volume of 569,000 foreign exchange contracts per day, with a notional value of $70.9
billion a day. Our total foreign exchange trading volume increased 27% in 2007, with a total of 144.0 million contracts traded during the year. Trading in our foreign exchange products represented 6% of our total trading volume in 2007. In
2007, electronically traded foreign exchange volume increased 33% over 2006 to 132.5 million contracts. Open outcry trading decreased 33% to 3.9 million contracts in 2007.  We believe future growth in our foreign exchange product line will come from expanding and diversifying our product suite and customer base. For example, trading in volatility-based options on six of our foreign
exchange options will begin in March 2008. We are expanding our foreign exchange options product suite to appeal to a broader array of customer segments, and we expect continued strong growth in the electronic execution of foreign exchange options
on CME Globex in 2008. As we expand our global footprint in the foreign exchange market, we expect increased trading volume from customers outside of the United States.  Commodity and Alternative Investment Products. Our commodity products help establish benchmark prices and play an important role in risk management for the agricultural community.

rough rice, gold and silver.  We also provide our customers with non-traditional, alternative investment products to diversify and manage their risk. Our
real estate products provide opportunities for protection in up and down markets, and extend to the real estate industry the same financial tools that our previous innovations have brought to agriculture and finance. By providing a means of hedging
exposure to real estate prices, customers can diffuse the potential impact of sustained declines in real estate prices. Our ethanol products offer a way for ethanol producers, ethanol marketers and gasoline refiners to limit alternative fuel price
risk in a highly volatile, growing market faced with mounting regulatory and market pressures. We also are the only regulated exchange that offers risk management products on the weather market through our weather contracts based on aggregate
temperatures in 35 cities around the world as well as hurricane, snowfall and frost indexes.  Commodity and alternative investment products accounted for
4% of our trading volume during 2007.  We continue to execute our strategy of growing our customer base and providing side-by-side access to our commodity
markets. We believe the changing perception of commodities as an asset class provides an opportunity for growth in our markets.  Market Data and
Information Products. Our markets generate valuable information regarding prices and trading activity in our products that we believe enhances the trading activity in our products. The dissemination of real-time data generates revenues and
supports our customer base with timely market information. We sell our market data, which includes information about bids, offers, trades and trade size in our products, to banks, broker-dealers, pension funds, investment companies, mutual funds,
insurance companies, individual investors and other financial services companies or organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions. We distribute our market data directly to our electronic trading customers as part of
their access to our markets through our electronic facilities. We also distribute market data via dedicated networks to quote vendors who consolidate our market data with that from other exchanges, other third party data providers and news services,
and then resell their consolidated data. Revenues from market data products totaled $145.1 million, or 8% of our total revenues, in 2007.  Sophisticated
quantitative approaches to risk management as well as customer time sensitivity have created new needs, uses and demands for trading-related data and analytics. We continue to enhance our current market data and information product offerings by
creating new value-added services to complement our market data products, including databases, analytical tools and other services to assist end-users. In October 2007, we launched our new Market Data Protocol named FIX/FAST. FIX/FAST is the most
recent step in our strategy to improve market data offerings in response to customer requests for faster and more efficient distribution of data. Combined with last years change to the Market Data Platform dissemination method, customers now
have the latest technology available for obtaining our market information and prices.  As part of our market data and information products business, we
also supply services to S&P and OneChicago, our joint venture with the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (CBOE) and Interactive Brokers Group, in connection with the usage reporting, contract administration and associated billing and revenue
collection for the display and integration of their market data into our standard market data distribution. We are also the exclusive distributor of Dow Jones Index data.

Products  STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px">We believe that the range and diversity of our products contribute significantly to our success. We offer markets in futures and options on futures contracts based on theU.S. interest rate yield curve, equity indexes, foreign exchange, agricultural and industrial commodities, energy and alternative investment products. Our products are traded through the CME Globex electronic trading platform, our open outcryauction markets or through privately negotiated transactions that we clear. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we derived $1.4 billion, or 81% of our total revenues, from fees associated with trading and clearing our products. These feesinclude per contract charges for trade execution, clearing and CME Globex fees. Fees are charged at various rates based on the product traded, the method of trade and the trading privileges of the customer making the trade. Generally, members arecharged lower fees than non-members. Certain of our customers benefit from volume discounts and limits on fees as part of our efforts to encourage increased liquidity in our markets. Our markets also generate valuable data and information regardingpricing and trading activity in our products. We identify new products by monitoring economic trends and their impact on the risk management and speculative needs of our existing and prospective customers. See Item 7. ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, page 59, for the average daily volume of contracts traded in our four principal product lines for the last two years.  STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px">Interest Rate Products. Our interest rate products enable banks and other financial institutions worldwide to hedge interest rate risks, and in turn helpto reduce the overall cost of borrowing and financing. Our interest rate products allow our customers to execute transactions across the entire U.S. dollar-denominated yield curve using some of the worlds most actively traded futures andoptions products. Customers may manage short-, medium- and long-term interest rate risk using our products based on Eurodollars, U.S. Treasuries, swaps and other dollar-related instruments. As a result of our acquisition of CBOT, our interest rateproducts include CBOTs thirty-year U.S. Treasury bond futures and options on futures and ten-year, five-year and two-year U.S. Treasury note futures and options. We also offer CME Credit Index Event Contracts, the first exchange-traded,centrally cleared and guaranteed product available in the U.S. credit derivatives market. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we added futures and options products based on the Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate Index, the preeminent benchmark debt indexfor U.S. investment-grade fixed income securities.    8 Table of Contents Sixty percent of our overall annual trading volume in 2007 was based upon our interest rate products. The overall volumeof our interest rate product line was up 73% compared to 2006 primarily due to our merger with CBOT Holdings.  We intend to increase our revenues from ourinterest rate product sector by leveraging cross marketing opportunities between CME and CBOT interest rate products, enhancing electronic liquidity in existing interest rate futures and options products, and extending into the execution andclearing of over-the-counter U.S. dollar and non-dollar interest rate derivative products through our launch of CME Swaps on Swapstream.  EquityProducts. Our equity products permit investors to obtain exposure, for hedging or speculative purposes, to a change in the weighting of one or more equity market sectors more efficiently than by buying or selling the underlying securities.By allowing investors to effectively manage stock market risks, our equity products increase investor confidence and overall participation in these important markets.  FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We are a leading equity index marketplace, offering futures and options products on key benchmark equity indexes covering small-, medium- and large-cap companies in the U.S., Europe and Asia. These include theStandard & Poors, Dow Jones, NASDAQ, Nikkei, MSCI and FTSE/Xinhua indexes, and others. We have exclusive licensing arrangements with Standard & Poors Corporation (S&P), The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (NASDAQ) and DowJones & Company, Inc. (Dow Jones), which allow us to offer futures and options on futures on their indexes, including our contracts based on the S&P 500 Index, the NASDAQ-100 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. For a detaileddescription of these licensing arrangements, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled Item 1. BusinessLicensing Agreements.  SIZE="2">We also offer E-mini contracts, which trade exclusively on our CME Globex platform and are one-fifth the size of their standard counterparts. These products are designed to address the growing demand for equity derivatives andelectronically traded products.  Our total trading volume for equity products rose 53% in 2007, to 667.9 million contracts. Trading in these productsrepresented 30% of our total trading volume during 2007.  We believe our leading market position in equity products is a result of the liquidity of ourmarkets, the status of the S&P 500, the NASDAQ-100 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes as the principal U.S. financial standards for benchmarking stock market returns, and the appeal to investors and traders of our E-mini productsand other equity products and our CME Globex platform. These investors include public and private pension funds, investment companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and other financial services companies that benchmark their investmentperformance to different segments of the equity markets.  We believe future growth in our equity products will come from expanding customer access to ourelectronic markets and enhancing the functionality of our CME Globex electronic platform to increase the electronic trading volume of our options on futures contracts as well as further educating the global marketplace on the benefits of theseproducts.  Foreign Exchange Products. We became the first exchange to introduce financial futures when we launched foreign exchange futuresin 1972. Our foreign exchange market serves as an effective and efficient means of risk transfer for the global foreign exchange market, bringing together a broad array of client segments by offering investment as well as risk managementopportunities. Our customers benefit from dealing anonymously in a fully transparent market, where large and small customers have equal access to the same prices and deep pool of liquidity. Our foreign exchange products provide the tools andresources to hedge foreign exchange risk, facilitating cross-border trade and commerce while mitigating the risks to profitability due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. Our foreign exchange market attracts both buy- and sell-sideinvestors, including commercial and investment banks, hedge funds, commodity trading advisors, proprietary trading firms and individual investors. Approximately 92% of our foreign exchange products are traded electronically on the CME Globexplatform, ensuring that business is transacted quickly with maximum operational efficiency.  Today, we offer approximately 40 foreign exchange futures andapproximately 30 foreign exchange options on futures products, covering major as well as a broad array of emerging market currency pairs in the following currencies: Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar,New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona, Czech koruna, Hungarian forint, Polish zloty, Russian ruble, South African rand, Israeli shekel, Korean won, and Chinese renminbi.  STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">  9 Table of Contents In 2007, we saw an average daily volume of 569,000 foreign exchange contracts per day, with a notional value of $70.9billion a day. Our total foreign exchange trading volume increased 27% in 2007, with a total of 144.0 million contracts traded during the year. Trading in our foreign exchange products represented 6% of our total trading volume in 2007. In2007, electronically traded foreign exchange volume increased 33% over 2006 to 132.5 million contracts. Open outcry trading decreased 33% to 3.9 million contracts in 2007.  FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We believe future growth in our foreign exchange product line will come from expanding and diversifying our product suite and customer base. For example, trading in volatility-based options on six of our foreignexchange options will begin in March 2008. We are expanding our foreign exchange options product suite to appeal to a broader array of customer segments, and we expect continued strong growth in the electronic execution of foreign exchange optionson CME Globex in 2008. As we expand our global footprint in the foreign exchange market, we expect increased trading volume from customers outside of the United States.  FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Commodity and Alternative Investment Products. Our commodity products help establish benchmark prices and play an important role in risk management for the agricultural community. These products providehedging tools for our customers who deal in tangible physical commodities, including agricultural producers of commodities and food processors.

We have maintaineda strong franchise in our commodity products, including futures contracts based on cattle, hogs, pork bellies, lumber and dairy products and, now as a result of our acquisition of CBOT, have added contracts based on soybeans, corn, wheat, oats,rough rice, gold and silver.

CME Group Inc. (Chicago Mercantile Exchange & Chicago Board of Trade) is an American financial market company operating the world's largest options and futures exchange. It owns and operates large derivatives and futures exchanges in Chicago, New York City, and exchange facilities in London, using online trading platforms.[3][4] It also owns the Dow Jones stock and financial indexes, and CME Clearing Services, which provides settlement and clearing of exchange trades. The exchange-traded derivative contracts include futures and options based on interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange, energy, agricultural commodities, rare and precious metals, weather, and real estate.[5] It has been described by The Economist as "The biggest financial exchange you have never heard of."[6]
The corporate world headquarters are in Chicago in The Loop. The corporation was formed by the 2007 merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). On March 17, 2008, CME Group announced it had acquired NYMEX Holdings, Inc., the parent company of the New York Mercantile Exchange and Commodity Exchange, Inc (COMEX). The acquisition was formally completed on August 22, 2008.[7] The four exchanges now operate as designated contract markets (DCM) of the CME Group.[8]
On February 10, 2010, CME announced its purchase of 90% of Dow Jones Indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[9] Dow Jones Indexes subsequently became S&P Dow Jones Indices, in which CME has a 24.4% ownership interest.[10]
On October 17, 2012, CME announced it was acquiring the Kansas City Board of Trade for $126 Million in cash. KCBOT is the dominant venue for the sale of hard red winter wheat. The Chicago Board of Trade is the leading trade platform for soft red winter wheat.[11]

CME Group Inc. (Chicago Mercantile Exchange & Chicago Board of Trade) is an American financial market company operating the world's largest options and futures exchange. It owns and operates large derivatives and futures exchanges in Chicago, New York City, and exchange facilities in London, using online trading platforms.[3][4] It also owns the Dow Jones stock and financial indexes, and CME Clearing Services, which provides settlement and clearing of exchange trades. The exchange-traded derivative contracts include futures and options based on interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange, energy, agricultural commodities, rare and precious metals, weather, and real estate.[5] It has been described by The Economist as "The biggest financial exchange you have never heard of."[6]
The corporate world headquarters are in Chicago in The Loop. The corporation was formed by the 2007 merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). On March 17, 2008, CME Group announced it had acquired NYMEX Holdings, Inc., the parent company of the New York Mercantile Exchange and Commodity Exchange, Inc (COMEX). The acquisition was formally completed on August 22, 2008.[7] The four exchanges now operate as designated contract markets (DCM) of the CME Group.[8]
On February 10, 2010, CME announced its purchase of 90% of Dow Jones Indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[9] Dow Jones Indexes subsequently became S&P Dow Jones Indices, in which CME has a 24.4% ownership interest.[10]
On October 17, 2012, CME announced it was acquiring the Kansas City Board of Trade for $126 Million in cash. KCBOT is the dominant venue for the sale of hard red winter wheat. The Chicago Board of Trade is the leading trade platform for soft red winter wheat.[11]

CME Group Inc. (Chicago Mercantile Exchange & Chicago Board of Trade) is an American financial market company operating the world's largest options and futures exchange. It owns and operates large derivatives and futures exchanges in Chicago, New York City, and exchange facilities in London, using online trading platforms.[3][4] It also owns the Dow Jones stock and financial indexes, and CME Clearing Services, which provides settlement and clearing of exchange trades. The exchange-traded derivative contracts include futures and options based on interest rates, equity indexes, foreign exchange, energy, agricultural commodities, rare and precious metals, weather, and real estate.[5] It has been described by The Economist as "The biggest financial exchange you have never heard of."[6]
The corporate world headquarters are in Chicago in The Loop. The corporation was formed by the 2007 merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). On March 17, 2008, CME Group announced it had acquired NYMEX Holdings, Inc., the parent company of the New York Mercantile Exchange and Commodity Exchange, Inc (COMEX). The acquisition was formally completed on August 22, 2008.[7] The four exchanges now operate as designated contract markets (DCM) of the CME Group.[8]
On February 10, 2010, CME announced its purchase of 90% of Dow Jones Indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[9] Dow Jones Indexes subsequently became S&P Dow Jones Indices, in which CME has a 24.4% ownership interest.[10]
On October 17, 2012, CME announced it was acquiring the Kansas City Board of Trade for $126 Million in cash. KCBOT is the dominant venue for the sale of hard red winter wheat. The Chicago Board of Trade is the leading trade platform for soft red winter wheat.[11]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
