 Educational Background



BA 


The University of Chicago

                  The University of Chicago's Office of Investments (COI) is responsible for managing the University's investment assets, which includes overseeing the endowment to ensure that it benefits both current and future generations of the University of Chicago. COI oversees the broad investment strategy and provides input to the development of the strategic and tactical investment policies of the University & UCMC endowments, pension plans and self-insurance trust assets. Their strategy combines qualitative and quantitative analysis, seeking to achieve superior investment performance on a risk-adjusted basis. COI's approach seeks to evaluate the investment strategy as an integrated part of the operating plans of the University rather than in isolation and focuses the the University's overall success, not investment returns. The endowment is well-diversified across a variety of asset classes, including global stocks and bonds, real estate, natural resources, private equity, absolute return strategies and protection (tail-hedging strategies). Asset class exposure is achieved primarily by selecting and engaging external managers. COI manages the global macro and the overlay portfolio to ensure that the portfolio’s overall positioning is compliance with the endowment's investment guidelines. COI's strategies for investing in the public markets include: Absolute Return, Private Debt, Fixed Income and Credit. and Global Equities. COI's real assets team invests globally in real estate and natural resources using outside managers. The real estate portfolio invests globally in value-added and opportunistic strategies using both private partnerships and public vehicles. The natural resources portfolio invests globally in strategies that include, but are not limited to: oil and gas exploration & production; power generation; infrastructure; timber; mining and minerals; and agriculture.                




MBA 


University of Chicago - Booth School of Business

                  The University of Chicago Booth School of Business is a graduate business school located in Chicago, Illinois, at the University of Chicago.

The school was renamed in 2008 following a $300 million endowment gift to the school by alumnus David G. Booth. The school has the third-largest endowment of any business school.

The school's flagship campus is located in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago on the main campus of the university. The school also maintains additional campuses in London and Asia (originally Singapore, but in July 2013 a move to Hong Kong was announced), as well as in downtown Chicago on the Magnificent Mile. In addition to conducting graduate business programs, the school conducts research in the fields of finance, economics, quantitative marketing research, and accounting. Chicago Booth is currently ranked first in the United States by Bloomberg Businessweek and first globally by the Economist.

Our Firm
Keenan Cohen & Merrick P.C. represents railroads, motor carriers, and logistics companies in connection with commercial transportation litigation and contract issues, and is one of the most respected transportation law practices in the country.
At any given time we may be representing our clients’ interests in connection with a derailment in Indiana, a demurrage dispute in Virginia, a high value freight loss in New Jersey, a bridge strike in Illinois, a contract dispute in Texas, or pursuing a fraud claim in New York.  Our attorneys are focused solely on advancing and protecting the interests of our transportation clients nationwide.  KCM has a well earned reputation in the freight industry, and has been recognized in Corporate Counsel Magazine as a Go-To Law Firm named both by Norfolk Southern and CSX Transportation.
While some clients seek representation by only the largest law firms, it is not the size of any law firm that assures the best result for a client, it is the personal knowledge and experience of the firm’s attorneys with respect to what is at issue.  As a firm focused exclusively on freight transportation issues, KCM provides cost effective representation with neither expensive overhead nor the burdensome conflicts that large firms impose on their clients.
Prospective clients are encouraged to review our work product by way of reported court rulings favorable to our transportation clients in cases decided by dozens of U.S. District Courts and U.S. Courts of Appeal.  Please review the descriptions of our practice areas and attorneys for additional information.  Should you have any questions, we look forward to hearing from you.

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. Keenan, Jeffrey A, MD11126 Kingston PikeKnoxville, TN 37934(865) 777-0088Skin CareWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. DR Jeffrey A Keenan MD Facog - CLOSED10820 Parkside DrKnoxville, TN 37934Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Schlactus Jeffrey L MD1450 Dowell Springs BlvdKnoxville, TN 37909(865) 584-2071Physicians & SurgeonsSkin CareWebsiteServicesBusinesses in related categories to Skin CareAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collectionPREFERRED4. Dermatology Associates Of Knoxville PC(1)BBB Rating: A939 east emerald ave suite 705Knoxville, TN 37917(865) 524-2547Skin CareLasersLab Equipment & SuppliesWebsiteDirectionsMore InfoMake an AppointmentMy appointment was for at 8:00 am and I STILL waited 30 minutes because the doctor was late.
