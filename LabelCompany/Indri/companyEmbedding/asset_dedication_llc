What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Turnkey asset management for financial planners
We align investments with each client’s financial plan and handle the reporting, billing, account aggregation, and white-labeled client portals so that you can focus on what matters most.
 
Meet with a Team Member
 
 

 
 
 
 



Customized strategies to fit each client’s plan
 
 
 




Intelligent Laddering
When your client wants to fund future spending needs with income investments, we use our proprietary system to find municipal bonds, corporate bonds, CDs and/or agencies that match their spending needs.
Learn more…
 
 
 



Growth Time Targeting
Since most clients cannot afford to fund their lifetime spending needs with fixed income, we built growth portfolios that use game theory algorithms that seek to improve a client’s probability of reaching a time-based goal.
Learn more…
 
 
 



Principal Protection
When your client wants to protect their principal and reduce their exposure to rising interest rates, we look for investment grade income securities that are at advantageous spots along the yield curve and hold them until maturity.
Learn more…
 
 
 



Lifetime Investing
Using your client’s projected spending needs and portfolio mix, we can provide historical context to their investments by showing how the portfolio’s underlying asset class performed during every relevant rolling time-horizon going back to 1928.
Learn more…
 
 
 
 
 



Back office and technology solutions included with every account
Any account that we manage will enjoy account aggregation, billing, reporting and technology services at no additional charge. Those accounts we do not manage can also enjoy these benefits for a quarterly fee.
Learn more…
 
 

 
 
 



Portfolios Managed to a Higher Standard
We understand that the way a portfolio is implemented and maintained can have a significant impact on long-term returns, so we’ve established some best practices. Click on each to learn more.
 
 
 


Tax Efficient Fund Usage

Whenever possible, we seek to reduce the client’s tax liability by using the most tax-efficient versions of the desired funds.
 
 
Capital Gains Sensitivity

We incorporate legacy positions into our model until you and your client are ready to strategically realize the gains or cut emotional ties with a certain security.
 
 
Transaction Fee Minimization

For each Dimensional fund that we use, we found the most highly correlated, no-transaction fee fund at Schwab, Fidelity and TD Ameritrade. Then we compared the expense ratios, transaction fees, geographic deviations, and asset class deviations to calculate a minimum trade threshold for every security at each custodian. By doing so, we can put smaller contributions to work without the unnecessary transaction fees.
 
 
 

Bond Downgrade Tracking

If one of the major rating agencies downgrade a fixed income security held in one of your clients’ portfolios, we notify you with a recommendation.
 
 
Holistic Trading

When we implement a portfolio, we look to reduce trading costs by implementing across the household. Additionally, we seek to build around external assets such as 401K accounts, so that the client has a holistic portfolio.
 
 
Tactical Rebalancing

We understand that the cost of rebalancing often outweighs the benefit of doing so. Therefore, we utilize tolerance bands and minimum trade thresholds for each security.
 
 
 

Cash Monitoring

We monitor the cash levels in each account and either notify you, invest, or raise cash in accordance with the settings you defined in the investment policy statement.
 
 
Tax Aware Asset Location

Unless told otherwise, we will place less tax-efficient assets, such as bonds, in tax-deferred retirement accounts and more tax-efficient assets, such as stocks, in taxable accounts. By leveraging these asset location preferences, we can potentially reduce an investor’s tax liability.
 
 
Low-cost Securities

Unlike the industry simple-average equity fund expense ratio of 1.37%, the simple-average expense ratio of the equity funds that Asset Dedication uses is .33%. In addition, we often use individual fixed income securities that don’t carry expense ratios.
Industry simple-average equity fund expense ratio source: Investment Company Institute® | 2014 Investment Company Fact Book

About Us


 



The early mission of Asset Dedication grew out of a research project at the University of San Francisco’s School of Business in the late 1990’s. Its focus was to engineer retirement income portfolios for individual investors using the liability-driven method of investing that is common within the institutional world. From this research emerged a concept and process for balancing the risks of volatility and longevity through a goals and time-based approach to asset allocation. The cornerstone of this idea is using individual bonds to match a retiree’s income stream. Since 1999, Asset Dedication has evolved into a turnkey asset management platform for financial planners across the country.
The Evolution of Asset Dedication
1999 – At the University of San Francisco’s School of Business, Stephen J. Huxley and Brent Burns began researching how to engineer retirement income portfolios for individual investors using the liability-driven method of investing.
2002 – Asset Dedication registered as an investment advisor.
2004 – Huxley and Burns co-authored a book entitled Asset Dedication, which described the strategy and was published by McGraw-Hill.
2007 – Established relationships with various custodial firms and began directly managing assets for clients.
2010 – Began offering portfolio solutions to investment advisers via separately managed accounts.
2012 – Started offering turnkey asset management services to financial planners.

Stephen is a tenured Professor of Decision Sciences at the University of San Francisco, where he has taught in the School of Business and Management since 1973. His courses include Data Analysis, Decision Modeling, and Operations Management at the graduate and undergraduate level.

He first applied his scheduling research to the construction of investment strategies in the late 1990’s. This work ultimately led to the book Asset Dedication: How to Grow Wealthy with the Next Generation of Asset Allocation (McGraw-Hill, 2004), which he co-authored with Brent Burns. Stephen holds a doctorate in economics from the University of California at San Diego and an undergraduate degree in business and statistics from Ohio State University.

What is the Asset Dedication Strategy?


 



The Asset Dedication Strategy was designed to match investments to each client’s financial plan. Starting with their goals, cash flow needs and time-horizon, we create a customized portfolio that seeks to provide pension-like predictable cash flows and then growth that will supplement their income in later years.
 
Meet with a team member
 
 






 
 
 
 


How does the Asset Dedication Strategy work?


 



Step 1: Secure future cash flow needs
Whether a client is saving for a down payment on their first home, preparing for their initial years of retirement, or looking to protect their principal for another cash flow need, they should have investments that can help them fulfill those needs, regardless of how the market reacts. Given this, we purchase fixed income securities to generate the specific cash flow when it’s needed most.  Learn More…
 
 
 




Predictable Cash Flows
 
 
 



Principal Protection
 
 
 



Rising Interest Rate Management
 
 
 
 
 



Step 2: Align growth investments with time-based goals
The market has repeatedly shown us that the longer you remain invested in equities, the greater your chance of seeing higher returns. However, most investors cannot afford to leave their equity investments in the market forever. We build growth portfolios that use game-theory algorithms that seek to improve a client’s probability of reaching a time-based goal by maximizing minimum returns. Learn More…

Risk-aligned diversification
 
 
 



Maximized minimum returns
 
 
 
 
 



Step 3: Monitor and adjust the portfolio so that it lasts a lifetime
Most clients contemplate adjusting their financial plans over time, but are unsure how any changes will impact their long-term goals. Given this, we created a decision making framework and reporting system, the Critical Path, that intuitively reflects the progress an investor’s defined income portfolio and growth portfolio are making towards the goals laid out in their financial plan. It also outlines what certain adjustments will do to their probabilities of success during every rolling period dating back to the Great Depression. Click here to learn more…

Critical Path® System


 



Guiding portfolios to last a lifetime
The Critical Path® is a decision making framework and reporting system that intuitively reflects the progress that an investor’s portfolio is making towards a specific goal or their projected lifetime spending needs.
 
Meet with a team member
 
 

 
 
 



How we build a client’s Critical Path®
 
 
 
 



Step 1: Collect financial planning information
Since the Critical Path acts as the vehicle to display a portfolio in the context of the financial plan, we first need to collect the core financial planning information. Some pieces of information include:

Age
Goal and the goal’s time horizon
Investable assets
Net desired cash flows desired
Net desired cash flows to purchase today

Step 2: See if the plan stands the test of time
Using the financial planning data that you provide, we create the client’s Critical Path, run a historical audit and provide the historical probabilities of success for the proposed financial plan and investments. By showing investments in the context of the financial plan, the feasibility of the client’s goals are shown in a historically significant manner, which may allow you to keep, or get your client on track.
Below are some charts and tables that we typically include in our Critical Path proposals.
 

Historical Portfolio AuditProbability of Success Table




In each proposal, our goal is to show you if your client’s proposed portfolio is realistic or if planning changes need to be made. To show how realistic the proposed financial plan may be, we create the chart shown. In the chart, the white dotted line shows what needs to happen for your client to meet their goals, and the yellow lines show how a representative strategy performed during every longevity-matched period going back to 1927.
For scenarios that fall short in the chart, no adjustments (like reducing withdrawals or changing asset allocation) were made to prevent early depletion. As part of the client’s annual Critical Path review, we provide you with recommendations to help keep your clients on track to meet their financial goals.

 Chart Disclosures
The chart uses historical index data from a number of providers to create a historical audit for a sample client’s portfolio. 
An historical audit is a method for back-testing performance with the benefit of hindsight. Back-tested performance is provided for informational purposes only and does not represent actual performance. It is strictly hypothetical. Actual performance may have been materially lower and future performance may be materially lower. Results also do not reflect actual trading and market factors that could have impacted a client’s or Asset Dedication’s decision-making process. 
No matter how positive historical audits have been over any time period, the potential for loss is always present due to factors which may not be accounted for in the historical audit. The nature of a back-tested audit creates the potential for a financial professional to select superior performance results in order to get the desired audit results.
The dataset range is 1927 to 2013. The primary sources are: Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP), Fama/French Research Database, Dimensional Fund Advisors, MSCI, Ibbotson Associates and Global Financial Data. Some datasets have been extended using multiple regression analysis.

 
To further show how realistic the proposed financial plan may be, we include this table to show the expected returns for the proposed portfolio and the corresponding probabilities of success over all longevity-matched time-spans back to 1927 and 1947.
By looking at returns during the dawn of the Great Depression and the Post World War II era, our goal is to provide you and your client’s with more perspective into the potential longevity of the proposed portfolio.
 
 
 
Step 3: Invest to the financial plan
Once you and your client have defined the client’s Critical Path, we begin investing with the goal of delivering a representative portfolio. Below is an example of how we may have implemented a client’s portfolio.
 

Predictably match income needsTime-align equities with income securities



 Before building the growth portfolio, we purchase fixed-maturity income securities that match the client’s projected account-specific spending needs. Doing so, our goal is to protect principal and give the client flexibility to ride through down markets without having to sell their growth securities at a discount. Click here to learn more about the income portfolio.
The table shows securities that we may have purchased in an attempt to match cash flows to a client’s future spending needs. .

The table is being shown for illustrative purposes only. We sourced the securities listed in the table on 10/19/2014. Because the fixed income market is constantly changing, the securities used to create this table should not be interpreted as representative of the current fixed income market. The projected cash flows do not represent a guarantee. Individual fixed income securities have the potential for default. Each security is assumed to be held to maturity. Individual securities reflect yield to maturity. Yield calculations for Inflation-Indexed securities include an assumption for future inflation.
 
We typically time-align a client’s Income Portfolio with their Growth Portfolio with the goal of improving the client’s probability of reaching their time-based goals.
For example, if a client has income securities that are projected to meet the next ten years of their spending needs, we may purchase a growth portfolio that is designed to maximize their minimum returns over a 7-15 year time horizon.

Chart Disclosures
The chart uses historical index data from a number of providers to create a historical audit of the S&P 500 and the weighted underlying asset classes that Asset Dedication attempts to replicate in the 7-15 year time-targeted portfolio. An historical audit is a method for back-testing performance with the benefit of hindsight. Back-tested performance is provided for informational purposes only and does not represent actual performance. It is strictly hypothetical. Actual performance may have been materially lower and future performance may be materially lower. Results also do not reflect actual trading and market factors that could have impacted a client’s or Asset Dedication’s decision-making process. No matter how positive historical audits have been over any time period, the potential for loss is always present due to factors which may not be accounted for in the historical audit. The nature of a back-tested audit creates the potential for a financial professional to select superior performance results in order to get the desired audit results. The dataset range is 1927 to 2013. The primary sources are: Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP), Fama/French Research Database, Dimensional Fund Advisors, MSCI, Ibbotson Associates and Global Financial Data. Some datasets have been extended using multiple regression analysis.

 
 
 
Step 4: Navigate market swings and planning changes
After implementing the portfolio, we send you an annual Critical Path report that shows where the client is relative to their Critical Path along with recommendations that are intended to improve the financial plan’s probability of success.
If your client is thinking about making a change to their financial plan, we can create a modified Critical Path that shows the potential impact that the proposed change may have on their ability to meet their long-term planning goals. By showing the potential impact of any proposed changes, the Critical Path® may allow you to understand if your client can adopt the proposed change while maintaining the integrity of their long-term planning goals.

Defined Income Portfolio


 



Fund Spending Needs Precisely, Predictably and Flexibly
The defined income portfolio is engineered to cost-effectively protect principal and reduce exposure to rising interest rates while precisely matching fixed income securities to spending needs or finding advantageous spots along the yield curve.

Target vs. Projected Cash FlowsUnderlying Securities




The chart above shows how we may have implemented a defined income portfolio in an attempt to match investments to a client’s future spending needs.
Disclosures
The chart above is intended for illustrative purposes only. The securities used to create the projected cash flow columns were sourced on 10/19/2014 and are listed in the underlying securities tab. Because the fixed income market is constantly changing, the securities used to create this table should not be interpreted as representative of the current fixed income market. The projected cash flows do not represent a guarantee. Individual fixed income securities have the potential for default. Each security is assumed to be held to maturity. Individual securities reflect yield to maturity. Yield calculations for Inflation-Indexed securities include an assumption for future inflation.

Potential Benefits of the Defined Income Portfolio
 
 
 




Cash Flow Matching
We understand that accounts may have unique cash flow needs and may benefit by holding different fixed-maturity securities. Given this, we engineer the portfolio to match the specific cash flows that your client desires with the fixed-maturity securities that you define.
 
 
 



Flexibility
We build each client’s portfolio with fixed-maturity securities so that they have the flexibility to change their portfolio as their financial plan evolves. This is in contrast to annuities and other income-producing products that have surrender charges and fees that may restrict your clients.
 
 
 
 




Rising Interest Rate Management
We manage rising interest rates by purchasing fixed-maturity securities, and holding them until they mature. This gives us a secure advantage in long-term planning over bond funds that must sell their performing bonds when interest rates rise, and rely on chance to keep yields attractive.
 
 
 



Principal Protection
We believe it is essential to protect the principal for anyone who will rely on their fixed-income investments for spending needs. To deliver predictability, we hold investment-grade fixed maturity securities to maturity, so that your clients can effectively lock-in their principal investment while generating yield along the way.
 
 
 
 
 



Implementing the Income Portfolio
Watch Professor Huxley and Brent Burns meet with the American College to dig into the research behind the defined income portfolio. Enjoy!

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
