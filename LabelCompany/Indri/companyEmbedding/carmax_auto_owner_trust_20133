      Fitch Rates CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2013-3
    





August 08, 2013 03:11 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to CarMax Auto Owner Trust 
      2013-3:
    

      --$178,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$321,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$308,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$128,500,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24,500,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22,000,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$18,000,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: 2013-3 has consistent credit quality compared 
      to recent 2013 pools. The weighted average FICO score is 700 with 
      consistent internal credit tiers, while vehicle age, condition and LTV's 
      are slightly above recent 2013 pools.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on CarMax Auto 
      Finance's (CAF) portfolio and 2009-2012 securitizations have declined in 
      recent years due to stronger quality originations and elevated used 
      vehicle values, which have supported higher recovery rates.
    

      Higher Credit Enhancement: The cash flow distribution in 2013-3 is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) in 2013-3 
      for the class A notes totals 6.70%, up from 5.70% in 2013-2 and 2013-1. 
      CE is adequate to cover Fitch's base case loss coverage levels.
    

      Unstable Macroeconomic Conditions: A slower recovery and potential for 
      volatility could affect delinquencies and losses. Fitch's analysis 
      accounts for this risk by including poorer performing vintages from the 
      recent recession in the base case loss analysis.
    

      Stable Origination, Underwriting and Servicing Platform: Fitch believes 
      CAF demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and 
      servicer to service 2013-3.
    

      Integrity of the Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of CAF would not impair the timeliness 
      of the payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to each class of 
      CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2013-3 to increased losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that each class of notes displays 
      some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing potential 
      downgrades of one category under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) 
      scenario. Each class of notes could experience downgrades of up to three 
      rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report.

Fitch Upgrades One and Affirms Four Classes of CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2013-3 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Upgrades One and Affirms Four Classes of CarMax Auto Owner Trust 
      2013-3
    





June 13, 2016 11:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings has upgraded one and 
      affirmed four outstanding classes of the CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2013-3. 
      A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating upgrades and affirmations are based on available credit 
      enhancement (CE) and loss performance. The collateral pool continues to 
      perform within Fitch's expectations. Based on the current structure and 
      CE, the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent 
      with the assigned ratings and make full payments to investors in 
      accordance with the terms of the documents.
    

      The ratings reflect the quality of CarMax Business Services, LLC's 
      retail auto loan originations, the strength of its servicing 
      capabilities, and the sound financial and legal structure of the 
      transactions.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited strong 
      performance with losses well within Fitch's initial expectations with 
      rising loss coverage and multiple levels. Therefore, a material 
      deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool 
      to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has taken the following rating actions:
    

      CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2013-3
    

      --Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class C upgraded to 'AAAsf' from 'AAsf'; Outlook to Stable from 
      Positive;
    

      --Class D affirmed at 'BBBsf'; Outlook to Positive from Stable.

Third-Party Auto Sites Continue to Lag Behind Manufacturer Sites in Overall Look and Feel


 






TrueCar Ranks Highest among Third-Party Automotive Websites, Followed by CARFAX and Cars.comNew York: 24 March 2016 — Third-party automotive websites are improving satisfaction by capturing the attention of car shoppers through increased use of the visual Web and its streamlined approach to site navigation, according to the J.D. Power 2016 Third-Party Automotive Website Evaluation Study,SM released today.The study, now in its fourth year, measures the usefulness of automotive third-party websites during the new- and used-vehicle shopping process by examining four key measures (in order of importance): information/content; appearance; navigation; and speed. Satisfaction is measured on a 1,000-point scale.While the impact of appearance on third-party auto website satisfaction has increased at a steady pace to 24% in 2016 from 21% in 2013, there exists a significant 83-point gap in satisfaction between third-party sites and manufacturer (OEM[1]) sites (742 vs. 825, respectively).  Appearance is the highest-scoring measure for auto manufacturer sites and second lowest for third-party sites.“The common bond among top-performing third-party auto sites is a heavy reliance on the ‘visual Web,’ with its very streamlined, easy-to-use site navigation features,” said Arianne Walker, senior director of marketing analytics at J.D. Power. “Expectations continue to increase not only because auto manufacturers have such visually stimulating sites but because websites in many categories have focused on enhancing visual aesthetics and easy navigation. If third-party sites want to maintain and increase their usage among shoppers, they need to consider the impact appearance has on satisfaction and continually work to improve the look and feel of the website to keep up with the ever changing expectations of shoppers.”Following are the key findings of the 2016 study:Visual Web Influences Site Preference: The study finds that the highest-scoring third-party auto websites employ heavy use of visual Web design elements such as edge-to-edge imagery, cleaner spacing and aesthetically pleasing call-to-action colors.Expert Reviews Must Cover the Basics: Content is king when it comes to satisfying shoppers on third-party sites, which includes ratings and reviews. Shoppers indicate the most important content to cover in an expert review is safety (38%), performance (24%) and functionality (11%).Satisfaction Drives Loyalty and Advocacy: The study finds that 83% of highly satisfied shoppers (overall satisfaction scores of 901 or higher) using third-party websites say they “definitely will” return to the website in the future, and 81% say they “definitely will” recommend the site, while only 3% of displeased shoppers (scores of 500 or less) say they “definitely will” return and only 2% say they “definitely will” recommend.Study RankingsIn 2016, overall satisfaction with automotive third-party websites averages 751. TrueCar ranks highest (795), followed by CARFAX (793) and Cars.com (775).The 2016 Third-Party Automotive Website Evaluation Study is based on evaluations from more than 5,000 new- and used-vehicle shoppers who indicate they will be in the market for a vehicle within the next 24 months. The study was fielded in January 2016.Websites evaluated in the study were selected based on meeting the following criteria: must be an automotive third-party site; have the ability for consumers to shop for both new and used vehicles; and be among the most frequently visited sites based on behavioral data.Media Relations ContactsJohn Tews; Troy, Mich.; (248) 680-6218; media.relations@jdpa.comFor more information about the 2016 Third-Party Automotive Website Evaluation Study, visit http://www.jdpower.com/resource/us-third-party-automotive-website-evaluation-studySee the online Press Release at http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2016-third-party-automotive-website-evaluation-studyAbout J.D.
