 LINEAR
TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION

ROBERT C. DOBKIN EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENT

This Agreement is made by and
between Linear Technology Corporation (the “Company”)
and Robert C. Dobkin (“Executive”).






1. Duties and Scope of Employment
.









(a) Position; Agreement Commencement Date;
Duties .  Executive’s coverage under this
Agreement shall commence upon the date this Agreement has been
signed by both parties hereto (the “Agreement Commencement
Date”).  Following the Agreement Commencement Date,
Executive shall continue to serve as Vice President, Engineering
and Chief Technical Officer, reporting to the Chief Executive
Officer.  The period of Executive’s employment
hereunder is referred to herein as the “Employment
Term.”  During the Employment Term, Executive shall
render such business and professional services in the performance
of his duties, consistent with Executive’s position within
the Company, as shall reasonably be assigned to him by the Chief
Executive Officer.




 





(b)
Obligations .  During the Employment Term, Executive
shall devote his full business efforts and time to the
Company.  Executive agrees, during the Employment Term,
not to actively engage in any other employment, occupation or
consulting activity for any direct or indirect remuneration without
the prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Company (the
“Board”);  provided, however, that Executive
may serve in any capacity with any civic, educational or charitable
organization, or as a member of corporate Boards of Directors or
committees thereof, without the approval of the Board, unless such
service involves a conflict of interest with the Company’s
business.









(c)
Employee Benefits .  During the Employment Term, Executive
shall be eligible to participate in the employee benefit plans
maintained by the Company that are applicable to other senior
management to the full extent provided for under those
plans.




 





2. At-Will Employment .  Executive and the Company understand and
acknowledge that Executive’s employment with the Company
constitutes “at-will” employment.  Subject to
the Company’s obligation to provide severance benefits as
specified herein, Executive and the Company acknowledge that this
employment relationship may be terminated at any time, upon written
notice to the other party, with or without good cause or for any or
no cause, at the option either of the Company or
Executive.









3.
Compensation .




 





(a) Base Salary .  While employed by the Company, the
Company shall pay the Executive as compensation for his services a
base salary at the annualized rate of $280,000   (the
“Base Salary”).  Such salary shall be paid
periodically in accordance with normal Company payroll practices
and subject to the usual, required
withholding.  Executive’s Base Salary shall be
reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee of the Board for
possible adjustments in light of Executive’s performance and
competitive data.









(b)
Bonuses .  Executive shall be eligible to earn a
target bonus under the Company’s 1996 Senior Executive Bonus
Plan as specified annually by the Compensation Committee of the
Board and will also be eligible to participate in the Key Employee
Incentive Bonus Plan (the target amounts under these plans, added
together, are referred to herein as the “Target
Bonus”).




 





(c)
Severance Prior to a Change of Control
.  If, at any time prior to a
Change of Control (as defined herein), Executive’s employment
with the Company terminates due to (i) a voluntary termination for
“Good Reason” (as defined herein) where the grounds for
the Good Reason are not cured by the Company within 90 days
following receipt of written notice specifying the grounds from
Executive, or (ii) an involuntary termination by the Company other
than for “Cause” (as defined herein), then, subject to
Executive executing and not revoking a standard form of mutual
release of claims with the Company and not breaching the terms of
Section 11 hereof, (i) all of Executive’s Company stock
options and restricted stock shall immediately accelerate vesting
as to the amount of shares as would have vested had Executive
remained employed by the Company an additional six months,
(ii) Executive shall





 




receive continued
payments of six month’s Base Salary plus 50% of his Target
Bonus, less applicable withholding, in accordance with the
Company’s standard payroll practices (the “Severance
Payment”), (iii) the Company shall pay the group health
and dental plan continuation coverage premiums for Executive and
his covered dependents under Title X of the Consolidated Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (“COBRA”) for
the lesser of (A) six (6) months from the date of
Executive’s termination of employment, or (B) the date
upon which Executive and his covered dependents are covered by
similar plans of Executive’s new employer (the “COBRA
Coverage”).





For purposes of this
Agreement, “Cause” shall mean (i) an act of
personal dishonesty taken by Executive in connection with his
responsibilities as an employee and intended to result in
substantial personal enrichment of Executive, (ii) Executive
being convicted of, or plea of nolo   contendere
to, a felony, (iii) a willful act by Executive which
constitutes gross misconduct and which is injurious to the Company,
(iv) following delivery to Executive of a written demand for
performance from the Company which describes the basis for the
Company’s reasonable belief that Executive has not
substantially performed his duties, continued violations by
Executive of Executive’s obligations to the Company which are
demonstrably willful and deliberate on Executive’s
part.

For purposes of this
Agreement, “Good Reason” means, without Executive's
express consent, (i) a material reduction of Executive's duties,
title, authority or responsibilities, relative to Executive's
duties, title, authority or responsibilities as in effect
immediately prior to such reduction, or the assignment to Executive
of such reduced duties, title, authority or responsibilities
(ii) a material reduction, of the facilities and perquisites
(including office space and location) available to Executive
immediately prior to such reduction, other than a reduction
generally applicable to all senior management of the Company;
(iii) a reduction by the Company in the Base Salary of
Executive as in effect immediately prior to such reduction (other
than a reduction that generally applies to Company employees);
(iv) a material reduction by the Company in the aggregate
level of employee benefits, including Target Bonuses, to which
Executive was entitled immediately prior to such reduction with the
result that Executive's aggregate benefits package is materially
reduced(other than a reduction that generally applies to Company
employees); (v) the relocation of Executive to a facility or a
location more than thirty-five (35) miles from Executive's then
present location; or (vi) any act or set of facts or
circumstances which would, under California case law or statute
constitute a constructive termination of Executive.

For purposes of this
Agreement, “Change of Control” shall mean the
occurrence of any of the following events in either a single
transaction or a series of related transactions:






(i) Any
“person” (as such term is used in Sections 13(d)
and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in
Rule 13d-3 under said Act), directly or indirectly, of
securities of the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more
of the total voting power represented by the Company's then
outstanding voting securities; or









(ii)
The
consummation of the sale or disposition by the Company of all or
substantially all the Company's assets; or




 





(iii)
The
consummation of a merger or consolidation of the Company with any
other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would
result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding
immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by
remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities
of the surviving entity) at least fifty percent (50%) of the total
voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or
such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or
consolidation; or









(iv)
A change
in the composition of the Board occurring within a two-year period,
as a result of which fewer than a majority of the directors are
Incumbent Directors.  “Incumbent Directors”
shall mean directors who either (A) are directors of the
Company as of the date upon which this Agreement was entered into,
or (B) are elected, or nominated for election, to the Board
with the affirmative votes of at least a majority of those
directors whose election or nomination was not in connection with
any transaction described in subsections (i), (ii), or (iii) above,
or in connection with an actual or threatened proxy contest
relating to the election of directors to the
Company.




 





(d) The
Executive shall not be required to mitigate the value of any
severance benefits contemplated by this section, nor shall any such
benefits be reduced by any earnings or benefits that the Executive
may

receive from any other
source; provided, however, that if Executive receives severance
benefits hereunder, he expressly waives the right to receive
severance benefits under any other severance plan or policy of the
Company.









(e)
Severance on or Following a Change of
Control .  If, on or
after a Change of Control (as defined herein), Executive’s
employment with the Company terminates due to (i) a voluntary
termination for “Good Reason” (as defined herein) where
the grounds for the Good Reason are not cured by the Company within
30 days following receipt of written notice specifying the grounds
from Executive, or (ii) an involuntary termination by the Company
other than for “Cause” (as defined herein), then,
subject to Executive executing and not revoking a standard form of
mutual release of claims with the Company and not breaching the
terms of Section 11 hereof, (i) all of Executive’s
Company stock options and restricted stock shall immediately
accelerate vesting as to 50% of the then unvested shares,
(ii) Executive shall receive continued payments of one
year’s Base Salary plus 50% of his Target Bonus, less
applicable withholding, in accordance with the Company’s
standard payroll practices (the “Severance Payment”),
(iii) the Company shall pay the group health and dental plan
continuation coverage premiums for Executive and his covered
dependents under Title X of the Consolidated Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1985, as amended (“COBRA”) for the lesser of
(A) twelve (12) months from the date of Executive’s
termination of employment, or (B) the date upon which
Executive and his covered dependents are covered by similar plans
of Executive’s new employer (the “COBRA
Coverage”).




The Executive shall not
be required to mitigate the value of any severance benefits
contemplated by this section, nor shall any such benefits be
reduced by any earnings or benefits that the Executive may receive
from any other source; provided, however, that if Executive
receives severance benefits hereunder, he expressly waives the
right to receive severance benefits under any other severance plan
or policy of the Company. 






(f) Voluntary Termination Other than for Good Reason;
Involuntary Termination for Cause .  In the event that Executive terminates
his employment voluntarily other than for Good Reason or is
involuntarily terminated by the Company for Cause, then all vesting
of Executive’s stock options and restricted stock shall
terminate immediately and all payments of compensation by the
Company to Executive hereunder shall immediately terminate (except
as to amounts already earned).









4. Death or Total Disability of Executive
.  




 





(a) Death .  Upon Executive’s death while
Executive is an employee or consultant of the Company, then (i)
employment hereunder shall automatically terminate, (ii) all of
Executive’s Company stock options and restricted stock shall
immediately accelerate vesting as to 50% of the then unvested
shares, and all subsequent vesting of Executive’s stock
options and restricted stock shall terminate immediately, and (iii)
all payments of compensation by the Company to Executive hereunder
shall immediately terminate (except as to amounts already
earned).

5. Golden Parachute Excise Taxes .  









(a) Parachute Payments of Less than 3.59 x Base
Amount .  In the
event that the benefits provided for in this agreement or otherwise
payable to Executive (a) constitute “parachute
payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
(b) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999
of the Code, and (c) the aggregate value of such parachute
payments, as determined in accordance with Section 280G of the Code
and the proposed Treasury Regulations thereunder (or the final
Treasury Regulations, if they have then been adopted) is less than
the product obtained by multiplying 3.59 by Executive’s
“base amount” within the meaning of Code Section
280G(b)(3), then such benefits shall be reduced to the extent
necessary (but only to that extent) so that no portion of such
benefits will be subject to excise tax under Section 4999 of the
Code.




 





(b)
Parachute Payments Equal to or Greater than 3.59 x
Base Amount .  In
the event that the benefits provided for in this agreement or
otherwise payable to Executive (a) constitute “parachute
payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code,
(b) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999
of the Code, and (c) the aggregate value of such parachute
payments, as determined in accordance with Section 280G of the Code
and the proposed Treasury Regulations thereunder (or the final
Treasury Regulations, if they have then been adopted) is equal to
or greater than the product obtained by multiplying 3.59 by
Executive’s “base amount” within the meaning of
Code Section 280G(b)(3), then the Executive shall receive
(i) a payment from the Company sufficient to pay such excise
tax, plus (ii) an additional payment from the Company
sufficient to pay the excise tax and federal and state income and
employment taxes arising from the payments made by the Company to
Executive pursuant to this sentence.









(c)
280G
Determinations . Unless the
Company and the Executive otherwise agree in writing, the
determination of Executive’s excise tax liability and the
amount required to be paid or reduced under this Section 5 shall be
made in writing by the Company’s independent auditors who are
primarily used by the Company immediately prior to the Change of
Control (the “Accountants”).  For purposes of
making the calculations required by this Section 5, the
Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations
concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith
interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and
4999 of the Code.  The Company and the Executive shall
furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the
Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination
under this Section.  The Company shall bear all costs the
Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any
calculations contemplated by this Section 5.




 





6. Assignment .  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of (a) the heirs, beneficiaries,
executors and legal representatives of Executive upon
Executive’s death and (b) any successor of the
Company.  Any such successor of the Company shall be
deemed substituted for the Company under the terms of this
Agreement for all purposes.  As used herein,
“successor” shall include any person, firm, corporation
or other business entity which at any time, whether by purchase,
merger or otherwise, directly or indirectly acquires all or
substantially all of the assets or business of the
Company.  None of the rights of Executive to receive any
form of compensation payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be
assignable or transferable except through a testamentary
disposition or by the laws of descent and distribution upon the
death of Executive.  Any attempted assignment, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition (other than as aforesaid) of any
interest in the rights of Executive to receive any form of
compensation hereunder shall be null and void.

or controversy arising out of, relating to, or in connection with
this Agreement, or the interpretation, validity, construction,
performance, breach, or termination thereof shall be finally
settled by binding arbitration to be held in Santa Clara County,
California, in accordance with the National Rules for the
Resolution of Employment Disputes then in effect of the American
Arbitration Association (the “Rules”).  The
arbitrator may grant injunctions or other relief in such dispute or
controversy.  The decision of the arbitrator shall be
confidential, final, conclusive and binding on the parties to the
arbitration.  Judgment may be entered under a protective
order on the arbitrator’s decision in any court having
jurisdiction.  The Company shall pay all costs of any
mediation or arbitration; provided, however, that each party shall
pay its own attorney and advisor fees.




 





(b)
The
arbitrator shall apply California law to the merits of any dispute
or claim, without reference to rules of conflict of
law.  The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by
federal arbitration law and by the Rules, without reference to
state arbitration law.  Executive hereby expressly
consents to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts located in California for any action or proceeding arising
from or relating to this Agreement and/or relating to any
arbitration in which the parties are
participants.









(c)
Executive
understands that nothing in Section 10 modifies
Executive’s at-will status.  Either the Company or
Executive can terminate the employment relationship at any time,
with or without cause.




 





(d)
EXECUTIVE
HAS READ AND UNDERSTANDS SECTION 10, WHICH DISCUSSES
ARBITRATION.  EXECUTIVE UNDERSTANDS THAT BY SIGNING THIS
AGREEMENT, EXECUTIVE AGREES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TO
SUBMIT ANY FUTURE CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE INTERPRETATION, VALIDITY,
CONSTRUCTION, PERFORMANCE, BREACH, OR TERMINATION THEREOF TO
BINDING ARBITRATION, AND THAT THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE CONSTITUTES A
WAIVER OF EXECUTIVE’S RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND RELATES TO
THE RESOLUTION OF ALL DISPUTES RELATING TO ALL ASPECTS OF THE
EMPLOYER/EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP.









11. Covenants Not to Compete and Not to
Solicit .




 





(a) Covenant Not to Compete . If and only if Executive receives severance
benefits under either Section 3(c) or 3(d) hereof, then Executive
agrees that, until the end of the six or twelve month severance
benefits period, as applicable, following the date of his
termination of employment with the Company for any reason or no
reason, Executive will not directly engage in (whether as an
employee, consultant, proprietor, partner, director or otherwise),
or have any ownership interest in, or participate in the financing,
operation, management or control of, any person, firm, corporation
or business that engages or participates anywhere in the world in
providing goods and services similar to those provided by the
Company upon the date of Executive’s termination of
employment.  Ownership of less than 3% of the outstanding
voting stock of a corporation or other entity will not constitute a
violation of this provision.  The Company agrees not to
unreasonably withhold consent from Executive to engage in any
activity that is not competitive with the
Company.





5



 






(b)
Covenant Not to Solicit .   If and only if Executive receives
severance benefits under either Section 3(c) or 3(d) hereof, then
Executive agrees that he will not, at any time during the six
or twelve month severance benefits period, as applicable, following
his termination date, directly or indirectly solicit any
individuals to leave the Company’s employ for any reason or
interfere in any other manner with the employment relationships at
the time existing between the Company and its current or
prospective employees.









(c)
Representations .  The parties intend that the covenants
contained in Section 11(a) and (b) shall be construed as a
series of separate covenants, one for each county, city and state
(or analogous entity) and country of the world.  If, in
any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce any of the
separate covenants, or any part thereof, then such unenforceable
covenant, or such part thereof, shall be deemed eliminated from
this Agreement for the purpose of those proceedings to the extent
necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants, or portions
thereof, to be enforced.




 





(d)
Reformation .  In the event that the provisions of this
Section 11 should ever be deemed to exceed the time or
geographic limitations, or scope of this covenant, permitted by
applicable law, then such provisions shall be reformed to the
maximum time or geographic limitations, as the case may be,
permitted by applicable laws.









(e)
Reasonableness of Covenants .  Executive represents that he (i) is
familiar with the covenants not to compete and solicit, and
(ii) is fully aware of his obligations hereunder, including,
without limitation, the reasonableness of the length of time, scope
and geographic coverage of these covenants.




 





(f)
Remedy
for Breach by Executive .  In the event Executive breaches his
obligations under this Section 11, the sole remedy shall be that
the Company may thereafter discontinue providing the severance
benefits under Section 3(c) or 3(d) hereof that Executive would
otherwise receive.









12. No
Oral Modification, Cancellation or Discharge
.  This Agreement may only be
amended, canceled or discharged in writing signed by Executive and
the Chairman of the Board.




 





13.
Withholding .  The Company shall be entitled to
withhold, or cause to be withheld, from payment any amount of
withholding taxes required by law with respect to payments made to
Executive in connection with his employment
hereunder.









14.
Governing Law .  This Agreement shall be governed by the
laws of the State of California.




 





15.
Effective Date .  This Agreement is effective upon the
date it has been executed by both parties.









16.
Acknowledgment .  Executive acknowledges that he has had
the opportunity to discuss this matter with and obtain advice from
his private attorney, has had sufficient time to, and has carefully
read and fully understands all the provisions of this Agreement,
and is knowingly and voluntarily entering into this
Agreement.

An employment agreement is a document which delineates the terms of the relationship between an employer and employee. If you are hiring a new employee, this document can help form a solid foundation for your business relationship. The document will specify expectations for both parties and may include items such as terms of conduct, employee benefits, vacation time, medical leave, hours, and other issues that may be up for consideration, depending on the business' needs.

An employment agreement might also incorporate arbitration conditions, confidentiality terms and non-compete clauses, provided that separate documents do not address these issues. Some employers may include a progressive disciplinary policy section in the agreement, wherein conditions and repercussions for employee misconduct are explained.

Once signed, an employment agreement is a legally binding contract that can be enforced in a court of law. Often an employer or company makes their offer of employment contingent on an employee signing the agreement.

RIPPLE MONITORING



Publication number:  20170153296
                                            

Abstract:  A ripple monitoring circuit may generate information indicative of a failing component in a power supply. At least one input may receive a ripple signal from the power supply that has a ripple component. A quantization circuit may repeatedly quantize the amplitude of the ripple component. A ripple amplitude statistics counter bank may count and store the number of times that different quantized amplitudes or different ranges of quantized amplitudes of the ripple component occurred. A ripple monitoring circuit may generate information about a power supply. At least one input may receive a ripple signal from the power supply that has a ripple component. A ripple measurement circuit may measure a characteristic of the ripple component. A storage circuit may store information about the measurement. A comparison circuit may compare information stored in the storage circuit with a threshold value and indicate when the stored information meets or exceeds this threshold value.

Paralleling voltage regulators



Patent number:  8378657
                                            

Abstract:  Circuits and methods for paralleling voltage regulators are provided. Improved current sharing and regulation characteristics are obtained by coupling control terminals of the voltage regulators together which results in precise output voltages and proportional current production. Distributing current generation among multiple paralleled voltage regulators improves heat dissipation and thereby reduces the likelihood that the current produced by the voltage regulators will be temperature limited.

Method for clamping a semiconductor region at or near ground



Patent number:  8159278
                                            

Abstract:  A clamping circuit clamps a voltage received by an n-type semiconductor region without using a Schottky transistor. The clamping circuit includes a current mirror as well as first and second bipolar transistors. The current mirror receives a first current and supplies a second current in response. The first current is received by the first bipolar transistor, and the second current is received by the second bipolar transistor. The difference between the base-emitter junction voltages of the first and second bipolar transistors, in part, defines the voltage at which the n-type region is clamped. To start-up the circuit properly, current is withdrawn from the base/gate terminals of the transistors disposed in the current mirror. The circuit optionally includes a pair of cross-coupled transistors to reduce the output impedance and improve the power supply rejection ratio.

Low thermal hysteresis bandgap voltage reference



Patent number:  7772920
                                            

Abstract:  A first and a second group of individual transistors in a voltage reference may collectively function as a first and a second composite transistor with a first and a second emitter area equal to the combined areas of the emitters of the first and the second groups of individual transistors, respectively. The second emitter area may be larger than the first emitter area. The stability of the reference voltage may depend upon the stability of the ratio between the first emitter area and the second emitter area. The first group of individual transistors may not be at the center of an arrangement of the second group of individual transistors. The constant reference voltage may vary due to thermal hysteresis by less than 200 parts per million over a 40 degree centigrade temperature range.

Bidirectional power conversion with multiple control loops



Patent number:  7538532
                                            

Abstract:  Bidirectional power conversion systems provide the ability to change power attributes to and from a component. Current bidirectional power conversion systems use a unidirectional power converter for each direction. The integration of the two normally independent power converters results in a bidirectional power converter with nearly half the size, weight, volume, cost and complexity.

METHOD FOR CLAMPING A SEMICONDUCTOR REGION AT OR NEAR GROUND



Publication number:  20090121770
                                            

Abstract:  A clamping circuit clamps a voltage received by an n-type semiconductor region without using a Schottky transistor. The clamping circuit includes a current mirror as well as first and second bipolar transistors. The current mirror receives a first current and supplies a second current in response. The first current is received by the first bipolar transistor, and the second current is received by the second bipolar transistor. The difference between the base-emitter junction voltages of the first and second bipolar transistors, in part, defines the voltage at which the n-type region is clamped. To start-up the circuit properly, current is withdrawn from the base/gate terminals of the transistors disposed in the current mirror. The circuit optionally includes a pair of cross-coupled transistors to reduce the output impedance and improve the power supply rejection ratio.

Switching regulator over voltage reduction circuit and method



Patent number:  7518351
                                            

Abstract:  Output voltage overshoot of a switching regulator is controlled by deactivating switching operation when a signal proportional to the output voltage exceeds a variable threshold level, with the threshold level set as a function of regulator output current. In accordance with an embodiment, a difference signal is generated that corresponds to a difference between an output voltage feedback signal and a constant reference voltage. The generated difference signal is combined with a signal proportional to load current to obtain an adapted threshold level. The adapted threshold level is greater than the level of the constant reference voltage. A regulator switch is reset to an off state when the output voltage feedback signal exceeds the adapted threshold level.

Paralleling voltage regulators



Publication number:  20090015070
                                            

Abstract:  Circuits and methods for paralleling voltage regulators are provided. Improved current sharing and regulation characteristics are obtained by coupling control terminals of the voltage regulators together which results in precise output voltages and proportional current production. Distributing current generation among multiple paralleled voltage regulators improves heat dissipation and thereby reduces the likelihood that the current produced by the voltage regulators will be temperature limited.

Bidirectional power conversion with multiple control loops



Publication number:  20080164853
                                            

Abstract:  Bidirectional power conversion systems provide the ability to change power attributes to and from a component. Current bidirectional power conversion systems use a unidirectional power converter for each direction. The integration of the two normally independent power converters results in a bidirectional power converter with nearly half the size, weight, volume, cost and complexity. Described are embodiments of bidirectional power conversion systems that allow power transfer between two or more components without requiring the use of separate unidirectional power converters.
