      Fitch Rates CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2013-3
    





August 08, 2013 03:11 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to CarMax Auto Owner Trust 
      2013-3:
    

      --$178,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$321,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$308,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$128,500,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24,500,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22,000,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$18,000,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: 2013-3 has consistent credit quality compared 
      to recent 2013 pools. The weighted average FICO score is 700 with 
      consistent internal credit tiers, while vehicle age, condition and LTV's 
      are slightly above recent 2013 pools.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on CarMax Auto 
      Finance's (CAF) portfolio and 2009-2012 securitizations have declined in 
      recent years due to stronger quality originations and elevated used 
      vehicle values, which have supported higher recovery rates.
    

      Higher Credit Enhancement: The cash flow distribution in 2013-3 is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) in 2013-3 
      for the class A notes totals 6.70%, up from 5.70% in 2013-2 and 2013-1. 
      CE is adequate to cover Fitch's base case loss coverage levels.
    

      Unstable Macroeconomic Conditions: A slower recovery and potential for 
      volatility could affect delinquencies and losses. Fitch's analysis 
      accounts for this risk by including poorer performing vintages from the 
      recent recession in the base case loss analysis.
    

      Stable Origination, Underwriting and Servicing Platform: Fitch believes 
      CAF demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and 
      servicer to service 2013-3.
    

      Integrity of the Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of CAF would not impair the timeliness 
      of the payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to each class of 
      CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2013-3 to increased losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that each class of notes displays 
      some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing potential 
      downgrades of one category under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) 
      scenario. Each class of notes could experience downgrades of up to three 
      rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      For more information about Fitch's comprehensive subscription service

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

We Buy Cars and Trucks, Any Condition!

 We Buy Cars, Trucks, Vans, SUVs, Classics, Commercial vehicles and more. Seriously, if it’s got wheels and an engine we want it!  We’ve been in business for over 35 years, and due to the fantastic customer response we’ve gotten all those years, we expect to be around for many years to come.
				 You can sell your “like new” or “beat to heck” used car to us. We, of course, LOVE to get our hands on clean cars and really bend over backwards to buy your late model, low mileage car. However, we are realistic and know that most people buy their cars and drive them, until that sad day when the car is no longer useful to them. Because of that, we buy cars in nearly every possible condition. Check out our photos of recently purchased vehicles to see the ginormous variety of vehicles that we are able to purchase.
				 We have the capability to purchase a fleet of late model commercial trucks, as well as the ability to purchase the junk car your ex left in the driveway 12 years ago and of course anything in between these extremes, and we can do it today!
				 We will come to your home or office and buy your car, truck, van, SUV or commercial vehicle. We are fully licensed, bonded, insured and have received great reviews on Yelp and the
				BBB. We handle all of the paperwork for you and will tow your car for free.
			
Sell Your Car Fast

				We come to you FAST. For instance, in just ONE of our Service Zones, we have 14 expert car buyers on our payroll in the field, all either on their way to or at a vehicle that we are purchasing. They are on a map in our call center and can be deployed to you literally at the touch of a button. 
			





				Call, Chat or Submit your vehicle online to initiate a conversation with a live experienced buyer.
				
WE CAN PURCHASE YOUR CAR IN ANY STATE!! WHETHER ITS ONE OF OUR MOBILE REPS OR OUR MOBILE TOW SERVICE, WE CAN BUY YOUR CAR!

Common Questions


Why Sell To Us?


Cash For Cars 
Get Top Dollar 
 Get all your questions answered by calling or chatting with a knowledgeable professional Cash for Cars representative. Even if your car  failed smog,  we will buy it. If your  car is wrecked, we will buy it. 
Smog Certificate
 
				California State law says that " The seller is required to provide the 
				buyer with a valid smog inspection certification at the time of the sale or transfer." If your car hasn't been smogged in the last 90 days, then you must go through the hassle of getting the smog certificate to make the sale of your car legal in California. If you don't, then you would be liable for the cost of repairs that the buyer had to pay for to get the car you sold him smogged. When you sell your car to WeBuyCars.com, we handle all DMV paperwork and smog cert, so you don’t have to.
				 We will even buy your car if the title has been lost and if the registration is out of date.
			
Who should I sell my car to? 
 
				WeBuyCars.com has been buying cars in volume directly from the public since 1980. We know what people want. You want a safe company to sell your car to. You want it to be hassle-free. You don’t want to hear from the DMV after the purchase. You want clear and honest communication. You want fast service that is professional and experienced. You want WeBuyCars.com.

Who will buy our Highlander fast?



					Jim and Kathy had a great run of luck with their 2004 Toyota Highlander. It was dependable and they had used it for almost everything but now they needed to sell it right away. Jim had taken a job on the East Coast as a sales manager for a large software firm. He was planning to buy a 2013 Lexus LS 450 once they got settled in. They used the Highlander until the day before they needed to move because they figured they could sell it on Craigslist pretty quickly. They placed an ad and two hours later they removed the ad in fear for their lives (just kidding). But they did take the ad down right away because the phone was ringing off the hook. And they hadn't talked to one person who they were comfortable with having come to their house. Jim remembered having seen a television ad for a company called WE BUY CARS. He remembered that they purchased cars really fast and the process seemed really straightforward. He found WeBuyCars.com on the Internet and gave them a call. A friendly, courteous, very knowledgeable buyer was literally on their doorstep two hours later. The buyer inspected the vehicle quickly and 15 minutes later they had a guaranteed company check in hand and were on their way to their new life on the East Coast. 
				
Who buys Highlanders fast?.......We do!

 Misho A.  on   4/9/2016 

 

 Excellent, nice, perfect person for the job. I feel very grateful and happy about the transaction. Mostly about the representative. Thank you thank you thank you very much.
							





 Lynn  on   4/1/2016 

 

 We recently sold a Toyota Camry long distance. The task seemed daunting but was made surprisingly easy, fast and pleasant by WeBuyCars. Guesley in Florida was super patient but also efficient. He was ready to answer any questions about the car and the process. Bruce in New York was a true professional, also personable. René was friendly and very helpful on the the phone. We would strongly recommend this company to anyone who wants to sell a car!
							





 Thomas  on   3/28/2016 

 

 Never having sold a car in this fashion, I was extremely satisfied with Guesley's professionalism, experience and honesty. I was confident that I received the best price for my car. Thank you very much!
							





 Adam  on   4/14/2016 

 

 Professional is what I describe my rep as. They matched our offer and then some. Thanks Heber.
							





 Jason G.  on   4/1/2016 

 

 Very flexible with time, great service friendly, patient. Would recommend the service to anyone.
							





 Megan  on   3/31/2016 

 

 We couldn't be more pleased with our WeBuyCars experience and was even more impressed with your buyer, Bob. We initially had no idea what to expect, what to do, or if we even wanted to sell our car, since this decision was completely on a whim. Bob promptly showed up, chatted with us about our day, gave us the rundown on how WeBuyCars works and was not only extremely helpful with negotiations, but patient with our indecisions. Although we were his last stop for the evening, Bob was genuinely kind, outgoing and made us feel comfortable in whatever decision we made, during however long it took us to decide. WeBuyCars, Bob has upper management written all over him! Give that man a raise! Thanks for all the help Bob!

Common Questions


Q: What kind of cars do you buy?
A: We here at WeBuyCars.com are interested in purchasing almost any vehicle no matter how old it is. We also buy all Toyota or Nissan truck, and most convertibles. We are also interested in classics and other collectable vehicles of any year.
Q: Will you still take my car even if it isn’t running?
A: Absolutely! We purchase cars running or not.
Q: What if my car was in an accident?
A: We buy wrecked cars also. Read More >

Q: I can’t find the Certificate of Title (a.k.a pink slip) to the car. Will you still buy my car?
A: Our buyers carry all the necessary paperwork to purchase your vehicle, even if the title is lost. (This varies from state to state, call for details)

Q: My car isn’t paid off yet.
A: We are fully equipped to purchase the car from you even in this circumstance. Of course, the car must be worth more than the balance still due on it.
Q: Won’t I make more money by donating my car?
A: As of January 1, 2005, the donation laws changed radically. You are now only able to deduct the amount that the vehicle is sold for by the charity.Click here for full details on the law change and how it impacts you and your wallet.
Q: What happens to my car after I sell it?
A: Newer vehicles are reconditioned and resold by our dealer network. Older, wrecked and mechanically damaged vehicles are usually dismantled.
Q: I want to sell my car to you. When can you come?
A: Right now! Just call the WeBuyCars.com hotline and we’ll schedule an appointment.
Q: How long have you been doing this?
A: We have been buying cars from the public continuously since 1980. We have purchased over 18,000 cars directly from the public in those 30 years of business.
Q: How much do you pay?
A: We have a proprietary database that we use to determine our pricing. We can give a price quote on your car right away when you call in.

Q: Do I need to get my car smog checked before I sell it to you?
A: This is just one of the many reasons to sell your car to WeBuyCars.com. A smog certificate is not needed when selling your car to us.
