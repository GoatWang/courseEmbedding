Indications & Risk of the Checkpoint Stimulator & Locator

The Checkpoint® Stimulator is a single-use, sterile device intended to provide electrical stimulation of exposed motor nerve or muscle tissue to locate and identify nerves and to test nerve and muscle excitability.







Model: 9094
Surgical Nerve Stimulator/Locator

Patented (US) – www.checkpointsurgical.com/patents Ⓓ (US)

INDICATIONS FOR USE:
The CHECKPOINT® Stimulator is a single-use, sterile device intended to provide electrical stimulation of exposed motor nerves or muscle tissue to locate and identify nerves and to test nerve and muscle excitability.
CONTRAINDICATION:
Do NOT use this Stimulator when paralyzing anesthetic agents are in effect, as an absent or inconsistent response to stimulation may result in inaccurate assessment of nerve and muscle function.
WARNINGS:


Do NOT apply stimulation across the patient’s chest because the introduction of electrical current into the chest may cause rhythm disturbances to the patient’s heart.
Do NOT leave Stimulator unattended in the surgical field.
Do NOT use Stimulator in the presence of flammable anesthetics.
Do NOT use this Stimulator in patients with implanted electronic devices. Stimulus current near such devices may cause them to malfunction.
Do NOT use in cerebrospinal fluid, brain, meninges, or spinal cord.
Do NOT use the Stimulator while delivering electrocautery. Electrocautery may interfere with or damage the Checkpoint Stimulator or cause injury.
Use of a tourniquet may reduce nerve and muscle excitability distal to the tourniquet. If a decrease in nerve or muscle response to stimulation is observed, it may be necessary to take down the tourniquet and allow time for re-perfusion before testing with Checkpoint.

PRECAUTIONS:

Single use only. Once turned ON, the Stimulator will not turn OFF and will remain operational for approximately four (7) hours.
Use the Stimulator at 0.5mA initially and increase the amplitude as needed.
Do NOT bend the probe or apply excessive pressure where the probe enters the nose cone. Do NOT use the Checkpoint Stimulator as a dissecting tool or for any other purpose not specified in these Instructions for Use.
The needle return electrode may cause stimulation. Place the needle return electrode in an area away from excitable tissue and away from the stimulation area to avoid confusion.
Do NOT submerge or saturate the Checkpoint Stimulator with fluid.
The Stimulator may interfere with patient monitoring equipment in the operating room while stimulating.
Portable and mobile Radio Frequency (RF) communications equipment can interfere with the Stimulator. Do not use such equipment while delivering stimulation.
The Stimulator is not likely to cause any interference in nearby electronic equipment through Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) (complies with CISPR 11, Type B). For additional information on Electromagnetic Interference contact NDI Medical.
Be aware that using the device in the vicinity of certain nerves can have systemic effects (e.g. bradycardia, hypotension, laryngospasm).



The Checkpoint Stimulator is an adjunctive tool for locating nerves and testing nerve and muscle excitability. It is not intended to replace good surgical techniques in locating and dissecting tissue. The surgeon is ultimately responsible for identifying exposed motor nerves and tissue.

Clinical Results & Abstracts

Clinical results of an efficacy and bio-compatibility study (1)




Design: Prospective clinical studyPatients: 12 patients (average age 51.5 years) presented with significant nerve disability pre-operatively and underwent neurolysis
Procedure: Neurolysis followed by implantation of Cova™ Ortho-Nerve membrane around the released peripheral nerve tissue.
Results: After a minimum follow-up of 6 months, irritation had significantly decreased and/or mobility improved partially or completely. No allergic reaction was noted.
Median nerve neurolysis repair (1)History: Irritation of the median nerve due to a suture at the wrist after thumb opposition transfer following a complex wrist wound (median nerve suture).
Procedure: Neurolysis of the median nerve suture and tenosynovectomy of the flexors; protection of the nerve with Cova Ortho-Nerve membrane (30 x 40 mm).
Results after 1 month follow-up: Complete disappearance of the irritation syndrome. Excellent thumb mobility post-operation.
Median nerve neurolysis graft (1)History: Secondary nerve graft following a complex wrist wound; satisfactory nerve recovery with a major median nerve irritation of the wrist.
Procedure: Neurolysis graft combined with tenosynovectomy of the flexors; protection of
the graft with Cova™Ortho-Nerve membrane (30 x 40 mm).
Very positive results at 3 month follow-up with almost complete disappearance of the irritation.

Evaluation of a new anti-adhesion collagen resorbable membrane (Cova™ ORTHO) following nervous upper limb surgery. Tordjman D,  Schlur C,  Mamane W, Masmejean E, Annual Congress of French Hand Surgery Society / de la Main. 2012. 31 (6), 416Purpose: The aim of this study is to analyze the efficacy and tolerance of a new anti-adhesion resorbable collagen membrane CovaTM Ortho for primary and secondary upper extremity nerve surgery.
Methods: Retrospective study including 40 patients, with an indication of neurolysis at upper extremity with a partial sensory and motor deficit and/or a disabling irritative syndrome, included in a 29-months period (04/2009-09/2011).  The series involves 25 males and 15 females. The mean age is 48.3 years-old (15-83).
Primary neurolysis concerned elbow ulnar nerve neurolysis with anterior subcutaneous transposal for 11 patients (27.5%).  Secondary neurolysis involved 29 patients (72.5%) including recurrent or recalcitrant carpal tunnel syndrome (n=7), recurrent cubital tunnel syndrome at the elbow (n=3), post-trauma neurolysis (n=12), or after nerve graft (n=3) neuroma (n=2), thoracic outlet syndrome (n=1) and median nerve compression by tendon transfer (n=1).
Primary Endpoints: Quick Dash score, pain (EVA), grip strength measured by Jamar® dynamometer, sensitivity, motricity, paresthesias, irritative syndrome and patient’s satisfaction.
Key Findings: The Quick Dash test (performed in 80% of the cases) improved 14 points (+5/-11).
Jamar® dynamometer grip strength (assessed in 72.5% of the cases) improved of 8% (-28%/+45.4%).
Pain was completely resolved in 25% of the cases and improved in 55% of the cases.  Sensitivity, a S4 complete recovery was observed in 23% of the cases and an improvement in 40% of the patients.  Motricity, a M5 complete recovery was noted in 20% of the cases and an improvement in 20% of the cases.  Complete resolution of paresthesias was observed in 30% of the cases and an improvement in 45% of the cases.  Irritative syndrome, a complete resolution was observed in 53% of the cases and an improvement in 35% of the cases.  Patients’ global satisfaction was considered excellent or good in 75% of the cases, moderate for 10% and weak in 15% of the cases.
Conclusion: The collagen membrane is a natural and resorbable device presenting with excellent patient tolerance. The procedure for using this anti-adhesion collagen membrane is simple, reliable and reproducible
Reduction of neural scarring after peripheral nerve suture: an experimental study about collagen membrane and autologous vein wrapping. L. Mathieu, C. Adam, J. Legagneux, P. Bruneval, E. Masmejean. Chirurgie de la Main. 2012; 31:311-7.Purpose: The effects of a collagen membrane(CovaTM Ortho) and a technique of autologous vein wrapping on scar formation after peripheral nerve suture are investigated.
Methods: Forty-eight sciatic nerves from Wistar rats were transected and repaired, then allocated to a control group C (n = 16) and two experimental groups: in group A (n = 16) the repair line was covered by the collagen membrane, and in group B (n = 16) the repair line was wrapped by an external jugular venous graft
Primary Endpoints: Macroscopic evaluation and histologic evaluation of extraneural and intraneural fibrosis.
Key Findings: Three months later, it was observed that adhesions in the surrounding tissues were significantly less in groups A(collagen membrane)  and B(vein wrap) compared to group C (control), and significantly less in group A than in the group B.  In group A, the sciatic nerve could be detached from the surrounding muscle tissue, or was wrapped in a thin fibrous, translucent, and easily cleavable tissue. After 3 months, the collagen membrane was completely resorbed in all cases.  Histological analysis revealed no significant reduction of extraneural or intraneural scar tissue in groups A or B compared to group C. However intraneural fibrosis was significantly less in the group A than in the group B.
Conclusion:  It was concluded that the collagen membrane was effective in reducing neural scar formation after peripheral nerve suture.  Autologous vein wrapping also showed a favorable effect in this indication despite less successful histological outcomes.
Comparison of a collagen membrane versus a fibrin sealant after a peroneal nerve section and repair: a functional and histological study. V. Pertici, J. Laurin, T. Marqueste, P. Decherchi.  Acta Neurochir (Wien). 2014; 156(8): 1577-90Purpose:	To date, fibrin sealant is considered to be one of the most effective substitutes to prevent post-operative fibrosis and to limit neuroma formation after nerve suture. Because fibrin sealant presents a number of drawbacks, more suitable techniques should be considered. The aim of this study was to functionally and histologically compare the efficiency of a fibrin sealant to a resorbable semi-permeable porcine type I collagen membrane(CovaTMOrtho) after a peroneal nerve lesion and repair on rats.
Methods: Rats were divided into four groups: (1) a SHAM group (n=10) in which surgery was performed without damaging the nerve, (2) a LESION group (n=15) in which the nerve was cut and immediately sutured without additional treatment, (3) a MEMBRANE group (n=30) in which a collagen membrane was wrapped around the lesion site, and (4) a GLUE group (n=30) in which the peroneal nerve was coated by fibrin sealant. Peroneal Functional Index (PFI), kinematic analysis of locomotion, muscular atrophy, axonal regrowth, and irritant ranking score (IRS) were performed during three months post-surgery.
Primary Endpoints: The peroneal functional index, kinematic analysis of movement, muscle weight measurements and histology; inflammatory reactions, histopathological analysis, axonal regrowth.
Key Findings: Our results indicate that at the third month post-surgery, no difference in both the functional recovery and the histological measurement was observed between groups.  However, no deleterious effect was observed following the use of the collagen membrane. Indeed, the porcine membrane was well-integrated into the host tissue, with no noticeable foreign body reaction at three months post-surgery.
Conclusion: Our preliminary results highlight the fact that the collagen membrane could be used as an alternative to fibrin sealant in peripheral nerve repair surgery. Indeed, animals in which the collagen membrane was used to wrap the lesion site exhibited similar functional and histological results as animals in which a fibrin sealant was used to coat the lesion. The greatest advantage of this membrane is that it could be used as a drug delivery device, regulated by its degradation rate.

“Why make a manual solely devoted to nerve repair in the brachial plexus and upper extremity?  This answer is simple; find a perplexing problem and simply it.  The diagnosis of nerve injury produces confusion, myth and misperception.  The field of nerve injury crosses many specialties including neurology, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, physiatry, orthopedic surgery and therapy.
This manual will demystify nerve injuries and will provide a practical approach to anatomy, injury, examination and treatment that will give the clinician the knowledge and confidence necessary to diagnose and manage nerve injuries.”
Dr. Scott Kozin, MD
Professor, Orthopaedic Surgery, Temple University and Hand & Upper Extremity Surgeon, Shriners Hospitals for Children




Author Biography
SCOTT H. KOZIN, MD Chief of Staff, Shriners Hospital for Children- Philadelphia
Team Leader, Touching Hands Project, American Society for Surgery of the Hand
Scott Kozin graduated from Duke University in 1982 with a degree in computer science. Medical School was completed at Hahnemann University in Philadelphia, followed by orthopaedic residency at Albert Einstein Medical Center.   Fellowship was completed in 1992 at the Mayo Clinic focusing on hand and microvascular surgery. Dr. Kozin initially cared for adults and children until the year 2000, when he devoted his practice and research to children at Shriners Hospitals for Children in Philadelphia. Since that time, Dr. Kozin has been an advocate for improving the lives of children via research, education, and patient care. He is currently Chief of Staff at Shriners Hospitals for Children in Philadelphia. He has published over 100 Peer reviewed papers, mainly on the care of children with various diagnoses including brachial plexus injury, spinal cord injury, and congenital differences. He routinely travels to developing countries to operate on children in need. Dr. Kozin received the Weiland Metal by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand in 2010, which honors a hand surgeon/scientist who has contributed a body of research that advances the field. Dr. Kozin was president of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand 2014. He implemented the Touching Hands Project to foster hand care around the globe with a focus on developing and underserved countries. The mission statement reads “Creating opportunities for hand specialists to give back their knowledge and expertise to the global community.” The inaugural mission to Haiti occurred in 2014 and 6 additional missions occurred in 2015. More to come!
Dr. Kozin is also a devoted husband and father to his two children, Bryan and Samantha. During his leisure time, he enjoys travel, food, and mountain biking.

NDI - Medical Device Business Portfolio









































NDI









Portfolio








 
Deep Brain Innovations
Deep Brain Innovations™ (DBI) was formed in 2012 as a portfolio company of NDI to commercialize a proprietary method for optimizing deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy through novel patterns of stimulation. DBI’s Temporally Optimized Patterned Stimulation™ (TOPS) technology is designed to increase the efficiency of implanted neurostimulation systems and enable the commercialization of devices designed to be more cost-effective, smaller, and longer lasting, requiring fewer lifetime replacements while concurrently reducing the potential for implant replacement related complications, such as infections.
SPR Therapeutics
SPR Therapeutics (Stimulation for Pain Relief) was spun-out from NDI in January 2010 to develop a novel peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) therapy platform meeting a critical unmet need for minimally invasive, long lasting, and cost effective pain treatments across an array of painful neuropathic and orthopedic conditions affecting the joints and limbs.
The company is commercializing novel and proprietary treatment methods and technologies, including both short-term, percutaneous systems and long-term, fully-implantable systems.
The first product to be commercialized is the SMARTPATCH® PNS System, a minimally-invasive, percutaneous therapy designed to stimulate peripheral nerves for up to 30 days to relieve pain. SMARTPATCH received CE Mark certification for chronic shoulder pain in 2013.
SPR has been awarded more than $5 million in federal and state research grants, including a grant from the United States Department of Defense of nearly $3 million to advance its therapies in post-amputation pain. SPR has raised $5 million in Series A financing from the NDI Healthcare Fund, Public Square Partners, and individual investors.
Checkpoint Surgical
Checkpoint Surgical was formed as a portfolio company of NDI in 2009. In 2010, Checkpoint Surgical launched the CHECKPOINT® Nerve Stimulator/Locator, its first FDA-cleared product in a line of unique surgical devices to locate, identify, and test excitability of nerves and muscles in surgical procedures in an effort to improve patient outcomes. Checkpoint Surgical targets an estimated market over the next ten years in excess of $3 billion in orthopedic, otolaryngology, maxillofacial, oncology, trauma and plastic surgery procedures.
Checkpoint has experienced consistent and substantial revenue growth based on widespread use of the device among orthopedic, head and neck, ENT, hand, plastic, reconstructive and craniofacial surgeons. Checkpoint customers include more than 100 top U.S. hospital systems and the sales are expanding in international markets based on CE Mark certification granted in 2012.
MEDSTIM
NDI’s MEDSTIM® system was an implanted device used to deliver electrical stimulation to pelvic nerves that control bladder function.  The company was sold to Medtronic, Inc. in April 2008 for $42 million.
