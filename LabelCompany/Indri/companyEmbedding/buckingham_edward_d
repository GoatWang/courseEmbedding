Home » Procedures » FaceliftFacelift in Austin, Texas


Many patients look in the mirror and are discouraged because the face they see looks older and more tired than they feel. A facelift and necklift can address this concern. Face and neck lifting surgery is successfully performed on healthy patients ranging in age from their 30’s to well in their 80’s. A facelift cannot stop the aging process; however, what it can do is give your face a healthy and more youthful appearance. Many patients experience increased self-confidence as the face in the mirror now more accurately represents their psychological rather than chronological maturity. As with all facial plastic surgery, general good health and realistic expectations are prerequisites. You should seek out a trusted, Austin plastic surgeon.















Before & After Photos




*Each patient is unique and individual results may vary.
A face/necklift primarily treats the jawline and neck areas. More specifically, it treats the lower half of the face. In the past, pulling the skin back was the only method of face-lifting, which would lead to an artificial “windswept” look, poor wound healing and transient results. More aggressive surgery was in vogue during the 80’s and 90’s, but has fallen out of favor with many surgeons because of the long operative time, higher risk of surgery, protracted recovery period and minimal cosmetic benefit. Dr. Buckingham utilizes the newest minimally invasive techniques with incisions nearly entirely confined to and camouflaged within the hairline. This reduces recovery time and leads to the most natural appearing and long-lasting results.
Dr. Buckingham tailors his facelift to fit the patient’s needs and wishes. Limited incision facelifts are performed for patients with thin necks and minimal neck banding with substantial results. See our section on limited incision facelift for more details and photos. For patients with more advanced aging including neck fatty pockets, significant neck bands or more advanced skin sagging a more involved, but still minimally traumatic facelift is performed. Unlike our limited incision facelift where the anterior neck is not opened, in patients who require these techniques, we make a small incision under the chin where fat can be gently removed and the platysma muscle can be sutured in the midline. A completely concealed incision is then place around the ears and in the hairline to expose the SMAS which is lifted and elevated re-suspending the face to a more youthful position. Even with this procedure, Dr. Buckingham tailors the SMAS elevation based on the patient’s needs. For those patients with thin faces and moderate jowling and neck laxity the SMAS will be elevated a shorter distance. For patients with heavy faces and more significant aging the SMAS will be elevated as a deep plane composite flap allowing for maximal improvement.
Regardless of the approach used, our patients are ready for social activities within 10-14 days and are fully active in 2-3 weeks. Some residual swelling and firm areas will persist and continue to improve for as long as 3 months, but these areas are usually minor and not noticeable without close inspection.
To determine if a patient is a good candidate for this procedure, Dr. Buckingham recommends a private patient consultation.
Dr. Buckingham feels that successful facial plastic surgery results from the development and maintenance of good rapport between the patient, the surgeon, and his staff during the consultation and future appointments. The consultation will include a complete facial analysis to determine the best procedure to bring about the desired results and all questions relating to the patient’s specific concerns will be addressed.
Prospective patients are encouraged to call the office to schedule an appointment at their earliest convenience. 
Frequently Asked Facelift Questions
Q – What is a facelift?
A facelift is a procedure to lift sagging tissues of the face. It is a generic term that patients and some surgeons use to describe more specifically brow/forehead lift, midface lift, or lower facelift. We use the term facelift to refer to the lower face and usually call it a “lower facelift.” It is a procedure that addresses the neck and jawline, or if you draw an oblique line from the corner of the mouth to the upper ear it improves everything below that line. Many different kinds or degrees of facelifts can be performed and are tailored to the particular patient. Some involve incisions only in front of the ear while others involve a small incision under the chin to perform a submentoplasty followed by an incision around the ear and a deep plane facelift.
Q – Who is the best candidate for a facelift?
The best candidate for a facelift is someone who is medically fit. A facelift can be beneficial for patients experiencing pre-mature aging of the jawline and neck in their late 30’s up to patients with more severe aging extending into their 80’s assuming good health. The younger patients often undergo an “S”-lift or mini-lift while the older patients often need a deep plane facelift.
Q – What can I expect during the consultation?
During the consultation, you will meet our patient care coordinator who will tell you about our practice and walk you through the process. Our nurse will then get a medical history. Dr. Buckingham will then first listen to your concerns and then address them with a focus on providing the most effective and economical procedure with the least down-time to meet your cosmetic expectations. Doctor Buckingham will also review many before and after photos of his patients with you focusing on patients with similar appearance and concerns. Once the consult is complete you will receive a written quote describing your procedures and have the ability to select a surgery date if desired.
Q – Where is Facelift surgery performed?
The “S”-lift and mini-lifts are performed in our private office surgery suite with local anesthesia and if desired oral sedation. The more extensive lifts are best performed under IV sedation and are therefore performed at and outpatient surgery center, usually Central Park Surgery Center.

Home » Procedures » Erbium LaserLaser Skin Resurfacing in Austin, TX
The Whisper-3G Erbium laser skin resurfacing treatment rejuvenates the skin for a healthier, smoother appearance. The Whisper laser can improve a variety of skin conditions including fine lines and wrinkles, enlarged pores, uneven skin tone and texture, and sun damage. This is a gentle, minimally invasive treatment.

Dr. Buckingham performs Whisper-3G Erbium laser skin resurfacing in the office setting at the Buckingham Center for Facial Plastic Surgery of Austin, Texas. The treatment takes just fifteen to thirty minutes to complete. Because there is minimal discomfort, a topical anesthetic at most may be used.
The Whisper-3G Erbium laser works by emitting a beam of laser light that precisely removes the outer layers of aged and sun damaged tissue. This stimulates skin cell turnover while triggering the skin’s natural response to form new collagen and elastin fibers to strengthen and rejuvenate the skin. Following treatment, patients will see a reduction in fine wrinkles and age spots and an overall smoother, more vibrant skin appearance.
Recovery following Whisper-3G Erbium laser skin resurfacing is minimal. Though the skin may appear red right after treatment and flaky for about three to four days, patients can immediately return to work and other normal activities. Makeup can be worn the next day. For optimal results, patients usually choose to receive multiple sessions over the course of several months.
Frequently Asked Whsiper-3G Erbium Laser Questions
What is Whisper-3G Erbium Laser Skin Resurfacing?
Whisper-3G Erbium laser resurfacing is a gentle, minimally invasive laser skin resurfacing procedure which uses laser energy to remove the outer layers of aged and sun damaged tissue. The result is smoother, younger, more vibrant looking skin.
How do I know if I am a good candidate for Whisper-3G Erbium Laser resurfacing?
Candidates for treatment with the Whisper-3G Erbium laser are physically healthy and have realistic expectations. They are looking to improve the signs of age and sun damage including fine lines and wrinkles, enlarged pores, and uneven skin tone and texture.
Where is the Whisper-3G Erbium Laser procedure performed? 
The Whisper-3G Erbium laser resurfacing procedure is an in-office treatment performed at the Buckingham Center for Facial Plastic Surgery of Austin, Texas.
What type of anesthesia is used for Whisper-3G Erbium Laser skin resurfacing?
This is a very tolerable treatment that requires, at most, a topical anesthetic.
What is the downtime for Whisper-3G Erbium laser resurfacing?
There is no downtime following treatment with the Whisper-3G Erbium laser. Though patients may experience some temporary redness and flaking of the skin, work and other activities can be resumed immediately.
Can I wear makeup after my Whisper-3G Erbium laser resurfacing treatment? 
You will be able to wear makeup on the day after your treatment.
Q – Is more than one treatment needed to get the best results with Whisper-3G Erbium laser resurfacing? 
Many patients elect to receive multiple treatments over the course of several months in order to achieve optimal results.

Home » Procedures » VolumaJuvederm Voluma XC in Austin, Texas
A youthful face is composed of many characteristics, all of which work together to give you the young luminous appearance that draws others to you. An attractive face free of sun damage, wrinkles, and sagging skin is something many of us strive for, but unfortunately Mother Nature often has other plans. Now physicians have another anti-aging solution available to them in the form of a new injectable filler. Juvederm Voluma XC is Allergan’s latest injectable product. Voluma has been FDA approved to restore volume loss in the cheeks and promises long lasting-results when used correctly with advanced injection techniques.

Juvederm Voluma is a hyaluronic acid filler, much like Juvederm and Restylane, but rather than smoothing out wrinkles it subtly lifts the cheeks and restores the contours of the face, reversing volume loss that occurs as a result of age. Hyaluronic acid is naturally found in the body in the soft connective tissue and skin. The substance is a popular component of facial fillers due to its ability to retain water and help build collagen, a protein necessary to retain healthy skin structure and prevent laxity. Over time collagen production diminishes and the cheeks may become hollow, adding to an older appearance. With Juvederm Voluma the hyaluronic acid has been cross-linked to deliver natural-looking fullness and return essential moisture to the cheeks.
The more youthful profile may last up to 2 years under optimal treatment circumstances, making it a very desirable procedure. The procedure is quick, taking an average of 15 minutes. No downtime is required following treatment and patients may return to all normal activities soon after. Some patients may experience some moderate side effects, such as tenderness, swelling, redness, or bruising. These common side effects are temporary and generally last no longer than 1 to 2 weeks.
To learn more about Juvederm Voluma and the benefits that injectable fillers have to offer, prospective patients should call Dr. Buckingham’s office to schedule a consultation. Consultations involve a comprehensive analysis of the face to determine which procedures are suitable for a particular patient’s needs. Dr. Buckingham will gladly answer any and all questions you may have concerning volume loss in the cheeks or Voluma.

Juvederm Voluma Frequently Asked Questions
What is Juvederm Voluma?
Juvederm Voluma is a long-lasting injectable smooth gel filler composed of cross-linked hyaluronic acid. The product has been FDA-approved for injection into the cheek area for the purpose of restoring lost volume in the mid-face. Voluma is effective in all three areas of the cheek: the apex, apple, and hollow.
Who is a good candidate for Juvederm Voluma?
Good candidates for Juvederm Voluma are individuals over the age of 21 who are in good general health and have concerns about volume loss in their cheeks.
Where is the Juvederm Voluma procedure performed?
The Voluma procedure is performed in the office setting by either Dr. Buckingham or our Aesthetic Nurse Injector.
What can I expect during the Juvederm Voluma procedure?
A fine needle will be used to inject Voluma into the skin. The procedure is quick and easy and takes as little as 15 minutes. Anesthesia is not necessary since lidocaine is already included in the Juvederm Voluma mixture. However, a topical anesthetic or another option may be used for sensitive patients. The results are immediately noticeable.
How long does the Juvederm Voluma procedure last?
Juvederm Voluma injections typically take between 15 and 20 minutes to perform. Some patients may require more extensive treatment which can increase the procedure time.
Are Juvederm Voluma injections painful? 
When performed by an experienced physician or nurse injector, patients experience minimal discomfort. Voluma also includes a small dose of local anesthetic in the mixture, diminishing any pain felt during the procedure even more. Dr. Buckingham will be able to discuss other options with you, such as topical anesthesia, at your consultation to minimize your discomfort during injections. Tenderness of the treatment site is a side effect, but it is typically moderate and short lived.
What is recovery like after the Juvederm Voluma procedure?
After Voluma injections, patients may return to their normal activities. There is virtually no downtime. Some side effects are commonly seen in Voluma patients, including bruising, redness, tenderness, and swelling at the injection sites. In the vast majority of patients these side effects are resolved within several days. The enduring results are rejuvenated cheeks that enhance the youthful appearance of the face.
How long do the results of a Juvederm Voluma procedure last?
When used correctly, Juvederm Voluma has the potential to show continued results for up to 2 years, much longer than with other hyaluronic acid fillers.

Home » Procedures » Belotero BalanceBelotero Balance in Austin, TX

Board Certified Plastic Surgeon Dr. Buckingham helps men and women release their inner beauty with treatments like Belotero Balance® at Buckingham Center in Austin, Texas. Balance® is a non-surgical procedure that refreshes the skin, improves its overall appearance and reduces signs of aging. If aging is getting you down, a simple Balance® treatment may boost your self-confidence and restore your youthful appearance. Dr. Buckingham specializes in providing smooth, natural-looking results for men and women.
The Belotero Balance® Procedure
Belotero Balance® is a hyaluronic acid injectable filler that adds volume and smooths lines and wrinkles. The amount of hyaluronic acid in our skin is naturally depleted as we age, and Belotero® replenishes this important substance during a simple in-office treatment. Each treatment produces instant results as it discreetly enhances facial contours and replaces lost hyaluronic acid. The treatment also moisturizes and hydrates the skin, which creates a radiant Belotero Balance® glow.
Belotero Balance® is a hyaluronic acid filler that is similar to Restylane® and Juvederm®, but it is constituted differently to treat superficial lines and wrinkles without appearing lumpy or creating a bluish hue that is referred to as the Tyndall effect. Belotero Balance® is ideal for redefining the lip border and treating the wrinkles and lines around the nose and mouth as well as other facial wrinkles and fold, including the following:

Frown lines in the glabellar region
Crow’s feet/Periorbital lines
Lines on the bridge of the nose
Nasolabial folds and smile lines
Perioral lines around the mouth and lips (pouting lines)
Marionette lines/folds around the mouth and chin (laugh lines)
Forehead lines (worry lines)
Under-the-eye hollows or circles

What to Expect During the Procedure
Professional nurse injectors Rene Thomas, R.N. and Laura Meyers, R.N. perform Belotero Balance at the Buckingham Center for Facial Plastic Surgery in Austin, Texas. Balance® injections are administered with a very fine needle to smooth moderate to severe lines and wrinkles. The procedure takes about 45 minutes, and the results are seen instantly as the lines and wrinkles are filled. Balance® quickly and evenly integrates into the skin to provide subtle, smooth and natural-looking changes. Dr. Buckingham’s nurses strategically fill wrinkles, folds, and hollows that are pre-determined during the consultation, giving each patient the more youthful and refreshed look that they desire.
Belotero Balance® Expectations
Belotero® is an excellent dermal filler that is used to restore a more youthful and radiant appearance. The moisturizing and rehydrating benefits of Belotero Balance® provide a healthy glow. Each treatment is customized to match the patient’s requests, and Dr. Buckingham discusses the expectations with each patient during their consultation. Belotero® smooths and fills lines, wrinkles, and folds, and the results last for approximately six months.
Belotero Balance® Recovery
Belotero Balance® requires little to no downtime or recovery period. The results are instant, and patients can immediately return to their regular work schedule and activities. Some minor bruising, swelling and redness can be experienced initially, but these symptoms quickly fade. Patients enjoy quick, natural-looking results that fade away lines and signs of aging.
Belotero Balance® Consultation
Dr. Buckingham meets privately with each patient. After reviewing their medical history, he asks about the specific goals and cosmetic concerns that brought the patient in for the consultation. Dr. Buckingham then completes a detailed facial analysis and provides each patient with a personalized treatment plan based on his or her goals. He explains the advantages and disadvantages of each recommended surgical or nonsurgical procedure, including Belotero Balance®. Although Dr. Buckingham offers several exceptional dermal fillers, he will only suggest the best filler for the patient. If Balance® is recommended, the injections may be completed during that visit.
The Ideal Belotero Balance® Candidate
The ideal Balance® candidate is a male or female who is in generally good health, over the age of 21, and has moderate to severe fine lines and wrinkles or volume depletion. The ideal Balance® candidate has reasonable expectations and understands that a filler provides great improvements but cannot achieve the significant or lasting benefits of a surgical procedure. Balance® may also be performed in conjunction with an additional surgical treatment, such as an eyebrow lift or rhinoplasty.
Filler Cost
Dr. Buckingham and the professionals at the Buckingham Center never pressure patients to have treatments completed. Financing packages are available that fit most budgets, and Balance® is priced similarly to other popular fillers. The cost will depend on the number of injections and vials of Balance® that are needed.

Belotero Balance® Questions and Answers
What is a Belotero Balance® Procedure?
Belotero Balance® is a hyaluronic acid injectable filler to contour and add volume to the face and to smooth moderate to severe lines and wrinkles. Balance® is recommended for patients who are over 21 years of age and desire cosmetic changes, such as a defined upper lip or a more youthful and refreshed appearance. The treatment provides natural-looking results and a soft glow with minimal side effects and no downtime.
What Should I Expect at My Belotero Balance® Consultation?
During your Belotero Balance® consultation, Dr. Buckingham will review your medical history and listen to your cosmetic desires and goals. After completing a full facial analysis, he will provide you with a customized treatment plan based on your desires. If it is determined that you will benefit from Balance®, you may have the treatment completed that same day or at another scheduled appointment.
Am I a Good Candidate for Belotero Balance®?
You may be a considered a good candidate for Balance® if you are over the age of 21 and in good health. During your consultation with Dr. Buckingham, he will examine your skin and complete a facial analysis to determine if you could achieve a more youthful appearance with Balance® injections.
Where is Belotero Balance® Performed?
Dr. Buckingham performs Balance® injection procedures at the Buckingham Center, where every patient’s privacy, comfort, and safety are prioritized.
Is Belotero Balance® painful?
Patients report experiencing only mild discomfort during Belotero® injections. To ensure the patient’s comfort, very fine needles are used and a local anesthetic, such as lidocaine, is applied before the treatment to numb the area.
What is the Recovery Period for Belotero Balance®?
A very short recovery time is needed after a Balance® treatment, and no downtime is required. Some site reactions like temporary redness, swelling or bruising may occur, but patients typically return to their usual routine immediately after the treatment.
When are Patients Released to Return to Work?
Belotero Balance® patients can return to work immediately after their treatment. If you desire to keep your treatment a secret from coworkers, you may prefer to have the procedure completed on your day off or before the weekend. Any redness and swelling will vanish quickly. If you have another treatment combined with Balance®, Dr. Buckingham will provide you with any additional instructions that are needed.
When Can I Resume Exercising after a Belotero Balance®?
You can resume exercising immediately after the Balance® treatment. The area around the injections may be sensitive for a few hours.
Does Belotero Balance® Have Risks?
Balance® is not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women or anyone under the age of 21. This is a safe treatment with few risks and minimal side effects. Individuals who bleed easily or who take blood thinners or other drugs to prevent blood clotting face a greater risk of bleeding or bruising at the injection site. People who are taking certain drugs, such as radiation therapy, may be at a higher risk for infection. Dr. Buckingham will discuss any potential risks with you during your consultation.
Plastic Surgeon Dr. Edward Buckingham is a respected facial surgeon who provides excellent non-surgical and surgical procedures for men and women residing in the Austin, TX, area.

Buckingham 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeOn February 27th, I saw Dr. Edward Buckingham for a blepharoplasty, treating my droopy eyes. Originally, I read about Dr. Buckingham online and was impressed by his approach to eyelid surgery. There were no other consultation appointments, as Dr. Buckingham had a great presence and bedside manner. We agreed there was a lot of excess skin across my upper lids that needed to be removed. My surgery went just as Dr. Buckingham explained and there were no complications. My expectations were more than met. I strongly want to encourage others to check out Dr. Buckingham before deciding on a plastic surgeon, as he is the best in Texas. Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted June 14, 2017 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeIt was on February 22nd that I had a facelift with Dr. Buckingham in Austin. It had been too many years since I first noticed my face looking tired and saggy, so I wanted to look younger, more rested, and rejuvenated. An in-law suggested Dr. Buckingham and from the get-go, I was impressed with his reputation and his manner. Although this was not a quick decision, I knew as soon as I met Dr. Buckingham that he was the surgeon for me. I did not want to change my appearance, just to look better. As my face has healed, I still look natural, but more awake and refreshed. This was a wonderful experience and one of the best decisions I have made for myself. I understand how nervous someone can be, thinking of plastic surgery, but Dr. Buckingham’s office will exceed your expectations in a safe and comforting environment.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted May 30, 2017 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr. Buckingham is an incredibly professional and helpful surgeon. A close friend referred him to me some time ago, and after checking into his reputation, I decided to pursue my dream of a facelift. Dr Buckingham performed my surgery in February of this year. I was so tired of the bags under my eyes, making me look exhausted all of the time. The final results from my facelift are extraordinary! There are no more bags along my lower eyelids and I look so much younger! I did not expect to be so elated about my results. Dr. Buckingham’s staff was also a charming bunch that really made me feel comfortable throughout the my procedure. Dr. Buckingham is the best in Austin for good reason, so everybody make an appointment to go see him!Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted May 15, 2017 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr. Edward Buckingham was the doctor to perform my facelift and Halo Laser resurfacing procedure back in January. I live in a small city and Dr. Buckingham’s name would often come up in town. Although I knew about Dr. Buckingham, I still interviewed over five different surgeons, but none of them made me feel as comfortable as Dr. Buckingham. He brought a conservative approach to surgery. One of the best things about Dr. Buckingham is that he did not need to use general anesthesia. The procedure was not nearly as painful as I expected, which was perfect. Dr. Buckingham did a wonderful job and I am extremely pleased with my result. As i am 53 years old, I’m getting divorced, I was hoping I could look better. The quality of my skin looks so much better. You could not believe how much better it looks. I am getting compliments left and right these days; looking prettier and more refreshed. Everyone at Dr. Buckingham’s office is so nice. As they only do faces this gives me so much confidence in Dr. Buckingham’s facial rejuvenation skills.

Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted May 1, 2017 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeMy life changed in November of 2016, the day I had my lower facelift and blepharoplasty with Dr. Buckingham. The experience was incredible. Dr. Buckingham has a great group of warm and welcoming staff, which really go out of their way to make you feel comfortable in his office. Never did I feel like someone was trying to sell me on anything. Dr. Buckingham is honest and candid in his assessment of your needs. I had just adopted a child and felt like I was too old and ‘angry looking’ in the face. Dr. Buckingham understood where I was coming from. I really love the results from Dr. Buckingham’s procedure. My eyes look so warm and awake now, taking years off my overall appearance. I love that I still look natural, however. What a wonderful experience!
Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted April 7, 2017 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeLast May, Dr. Buckingham performed my facelift procedure. The procedure went better than I could have dreamed. From the start, the staff at Dr. Buckingham's office made me feel so comfortable, which made a world of difference, as I was quite scared and emotional. Originally, Dr. Buckingham came to my attention on the Internet, when I was searching for the best face surgeon in Austin. His reviews were second to none. Then, at my consultation, Dr. Buckingham took his time to make me feel comfortable with my suggested procedure. No other doctor made me feel so confident. Now, I can say that my facelift has been life changing. My eyes are no longer drooping, giving me a refreshed and rejuvenated appearance. The whole experience was extremely positive. My surgery was certainly the right decision for me, and I will not hesitate to recommend Dr. Buckingham to someone else. Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted March 26, 2017 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI saw Dr. Buckingham for a revision rhinoplasty. My surgeon in New York recommended him, so I had Dr. Buckingham perform my procedure in February. I had a very deformed nose from my initial rhinoplasty in 2007. This was actually my fourth revision procedure. Dr. Buckingham was very competent and I am happy with my results. My nose looks symmetrical and Dr. Buckingham achieved exactly what he wanted.Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted March 1, 2017 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI had a rhinoplasty on March 9th with Dr. Buckingham; he was referred by my ENT. It seems that I was having some breathing issues from an old nasal injury, which had changed the appearance of my nose, as well. Dr. Buckingham was incredibly kind and knowledgeable. From the start, I felt comfortable in his care. Today, I am so happy with my results. Everyone at Dr. Buckingham's office was gracious, efficient, and kind. Connie Z.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted February 26, 2017 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr. Buckingham performed a neck lift in November. My experience at his office was nothing but wonderful. I was always comfortable: before, during, and after my surgery. My dermatologist originally recommended Dr. Buckingham, but right away during my consultation, I could tell I was in the best of hands. After losing a great deal of weight, I was starting to look older and had excess skin under my chin. Dr. Buckingham gave me a chance to look and feel my age again. The results from his neck lift are truly beyond my wildest expectations. If you are thinking about a neck lift, I recommend talking to Dr. Buckingham, as his work ethic and experience are well worth the trip. Mary G. Myers

There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).

Buckingham County is a rural United States county located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and containing the geographic center of the state. Buckingham County is part of the Piedmont region of Virginia, and the county seat is the town of Buckingham.[1]
Buckingham County was created in 1761 from the southeastern portion of Albemarle County and was predominantly farmland. The county was probably named in honor of the Duke of Buckingham, though the precise origin is uncertain. Several changes were made to the borders, until the existing boundaries were established in 1860.
As of the 2010 census, the county population was 17,146. The county experienced steady population growth over the preceding forty years.[2] Buckingham is part of the Charlottesville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

History[edit]
Buckingham County, lying south of the James River and in the Piedmont at the geographic center of the state, was established on May 1, 1761 from the southeastern portion of Albemarle County. The origin of the county name probably comes from the Duke of Buckingham (Buckinghamshire, England). Some sources say that the county was named for Archibald Cary's estate "Buckingham," which was located on Willis Creek.[3] This is the only Buckingham County in the United States.
In 1778 a small triangular area bordering the James River was given to Cumberland County. In 1845, another part was taken from Buckingham to form the northern portion of Appomattox County. A final adjustment of the Appomattox-Buckingham county line was made in 1860, and Buckingham's borders then became fixed in their current form. A fire destroyed the courthouse (designed by Thomas Jefferson) in 1869, and most of the early records of this county were lost.
In the nineteenth century the county was settled more heavily by people migrating from the Tidewater area. It was devoted chiefly to plantations, worked by enslaved African Americans. These were converted from tobacco cultivation to mixed farming and pulpwood harvesting as the markets changed and the soil became exhausted from tobacco. These new types of uses required fewer slaves, and many were sold from the Upper South in the domestic slave trade to the Deep South, where cotton cultivation expanded dramatically in the antebellum period.
In the 21st century, large tracts of land are held by companies such as WestVaco, which sell pulpwood and other timber products to the paper mills and wood product producers. It is still largely rural, with areas devoted to recreation such as fishing and hunting. The County is home to families who can trace their ancestry to the early colonial history of Virginia. Many families still live on tracts of land that were granted to their ancestors in that period. Some of the land grants were originally given to French Huguenots, who resettled from London, England in the southwestern part of the county in the early 1700s.
During the American Civil War, General Robert E. Lee’s army marched through the county during his retreat on their way to surrender at Appomattox, Virginia. A marker in the cemetery of Trinity Presbyterian Church in New Canton reads,
"According to the oral history of Trinity Presbyterian Church and this community, here are 45 Confederate and Union soldiers buried in mass graves directly behind this church. They left Appomattox after the surrender and headed for their homes north of here. Sick with disease, they died in a nearby camp. That they may not be forgotten, this plaque is placed by the Elliott Grays UDC Chapter #1877 2003."
In 2011, the county celebrated its 250th anniversary.[4]

Buckingham County is a rural United States county located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and containing the geographic center of the state. Buckingham County is part of the Piedmont region of Virginia, and the county seat is the town of Buckingham.[1]
Buckingham County was created in 1761 from the southeastern portion of Albemarle County and was predominantly farmland. The county was probably named in honor of the Duke of Buckingham, though the precise origin is uncertain. Several changes were made to the borders, until the existing boundaries were established in 1860.
As of the 2010 census, the county population was 17,146. The county experienced steady population growth over the preceding forty years.[2] Buckingham is part of the Charlottesville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

History[edit]
Buckingham County, lying south of the James River and in the Piedmont at the geographic center of the state, was established on May 1, 1761 from the southeastern portion of Albemarle County. The origin of the county name probably comes from the Duke of Buckingham (Buckinghamshire, England). Some sources say that the county was named for Archibald Cary's estate "Buckingham," which was located on Willis Creek.[3] This is the only Buckingham County in the United States.
In 1778 a small triangular area bordering the James River was given to Cumberland County. In 1845, another part was taken from Buckingham to form the northern portion of Appomattox County. A final adjustment of the Appomattox-Buckingham county line was made in 1860, and Buckingham's borders then became fixed in their current form. A fire destroyed the courthouse (designed by Thomas Jefferson) in 1869, and most of the early records of this county were lost.
In the nineteenth century the county was settled more heavily by people migrating from the Tidewater area. It was devoted chiefly to plantations, worked by enslaved African Americans. These were converted from tobacco cultivation to mixed farming and pulpwood harvesting as the markets changed and the soil became exhausted from tobacco. These new types of uses required fewer slaves, and many were sold from the Upper South in the domestic slave trade to the Deep South, where cotton cultivation expanded dramatically in the antebellum period.
In the 21st century, large tracts of land are held by companies such as WestVaco, which sell pulpwood and other timber products to the paper mills and wood product producers. It is still largely rural, with areas devoted to recreation such as fishing and hunting. The County is home to families who can trace their ancestry to the early colonial history of Virginia. Many families still live on tracts of land that were granted to their ancestors in that period. Some of the land grants were originally given to French Huguenots, who resettled from London, England in the southwestern part of the county in the early 1700s.
During the American Civil War, General Robert E. Lee’s army marched through the county during his retreat on their way to surrender at Appomattox, Virginia. A marker in the cemetery of Trinity Presbyterian Church in New Canton reads,
"According to the oral history of Trinity Presbyterian Church and this community, here are 45 Confederate and Union soldiers buried in mass graves directly behind this church. They left Appomattox after the surrender and headed for their homes north of here. Sick with disease, they died in a nearby camp. That they may not be forgotten, this plaque is placed by the Elliott Grays UDC Chapter #1877 2003."
In 2011, the county celebrated its 250th anniversary.[4]

Buckingham County is a rural United States county located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and containing the geographic center of the state. Buckingham County is part of the Piedmont region of Virginia, and the county seat is the town of Buckingham.[1]
Buckingham County was created in 1761 from the southeastern portion of Albemarle County and was predominantly farmland. The county was probably named in honor of the Duke of Buckingham, though the precise origin is uncertain. Several changes were made to the borders, until the existing boundaries were established in 1860.
As of the 2010 census, the county population was 17,146. The county experienced steady population growth over the preceding forty years.[2] Buckingham is part of the Charlottesville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

History[edit]
Buckingham County, lying south of the James River and in the Piedmont at the geographic center of the state, was established on May 1, 1761 from the southeastern portion of Albemarle County. The origin of the county name probably comes from the Duke of Buckingham (Buckinghamshire, England). Some sources say that the county was named for Archibald Cary's estate "Buckingham," which was located on Willis Creek.[3] This is the only Buckingham County in the United States.
In 1778 a small triangular area bordering the James River was given to Cumberland County. In 1845, another part was taken from Buckingham to form the northern portion of Appomattox County. A final adjustment of the Appomattox-Buckingham county line was made in 1860, and Buckingham's borders then became fixed in their current form. A fire destroyed the courthouse (designed by Thomas Jefferson) in 1869, and most of the early records of this county were lost.
In the nineteenth century the county was settled more heavily by people migrating from the Tidewater area. It was devoted chiefly to plantations, worked by enslaved African Americans. These were converted from tobacco cultivation to mixed farming and pulpwood harvesting as the markets changed and the soil became exhausted from tobacco. These new types of uses required fewer slaves, and many were sold from the Upper South in the domestic slave trade to the Deep South, where cotton cultivation expanded dramatically in the antebellum period.
In the 21st century, large tracts of land are held by companies such as WestVaco, which sell pulpwood and other timber products to the paper mills and wood product producers. It is still largely rural, with areas devoted to recreation such as fishing and hunting. The County is home to families who can trace their ancestry to the early colonial history of Virginia. Many families still live on tracts of land that were granted to their ancestors in that period. Some of the land grants were originally given to French Huguenots, who resettled from London, England in the southwestern part of the county in the early 1700s.
During the American Civil War, General Robert E. Lee’s army marched through the county during his retreat on their way to surrender at Appomattox, Virginia. A marker in the cemetery of Trinity Presbyterian Church in New Canton reads,
"According to the oral history of Trinity Presbyterian Church and this community, here are 45 Confederate and Union soldiers buried in mass graves directly behind this church. They left Appomattox after the surrender and headed for their homes north of here. Sick with disease, they died in a nearby camp. That they may not be forgotten, this plaque is placed by the Elliott Grays UDC Chapter #1877 2003."
In 2011, the county celebrated its 250th anniversary.[4]

History[edit]
Buckingham County, lying south of the James River and in the Piedmont at the geographic center of the state, was established on May 1, 1761 from the southeastern portion of Albemarle County. The origin of the county name probably comes from the Duke of Buckingham (Buckinghamshire, England). Some sources say that the county was named for Archibald Cary's estate "Buckingham," which was located on Willis Creek.[3] This is the only Buckingham County in the United States.
In 1778 a small triangular area bordering the James River was given to Cumberland County. In 1845, another part was taken from Buckingham to form the northern portion of Appomattox County. A final adjustment of the Appomattox-Buckingham county line was made in 1860, and Buckingham's borders then became fixed in their current form. A fire destroyed the courthouse (designed by Thomas Jefferson) in 1869, and most of the early records of this county were lost.
In the nineteenth century the county was settled more heavily by people migrating from the Tidewater area. It was devoted chiefly to plantations, worked by enslaved African Americans. These were converted from tobacco cultivation to mixed farming and pulpwood harvesting as the markets changed and the soil became exhausted from tobacco. These new types of uses required fewer slaves, and many were sold from the Upper South in the domestic slave trade to the Deep South, where cotton cultivation expanded dramatically in the antebellum period.
In the 21st century, large tracts of land are held by companies such as WestVaco, which sell pulpwood and other timber products to the paper mills and wood product producers. It is still largely rural, with areas devoted to recreation such as fishing and hunting. The County is home to families who can trace their ancestry to the early colonial history of Virginia. Many families still live on tracts of land that were granted to their ancestors in that period. Some of the land grants were originally given to French Huguenots, who resettled from London, England in the southwestern part of the county in the early 1700s.
During the American Civil War, General Robert E. Lee’s army marched through the county during his retreat on their way to surrender at Appomattox, Virginia. A marker in the cemetery of Trinity Presbyterian Church in New Canton reads,
"According to the oral history of Trinity Presbyterian Church and this community, here are 45 Confederate and Union soldiers buried in mass graves directly behind this church. They left Appomattox after the surrender and headed for their homes north of here. Sick with disease, they died in a nearby camp. That they may not be forgotten, this plaque is placed by the Elliott Grays UDC Chapter #1877 2003."
In 2011, the county celebrated its 250th anniversary.[4]

Buckingham County is a rural United States county located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and containing the geographic center of the state. Buckingham County is part of the Piedmont region of Virginia, and the county seat is the town of Buckingham.[1]
Buckingham County was created in 1761 from the southeastern portion of Albemarle County and was predominantly farmland. The county was probably named in honor of the Duke of Buckingham, though the precise origin is uncertain. Several changes were made to the borders, until the existing boundaries were established in 1860.
As of the 2010 census, the county population was 17,146. The county experienced steady population growth over the preceding forty years.[2] Buckingham is part of the Charlottesville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

History[edit]
Buckingham County, lying south of the James River and in the Piedmont at the geographic center of the state, was established on May 1, 1761 from the southeastern portion of Albemarle County. The origin of the county name probably comes from the Duke of Buckingham (Buckinghamshire, England). Some sources say that the county was named for Archibald Cary's estate "Buckingham," which was located on Willis Creek.[3] This is the only Buckingham County in the United States.
In 1778 a small triangular area bordering the James River was given to Cumberland County. In 1845, another part was taken from Buckingham to form the northern portion of Appomattox County. A final adjustment of the Appomattox-Buckingham county line was made in 1860, and Buckingham's borders then became fixed in their current form. A fire destroyed the courthouse (designed by Thomas Jefferson) in 1869, and most of the early records of this county were lost.
In the nineteenth century the county was settled more heavily by people migrating from the Tidewater area. It was devoted chiefly to plantations, worked by enslaved African Americans. These were converted from tobacco cultivation to mixed farming and pulpwood harvesting as the markets changed and the soil became exhausted from tobacco. These new types of uses required fewer slaves, and many were sold from the Upper South in the domestic slave trade to the Deep South, where cotton cultivation expanded dramatically in the antebellum period.
In the 21st century, large tracts of land are held by companies such as WestVaco, which sell pulpwood and other timber products to the paper mills and wood product producers. It is still largely rural, with areas devoted to recreation such as fishing and hunting. The County is home to families who can trace their ancestry to the early colonial history of Virginia. Many families still live on tracts of land that were granted to their ancestors in that period. Some of the land grants were originally given to French Huguenots, who resettled from London, England in the southwestern part of the county in the early 1700s.
During the American Civil War, General Robert E. Lee’s army marched through the county during his retreat on their way to surrender at Appomattox, Virginia. A marker in the cemetery of Trinity Presbyterian Church in New Canton reads,
"According to the oral history of Trinity Presbyterian Church and this community, here are 45 Confederate and Union soldiers buried in mass graves directly behind this church. They left Appomattox after the surrender and headed for their homes north of here. Sick with disease, they died in a nearby camp. That they may not be forgotten, this plaque is placed by the Elliott Grays UDC Chapter #1877 2003."
In 2011, the county celebrated its 250th anniversary.[4]
Geography[edit]

Buckingham County is a rural United States county located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and containing the geographic center of the state. Buckingham County is part of the Piedmont region of Virginia, and the county seat is the town of Buckingham.[1]
Buckingham County was created in 1761 from the southeastern portion of Albemarle County and was predominantly farmland. The county was probably named in honor of the Duke of Buckingham, though the precise origin is uncertain. Several changes were made to the borders, until the existing boundaries were established in 1860.
As of the 2010 census, the county population was 17,146. The county experienced steady population growth over the preceding forty years.[2] Buckingham is part of the Charlottesville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

History[edit]
Buckingham County, lying south of the James River and in the Piedmont at the geographic center of the state, was established on May 1, 1761 from the southeastern portion of Albemarle County. The origin of the county name probably comes from the Duke of Buckingham (Buckinghamshire, England). Some sources say that the county was named for Archibald Cary's estate "Buckingham," which was located on Willis Creek.[3] This is the only Buckingham County in the United States.
In 1778 a small triangular area bordering the James River was given to Cumberland County. In 1845, another part was taken from Buckingham to form the northern portion of Appomattox County. A final adjustment of the Appomattox-Buckingham county line was made in 1860, and Buckingham's borders then became fixed in their current form. A fire destroyed the courthouse (designed by Thomas Jefferson) in 1869, and most of the early records of this county were lost.
In the nineteenth century the county was settled more heavily by people migrating from the Tidewater area. It was devoted chiefly to plantations, worked by enslaved African Americans. These were converted from tobacco cultivation to mixed farming and pulpwood harvesting as the markets changed and the soil became exhausted from tobacco. These new types of uses required fewer slaves, and many were sold from the Upper South in the domestic slave trade to the Deep South, where cotton cultivation expanded dramatically in the antebellum period.
In the 21st century, large tracts of land are held by companies such as WestVaco, which sell pulpwood and other timber products to the paper mills and wood product producers. It is still largely rural, with areas devoted to recreation such as fishing and hunting. The County is home to families who can trace their ancestry to the early colonial history of Virginia. Many families still live on tracts of land that were granted to their ancestors in that period. Some of the land grants were originally given to French Huguenots, who resettled from London, England in the southwestern part of the county in the early 1700s.
During the American Civil War, General Robert E. Lee’s army marched through the county during his retreat on their way to surrender at Appomattox, Virginia. A marker in the cemetery of Trinity Presbyterian Church in New Canton reads,
"According to the oral history of Trinity Presbyterian Church and this community, here are 45 Confederate and Union soldiers buried in mass graves directly behind this church. They left Appomattox after the surrender and headed for their homes north of here. Sick with disease, they died in a nearby camp. That they may not be forgotten, this plaque is placed by the Elliott Grays UDC Chapter #1877 2003."
In 2011, the county celebrated its 250th anniversary.[4]

Buckingham County is a rural United States county located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and containing the geographic center of the state. Buckingham County is part of the Piedmont region of Virginia, and the county seat is the town of Buckingham.[1]
Buckingham County was created in 1761 from the southeastern portion of Albemarle County and was predominantly farmland. The county was probably named in honor of the Duke of Buckingham, though the precise origin is uncertain. Several changes were made to the borders, until the existing boundaries were established in 1860.
As of the 2010 census, the county population was 17,146. The county experienced steady population growth over the preceding forty years.[2] Buckingham is part of the Charlottesville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

History[edit]
Buckingham County, lying south of the James River and in the Piedmont at the geographic center of the state, was established on May 1, 1761 from the southeastern portion of Albemarle County. The origin of the county name probably comes from the Duke of Buckingham (Buckinghamshire, England). Some sources say that the county was named for Archibald Cary's estate "Buckingham," which was located on Willis Creek.[3] This is the only Buckingham County in the United States.
In 1778 a small triangular area bordering the James River was given to Cumberland County. In 1845, another part was taken from Buckingham to form the northern portion of Appomattox County. A final adjustment of the Appomattox-Buckingham county line was made in 1860, and Buckingham's borders then became fixed in their current form. A fire destroyed the courthouse (designed by Thomas Jefferson) in 1869, and most of the early records of this county were lost.
In the nineteenth century the county was settled more heavily by people migrating from the Tidewater area. It was devoted chiefly to plantations, worked by enslaved African Americans. These were converted from tobacco cultivation to mixed farming and pulpwood harvesting as the markets changed and the soil became exhausted from tobacco. These new types of uses required fewer slaves, and many were sold from the Upper South in the domestic slave trade to the Deep South, where cotton cultivation expanded dramatically in the antebellum period.
In the 21st century, large tracts of land are held by companies such as WestVaco, which sell pulpwood and other timber products to the paper mills and wood product producers. It is still largely rural, with areas devoted to recreation such as fishing and hunting. The County is home to families who can trace their ancestry to the early colonial history of Virginia. Many families still live on tracts of land that were granted to their ancestors in that period. Some of the land grants were originally given to French Huguenots, who resettled from London, England in the southwestern part of the county in the early 1700s.
During the American Civil War, General Robert E. Lee’s army marched through the county during his retreat on their way to surrender at Appomattox, Virginia. A marker in the cemetery of Trinity Presbyterian Church in New Canton reads,
"According to the oral history of Trinity Presbyterian Church and this community, here are 45 Confederate and Union soldiers buried in mass graves directly behind this church. They left Appomattox after the surrender and headed for their homes north of here. Sick with disease, they died in a nearby camp. That they may not be forgotten, this plaque is placed by the Elliott Grays UDC Chapter #1877 2003."
In 2011, the county celebrated its 250th anniversary.[4]

                        I was very impressed with Dr. Buckingham and his staff. In October, I saw the doctor for a mini facelift. From the beginning, the customer service at his office is the path of my imagination and extremely professional. Right away, everyone knows your name. They listened to my concerns and answered my questions. After my surgery, the office even sends me roses. Originally, I was referred to Dr. Buckingham by my dermatologist. I had lost over 100 pounds and had a ton of extra skin that made me look older and gave me the dreaded ‘turkey neck’. After the facelift with Dr. Buckingham, I easily look 15 years younger and I finally have my cheek bones back. I was amazed with my results and the level of care I was given. I recommend that everyone make an appointment with Dr. Buckingham.
