About CELLCO PARTNERSHIP

Verizon Communications is the #1 wireless phone service in the
US (ahead of rival AT&T Mobility) and the #2 US telecom
services provider overall (after AT&T ). The company's core
mobile business, Verizon Wireless, serves more than 146 million
connections. Verizon's wireline unit, with more than 18 million
voice connections, provides local telephone, long-distance,
internet access, and digital TV services to residential and
wholesale customers. In addition, Verizon offers a wide range of
telecom, managed network, and IT services to commercial and
government clients in more than 150 countries. Verizon has expanded
its video and advertising capabilities with the acquisitions of AOL
and Yahoo assets.
Operations
Verizon Communications' Verizon Wireless segment accounts for
70% of revenue. It operates one of the most extensive wireless
networks in the US and the largest 4G LTE and third-generation
Evolution-Data Optimized (EV-DO) networks. The 4G LTE network is
available to more than 98% of the US population.
The wireline segment, which provides about a quarter of revenue,
provides voice, data, and video communications products, and
enhanced services, including broadband video and data, corporate
networking services, data center and cloud services, security and
managed network services, and local and long distance voice
services. AOL and Verizon's telematics business are included in the
wireline segment. The segment also includes Verizon's Fios service,
which offers high-speed internet and TV. The company reported
nearly 6 million Fios internet and close to 5 million Fios video
subscribers at the end of 2016.
A corporate category supplies about 5% of revenue.


Geographic Reach
Verizon is all over the horizon, with a network that stretches
across the US and offices in more than 150 countries. The company
conducts research in San Francisco and Waltham, Massachusetts.


Sales and Marketing
Verizon sells its prepaid and postpaid wireless phone services
through its website, its own stores, and national retailers such as
Best Buy, Target, and Wal-Mart. It also has a dedicated
telemarketing sales force. The average retail customer account pays
about $144 a month.
The company is a major advertiser, with a coordinated program of
TV, print, radio, outdoor signage, internet, and point-of-sale
media promotions. Those Verizon ads, commercials, and other
promotional vehicles cost the company about $2.7 billion a year,
which is about two-thirds of what AT&T spends on
advertising.
Financial Performance
After several years of riding the wireless wave, Verizon's 2016
financial performance stumbled in the wake of changes in pricing
plans. Revenue dropped 4% to about $126 billion in 2016 from about
$132 million in 2015. Service revenue fell about $4 billion in 2016
because of lower retail postpaid service revenue as customers
flocked to unsubsidized service pricing. Equipment revenue rose
about $600 million in 2016 from better sales of smartphones under
the company's device payment program. Revenue from the wireline
business decreased about 2% in 2016 from declines in Global
Enterprise and Global Wholesale as well as a reduction in Fios
marketing activities during a month-and-a-half long union work
stoppage.
Verizon's net income slumped 27% to about $13 billion in 2016
from about $18 billion in 2015. The lower profit resulted mainly
from the revenue decrease as the company's operating expenses
increased just $361 million in 2016 from 2015.
Cash flow from operations was $23 billion in 2016, down from
about $39 billion in 2015. Some of the difference came from a
change in how Verizon monetizes device payments. It changed them
from receivables to asset-backed securitizations. That switches the
proceeds from operating activities to financing activities. It
means Verizon reports lower cash flow from operations, but does not
reduce the cash available to run the business.
Strategy
When its rivals slash prices on wireless service, Verizon
Communications touts the coverage, speed, and reliability of its
network. Maybe it costs a bit more, Verizon tells customers, but
the network is worth it. Verizon is investing to expand and
strengthen the network to develop new streams of revenue.
The company has committed to spend about $1.4 billion over the
next three years to extend its fiber optic cable network to improve
4G service and get ready for higher-speed 5G service in a few
years. It has contracted with Corning and the Italian fiber cable
maker Prysmian to supply more than 20 million fiber miles over the
next several years. In 2017 Verizon shelled out another $1.8
billion to buy the fiber network business of XO Communications. The
deal included metro rings in 45 of the top 50 US markets.
In Boston, Verizon is installing a fiber network to deliver
high-speed service to businesses and consumers. It plans to build
similar networks in several other markets. In another network
bolstering move, Verizon is installing small cell antennas on
utility poles and the like to improve network density and relieve
network congestion.
While wireless telephone service remains Verizon's main
business, the company is moving into markets that leverage its
network. With its telematics and Smart City initiatives, Verizon
looks to monetize data traffic through Internet of Things
applications.
Verizon wants to use its network to deliver its own content. Its
acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo (which closed in June 2017) provide
it with advertising technology and a range of content that could
open new revenue streams. Verizon maintains its go90 video platform
with content aimed millennials; daily use was about 30 minutes per
view in 2016. It also plans to launch a streaming service in
2017.
The company has assembled a digital rights portfolio that
includes the NFL and NBA and provides enhanced viewing options for
Verizon wireless customers. In 2017, Verizon agreed to pay about
$20 million to stream over the internet an NFL game from London.
Verizon can stream the game on any of its properties, including AOL
and Yahoo.
Mergers and Acquisitions
Verizon Communications agreed to buy Straight Path
Communications for more than $3 billion, gaining a trove of 28 GHz
and 39 GHz millimeter wave spectrum used in mobile communications.
The spectrum could give Verizon a boost in developing 5G
technology. Verizon outbid AT&T for Straight Path.
In 2016 Verizon bought Fleetmatics, a telematics company, for
about $2.4 billion. Verizon made Fleetmatics a part of its
telematics unit that focuses on fleet management, mobile workforce
services, and the Internet of Things.
Verizon acquired XO Holdings' wireline business, which owns and
operates one of the largest fiber-based IP and Ethernet networks,
for about $1.8 billion in February 2017. The purchase extends
Verizon's fiber tracks in the US.
Verizon's acquisition of AOL provides the carrier with boosts in
traffic for mobile and video as well as a strong presence in
programmatic advertising. AOL's ad technologies are to enable
Verizon to more precisely place ads in front of willing buyers. AOL
also brought several high-profile content sites, including the
Huffington Post, TechCrunch, and Engadget.
The Yahoo purchase, which concluded in 2017, brings some one
billion users, including 600 million on mobile devices (according
to Yahoo figures) to Verizon. The deal includes Yahoos news,
finance, and sports websites as well as Flickr and Tumblr. Also
important are the advertising assets that Brightroll, a
programmatic ad platform; Flurry, a mobile apps analytics service;
and Gemini, a native and search advertising service. Verizon was
the winning bidder in a process that took several months to work
through. In early 2017, Verizon lowered the amount it would for
Yahoo by $350 million, bringing the deal's value to $4.48 billion.
The move came after several hacking episodes exposed Yahoo to
liabilities. As part of the rejiggered deal, the companies will
split certain legal and financial liabilities.
In 2016 Verizon agreed to acquire Volicon, a provider of video
capture, archival, compliance monitoring and clip creation
workflow. The acquisition expands Verizon Digital Media Services as
a provider of technology and media services for broadcast and
online video.

Verizon Wireless (legally known as Cellco Partnership) is an American telecommunications company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon Communications, that offers wireless products and services. With 146 million subscribers as of April 2017, Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless telecommunications provider in the United States.[6]
The company is headquartered in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. It was founded in 2000 as a joint venture of American telecommunications firm Bell Atlantic, which would soon become Verizon Communications, and British multinational telecommunications company Vodafone.[7] Verizon Communications became sole owner in 2014 by buying Vodafone's 45-percent stake in the company.[8]
It operates a national 4G LTE network covering about 98 percent of the U.S. population,[9] which in December 2015 won or tied for top honors in each category of the RootMetrics RootScore Reports.[10] Verizon Wireless offers mobile phone services through a variety of devices.[11] Its LTE in Rural America Program, with 21 rural wireless carriers participating, covers 2.7 million potential users in 169 rural counties.[12] Verizon Wireless announced in 2015 that it was developing a 5G, or fifth generation, network.[13]

History[edit]
In September 1999, American phone company Bell Atlantic and U.K.-based Vodafone Airtouch PLC proposed they would create a new wireless phone service joint venture valued at $70 billion.[14] The joint venture was being created as Bell Atlantic underwent a merger with GTE Corporation. In April 2000, the companies announced that the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger would take the name Verizon and that the Bell Atlantic-Vodafone wireless unit would be called Verizon Wireless (legally Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless).[15] Verizon Communications owned 55 percent of Verizon Wireless while Vodafone retained 45 percent ownership.[7] Regulators with the Federal Communications Commission approved the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger June 16, 2000,[16] creating the largest wireless company in the U.S.[17] Verizon Wireless held this market position until Cingular acquired AT&T Wireless Services in 2004.[18]
Throughout the 2000s, Verizon acquired several wireless phone companies and assets across the country, including West Virginia Wireless in 2006;[19] Ramcell in 2007;[20] Rural Cellular Corporation[21] and SureWest Communications, both in 2008.[22] Also in 2008, Verizon struck a deal to buy Alltel for $5.9 billion in equity while assuming $22.2 billion worth of debt.[23][24] The deal finalized January 9, 2009, again making Verizon Wireless the country's biggest cellphone network.[23] As per the agreement, Verizon sold rural wireless properties across 18 states to AT&T. Those properties were in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming.[25] Verizon's acquisitions continued in the 2010s, including the purchases of some Plateau Wireless markets in 2012[26] and Golden State Cellular's operator in 2014.[27]
Majority owner Verizon Communications became sole owner of its wireless business in 2014, when it bought Vodafone's 45 percent stake. Vodafone received $58.9 billion cash, $60.2 billion in stock and $11 billion in other transactions.[8][28] An article in The New York Times estimated Verizon Wireless' valuation at about $290 billion.[8]
In late 2014, it became known that Verizon Wireless uses deep packet inspection for server-side insertion of a customer-unique ID field ("X-UIDH") into all unencrypted HTTP headers. The mechanism has been referred to as "supercookie" or "perma-cookie", although it is not technically a cookie in that it does not store information on the customers device and is transparent to the user. It can not be averted with common mechanisms like ad-blockers; however it can not be inserted into encrypted HTTPS and VPN connections. Verizon advertises the system to marketing partners. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has called on Verizon to terminate the program, calling it a "profound violation of trust", expressing concern over abuse by third parties, and questioning the legality of Verizon modifying their users' outgoing data without offering them the possibility of a full opt-out.[29][30][31][32][33] In January 2015, Verizon announced they would give customers the option of opting out, and as of April 1, 2015, Verizon now allows customers to opt-out either online or calling a special phone number.[34]
In August 2016, Verizon hired Ronan Dunne, the former head of British provider O2, as the new president of its wireless business.[35]
In September 2016, Comcast confirmed that it planned to launch a mobile service, using Verizon's network as an MVNO, in mid-2017.[36][37]
In February 2017, in the wake of competition from Sprint and T-Mobile, and initiatives to expand the capacity and improve the quality of its network by using macrocells and supporting carrier aggregation, Verizon announced that it would bring back an "unlimited" data plan (subject to throttling in heavy network areas after 22 GB of usage). Verizon's decision not to restrict the bitrate of video services prompted Sprint and T-Mobile to remove similar restrictions from their own plans.[38]
In March 2017, Verizon announced that all their Android phones will have AppFlash, to help users find content and services across different apps.[39] Critics spoke harshly against it.[40]
Network[edit]
Verizon Wireless operates a 4G LTE network, which, as of January 2016, covers about 98 percent of the U.S.[41] Before their LTE network was launched, they operated an exclusively CDMA2000 network (the other major CDMA2000 carrier in the US being Sprint). Verizon began its initial tests for the 4G LTE network in 2008[13] in order to move from older-generation mobile communications technologies to the emerging global standard.[42] In December 2010, Verizon Wireless launched a fledgling 4G LTE network in 39 markets.[43] By December 2011, only a year after launch, 200 million Americans were covered with 4G LTE, and 190 markets were covered.[44] As of 2016, 98% percent of the U.S. is covered with LTE, and 92% of all data traffic is on LTE.[45]
In 2012, the service provider bought spectrum from the country's biggest cable companies, including Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks to improve its data network across the U.S.[46] The new capacity allowed Verizon to launch what it calls XLTE (LTE on Band 4) in 2013, providing more capacity in congested and well-populated markets.[47]
Because 4G LTE is a data-transmitting network, when it launched, Verizon customers' voice calls were still carried over the company's CDMA2000 network,[48] which was developed for 3G cellphones. In September 2014, Verizon launched voice over LTE (VoLTE);[49] this allowed voice calls to transmit via the data-only LTE network. This also allows for simultaneous voice and data services, something that is unavailable on traditional CDMA2000 calls. Along with VoLTE, Verizon also announced support for HD Voice, which provides higher quality audio for VoLTE calls, and native Video Calling for Android phones. In March 2016, Verizon enabled support for Wi-Fi Calling, which allows calls to be placed over a Wi-Fi Network. As of August 2015, nearly 4 million of Verizon's 103.7 million subscribers used VoLTE.[49]
A report by RootMetrics on carrier performance in the first half of 2015 ranked Verizon's network as the best in overall national performance, network reliability, network speed, data performance and call performance.[50] For the second half of 2015, RootMetrics's RootScore Report ranked Verizon Wireless No. 1 in overall performance, network speed, network reliability, call performance and data performance.[10] Verizon Wireless and AT&T tied for first in text performance.[10]
In September 2015, Verizon's chief information and technology architect Roger Gurnani stated that Verizon was planning to trial a 5G wireless network within 12 months, with "some level of commercial deployment" by 2017.[13] In late-August 2016, Verizon officially announced that it had rolled out LTE Advanced services in 461 markets. The company promoted that the technology would allow at least 50% higher LTE data speeds on supported devices.[51]

Apps[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers certain applications and services that are exclusive to its subscribers. Many of these apps are pre-loaded on Verizon devices—primarily Android smartphones. The company has received criticism for this practice, as users and critics have viewed the applications to be "bloatware" that are sometimes redundant to applications already included with the device's operating system.[57][58][59]
The NFL Mobile app allows Verizon Wireless subscribers to stream National Football League games and NFL Network on their devices. While previously a subscription-based service, NFL Mobile was made free to all subscribers beginning in the 2015 NFL season. As part of an exclusivity agreement with the NFL, only Verizon Wireless subscribers may stream NFL telecasts to smartphones.[60][61][62] As part of a similar deal that also granted the carrier title sponsorship of the series, Verizon also has exclusivity on phone streaming of Verizon IndyCar Series races via its official app.[63]
The My Verizon app is used for account management, including checking usage statistics and managing the user's service plan and account features.[64][65][66] Verizon Cloud, which allows photos, videos, contacts, messages and call logs to be synchronized online, was released in April 2013 initially for Android phones,[67] followed the next month by a launch for iOS.[67][68][68] Verizon Messages, otherwise known as Message+, is an alternate text messaging app that additionally allows messages to be synchronized between multiple devices.[69] VZ Navigator is a subscription-based maps and navigation service which provides turn-by-turn navigation, crowdsourced traffic data, weather, events and entertainment listings, gas prices, roadside assistance, 2D and 3D views.[70] The Verizon Support & Protection app provides technical support services, lost device location, and on Android, antivirus functionality.[71]
Verizon Family Locator is a subscription-based service and app can be used to track the locations of family members on a map for up to 10 devices.[72][73] Verizon Family Base allows parents to restrict when and how their children use their phones, view their children's contacts and lock the devices.[73][74] Verizon also offers the GizmoPal, a wristband-worn phone for children that is restricted to only placing or receiving calls from one of two designated caregivers, and has GPS tracking.[75][76]
Other Verizon Wireless apps include Field Force Manager, which allows employers to manage employees with GPS, management timesheets and oversee travel,[77] Visual Voice Mail[78] and Roadside Assistance.[79][80]
Products and services[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers cellphones, home telephone, and Internet services through a variety of devices.
Wireless phone services[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers smartphones powered by Apple's iOS, Google's Android, Microsoft's Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS.[11] Its basic phones use Verizon's 3G network, while the smartphones use their 4G LTE network.[11] The company offers different voice and data plans for its users.[81][82]
Wireless home phone[edit]
Introduced in February 2011 as Verizon Wireless Home Phone Connect, Wireless Home Phone uses Verizon's cellular network rather than using traditional landline wires to provide home phone service.[83]
Mobile Wi-Fi and broadband[edit]
Verizon Wireless sells Wi-Fi hotspot devices, including Jetpack 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot AC791L and Jetpack MiFi 6620L.[84] Verizon Wireless' home Internet services includes 4G LTE Broadband Router with Voice that can power a home's wireless network and connect up to 10 devices and a home phone.[85]
LTE in Rural America[edit]
The LTE in Rural America Program (or LRA program), introduced in May 2010, covers 2.7 million potential users over 225,000 miles in 169 rural counties.[12] Currently, 21 rural wireless carriers participate in the program. Under this program, partners lease spectrum from Verizon Wireless and connect to the company's network, and Verizon provides technical support and resources to help the rural wireless company build out its own 4G LTE network. The program extends the footprint of 4G LTE coverage for both the rural carrier and Verizon, as customers can take advantage of both networks.[86] As of 2015, all LRA members have fully rolled out their 4G LTE networks.

Verizon Wireless (legally known as Cellco Partnership) is an American telecommunications company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon Communications, that offers wireless products and services. With 146 million subscribers as of April 2017, Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless telecommunications provider in the United States.[6]
The company is headquartered in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. It was founded in 2000 as a joint venture of American telecommunications firm Bell Atlantic, which would soon become Verizon Communications, and British multinational telecommunications company Vodafone.[7] Verizon Communications became sole owner in 2014 by buying Vodafone's 45-percent stake in the company.[8]
It operates a national 4G LTE network covering about 98 percent of the U.S. population,[9] which in December 2015 won or tied for top honors in each category of the RootMetrics RootScore Reports.[10] Verizon Wireless offers mobile phone services through a variety of devices.[11] Its LTE in Rural America Program, with 21 rural wireless carriers participating, covers 2.7 million potential users in 169 rural counties.[12] Verizon Wireless announced in 2015 that it was developing a 5G, or fifth generation, network.[13]

History[edit]
In September 1999, American phone company Bell Atlantic and U.K.-based Vodafone Airtouch PLC proposed they would create a new wireless phone service joint venture valued at $70 billion.[14] The joint venture was being created as Bell Atlantic underwent a merger with GTE Corporation. In April 2000, the companies announced that the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger would take the name Verizon and that the Bell Atlantic-Vodafone wireless unit would be called Verizon Wireless (legally Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless).[15] Verizon Communications owned 55 percent of Verizon Wireless while Vodafone retained 45 percent ownership.[7] Regulators with the Federal Communications Commission approved the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger June 16, 2000,[16] creating the largest wireless company in the U.S.[17] Verizon Wireless held this market position until Cingular acquired AT&T Wireless Services in 2004.[18]
Throughout the 2000s, Verizon acquired several wireless phone companies and assets across the country, including West Virginia Wireless in 2006;[19] Ramcell in 2007;[20] Rural Cellular Corporation[21] and SureWest Communications, both in 2008.[22] Also in 2008, Verizon struck a deal to buy Alltel for $5.9 billion in equity while assuming $22.2 billion worth of debt.[23][24] The deal finalized January 9, 2009, again making Verizon Wireless the country's biggest cellphone network.[23] As per the agreement, Verizon sold rural wireless properties across 18 states to AT&T. Those properties were in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming.[25] Verizon's acquisitions continued in the 2010s, including the purchases of some Plateau Wireless markets in 2012[26] and Golden State Cellular's operator in 2014.[27]
Majority owner Verizon Communications became sole owner of its wireless business in 2014, when it bought Vodafone's 45 percent stake. Vodafone received $58.9 billion cash, $60.2 billion in stock and $11 billion in other transactions.[8][28] An article in The New York Times estimated Verizon Wireless' valuation at about $290 billion.[8]
In late 2014, it became known that Verizon Wireless uses deep packet inspection for server-side insertion of a customer-unique ID field ("X-UIDH") into all unencrypted HTTP headers. The mechanism has been referred to as "supercookie" or "perma-cookie", although it is not technically a cookie in that it does not store information on the customers device and is transparent to the user. It can not be averted with common mechanisms like ad-blockers; however it can not be inserted into encrypted HTTPS and VPN connections. Verizon advertises the system to marketing partners. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has called on Verizon to terminate the program, calling it a "profound violation of trust", expressing concern over abuse by third parties, and questioning the legality of Verizon modifying their users' outgoing data without offering them the possibility of a full opt-out.[29][30][31][32][33] In January 2015, Verizon announced they would give customers the option of opting out, and as of April 1, 2015, Verizon now allows customers to opt-out either online or calling a special phone number.[34]
In August 2016, Verizon hired Ronan Dunne, the former head of British provider O2, as the new president of its wireless business.[35]
In September 2016, Comcast confirmed that it planned to launch a mobile service, using Verizon's network as an MVNO, in mid-2017.[36][37]
In February 2017, in the wake of competition from Sprint and T-Mobile, and initiatives to expand the capacity and improve the quality of its network by using macrocells and supporting carrier aggregation, Verizon announced that it would bring back an "unlimited" data plan (subject to throttling in heavy network areas after 22 GB of usage). Verizon's decision not to restrict the bitrate of video services prompted Sprint and T-Mobile to remove similar restrictions from their own plans.[38]
In March 2017, Verizon announced that all their Android phones will have AppFlash, to help users find content and services across different apps.[39] Critics spoke harshly against it.[40]
Network[edit]
Verizon Wireless operates a 4G LTE network, which, as of January 2016, covers about 98 percent of the U.S.[41] Before their LTE network was launched, they operated an exclusively CDMA2000 network (the other major CDMA2000 carrier in the US being Sprint). Verizon began its initial tests for the 4G LTE network in 2008[13] in order to move from older-generation mobile communications technologies to the emerging global standard.[42] In December 2010, Verizon Wireless launched a fledgling 4G LTE network in 39 markets.[43] By December 2011, only a year after launch, 200 million Americans were covered with 4G LTE, and 190 markets were covered.[44] As of 2016, 98% percent of the U.S. is covered with LTE, and 92% of all data traffic is on LTE.[45]
In 2012, the service provider bought spectrum from the country's biggest cable companies, including Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks to improve its data network across the U.S.[46] The new capacity allowed Verizon to launch what it calls XLTE (LTE on Band 4) in 2013, providing more capacity in congested and well-populated markets.[47]
Because 4G LTE is a data-transmitting network, when it launched, Verizon customers' voice calls were still carried over the company's CDMA2000 network,[48] which was developed for 3G cellphones. In September 2014, Verizon launched voice over LTE (VoLTE);[49] this allowed voice calls to transmit via the data-only LTE network. This also allows for simultaneous voice and data services, something that is unavailable on traditional CDMA2000 calls. Along with VoLTE, Verizon also announced support for HD Voice, which provides higher quality audio for VoLTE calls, and native Video Calling for Android phones. In March 2016, Verizon enabled support for Wi-Fi Calling, which allows calls to be placed over a Wi-Fi Network. As of August 2015, nearly 4 million of Verizon's 103.7 million subscribers used VoLTE.[49]
A report by RootMetrics on carrier performance in the first half of 2015 ranked Verizon's network as the best in overall national performance, network reliability, network speed, data performance and call performance.[50] For the second half of 2015, RootMetrics's RootScore Report ranked Verizon Wireless No. 1 in overall performance, network speed, network reliability, call performance and data performance.[10] Verizon Wireless and AT&T tied for first in text performance.[10]
In September 2015, Verizon's chief information and technology architect Roger Gurnani stated that Verizon was planning to trial a 5G wireless network within 12 months, with "some level of commercial deployment" by 2017.[13] In late-August 2016, Verizon officially announced that it had rolled out LTE Advanced services in 461 markets. The company promoted that the technology would allow at least 50% higher LTE data speeds on supported devices.[51]

Apps[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers certain applications and services that are exclusive to its subscribers. Many of these apps are pre-loaded on Verizon devices—primarily Android smartphones. The company has received criticism for this practice, as users and critics have viewed the applications to be "bloatware" that are sometimes redundant to applications already included with the device's operating system.[57][58][59]
The NFL Mobile app allows Verizon Wireless subscribers to stream National Football League games and NFL Network on their devices. While previously a subscription-based service, NFL Mobile was made free to all subscribers beginning in the 2015 NFL season. As part of an exclusivity agreement with the NFL, only Verizon Wireless subscribers may stream NFL telecasts to smartphones.[60][61][62] As part of a similar deal that also granted the carrier title sponsorship of the series, Verizon also has exclusivity on phone streaming of Verizon IndyCar Series races via its official app.[63]
The My Verizon app is used for account management, including checking usage statistics and managing the user's service plan and account features.[64][65][66] Verizon Cloud, which allows photos, videos, contacts, messages and call logs to be synchronized online, was released in April 2013 initially for Android phones,[67] followed the next month by a launch for iOS.[67][68][68] Verizon Messages, otherwise known as Message+, is an alternate text messaging app that additionally allows messages to be synchronized between multiple devices.[69] VZ Navigator is a subscription-based maps and navigation service which provides turn-by-turn navigation, crowdsourced traffic data, weather, events and entertainment listings, gas prices, roadside assistance, 2D and 3D views.[70] The Verizon Support & Protection app provides technical support services, lost device location, and on Android, antivirus functionality.[71]
Verizon Family Locator is a subscription-based service and app can be used to track the locations of family members on a map for up to 10 devices.[72][73] Verizon Family Base allows parents to restrict when and how their children use their phones, view their children's contacts and lock the devices.[73][74] Verizon also offers the GizmoPal, a wristband-worn phone for children that is restricted to only placing or receiving calls from one of two designated caregivers, and has GPS tracking.[75][76]
Other Verizon Wireless apps include Field Force Manager, which allows employers to manage employees with GPS, management timesheets and oversee travel,[77] Visual Voice Mail[78] and Roadside Assistance.[79][80]
Products and services[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers cellphones, home telephone, and Internet services through a variety of devices.
Wireless phone services[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers smartphones powered by Apple's iOS, Google's Android, Microsoft's Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS.[11] Its basic phones use Verizon's 3G network, while the smartphones use their 4G LTE network.[11] The company offers different voice and data plans for its users.[81][82]
Wireless home phone[edit]
Introduced in February 2011 as Verizon Wireless Home Phone Connect, Wireless Home Phone uses Verizon's cellular network rather than using traditional landline wires to provide home phone service.[83]
Mobile Wi-Fi and broadband[edit]
Verizon Wireless sells Wi-Fi hotspot devices, including Jetpack 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot AC791L and Jetpack MiFi 6620L.[84] Verizon Wireless' home Internet services includes 4G LTE Broadband Router with Voice that can power a home's wireless network and connect up to 10 devices and a home phone.[85]
LTE in Rural America[edit]
The LTE in Rural America Program (or LRA program), introduced in May 2010, covers 2.7 million potential users over 225,000 miles in 169 rural counties.[12] Currently, 21 rural wireless carriers participate in the program. Under this program, partners lease spectrum from Verizon Wireless and connect to the company's network, and Verizon provides technical support and resources to help the rural wireless company build out its own 4G LTE network. The program extends the footprint of 4G LTE coverage for both the rural carrier and Verizon, as customers can take advantage of both networks.[86] As of 2015, all LRA members have fully rolled out their 4G LTE networks.

Verizon Wireless (legally known as Cellco Partnership) is an American telecommunications company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon Communications, that offers wireless products and services. With 146 million subscribers as of April 2017, Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless telecommunications provider in the United States.[6]
The company is headquartered in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. It was founded in 2000 as a joint venture of American telecommunications firm Bell Atlantic, which would soon become Verizon Communications, and British multinational telecommunications company Vodafone.[7] Verizon Communications became sole owner in 2014 by buying Vodafone's 45-percent stake in the company.[8]
It operates a national 4G LTE network covering about 98 percent of the U.S. population,[9] which in December 2015 won or tied for top honors in each category of the RootMetrics RootScore Reports.[10] Verizon Wireless offers mobile phone services through a variety of devices.[11] Its LTE in Rural America Program, with 21 rural wireless carriers participating, covers 2.7 million potential users in 169 rural counties.[12] Verizon Wireless announced in 2015 that it was developing a 5G, or fifth generation, network.[13]

History[edit]
In September 1999, American phone company Bell Atlantic and U.K.-based Vodafone Airtouch PLC proposed they would create a new wireless phone service joint venture valued at $70 billion.[14] The joint venture was being created as Bell Atlantic underwent a merger with GTE Corporation. In April 2000, the companies announced that the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger would take the name Verizon and that the Bell Atlantic-Vodafone wireless unit would be called Verizon Wireless (legally Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless).[15] Verizon Communications owned 55 percent of Verizon Wireless while Vodafone retained 45 percent ownership.[7] Regulators with the Federal Communications Commission approved the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger June 16, 2000,[16] creating the largest wireless company in the U.S.[17] Verizon Wireless held this market position until Cingular acquired AT&T Wireless Services in 2004.[18]
Throughout the 2000s, Verizon acquired several wireless phone companies and assets across the country, including West Virginia Wireless in 2006;[19] Ramcell in 2007;[20] Rural Cellular Corporation[21] and SureWest Communications, both in 2008.[22] Also in 2008, Verizon struck a deal to buy Alltel for $5.9 billion in equity while assuming $22.2 billion worth of debt.[23][24] The deal finalized January 9, 2009, again making Verizon Wireless the country's biggest cellphone network.[23] As per the agreement, Verizon sold rural wireless properties across 18 states to AT&T. Those properties were in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming.[25] Verizon's acquisitions continued in the 2010s, including the purchases of some Plateau Wireless markets in 2012[26] and Golden State Cellular's operator in 2014.[27]
Majority owner Verizon Communications became sole owner of its wireless business in 2014, when it bought Vodafone's 45 percent stake. Vodafone received $58.9 billion cash, $60.2 billion in stock and $11 billion in other transactions.[8][28] An article in The New York Times estimated Verizon Wireless' valuation at about $290 billion.[8]
In late 2014, it became known that Verizon Wireless uses deep packet inspection for server-side insertion of a customer-unique ID field ("X-UIDH") into all unencrypted HTTP headers. The mechanism has been referred to as "supercookie" or "perma-cookie", although it is not technically a cookie in that it does not store information on the customers device and is transparent to the user. It can not be averted with common mechanisms like ad-blockers; however it can not be inserted into encrypted HTTPS and VPN connections. Verizon advertises the system to marketing partners. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has called on Verizon to terminate the program, calling it a "profound violation of trust", expressing concern over abuse by third parties, and questioning the legality of Verizon modifying their users' outgoing data without offering them the possibility of a full opt-out.[29][30][31][32][33] In January 2015, Verizon announced they would give customers the option of opting out, and as of April 1, 2015, Verizon now allows customers to opt-out either online or calling a special phone number.[34]
In August 2016, Verizon hired Ronan Dunne, the former head of British provider O2, as the new president of its wireless business.[35]
In September 2016, Comcast confirmed that it planned to launch a mobile service, using Verizon's network as an MVNO, in mid-2017.[36][37]
In February 2017, in the wake of competition from Sprint and T-Mobile, and initiatives to expand the capacity and improve the quality of its network by using macrocells and supporting carrier aggregation, Verizon announced that it would bring back an "unlimited" data plan (subject to throttling in heavy network areas after 22 GB of usage). Verizon's decision not to restrict the bitrate of video services prompted Sprint and T-Mobile to remove similar restrictions from their own plans.[38]
In March 2017, Verizon announced that all their Android phones will have AppFlash, to help users find content and services across different apps.[39] Critics spoke harshly against it.[40]
Network[edit]
Verizon Wireless operates a 4G LTE network, which, as of January 2016, covers about 98 percent of the U.S.[41] Before their LTE network was launched, they operated an exclusively CDMA2000 network (the other major CDMA2000 carrier in the US being Sprint). Verizon began its initial tests for the 4G LTE network in 2008[13] in order to move from older-generation mobile communications technologies to the emerging global standard.[42] In December 2010, Verizon Wireless launched a fledgling 4G LTE network in 39 markets.[43] By December 2011, only a year after launch, 200 million Americans were covered with 4G LTE, and 190 markets were covered.[44] As of 2016, 98% percent of the U.S. is covered with LTE, and 92% of all data traffic is on LTE.[45]
In 2012, the service provider bought spectrum from the country's biggest cable companies, including Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks to improve its data network across the U.S.[46] The new capacity allowed Verizon to launch what it calls XLTE (LTE on Band 4) in 2013, providing more capacity in congested and well-populated markets.[47]
Because 4G LTE is a data-transmitting network, when it launched, Verizon customers' voice calls were still carried over the company's CDMA2000 network,[48] which was developed for 3G cellphones. In September 2014, Verizon launched voice over LTE (VoLTE);[49] this allowed voice calls to transmit via the data-only LTE network. This also allows for simultaneous voice and data services, something that is unavailable on traditional CDMA2000 calls. Along with VoLTE, Verizon also announced support for HD Voice, which provides higher quality audio for VoLTE calls, and native Video Calling for Android phones. In March 2016, Verizon enabled support for Wi-Fi Calling, which allows calls to be placed over a Wi-Fi Network. As of August 2015, nearly 4 million of Verizon's 103.7 million subscribers used VoLTE.[49]
A report by RootMetrics on carrier performance in the first half of 2015 ranked Verizon's network as the best in overall national performance, network reliability, network speed, data performance and call performance.[50] For the second half of 2015, RootMetrics's RootScore Report ranked Verizon Wireless No. 1 in overall performance, network speed, network reliability, call performance and data performance.[10] Verizon Wireless and AT&T tied for first in text performance.[10]
In September 2015, Verizon's chief information and technology architect Roger Gurnani stated that Verizon was planning to trial a 5G wireless network within 12 months, with "some level of commercial deployment" by 2017.[13] In late-August 2016, Verizon officially announced that it had rolled out LTE Advanced services in 461 markets. The company promoted that the technology would allow at least 50% higher LTE data speeds on supported devices.[51]

Apps[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers certain applications and services that are exclusive to its subscribers. Many of these apps are pre-loaded on Verizon devices—primarily Android smartphones. The company has received criticism for this practice, as users and critics have viewed the applications to be "bloatware" that are sometimes redundant to applications already included with the device's operating system.[57][58][59]
The NFL Mobile app allows Verizon Wireless subscribers to stream National Football League games and NFL Network on their devices. While previously a subscription-based service, NFL Mobile was made free to all subscribers beginning in the 2015 NFL season. As part of an exclusivity agreement with the NFL, only Verizon Wireless subscribers may stream NFL telecasts to smartphones.[60][61][62] As part of a similar deal that also granted the carrier title sponsorship of the series, Verizon also has exclusivity on phone streaming of Verizon IndyCar Series races via its official app.[63]
The My Verizon app is used for account management, including checking usage statistics and managing the user's service plan and account features.[64][65][66] Verizon Cloud, which allows photos, videos, contacts, messages and call logs to be synchronized online, was released in April 2013 initially for Android phones,[67] followed the next month by a launch for iOS.[67][68][68] Verizon Messages, otherwise known as Message+, is an alternate text messaging app that additionally allows messages to be synchronized between multiple devices.[69] VZ Navigator is a subscription-based maps and navigation service which provides turn-by-turn navigation, crowdsourced traffic data, weather, events and entertainment listings, gas prices, roadside assistance, 2D and 3D views.[70] The Verizon Support & Protection app provides technical support services, lost device location, and on Android, antivirus functionality.[71]
Verizon Family Locator is a subscription-based service and app can be used to track the locations of family members on a map for up to 10 devices.[72][73] Verizon Family Base allows parents to restrict when and how their children use their phones, view their children's contacts and lock the devices.[73][74] Verizon also offers the GizmoPal, a wristband-worn phone for children that is restricted to only placing or receiving calls from one of two designated caregivers, and has GPS tracking.[75][76]
Other Verizon Wireless apps include Field Force Manager, which allows employers to manage employees with GPS, management timesheets and oversee travel,[77] Visual Voice Mail[78] and Roadside Assistance.[79][80]
Products and services[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers cellphones, home telephone, and Internet services through a variety of devices.
Wireless phone services[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers smartphones powered by Apple's iOS, Google's Android, Microsoft's Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS.[11] Its basic phones use Verizon's 3G network, while the smartphones use their 4G LTE network.[11] The company offers different voice and data plans for its users.[81][82]
Wireless home phone[edit]
Introduced in February 2011 as Verizon Wireless Home Phone Connect, Wireless Home Phone uses Verizon's cellular network rather than using traditional landline wires to provide home phone service.[83]
Mobile Wi-Fi and broadband[edit]
Verizon Wireless sells Wi-Fi hotspot devices, including Jetpack 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot AC791L and Jetpack MiFi 6620L.[84] Verizon Wireless' home Internet services includes 4G LTE Broadband Router with Voice that can power a home's wireless network and connect up to 10 devices and a home phone.[85]
LTE in Rural America[edit]
The LTE in Rural America Program (or LRA program), introduced in May 2010, covers 2.7 million potential users over 225,000 miles in 169 rural counties.[12] Currently, 21 rural wireless carriers participate in the program. Under this program, partners lease spectrum from Verizon Wireless and connect to the company's network, and Verizon provides technical support and resources to help the rural wireless company build out its own 4G LTE network. The program extends the footprint of 4G LTE coverage for both the rural carrier and Verizon, as customers can take advantage of both networks.[86] As of 2015, all LRA members have fully rolled out their 4G LTE networks.

Verizon Wireless (legally known as Cellco Partnership) is an American telecommunications company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon Communications, that offers wireless products and services. With 146 million subscribers as of April 2017, Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless telecommunications provider in the United States.[6]
The company is headquartered in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. It was founded in 2000 as a joint venture of American telecommunications firm Bell Atlantic, which would soon become Verizon Communications, and British multinational telecommunications company Vodafone.[7] Verizon Communications became sole owner in 2014 by buying Vodafone's 45-percent stake in the company.[8]
It operates a national 4G LTE network covering about 98 percent of the U.S. population,[9] which in December 2015 won or tied for top honors in each category of the RootMetrics RootScore Reports.[10] Verizon Wireless offers mobile phone services through a variety of devices.[11] Its LTE in Rural America Program, with 21 rural wireless carriers participating, covers 2.7 million potential users in 169 rural counties.[12] Verizon Wireless announced in 2015 that it was developing a 5G, or fifth generation, network.[13]

History[edit]
In September 1999, American phone company Bell Atlantic and U.K.-based Vodafone Airtouch PLC proposed they would create a new wireless phone service joint venture valued at $70 billion.[14] The joint venture was being created as Bell Atlantic underwent a merger with GTE Corporation. In April 2000, the companies announced that the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger would take the name Verizon and that the Bell Atlantic-Vodafone wireless unit would be called Verizon Wireless (legally Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless).[15] Verizon Communications owned 55 percent of Verizon Wireless while Vodafone retained 45 percent ownership.[7] Regulators with the Federal Communications Commission approved the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger June 16, 2000,[16] creating the largest wireless company in the U.S.[17] Verizon Wireless held this market position until Cingular acquired AT&T Wireless Services in 2004.[18]
Throughout the 2000s, Verizon acquired several wireless phone companies and assets across the country, including West Virginia Wireless in 2006;[19] Ramcell in 2007;[20] Rural Cellular Corporation[21] and SureWest Communications, both in 2008.[22] Also in 2008, Verizon struck a deal to buy Alltel for $5.9 billion in equity while assuming $22.2 billion worth of debt.[23][24] The deal finalized January 9, 2009, again making Verizon Wireless the country's biggest cellphone network.[23] As per the agreement, Verizon sold rural wireless properties across 18 states to AT&T. Those properties were in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming.[25] Verizon's acquisitions continued in the 2010s, including the purchases of some Plateau Wireless markets in 2012[26] and Golden State Cellular's operator in 2014.[27]
Majority owner Verizon Communications became sole owner of its wireless business in 2014, when it bought Vodafone's 45 percent stake. Vodafone received $58.9 billion cash, $60.2 billion in stock and $11 billion in other transactions.[8][28] An article in The New York Times estimated Verizon Wireless' valuation at about $290 billion.[8]
In late 2014, it became known that Verizon Wireless uses deep packet inspection for server-side insertion of a customer-unique ID field ("X-UIDH") into all unencrypted HTTP headers. The mechanism has been referred to as "supercookie" or "perma-cookie", although it is not technically a cookie in that it does not store information on the customers device and is transparent to the user. It can not be averted with common mechanisms like ad-blockers; however it can not be inserted into encrypted HTTPS and VPN connections. Verizon advertises the system to marketing partners. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has called on Verizon to terminate the program, calling it a "profound violation of trust", expressing concern over abuse by third parties, and questioning the legality of Verizon modifying their users' outgoing data without offering them the possibility of a full opt-out.[29][30][31][32][33] In January 2015, Verizon announced they would give customers the option of opting out, and as of April 1, 2015, Verizon now allows customers to opt-out either online or calling a special phone number.[34]
In August 2016, Verizon hired Ronan Dunne, the former head of British provider O2, as the new president of its wireless business.[35]
In September 2016, Comcast confirmed that it planned to launch a mobile service, using Verizon's network as an MVNO, in mid-2017.[36][37]
In February 2017, in the wake of competition from Sprint and T-Mobile, and initiatives to expand the capacity and improve the quality of its network by using macrocells and supporting carrier aggregation, Verizon announced that it would bring back an "unlimited" data plan (subject to throttling in heavy network areas after 22 GB of usage). Verizon's decision not to restrict the bitrate of video services prompted Sprint and T-Mobile to remove similar restrictions from their own plans.[38]
In March 2017, Verizon announced that all their Android phones will have AppFlash, to help users find content and services across different apps.[39] Critics spoke harshly against it.[40]
Network[edit]
Verizon Wireless operates a 4G LTE network, which, as of January 2016, covers about 98 percent of the U.S.[41] Before their LTE network was launched, they operated an exclusively CDMA2000 network (the other major CDMA2000 carrier in the US being Sprint). Verizon began its initial tests for the 4G LTE network in 2008[13] in order to move from older-generation mobile communications technologies to the emerging global standard.[42] In December 2010, Verizon Wireless launched a fledgling 4G LTE network in 39 markets.[43] By December 2011, only a year after launch, 200 million Americans were covered with 4G LTE, and 190 markets were covered.[44] As of 2016, 98% percent of the U.S. is covered with LTE, and 92% of all data traffic is on LTE.[45]
In 2012, the service provider bought spectrum from the country's biggest cable companies, including Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks to improve its data network across the U.S.[46] The new capacity allowed Verizon to launch what it calls XLTE (LTE on Band 4) in 2013, providing more capacity in congested and well-populated markets.[47]
Because 4G LTE is a data-transmitting network, when it launched, Verizon customers' voice calls were still carried over the company's CDMA2000 network,[48] which was developed for 3G cellphones. In September 2014, Verizon launched voice over LTE (VoLTE);[49] this allowed voice calls to transmit via the data-only LTE network. This also allows for simultaneous voice and data services, something that is unavailable on traditional CDMA2000 calls. Along with VoLTE, Verizon also announced support for HD Voice, which provides higher quality audio for VoLTE calls, and native Video Calling for Android phones. In March 2016, Verizon enabled support for Wi-Fi Calling, which allows calls to be placed over a Wi-Fi Network. As of August 2015, nearly 4 million of Verizon's 103.7 million subscribers used VoLTE.[49]
A report by RootMetrics on carrier performance in the first half of 2015 ranked Verizon's network as the best in overall national performance, network reliability, network speed, data performance and call performance.[50] For the second half of 2015, RootMetrics's RootScore Report ranked Verizon Wireless No. 1 in overall performance, network speed, network reliability, call performance and data performance.[10] Verizon Wireless and AT&T tied for first in text performance.[10]
In September 2015, Verizon's chief information and technology architect Roger Gurnani stated that Verizon was planning to trial a 5G wireless network within 12 months, with "some level of commercial deployment" by 2017.[13] In late-August 2016, Verizon officially announced that it had rolled out LTE Advanced services in 461 markets. The company promoted that the technology would allow at least 50% higher LTE data speeds on supported devices.[51]

Apps[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers certain applications and services that are exclusive to its subscribers. Many of these apps are pre-loaded on Verizon devices—primarily Android smartphones. The company has received criticism for this practice, as users and critics have viewed the applications to be "bloatware" that are sometimes redundant to applications already included with the device's operating system.[57][58][59]
The NFL Mobile app allows Verizon Wireless subscribers to stream National Football League games and NFL Network on their devices. While previously a subscription-based service, NFL Mobile was made free to all subscribers beginning in the 2015 NFL season. As part of an exclusivity agreement with the NFL, only Verizon Wireless subscribers may stream NFL telecasts to smartphones.[60][61][62] As part of a similar deal that also granted the carrier title sponsorship of the series, Verizon also has exclusivity on phone streaming of Verizon IndyCar Series races via its official app.[63]
The My Verizon app is used for account management, including checking usage statistics and managing the user's service plan and account features.[64][65][66] Verizon Cloud, which allows photos, videos, contacts, messages and call logs to be synchronized online, was released in April 2013 initially for Android phones,[67] followed the next month by a launch for iOS.[67][68][68] Verizon Messages, otherwise known as Message+, is an alternate text messaging app that additionally allows messages to be synchronized between multiple devices.[69] VZ Navigator is a subscription-based maps and navigation service which provides turn-by-turn navigation, crowdsourced traffic data, weather, events and entertainment listings, gas prices, roadside assistance, 2D and 3D views.[70] The Verizon Support & Protection app provides technical support services, lost device location, and on Android, antivirus functionality.[71]
Verizon Family Locator is a subscription-based service and app can be used to track the locations of family members on a map for up to 10 devices.[72][73] Verizon Family Base allows parents to restrict when and how their children use their phones, view their children's contacts and lock the devices.[73][74] Verizon also offers the GizmoPal, a wristband-worn phone for children that is restricted to only placing or receiving calls from one of two designated caregivers, and has GPS tracking.[75][76]
Other Verizon Wireless apps include Field Force Manager, which allows employers to manage employees with GPS, management timesheets and oversee travel,[77] Visual Voice Mail[78] and Roadside Assistance.[79][80]
Products and services[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers cellphones, home telephone, and Internet services through a variety of devices.
Wireless phone services[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers smartphones powered by Apple's iOS, Google's Android, Microsoft's Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS.[11] Its basic phones use Verizon's 3G network, while the smartphones use their 4G LTE network.[11] The company offers different voice and data plans for its users.[81][82]
Wireless home phone[edit]
Introduced in February 2011 as Verizon Wireless Home Phone Connect, Wireless Home Phone uses Verizon's cellular network rather than using traditional landline wires to provide home phone service.[83]
Mobile Wi-Fi and broadband[edit]
Verizon Wireless sells Wi-Fi hotspot devices, including Jetpack 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot AC791L and Jetpack MiFi 6620L.[84] Verizon Wireless' home Internet services includes 4G LTE Broadband Router with Voice that can power a home's wireless network and connect up to 10 devices and a home phone.[85]
LTE in Rural America[edit]
The LTE in Rural America Program (or LRA program), introduced in May 2010, covers 2.7 million potential users over 225,000 miles in 169 rural counties.[12] Currently, 21 rural wireless carriers participate in the program. Under this program, partners lease spectrum from Verizon Wireless and connect to the company's network, and Verizon provides technical support and resources to help the rural wireless company build out its own 4G LTE network. The program extends the footprint of 4G LTE coverage for both the rural carrier and Verizon, as customers can take advantage of both networks.[86] As of 2015, all LRA members have fully rolled out their 4G LTE networks.

Verizon Wireless (legally known as Cellco Partnership) is an American telecommunications company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon Communications, that offers wireless products and services. With 146 million subscribers as of April 2017, Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless telecommunications provider in the United States.[6]
The company is headquartered in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. It was founded in 2000 as a joint venture of American telecommunications firm Bell Atlantic, which would soon become Verizon Communications, and British multinational telecommunications company Vodafone.[7] Verizon Communications became sole owner in 2014 by buying Vodafone's 45-percent stake in the company.[8]
It operates a national 4G LTE network covering about 98 percent of the U.S. population,[9] which in December 2015 won or tied for top honors in each category of the RootMetrics RootScore Reports.[10] Verizon Wireless offers mobile phone services through a variety of devices.[11] Its LTE in Rural America Program, with 21 rural wireless carriers participating, covers 2.7 million potential users in 169 rural counties.[12] Verizon Wireless announced in 2015 that it was developing a 5G, or fifth generation, network.[13]

History[edit]
In September 1999, American phone company Bell Atlantic and U.K.-based Vodafone Airtouch PLC proposed they would create a new wireless phone service joint venture valued at $70 billion.[14] The joint venture was being created as Bell Atlantic underwent a merger with GTE Corporation. In April 2000, the companies announced that the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger would take the name Verizon and that the Bell Atlantic-Vodafone wireless unit would be called Verizon Wireless (legally Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless).[15] Verizon Communications owned 55 percent of Verizon Wireless while Vodafone retained 45 percent ownership.[7] Regulators with the Federal Communications Commission approved the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger June 16, 2000,[16] creating the largest wireless company in the U.S.[17] Verizon Wireless held this market position until Cingular acquired AT&T Wireless Services in 2004.[18]
Throughout the 2000s, Verizon acquired several wireless phone companies and assets across the country, including West Virginia Wireless in 2006;[19] Ramcell in 2007;[20] Rural Cellular Corporation[21] and SureWest Communications, both in 2008.[22] Also in 2008, Verizon struck a deal to buy Alltel for $5.9 billion in equity while assuming $22.2 billion worth of debt.[23][24] The deal finalized January 9, 2009, again making Verizon Wireless the country's biggest cellphone network.[23] As per the agreement, Verizon sold rural wireless properties across 18 states to AT&T. Those properties were in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming.[25] Verizon's acquisitions continued in the 2010s, including the purchases of some Plateau Wireless markets in 2012[26] and Golden State Cellular's operator in 2014.[27]
Majority owner Verizon Communications became sole owner of its wireless business in 2014, when it bought Vodafone's 45 percent stake. Vodafone received $58.9 billion cash, $60.2 billion in stock and $11 billion in other transactions.[8][28] An article in The New York Times estimated Verizon Wireless' valuation at about $290 billion.[8]
In late 2014, it became known that Verizon Wireless uses deep packet inspection for server-side insertion of a customer-unique ID field ("X-UIDH") into all unencrypted HTTP headers. The mechanism has been referred to as "supercookie" or "perma-cookie", although it is not technically a cookie in that it does not store information on the customers device and is transparent to the user. It can not be averted with common mechanisms like ad-blockers; however it can not be inserted into encrypted HTTPS and VPN connections. Verizon advertises the system to marketing partners. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has called on Verizon to terminate the program, calling it a "profound violation of trust", expressing concern over abuse by third parties, and questioning the legality of Verizon modifying their users' outgoing data without offering them the possibility of a full opt-out.[29][30][31][32][33] In January 2015, Verizon announced they would give customers the option of opting out, and as of April 1, 2015, Verizon now allows customers to opt-out either online or calling a special phone number.[34]
In August 2016, Verizon hired Ronan Dunne, the former head of British provider O2, as the new president of its wireless business.[35]
In September 2016, Comcast confirmed that it planned to launch a mobile service, using Verizon's network as an MVNO, in mid-2017.[36][37]
In February 2017, in the wake of competition from Sprint and T-Mobile, and initiatives to expand the capacity and improve the quality of its network by using macrocells and supporting carrier aggregation, Verizon announced that it would bring back an "unlimited" data plan (subject to throttling in heavy network areas after 22 GB of usage). Verizon's decision not to restrict the bitrate of video services prompted Sprint and T-Mobile to remove similar restrictions from their own plans.[38]
In March 2017, Verizon announced that all their Android phones will have AppFlash, to help users find content and services across different apps.[39] Critics spoke harshly against it.[40]
Network[edit]
Verizon Wireless operates a 4G LTE network, which, as of January 2016, covers about 98 percent of the U.S.[41] Before their LTE network was launched, they operated an exclusively CDMA2000 network (the other major CDMA2000 carrier in the US being Sprint). Verizon began its initial tests for the 4G LTE network in 2008[13] in order to move from older-generation mobile communications technologies to the emerging global standard.[42] In December 2010, Verizon Wireless launched a fledgling 4G LTE network in 39 markets.[43] By December 2011, only a year after launch, 200 million Americans were covered with 4G LTE, and 190 markets were covered.[44] As of 2016, 98% percent of the U.S. is covered with LTE, and 92% of all data traffic is on LTE.[45]
In 2012, the service provider bought spectrum from the country's biggest cable companies, including Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks to improve its data network across the U.S.[46] The new capacity allowed Verizon to launch what it calls XLTE (LTE on Band 4) in 2013, providing more capacity in congested and well-populated markets.[47]
Because 4G LTE is a data-transmitting network, when it launched, Verizon customers' voice calls were still carried over the company's CDMA2000 network,[48] which was developed for 3G cellphones. In September 2014, Verizon launched voice over LTE (VoLTE);[49] this allowed voice calls to transmit via the data-only LTE network. This also allows for simultaneous voice and data services, something that is unavailable on traditional CDMA2000 calls. Along with VoLTE, Verizon also announced support for HD Voice, which provides higher quality audio for VoLTE calls, and native Video Calling for Android phones. In March 2016, Verizon enabled support for Wi-Fi Calling, which allows calls to be placed over a Wi-Fi Network. As of August 2015, nearly 4 million of Verizon's 103.7 million subscribers used VoLTE.[49]
A report by RootMetrics on carrier performance in the first half of 2015 ranked Verizon's network as the best in overall national performance, network reliability, network speed, data performance and call performance.[50] For the second half of 2015, RootMetrics's RootScore Report ranked Verizon Wireless No. 1 in overall performance, network speed, network reliability, call performance and data performance.[10] Verizon Wireless and AT&T tied for first in text performance.[10]
In September 2015, Verizon's chief information and technology architect Roger Gurnani stated that Verizon was planning to trial a 5G wireless network within 12 months, with "some level of commercial deployment" by 2017.[13] In late-August 2016, Verizon officially announced that it had rolled out LTE Advanced services in 461 markets. The company promoted that the technology would allow at least 50% higher LTE data speeds on supported devices.[51]

Apps[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers certain applications and services that are exclusive to its subscribers. Many of these apps are pre-loaded on Verizon devices—primarily Android smartphones. The company has received criticism for this practice, as users and critics have viewed the applications to be "bloatware" that are sometimes redundant to applications already included with the device's operating system.[57][58][59]
The NFL Mobile app allows Verizon Wireless subscribers to stream National Football League games and NFL Network on their devices. While previously a subscription-based service, NFL Mobile was made free to all subscribers beginning in the 2015 NFL season. As part of an exclusivity agreement with the NFL, only Verizon Wireless subscribers may stream NFL telecasts to smartphones.[60][61][62] As part of a similar deal that also granted the carrier title sponsorship of the series, Verizon also has exclusivity on phone streaming of Verizon IndyCar Series races via its official app.[63]
The My Verizon app is used for account management, including checking usage statistics and managing the user's service plan and account features.[64][65][66] Verizon Cloud, which allows photos, videos, contacts, messages and call logs to be synchronized online, was released in April 2013 initially for Android phones,[67] followed the next month by a launch for iOS.[67][68][68] Verizon Messages, otherwise known as Message+, is an alternate text messaging app that additionally allows messages to be synchronized between multiple devices.[69] VZ Navigator is a subscription-based maps and navigation service which provides turn-by-turn navigation, crowdsourced traffic data, weather, events and entertainment listings, gas prices, roadside assistance, 2D and 3D views.[70] The Verizon Support & Protection app provides technical support services, lost device location, and on Android, antivirus functionality.[71]
Verizon Family Locator is a subscription-based service and app can be used to track the locations of family members on a map for up to 10 devices.[72][73] Verizon Family Base allows parents to restrict when and how their children use their phones, view their children's contacts and lock the devices.[73][74] Verizon also offers the GizmoPal, a wristband-worn phone for children that is restricted to only placing or receiving calls from one of two designated caregivers, and has GPS tracking.[75][76]
Other Verizon Wireless apps include Field Force Manager, which allows employers to manage employees with GPS, management timesheets and oversee travel,[77] Visual Voice Mail[78] and Roadside Assistance.[79][80]
Products and services[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers cellphones, home telephone, and Internet services through a variety of devices.
Wireless phone services[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers smartphones powered by Apple's iOS, Google's Android, Microsoft's Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS.[11] Its basic phones use Verizon's 3G network, while the smartphones use their 4G LTE network.[11] The company offers different voice and data plans for its users.[81][82]
Wireless home phone[edit]
Introduced in February 2011 as Verizon Wireless Home Phone Connect, Wireless Home Phone uses Verizon's cellular network rather than using traditional landline wires to provide home phone service.[83]
Mobile Wi-Fi and broadband[edit]
Verizon Wireless sells Wi-Fi hotspot devices, including Jetpack 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot AC791L and Jetpack MiFi 6620L.[84] Verizon Wireless' home Internet services includes 4G LTE Broadband Router with Voice that can power a home's wireless network and connect up to 10 devices and a home phone.[85]
LTE in Rural America[edit]
The LTE in Rural America Program (or LRA program), introduced in May 2010, covers 2.7 million potential users over 225,000 miles in 169 rural counties.[12] Currently, 21 rural wireless carriers participate in the program. Under this program, partners lease spectrum from Verizon Wireless and connect to the company's network, and Verizon provides technical support and resources to help the rural wireless company build out its own 4G LTE network. The program extends the footprint of 4G LTE coverage for both the rural carrier and Verizon, as customers can take advantage of both networks.[86] As of 2015, all LRA members have fully rolled out their 4G LTE networks.

Verizon Wireless (legally known as Cellco Partnership) is an American telecommunications company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon Communications, that offers wireless products and services. With 146 million subscribers as of April 2017, Verizon Wireless is the largest wireless telecommunications provider in the United States.[6]
The company is headquartered in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. It was founded in 2000 as a joint venture of American telecommunications firm Bell Atlantic, which would soon become Verizon Communications, and British multinational telecommunications company Vodafone.[7] Verizon Communications became sole owner in 2014 by buying Vodafone's 45-percent stake in the company.[8]
It operates a national 4G LTE network covering about 98 percent of the U.S. population,[9] which in December 2015 won or tied for top honors in each category of the RootMetrics RootScore Reports.[10] Verizon Wireless offers mobile phone services through a variety of devices.[11] Its LTE in Rural America Program, with 21 rural wireless carriers participating, covers 2.7 million potential users in 169 rural counties.[12] Verizon Wireless announced in 2015 that it was developing a 5G, or fifth generation, network.[13]

History[edit]
In September 1999, American phone company Bell Atlantic and U.K.-based Vodafone Airtouch PLC proposed they would create a new wireless phone service joint venture valued at $70 billion.[14] The joint venture was being created as Bell Atlantic underwent a merger with GTE Corporation. In April 2000, the companies announced that the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger would take the name Verizon and that the Bell Atlantic-Vodafone wireless unit would be called Verizon Wireless (legally Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless).[15] Verizon Communications owned 55 percent of Verizon Wireless while Vodafone retained 45 percent ownership.[7] Regulators with the Federal Communications Commission approved the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger June 16, 2000,[16] creating the largest wireless company in the U.S.[17] Verizon Wireless held this market position until Cingular acquired AT&T Wireless Services in 2004.[18]
Throughout the 2000s, Verizon acquired several wireless phone companies and assets across the country, including West Virginia Wireless in 2006;[19] Ramcell in 2007;[20] Rural Cellular Corporation[21] and SureWest Communications, both in 2008.[22] Also in 2008, Verizon struck a deal to buy Alltel for $5.9 billion in equity while assuming $22.2 billion worth of debt.[23][24] The deal finalized January 9, 2009, again making Verizon Wireless the country's biggest cellphone network.[23] As per the agreement, Verizon sold rural wireless properties across 18 states to AT&T. Those properties were in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming.[25] Verizon's acquisitions continued in the 2010s, including the purchases of some Plateau Wireless markets in 2012[26] and Golden State Cellular's operator in 2014.[27]
Majority owner Verizon Communications became sole owner of its wireless business in 2014, when it bought Vodafone's 45 percent stake. Vodafone received $58.9 billion cash, $60.2 billion in stock and $11 billion in other transactions.[8][28] An article in The New York Times estimated Verizon Wireless' valuation at about $290 billion.[8]
In late 2014, it became known that Verizon Wireless uses deep packet inspection for server-side insertion of a customer-unique ID field ("X-UIDH") into all unencrypted HTTP headers. The mechanism has been referred to as "supercookie" or "perma-cookie", although it is not technically a cookie in that it does not store information on the customers device and is transparent to the user. It can not be averted with common mechanisms like ad-blockers; however it can not be inserted into encrypted HTTPS and VPN connections. Verizon advertises the system to marketing partners. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has called on Verizon to terminate the program, calling it a "profound violation of trust", expressing concern over abuse by third parties, and questioning the legality of Verizon modifying their users' outgoing data without offering them the possibility of a full opt-out.[29][30][31][32][33] In January 2015, Verizon announced they would give customers the option of opting out, and as of April 1, 2015, Verizon now allows customers to opt-out either online or calling a special phone number.[34]
In August 2016, Verizon hired Ronan Dunne, the former head of British provider O2, as the new president of its wireless business.[35]
In September 2016, Comcast confirmed that it planned to launch a mobile service, using Verizon's network as an MVNO, in mid-2017.[36][37]
In February 2017, in the wake of competition from Sprint and T-Mobile, and initiatives to expand the capacity and improve the quality of its network by using macrocells and supporting carrier aggregation, Verizon announced that it would bring back an "unlimited" data plan (subject to throttling in heavy network areas after 22 GB of usage). Verizon's decision not to restrict the bitrate of video services prompted Sprint and T-Mobile to remove similar restrictions from their own plans.[38]
In March 2017, Verizon announced that all their Android phones will have AppFlash, to help users find content and services across different apps.[39] Critics spoke harshly against it.[40]
Network[edit]
Verizon Wireless operates a 4G LTE network, which, as of January 2016, covers about 98 percent of the U.S.[41] Before their LTE network was launched, they operated an exclusively CDMA2000 network (the other major CDMA2000 carrier in the US being Sprint). Verizon began its initial tests for the 4G LTE network in 2008[13] in order to move from older-generation mobile communications technologies to the emerging global standard.[42] In December 2010, Verizon Wireless launched a fledgling 4G LTE network in 39 markets.[43] By December 2011, only a year after launch, 200 million Americans were covered with 4G LTE, and 190 markets were covered.[44] As of 2016, 98% percent of the U.S. is covered with LTE, and 92% of all data traffic is on LTE.[45]
In 2012, the service provider bought spectrum from the country's biggest cable companies, including Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks to improve its data network across the U.S.[46] The new capacity allowed Verizon to launch what it calls XLTE (LTE on Band 4) in 2013, providing more capacity in congested and well-populated markets.[47]
Because 4G LTE is a data-transmitting network, when it launched, Verizon customers' voice calls were still carried over the company's CDMA2000 network,[48] which was developed for 3G cellphones. In September 2014, Verizon launched voice over LTE (VoLTE);[49] this allowed voice calls to transmit via the data-only LTE network. This also allows for simultaneous voice and data services, something that is unavailable on traditional CDMA2000 calls. Along with VoLTE, Verizon also announced support for HD Voice, which provides higher quality audio for VoLTE calls, and native Video Calling for Android phones. In March 2016, Verizon enabled support for Wi-Fi Calling, which allows calls to be placed over a Wi-Fi Network. As of August 2015, nearly 4 million of Verizon's 103.7 million subscribers used VoLTE.[49]
A report by RootMetrics on carrier performance in the first half of 2015 ranked Verizon's network as the best in overall national performance, network reliability, network speed, data performance and call performance.[50] For the second half of 2015, RootMetrics's RootScore Report ranked Verizon Wireless No. 1 in overall performance, network speed, network reliability, call performance and data performance.[10] Verizon Wireless and AT&T tied for first in text performance.[10]
In September 2015, Verizon's chief information and technology architect Roger Gurnani stated that Verizon was planning to trial a 5G wireless network within 12 months, with "some level of commercial deployment" by 2017.[13] In late-August 2016, Verizon officially announced that it had rolled out LTE Advanced services in 461 markets. The company promoted that the technology would allow at least 50% higher LTE data speeds on supported devices.[51]

Apps[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers certain applications and services that are exclusive to its subscribers. Many of these apps are pre-loaded on Verizon devices—primarily Android smartphones. The company has received criticism for this practice, as users and critics have viewed the applications to be "bloatware" that are sometimes redundant to applications already included with the device's operating system.[57][58][59]
The NFL Mobile app allows Verizon Wireless subscribers to stream National Football League games and NFL Network on their devices. While previously a subscription-based service, NFL Mobile was made free to all subscribers beginning in the 2015 NFL season. As part of an exclusivity agreement with the NFL, only Verizon Wireless subscribers may stream NFL telecasts to smartphones.[60][61][62] As part of a similar deal that also granted the carrier title sponsorship of the series, Verizon also has exclusivity on phone streaming of Verizon IndyCar Series races via its official app.[63]
The My Verizon app is used for account management, including checking usage statistics and managing the user's service plan and account features.[64][65][66] Verizon Cloud, which allows photos, videos, contacts, messages and call logs to be synchronized online, was released in April 2013 initially for Android phones,[67] followed the next month by a launch for iOS.[67][68][68] Verizon Messages, otherwise known as Message+, is an alternate text messaging app that additionally allows messages to be synchronized between multiple devices.[69] VZ Navigator is a subscription-based maps and navigation service which provides turn-by-turn navigation, crowdsourced traffic data, weather, events and entertainment listings, gas prices, roadside assistance, 2D and 3D views.[70] The Verizon Support & Protection app provides technical support services, lost device location, and on Android, antivirus functionality.[71]
Verizon Family Locator is a subscription-based service and app can be used to track the locations of family members on a map for up to 10 devices.[72][73] Verizon Family Base allows parents to restrict when and how their children use their phones, view their children's contacts and lock the devices.[73][74] Verizon also offers the GizmoPal, a wristband-worn phone for children that is restricted to only placing or receiving calls from one of two designated caregivers, and has GPS tracking.[75][76]
Other Verizon Wireless apps include Field Force Manager, which allows employers to manage employees with GPS, management timesheets and oversee travel,[77] Visual Voice Mail[78] and Roadside Assistance.[79][80]
Products and services[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers cellphones, home telephone, and Internet services through a variety of devices.
Wireless phone services[edit]
Verizon Wireless offers smartphones powered by Apple's iOS, Google's Android, Microsoft's Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS.[11] Its basic phones use Verizon's 3G network, while the smartphones use their 4G LTE network.[11] The company offers different voice and data plans for its users.[81][82]
Wireless home phone[edit]
Introduced in February 2011 as Verizon Wireless Home Phone Connect, Wireless Home Phone uses Verizon's cellular network rather than using traditional landline wires to provide home phone service.[83]
Mobile Wi-Fi and broadband[edit]
Verizon Wireless sells Wi-Fi hotspot devices, including Jetpack 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot AC791L and Jetpack MiFi 6620L.[84] Verizon Wireless' home Internet services includes 4G LTE Broadband Router with Voice that can power a home's wireless network and connect up to 10 devices and a home phone.[85]
LTE in Rural America[edit]
The LTE in Rural America Program (or LRA program), introduced in May 2010, covers 2.7 million potential users over 225,000 miles in 169 rural counties.[12] Currently, 21 rural wireless carriers participate in the program. Under this program, partners lease spectrum from Verizon Wireless and connect to the company's network, and Verizon provides technical support and resources to help the rural wireless company build out its own 4G LTE network. The program extends the footprint of 4G LTE coverage for both the rural carrier and Verizon, as customers can take advantage of both networks.[86] As of 2015, all LRA members have fully rolled out their 4G LTE networks.
