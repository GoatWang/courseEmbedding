What Plan Format Should I Order?
At Sater Design, we’re all about creating your dream home and making the process as easy as possible for you. Therefore, the plan format you select will depend on your situation. For your convenience, we sell our plans in 3 basic plan formats: printed on Vellum paper, in electronic PDF file format, and electronic AutoCAD files. AutoCAD is the name of the program that is used to create the plans. There is no “correct” or “better” plan format, it all depends on your individual needs. Each plan format has its benefits and some are more versatile than others.
Print Vellum: The most popular plan format our customers order is the Print-Vellum format. This plan format gives you a set of plans printed on Vellum paper that you can show your builder. Copies can be made as needed– see the Plan Licensing Information page for more details. The Vellum paper is erasable (using a special architect’s eraser) so added notes or minor changes can be made to the plans if needed. The Vellum plan format is the most expensive to ship.
PDF Electronic: The second most popular plan format is PDF, which is an electronic file format. We email you the plan as a set of electronic PDF files. This plan format provides the most expedient way to receive the plans. Your local blue print shop can make prints as needed. Again, see the Plan Licensing Information page for more details on making copies. The PDF plan format is an electronic file, but it is not editable so changes can be more difficult to make.
CAD Electronic: If you need to make changes or alterations to the plan, you will need to order the plan in electronic AutoCAD plan format. Anyone with the AutoCAD program and knowledge of how to use it — which most builders do –will be able to open the files and make changes to them. Your builder or local blue print shop can make prints from the AutoCAD files (see the Plan Licensing Information page for more details). There AutoCAD files come on a USB flash drive and is shipped with your plan licensing information packet.
