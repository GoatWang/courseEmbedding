Forward-Looking
Statements and Risk

This
report includes “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of
historical facts included or incorporated by reference in this
report, including, without limitation, statements regarding our
future financial position, business strategy, budgets, projected
revenues, projected costs and plans, and objectives of management
for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Such
forward-looking statements are based on our examination of
historical operating trends, the information that was used to
prepare our estimate of proved reserves as of December 31,
2015 , and other data in our possession or available from third
parties. In addition, forward-looking statements generally can be
identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as
“may,” “will,” “expect,”
“intend,” “project,”
“estimate,” “anticipate,”
“believe,” or “continue” or similar
terminology. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in
such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no
assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct.
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from our expectations include, but are not limited to,
our assumptions about:




 



 


 





•



the market
prices of oil, natural gas, NGLs and other products or
services;


 





 



 


 





•



the supply
and demand for oil, natural gas, NGLs and other products or
services;


 





 



 


 





•



pipeline
and gathering system capacity;


 





 



 


 





•



production
and reserve levels;


 





 



 


 





•



drilling
risks;


 





 



 


 





•



economic
and competitive conditions;


 





 



 


 





•



the
availability of capital resources;


 





 



 


 





•



capital
expenditure and other contractual obligations;


 





 



 


 





•



weather
conditions;


 





 



 


 





•



inflation
rates;


 





 



 


 





•



the
availability of goods and services;


 





 



 


 





•



legislative
or regulatory changes, including environmental
regulation;


 





 



 


 





•



terrorism
and cyber-attacks;


 





 



 


 





•



occurrence
of property acquisitions or divestitures;


 





 



 





•



the
securities or capital markets and related risks such as general
credit, liquidity, market and interest-rate risks; and





 



 





•



other
factors disclosed under Items 1 and 2 – “Business and
Properties — Estimated Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash
Flows,” Item 1A – “Risk Factors,”
Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,”
Item 7A – “Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk,” and elsewhere in our most
recently filed Form 10-K.





















All
subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable
to the Partnership, or persons acting on its behalf, are expressly
qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements. We assume
no duty to update or revise our forward-looking statements based on
changes in internal estimates or expectations or
otherwise.

APACHE
OFFSHORE INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP 

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

Apache
Offshore Investment Partnership, a Delaware general partnership
(the Investment Partnership), was formed on October 31, 1983,
consisting of Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation (Apache or
the Managing Partner), as Managing Partner and public investors
(the Investing Partners). The Investment Partnership invested its
entire capital in Apache Offshore Petroleum Limited Partnership, a
Delaware limited partnership (the Operating Partnership). The
primary business of the Investment Partnership is to serve as the
sole limited partner of the Operating Partnership. The accompanying
financial statements include the accounts of both the Investment
Partnership and the Operating Partnership. The term
“Partnership”, as used herein, refers to the Investment
Partnership or the Operating Partnership, as the case may
be.

These
financial statements have been prepared by the Partnership, without
audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). They reflect all adjustments that are,
in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the
results for the interim periods, on a basis consistent with the
annual audited financial statements. All such adjustments are of a
normal, recurring nature. Certain information, accounting policies,
and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) have been omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Partnership
believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information
presented not misleading. These financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 , which
contains a summary of the Partnership’s significant
accounting policies and other disclosures.

 


1.    SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

As of
September 30, 2016 , the Partnership’s significant
accounting policies are consistent with those discussed in Note 2
of its consolidated financial statements contained in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2015 .

Use of
Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Significant estimates with regard to these
financial statements include the estimate of proved oil and gas
reserve quantities and the related present value of estimated
future net cash flows therefrom and the assessment of asset
retirement obligations. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Oil and
Gas Property

The
Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil
and gas property. Under this method of accounting, all costs
incurred for both successful and unsuccessful exploration and
development activities, and oil and gas property acquisitions are
capitalized. The net book value of oil and gas properties may not
exceed a calculated “ceiling.” The ceiling limitation
is the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas
reserves, discounted at 10 percent per annum. Estimated future net
cash flows are calculated using end-of-period costs and an
unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the
first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life
of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual
arrangements. For a discussion of the calculation of estimated
future net cash flows, please refer to Note 10-Supplemental Oil and
Gas Disclosures to the consolidated financial statements contained
in the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 .

 

Any
excess of the net book value of proved oil and gas properties over
the ceiling is charged to expense and reflected as
“Additional depreciation, depletion and amortization”
in the accompanying statement of consolidated operations. Such
limitations are tested quarterly. The Partnership recorded non-cash
write-downs of the carrying value of its proved oil and gas
properties totaling $209,027 during the third quarter of 2016 and
$2,873,180 during the first nine months of 2016 .

New
Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted

 

In August
2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-15, Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230). ASU 2016-15 seeks to reduce the existing
diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash
payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash
flows. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal
years, with early adoption permitted. The Partnership is currently
evaluating the provisions of ASU 2016-15 and assessing the impact,
if any, it may have on its statement of consolidated cash
flows.

 

In June
2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit
Losses."  The standard changes the impairment model for most
financial assets and certain other instruments, including trade and
other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities and loans, and
requires entities to use a new forward-looking expected loss model
that will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for
losses. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. Early adoption is permitted for a fiscal year beginning
after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that
fiscal year.  The Partnership does not expect to adopt the
guidance early. Entities will apply the standard's provisions as a
cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the
beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is
adopted. The Partnership is evaluating the new guidance and does
not believe this standard will have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements.

 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, a new lease standard
requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities
for most leases classified as operating leases under previous U.S.
GAAP. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Partnership
will be required to use a modified retrospective approach for
leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the
earliest comparative period in the financial statements. The
Partnership is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this
standard on its consolidated financial statements.

 

In May
2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB) issued a joint revenue recognition standard, ASU 2014-09.
The new standard removes inconsistencies in existing standards,
changes the way companies recognize revenue from contracts with
customers, and increases disclosure requirements. The guidance
requires companies to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of
goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the
consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. In March 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-08, which provides further clarification on the
principal versus agent evaluation. The guidance is effective for
the annual and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2017.
The standard is required to be adopted using either the full
retrospective approach, with all prior periods presented adjusted,
or the modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative
adjustment to retained earnings on the opening balance
sheet. The Partnership is currently evaluating the level of
effort needed to implement the standard, the impact of adopting
this standard on its consolidated financial statements, and whether
to use the full retrospective approach or the modified
retrospective approach.

 

 


2.    RECEIVABLE
FROM / PAYABLE TO APACHE CORPORATION

The
receivable from/payable to Apache represents the net result of the
Investing Partners’ revenue received and expenditures paid in
the current month. Generally, cash in this amount will be paid by
Apache to the Partnership or transferred to Apache in the month
after the Partnership’s transactions are processed and the
net results of operations are determined.

 

 


3.    RIGHT
OF PRESENTMENT

As
provided in the Partnership Agreement, as amended (the
“Amended Partnership Agreement”), a first right of
presentment valuation was computed during the first quarter of 2016
. The per-unit value was determined to be $ 6,057 based on the
valuation date of December 31, 2015 . A second right of
presentment valuation was computed during October 2016 and the
per-unit value was determined to be $ 6,091 based on a valuation
date of June 30, 2016. The Partnership did not repurchase any
Investing Partner Units (Units) during the first nine months of
2016 , and is not expected to purchase any Units in the fourth
quarter of 2016. The per-unit right of presentment value computed
during the first quarter of 2015 was determined to be $ 9,765 based
on the valuation date of December 31, 2014 , and the second
per-unit right of presentment in 2015 was $ 9,831 based on a
valuation date of June 30, 2015. The Partnership did not repurchase
any Units during the first nine months of 2015 . Pursuant to the
Amended Partnership Agreement, the Partnership has no obligation to
purchase any Units presented to the extent it determines that it
has insufficient funds for such purchases.

5.    FAIR
VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Certain
assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a recurring
basis in the Partnership’s consolidated balance sheet. As of
September 30, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 , the carrying
amounts of the Partnership’s current assets and current
liabilities approximated fair value because of the short-term
nature or maturity of these instruments.

The
Partnership did not use derivative financial instruments or
otherwise engage in hedging activities during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 , and 2015 .

ITEM
2.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

The
following discussion relates to Apache Offshore Investment
Partnership (the Partnership) and should be read in conjunction
with the Partnership’s consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes included under Part I, Item 1,
“Financial Statements” of this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, as well as its consolidated financial statements,
accompanying notes and related Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included
in the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 .

The
Partnership’s business is participation in oil and gas
exploration, development and production activities on federal lease
tracts in the Gulf of Mexico, offshore Louisiana and
Texas.

 


Results of
Operations

 

Net
Income and Revenue

The
Partnership reported a net loss of $240,170 ($248 per Limited
Partner Unit) for the third quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss
of $136,865 ($132 per Limited Partner Unit) in the third quarter of
2015 . The loss for the third quarter of 2016 included a $0.2
million non-cash write-down in the carrying value of the
Partnership's oil and gas properties and reduced revenues as a
result of lower oil prices and production compared to the prior
year. Earnings for the third quarter of 2015 were reduced by
$82,640 for a gas balancing settlement with the operator of North
Padre Island 969 for gas volumes delivered in excess of its
ownership interest entitlement.

For the
first nine months of 2016 , the Partnership reported a net loss of
$3.1 million ($3,075 per Limited Partner Unit) compared to a net
loss of $122,696 ($165 loss per Limited Partner Unit) in the
comparable period of 2015 . The 2016 loss included $2.9 million of
non-cash write-downs in the carrying value of the Partnership's oil
and gas properties and reduced revenues as a result of lower oil
and gas prices compared to the prior year.



Total revenues in the third quarter of 2016 decreased 4 percent
from the third quarter of 2015 on lower oil prices and production
in 2016. As noted in the table below, oil prices in the quarter
declined 18 percent and oil production declined 14 percent from a
year ago. Total revenues in the first nine months of 2016 decreased
23 percent from the first nine months of 2015 on lower oil, gas,
and NGL prices in 2016. Revenues in the third quarter and first
nine months of 2015 were reduced by the gas balancing
