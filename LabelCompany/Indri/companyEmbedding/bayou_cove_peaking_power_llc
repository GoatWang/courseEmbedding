        June 18, 2002.
        Bayou Cove Peaking Power, LLC (Bayou Cove) filed an application requesting authority to engage in the sale of electric energy and capacity at market-based rates, and the resale of transmission rights. Bayou Cove also requested waiver of various Commission regulations. In particular, Bayou Cove requested that the Commission grant blanket approval under 18 CFR Part 34 of all future issuances of securities and assumptions of liability by Bayou Cove.
On June 14, 2002, pursuant to delegated authority, the Director, Office of Markets, Tariffs and Rates-Central, granted requests for blanket approval under Part 34, subject to the following:
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest the blanket approval of issuances of securities or assumptions of liability by Bayou Cove should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's rules of practice and procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214).
Absent a request to be heard in opposition within this period, Bayou Cove is authorized to issue securities and assume obligations or liabilities as a guarantor, indorser, surety, or otherwise in respect of any security of another person; provided that such issuance or assumption is for some lawful object within the corporate purposes of Bayou Cove, compatible with the public interest, and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for such purposes.
The Commission reserves the right to require a further showing that neither public nor private interests will be adversely affected by continued approval of Bayou Cove's issuances of securities or assumptions of liability.
Notice is hereby given that the deadline for filing motions to intervene or protests, as set forth above, is July 15, 2002.
Copies of the full text of the Order are available from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, 888 First Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. The Order may also be viewed on the Internet at http://www.ferc.fed.us/​online/​rims.htm (call 202-208-2222 for assistance). Comments, protests, and interventions may be filed electronically via the internet in lieu of paper. See, 18 CFR 385.2001(a)(1)(iii) and the instructions on the Commission's web site at http://www.ferc.fed.us/​efi/​doorbell.htm.
