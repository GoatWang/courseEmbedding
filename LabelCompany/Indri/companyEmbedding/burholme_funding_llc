Products and Services | YORK FUNDING LLC | YORK FUNDING LLC Products and ServicesOur approach and discretionary funds enable us to provide fast and flexible capital.York Funding will review your deal in 48 hoursFrom review to closing in less than 2 weeksYork Funding has full discretion over its investment capitalLong-term investments – up to 3 yearsNo pre-payment penalties on fixed interest loansHard Money LendingWe have over 40 years of combined experience in investment real estate financingYork Funding is a ‘bridge’ lender to real estate professionals in the acquisition and renovation of one-to-four family houses, multi-family apartment buildings, mixed-use properties, commercial properties, and new construction nationwide. Hard money loans, sometimes referred to as bridge loans, are short-term mortgages that seasoned real estate investors use to finance an investment project. This type of loan is often used for house flippers (fix and flip), developers, renovators, and speculators whose goal is to renovate or develop a property to sell or refinance. Unlike traditional banks and inexperienced lenders, we have the ability to underwrite, evaluate, and fund loans faster and more efficiently with our common sense approach.Learn MoreUltra Short Transactional FundingSame day and up to 90 day fundsTransactional Funding is a two step process for deals that require an intermediary between an original buyer and end buyer, a situation that may occur with many lenders. Typically, most lenders will not allow contract assignments and instead require the original buyer to provide funds immediately upon purchase, regardless of when they anticipate transferring it to the end buyer in a secondary sale. These initial funds can be borrowed for anywhere between 0 and 90 days in order to satisfy the requirements of the bank for the initial purchase before the funds from the end buyer are attained. All standard underwriting procedures are still followed.Learn MoreJoint VenturesCall us to discuss your next dealYork Funding gets creative with joint venture real estate projects with select borrowers. This includes the acquisition, renovation and repositioning of one-to-four family houses, multi-family apartment buildings, mixed-use properties, commercial properties, and new construction.

Financing & Incentive Options







Once you have developed your business plan, you should have a clear understanding of the amount of money (or capital) you need to start and run your business. If you need to raise or borrow money, there are several options. Learn about tax credits, grants and incentive programs could help add cash to the bottom line.








  										Understand Types of Financing  									
So you've tapped the bank – including your piggy bank – and you still need funds for your startup? Don't worry. There are many avenues yet to explore. Consider, with great care and caution, the following sources of financing possibilities. 




  										Learn About the Loan Application Process  									
Learn about the process of applying for a business loan. 




  										Training, One-on-one Consulting, and Legal Resources from our Nonprofit Partners  									
Need help with business planning, workshops or other research?  Check with some of our technical support providers. 




  										What is Jump Start Philly?  									
Jump Start Philly is designed to attract new businesses and entrepreneurs that create jobs to Philadelphia by exempting them from paying the Business Income and Receipts Tax, formerly the Business Privilege Tax, during the first two years of operations.

  										Find local loans through the Philadelphia Capital Consortium  									
The Capital Consortium is a group of nonprofit and for profit commercial lenders who work together with the Philadelphia Department of Commerce to improve access to capital for small businesses.  




  										Credits, Grants & Other Incentives  									
Tax credits, grants and incentive programs could also add cash to the bottom line, and unlike loans, they don't require repayment. 




  										Business Security Camera Program (Commerce SafeCam Program)  									
The Business Security Camera Program reimburses commercial property owners and business owners for the installation of surveillance cameras, to make their location safer for shoppers and the community 




  										Storefront Improvement Program  									
This program reimburses owners of commercial buildings and businesses within designated commercial corridors who make storefront improvements.  




  										InStore Program

The loans are limited to retail, food, and creative arts businesses and are used to purchase equipment and make interior improvements associated with establishing a new location or expanding at an existing one.  Only a limited number of loans are approved each year. 




  										Keystone Opportunity Zones  									
KOZs are specifically designated areas where property owners and businesses that meet capital investment or new employment targets pay little or no tax through 2013, 2018, and 2025. 




  										Keystone Innovation Zones

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you.

You must select a rate quote and then finalize your loan directly with the lender with which you have selected. Any credit product for which you apply is solely the product of the lender. Most lenders will perform a hard credit check under the Fair Credit Reporting Act in order to evaluate your request promptly and adequately. Your permission will be asked for prior to any hard credit inquiry being performed. Final rates, terms and fees will be based on your individual credit history and underwritten by the lender NOT 24/7 Lending Group. 24/7 Lending Group cannot guarantee final terms, rates or repayments as they vary by lender.

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you. Lenders may perform a soft pull of your credit during the free rate quote process. Soft credit pulls have no impact to your credit scores or rating. You must select a rate quote and then finalize your loan directly with the lender with which you have selected. Any credit product for which you apply is solely the product of the lender. Most lenders will perform a hard credit check under the Fair Credit Reporting Act in order to evaluate your request promptly and adequately. Your permission will be asked for prior to any hard credit inquiry being performed. Final rates, terms and fees will be based on your individual credit history and underwritten by the lender NOT 24/7 Lending Group. 24/7 Lending Group cannot guarantee final terms, rates or repayments as they vary by lender. Providing your information on this Website does not guarantee approval for a product offering.  There is no charge to use 24/7 Lending Group service. 24/7 Lending Group may receive compensation from a lender in certain circumstances.
  Rate quotes provided to customers will be no greater than 35.99% APR (APRs include 0-5% origination fees), with terms from 12 to 72 months and available borrowing amounts of $1,000 to $35,000. Representative Personal Loan Example: For a $5,000 36-month loan at an interest rate of 6.03% with a 1.11% origination fee of $55.50, you will receive a loan amount of $4,944.50 and will make 36 monthly payments of about $152.18 at a 6.78% APR. Total loan cost would be $5,478.48.

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
