Beer Dermatology: The Center for excellence in general, aesthetic, and surgical dermatology
			    As a Board-certified dermatologist and dermatopathologist, my team and I seek to provide the best dermatologic care available. We are a comprehensive dermatology center that cares for patients with general, surgical, and aesthetic dermatology concerns. Whether your goal is to look and feel better, be evaluated for skin cancer, have a dermatologic surgery procedure, or address a general dermatology issue, we are happy to help you. Our objective is to provide an individualized treatment for each of our patients. We work with several academic dermatology departments to coordinate your care when necessary. In addition, we have a clinical trial program that brings state of the art treatments to our offices.
			    
			    I have authored several text books and the following books:
			    
			    
Handbook of Botulinum Toxins for Aesthetic Indications
Management of Complications of Cosmetic Procedures
Dermatologic Surgery

			    I have also published more than 65 articles in peer reviewed medical journals. These publications run the gamut from treatments for advanced skin cancer using non-surgical methods, to the molecular origins of rare skin cancers. My interest in cosmetic dermatology is demonstrated by this range of publications and teaching engagements. Whether it is teaching at The Cosmetic Bootcamp (the aesthetic training symposium that I founded) or educating at the American Academy of Dermatology meetings, I consistently try to stay at the forefront of dermatology. In addition, I am an instructor at the University of Miami dermatology clinics where I supervise the dermatologists in training.  I have also had the opportunity to work with journalists and have been featured in the NY Times, The WSJ, Elle, and Allure, as well as on a range of television shows.
			    





					General dermatology
				      




				      General dermatology encompasses a wide range of skin care issues. These skin issues may affect infants, teens, adults, and seniors and include psoriasis, eczema, and allergic contact dermatitis, as well as some of the most common dermatologic issues such as acne and rosacea. Our offices provide treatments that involve systemic therapy when appropriate, and customized topical treatment regimens as needed. Our interest in general dermatology spans the spectrum of dermatology from hair loss to problems with nails. As specialists who focus on the wellness of your skin, hair, and nails, we believe that proper dermatologic care is essential.
				      
				      Psoriasis affects about 7.5 million people in the US. The disease is most commonly associated with red scaly skin on the knees and elbows, but may also involve the scalp, body, face, and nails. For many patients suffering from this disease, arthritis and/or gastrointestinal problems may also impair their quality of life. There are many treatments for psoriasis, and at Beer Dermatology we use combinations of topical treatments, moisturizers, lifestyle management, light therapy, and biologic modifiers to help our patients.
				      
				      Eczema is another skin disease that we treat. Eczema is frequently associated with red scaly patches of skin behind the knees, in the elbows, and on the sides of the neck. Patients with eczema may get infected with bacteria that impair their ability to heal. When needed, treatments with antibiotics may help patients clear. For some of our patients, the use of ultraviolet lights helps to maintain their skin and allows them to lead normal lives. For others, changes in diet and products used can make a difference. We formulate treatment plans that include the use of biologic modifiers, when needed, to help improve quality of life for our patients with eczema. We also try to identify ingredients that may cause flares, and work with allergists to identify contact allergens.
				      
				      Another facet of our practice is skin cancer detection and treatment. For most patients, an annual skin examination is recommended. For some patients, including those with a history of skin cancer or a family history of skin cancer (including melanoma), more frequent skin evaluations are recommended. If you have a mole that is changing in size, shape, or color, or that has become itchy or asymmetric, it should be evaluated.
				      
				      Skin Cancers are the most common types of cancers diagnosed in the US. Fortunately, when detected early, they are usually treatable. Many of our patients have a history of increased sun exposure during their youth. They are especially susceptible to skin cancers, and should be vigilant.
				      
				      The most common skin cancer is known as a basal cell carcinoma. This type of cancer is frequently a pearly pink or white bump that can bleed or that simply does not heal. Basal cell carcinoma is usually treated with surgery performed in the office. When they occur on the face, the treatment of choice is known as Mohs surgery (see below).
				      
				      Squamous Cell Carcinoma is the second most common skin cancer, and it usually has the appearance of a scaly pink or red bump that does not heal. They can be itchy and may also bleed. These types of skin cancer can occasionally go to other parts of the body, and are treated surgically.
				      
				      Melanoma is the most serious of the common skin cancers. These lesions usually begin as black or brown spots that are uneven in size and color. Rarely, a melanoma will lack pigment and simply appear as a pink bump that is growing or itching. Treatment for early melanomas is usually surgical, and for early lesions, this surgery is performed in a dermatologist’s office. Thicker or more advanced lesions may be accompanied by removal of lymph nodes, and this is usually done by a general surgeon.
				      
				    






					Surgical dermatology
				      




				      We offer expertise in all aspects of surgical dermatology including removal of skin cancers, Mohs skin cancer surgery, removal of benign skin growths, and a range of laser treatments. We also provide skin cancer screening examinations, and recommend that these be performed at least once a year. If you have fair skin and/or a history of increased sun exposure (especially as a young child), we recommend that you do skin examinations every four to six months.
				      
				      Among the skin growths that we treat in our surgical practice are cysts, skin tags, warts, benign skin growths such as seborrheic keratosis, skin cancers including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Precancerous skin growths known as actinic keratosis are very common and are treated with cryosurgery (nitrogen), lasers, photodynamic therapy, or topical treatments. We also have experience with rare skin cancers, and have published articles on their management.
				      
				      Surgical dermatology evolves continuously, with newer techniques and materials used to improve outcomes. If you are considering having something removed from your skin, please feel free to ask us about your procedure.
				    






					Concierge dermatology
				      




				      No aspect of medicine has been immune to changes imposed by managed care, Medicare, or other entities. These changes affect your healthcare. For patients interested in expedited appointments, expanded consultations, or discussions about wellness, or those who require extra attention for coordination of care, we offer a limited number of concierge dermatology opportunities.

Injectables: Fillers and botulinum toxins
Botulinum toxins

				      We offer a range of advanced cosmetic procedures which are individualized to treat your specific needs. These include injections of botulinum toxins (purified proteins known as Botox, Dysport, and Xeomin), as well as fillers. Botulinum toxins are used to relax muscles in various parts of the face. Botox is approved for the treatment of wrinkles around the eyes (crow’s feet) and frown lines (glabella).  Dysport and Xeomin are approved for use in the frown lines. These are among the most researched molecules in the world. When used by an experienced injector in the proper dose, they can provide dramatic results, and are safe and effective. These products are all purified proteins that have subtle differences. So, although none is the “best,” they are like Coke and Pepsi, and different people choose different products. When getting injections of these products, the dose and integrity of the formulation are critical. In our practice, we purchase them directly from the manufacturer. In addition, we use doses that will provide superior results and duration.
				      
				      Botox has been used for more than 20 years, and its indications include treatment of cosmetic wrinkles as well as more medical indications such as muscle spasms, headaches, and a range of other applications. In dermatology, it is most used to treat the wrinkles between the eyes (glabella or frown lines), as well as the lines around the eyes (crow’s feet). The dose required to treat each of these areas differs based on the muscle mass of the area being treated. In general, people with a lot of muscle mass will require more material than those with less mass. They also tend to require more frequent injections of material. When considering injections with Botox, price should not be your only consideration. Focus on the integrity of the practice and the skill of the injector. In our practice, we purchase products directly from the manufacturer.
				      
Fillers

				      Fillers may be used to “sculpt” the face and lift it, while also being able to fill in lines and wrinkles. Dr. Beer has been involved in the clinical development of many of these products, and he continues to teach advanced techniques in their use. In addition to these products, Sculptra is used to add volume by stimulating collagen production. This injection may be combined with other products, depending on the products that are used.
				      
				      At Beer Dermatology, we use hyaluronic acid fillers, as well as those made from calcium hydroxylapatite. Among the fillers utilized in our practice are Juvéderm, Voluma, Restylane L, Restylane Lyft, Restylane Refyne, Juvéderm Ultra Plus, Juvéderm Vollure, Juvéderm Volbella, Restylane Defyne, Restylane Silk, and Radiesse. All of these come with local anesthetic (lidocaine) mixed in.
				      
				      Dr. Beer and Dr. Davidson have been injecting these products, and Dr. Beer was an investigator and training physician for several of them. He is considered an “expert injector” because of his advanced skills.
				      
				      While there is no one product that is the best, each has its own advantages and can be used to achieve a desired result in a particular area.
				      
				      Each of the fillers has different physical properties that lend themselves to specific indications. For instance, Voluma, Restylane Lyft, and Radiesse are thicker products that may be used to restore lost volume and fill in areas that have lost volume. These thicker products are also used to lift the face, and can be used to help restore the face to a more youthful appearance. Smoother, thinner products such as Restylane, Refyne, and Juvéderm are best used for treating lines and wrinkles, and can also be helpful in restoring the corners of the mouth to a more youthful position. Restylane Silk, Belotero, and Juvéderm Volbella may be used to replace lost volume in the lips. They can also help to treat the fine lines around the lips. For some patients, combinations of these products are used to provide the personalized results that allow our patients to look refreshed but not artificial.
				      
				      In general, injections are performed at intervals of between six to 12 months. Common adverse events associated with these injections include bruising and swelling in and around the injection sites, but these tend to be temporary in nature.
				      
				      Sculptra is a molecule that is injected into the skin to stimulate collagen. When used correctly, it can restore the volume lost with time. Advantages of this product include the fact that it stimulates you to make your own collagen. However, it is a gradual process that can involve multiple injections over the span of a few months. This treatment has been around for about ten years, and during that time its use has evolved considerably. While only approved for injections into the face, it is being used to stimulate collagen growth in many areas of the body in an “off label” (non-approved by the FDA) manner. Sculptra is not appropriate for some areas of the face including the lips and tear troughs (eyelid region). In some patients, its use has been associated with the formation of small lumps and bumps under the skin.
				      
Kybella

				      Dr. Beer is an expert injector with Kybella, and was one of the few people in the US to participate in clinical trials that led to its FDA approval. When injected under the chin, it dissolves the fat that can accumulate there. Kybella treatments require a few visits to the office. After each treatment, it is common to have swelling that can last for about a week. The amount of swelling and degree of inflammation depend on the amount of fat that is present, as well as the amount of Kybella injected. In general, two to four treatments are used to help decrease the appearance of fat below the chin. While it is approved for use under the chin, its use in places such as the legs, arms, shoulders and other areas is considered “off label” by the FDA.
				      
Lasers, intense pulsed light and radiofrequency

				      Beer Dermatology is one of the few centers to offer the entire range of lasers and energy devices. Whether you need to have a minimally invasive procedure or a more intense laser treatment, we have the experience and training to help you achieve your goals.
				      
				      The Fraxel is one of our most popular lasers, and it is used to improve the appearance of fine lines and help the texture of the skin. After the procedure, it is common to be red for a few days. This procedure is typically performed as a series of treatments.
				      
				      The intense pulsed light treatment is a broad spectrum light source that is absorbed by the pigment of the skin. This is used to treat red and brown discoloration typically seen with sun exposure. It may also be helpful in treating the redness associated with rosacea and acne. This treatment is performed as a series of procedures, and it is common to have some mild desquamation afterwards. The best results are obtained when this is done several times, and then twice a year.
				      
				      The Isolaz is a laser that is used to treat acne. This is done weekly for several weeks, and may be combined with medications or performed by itself.
				      
				      Pulsed Dye lasers are used to treat blood vessels, scars and other lesions that are pink or red.  This treatment is typically performed several times, with each time helping to decrease the appearance of redness. Individuals getting this treatment may have rosacea, acne, birthmarks, or scars from trauma, burns, or surgery.
				      
				      Cellulite is found in about 95 percent of women, and we are pleased to offer treatments. While there is no miracle treatment, Smoothshapes may help to improve the appearance of cellulite.
				      
				      Skin tightening is performed using a variety of devices that utilize radiofrequency. These devices use energy to heat up the collagen and stimulate it to grow and to tighten. Multiple sessions are planned as part of any treatment with these devices.
					
				    






					Clinical research
				      




				      Beer Dermatology also has an active clinical research program in association with The Research Institute of the Southeast. We have been doing clinical research for more than ten years. During that time, we have worked on novel types of treatments for skin cancer, better ways to treat acne, eczema, and psoriasis, as well as a wide range of new cosmetic procedures and products. Dr. Beer has more than 60 publications, and has participated in more than 30 clinical trials. If you are interested in these, please click here.
				      
				      Clinical research is used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new drugs and devices. They require different levels of time commitment depending on the complexity of the study. Our research staff includes several full-time employees focused on clinical trials. 
				    






					Retail skin products
				      




				      Beer Dermatology offers a comprehensive skin care line that uses the best ingredients available. This line was created to maintain the health and beauty of their patients, as well as to provide an opportunity for those who cannot visit the offices to use the best products available. As new ingredients and new data become available, we will incorporate them into our ScientificRX line.
				      

Balancing Toner – A combination of pure botanicals equalizes and tones skin after cleansing. This refined product prepares skin for optimal enhancement from serums and creams.
Brightening Serum – One of our most popular products, and safe for all skin types. This serum repairs, sculpts, and brightens with seaweed extract, hyaluronic acid, and powerful antioxidants. Terrific for redness, rosacea, and irregular pigmentation.
Daily Hydrating Cream – A rich retinol formula that, used every day, improves skin tone and texture, while minimizing fine lines and wrinkles.
EyeSculpt Cream – Lavish hydration for your most noticeable feature. Ingredients such as spilantes acmella and squalane attract moisture to reduce appearance of fine lines.
Intensive Repair Serum – Contains spheres of hyaluronic acid to plump wrinkles, and squalene for skin revitalization. This serum is excellent protection against environmental damage. Patients cite noticeable improvement in moisture and elasticity, with regular use.
Lifting Serum – Smooths fine lines and wrinkles at eyes and lips, with results that last several hours. Patients love the lift it gives to the face and self-esteem.
NeckSculpt Cream – Restores youthful hydration to delicate skin at jawline, neck, and décolletage. You may never wear a turtleneck or scarf again.
Vitamin C Complex – Three forms of vitamin C are combined in one product to lighten discoloration and improve skin texture. It is one of the reasons a patient says Dr. Beer’s products helped her “erase regrets.”
White Bamboo Exfoliator – A patient favorite for smoother skin with youthful glow. Fine bamboo crystals in a warming clay base packed with antioxidants bring skin to life.

CELEB PHOTOS MY PATIENTS MOST OFTEN BRING IN
Jennifer Garner, Grace Kelly and Angelina Jolie


2.
CAREER-DEFINING PROCEDURE
Fillers have changed my career. To be able to translate what the patient already has into what they can achieve is an art form. As a cofounder of the Cosmetic Bootcamp (the leading core specialty training meeting), I work with plastic surgeons, oculoplastic surgeons, head and neck surgeons and other dermatologists to learn better ways and new places to inject. Recently, we’ve started to inject fillers into the arms, chest, legs and neck


3.
THREE WORDS THAT BEST DESCRIBE ME
Meticulous, curious, persistent


4.
WHAT SETS MY PRACTICE APART
We really go above and beyond to make people happy


5.
THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS MEDICAL MYTH I’VE HEARD
That Botox is poison


6.
MOST MEMORABLE THING I LEARNED THIS YEAR
I learned a new way of injecting fillers while I was in Stockholm that really transformed my abilities


7.
THE BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION ABOUT MY FIELD
Many patients think that one treatment can fix all their problems


8.
MY DREAM INNOVATION
A cannula with a port on it so that I can see where the tip of it is


9.
MY ULTIMATE SKIN-CARE ADVICE
Make sure you know the specific ingredients your skin needs. I formulated my ScientificRx line with professional-grade skin-care ingredients to provide patients with what they need to restore moisture and promote repair of damaged or aging skin


10.
WHAT PERSONALITY TRAIT IS UNIQUE TO YOU?
My curiosity about doing things better or that have not been done before


11.
WHAT IS THE ONE THING YOUR PRACTICE OFFERS THAT IS REALLY UNIQUE?
I try to evolve as I embrace new procedures and technologies. I love to learn new things and share them with my patients. I also own more than 15 lasers and energy devices so I have the ability to choose the exact device I need for the results I want to achieve


12.
WHAT IS THE BIGGEST MEDICAL MYTH YOU’VE EVER HEARD?
That injections done by discount providers are safe and effective


13.
WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER TO BE YOUR GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT?

About My Practice:
Why do you choose not to delegate procedures?
I perform all of my own injectable treatments because I enjoy interacting with my patients. I am committed to giving my patients the personalized, one-on-one attention they have come to expect.
About Me:
How have you popularized your techniques, making them more well-known?
I have been featured in Elle, Self, Time, Good Housekeeping, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. I have also appeared on NBC, ABC and CBS’ The Early Show for my dermatologic contributions.
Why did you become a dermatologist? 
Dermatology enables me to combine the medical and aesthetic components of patient care.  If I win the lottery, I would still enjoy being a dermatologist. I love the creativity of cosmetic dermatology, the problem solving of skin cancer treatment and the science of skin-care products. What I do every day is fun, and I enjoy all aspects of it.
How would you summarize your philosophy? 
The reason people come to my practice is because of my individualized approach and experience. Because we are a training center and have our own lasers, we have access to techniques and materials that enable me to provide patients with a different level of care. We have moved way beyond spackling wrinkles. In our practice, we strive to ensure that patients look like themselves, only younger.
What have you done to educate the dermatologists of tomorrow?
My practice is the training center for many of the cosmetic products we use, and I train physicians from around the world. I also write book chapters and journal articles that teach the best practices. I am a voluntary assistant professor at the University of Miami and a consulting associate at Duke University. I also founded the Cosmetic Bootcamp®, a leading-edge specialty physician training program.
What is your favorite part of your job?
If I ever win the lottery, I will still enjoy being a dermatologist. I love the creativity of cosmetic dermatology, the problem solving of skin cancer treatments and the science behind skin-care products. What I do every day is fun, and I enjoy every single aspect of it.

About Me









Smoother Complexion
This 46-year-old patient wanted to get rid of the lines that made her look and feel older than her age. Dr. Beer used Juvéderm® Ultra Plus to lighten the lines and create a more youthful look.








White Bamboo Exfoliator
White Bamboo Exfoliator is a clay-based scrub for all skin types and warms upon contact with water. This proprietary, deep-cleansing formula helps purify skin, minimize pores and balance excess oils. Bamboo crystals gently resurface the outer layers of skin and aid in correcting daily environmental damage. With regular use, White Bamboo Exfoliator can help provide a more luminous, smoother, younger-looking complexion.











Rejuvenating Results 
Concerned with sun damage and the uneven texture of her skin, this 60-year-old patient sought Dr. Beer for help. “I used one IPL treatment on the patient’s full face and then prescribed the Brightening Serum and Intensive Repair Serum from my skin-care line, Scientific by Kenneth Beer MD, to begin using two weeks post-treatment.”











A More Youthful Appearance
Dr. Beer used Dysport to smooth this patient’s brow and forehead, and Perlane® around her smile lines and the corners of her mouth for natural, more youthful results. 











Results Before and After Use of Scientific by Kenneth Beer MD Brightening Serum: 
Dr. Beer’s Brightening Serum incorporates the most advanced skin-brightening technology available. Unique botanical extracts from the Swiss Alps deliver a brighter, more uniform complexion. This exclusive formula helps to repair sun damage, improve redness and promote hydration. Scientific by Kenneth Beer MD is hydroquinone free, paraben free and fragrance free.











Redefined Lips
Concerned that her lipstick was bleeding into the skin around her lips, this 48-year-old patient sought Dr. Beer who used Restylane® to redefine the shape and enhance the volume.








Synergy Through Science






Scientific by Kenneth Beer MD products are formulated to treat each layer of the skin with targeted therapy. Each product incorporates high percentages of powerful, botanical ingredients. No layer of the skin is ignored and every skin-related issue is addressed with ingredients designed to restore the skin. The result is professional-grade skin care without the appointment. Dr. Beer’s skin-care line has been featured on the Martha Stewart Show, is the premier skin-care line sold on Royal Caribbean ships and can be found at high-end retailers such as NewBeauty at Fred Segal in Santa Monica, California. It’s a favorite among Dr. Beer’s celebrity clientele due to its advanced skin-care technology.

















Fraxel Re:store 1927
Administering eight passes of the Fraxel re:store® 1927 System, Dr. Beer was able to improve this 39-year-old patient’s melasma, pigmentation and skin texture. “Fraxel® is a great option when a patient’s symptoms are multifaceted, and not just limited to one concern. Whether it’s discoloration, texture or tone, Fraxel® works.” 











Rejuvenating Results
Concerned with her deep smile and frown lines that aged her appearance, this 35-year-old female patient sought Dr. Beer for help. “I used Botox and Juvéderm to achieve a youthful, natural-looking result, and the patient looks rejuvenated, but not overfilled,” says Dr. Beer.

FAQ's


Q. What is a pulse dye laser used to treat?  Does it hurt?  What can I expect my skin to look like after treatment?  
What our experts say:

It’s probably the oldest and most widely used lasers to treat broken blood vessels and scars, or anything that’s red, including stretch marks and rosacea. The only thing I don’t use it for is leg veins. It’s approved to treat that, but I find that it gives unacceptable white spots afterwards. It’s a pretty mild treatment that freezes the skin before the light beam hits it, so it’s pretty comfortable.



Q. Where is Botox most commonly injected? 
What our experts say:

Botox is most commonly injected in the area it’s FDA approved for, frown lines. A close second, is a combination of injections into the forehead and outside the brow to give a brow lift.



Q. How long does Botox take after it’s injected to work?  How long do the effect last?
What our experts say:

There are studies that show that within 48 hours,patients notice an onset, but typically we see maximal onset in 5 to 7 days. Also studies using Dysport, Xeomin, show a very rapid onset, sometimes within 2 to 3 days.  How long it lasts depends on the dose.  If you go to discount place that waters it down, it might only last 4 to 6 weeks; but, in general, the duration is 3 to 4 months; and you get longer duration after several visits.  Patients who have been treated for 8 to 10 years break their habit of wrinkling, so they don’t need to use it again for 6 months or more.



Q. Is collagen still used as a filler?
What our experts say:

No.



Q. How do you treat “lipstick bleed” lines?
What our experts say:

Carefully. I will do a variety of things. Sometime I use dilute hyaluronic acid mixed with saline to thin it out, and inject using a small needle into the fold.  I also use one of botulinum toxins to weaken the pucker muscles, or one of my CO2 lasers to etch out the lines.



Q. What was Evolence?
What our experts say:

It was a pig-derived collagen product that they are no longer marketing in the United States. It was great for filling lines. In my opinion, it’s a shame it got pulled. 



Q. What is the treatment for spider veins?  Does it hurt?  How many treatments do I need?
What our experts say:

If the veins are smaller than a paper clip, then I like to inject them. If they are bigger, then I send the patient to someone for an ultrasound evaluation, and an endovenous intervention. Both of those should be done by someone who does a lot of it. Either a vascular surgeon, an interventional radiologist or a dermatologist with vascular skill. I don’t treat anything bigger than a paperclip. I don’t do anything I can’t do really well.



Q. What does IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) treat?  Who is the best candidate for this?  Does it hurt?
What our experts say:

IPL is great for skin texture, brown spots and red spots. We use it all day. It’s great at reversing the signs of sun damage and aging. I have not had anyone who couldn’t tolerate it. It feels like a rubber band. There is really minimal downtime; the skin gets pink with a little flaking for a few days. The best candidate would be a fair-skinned person who has been exposed to a lot of sun. It would be a patient who could come in a few times for treatments, and then they will need to use sun protection, a skin brightening serum and/or Retina-A. They will proceed gradually and will stick to a program.



Q. What is the best treatment for cellulite? (How long until you see results? How long do results last? How many treatments do you need?)
What our experts say:

Having decent parents! The best treatment for cellulite remains to be seen. Right now, there are two treatments that are good for it. SmoothShapes laser by Cynosure; and Zeltiq. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. I made the decision to use SmoothShapes and I am thrilled with it. It’s not a home run, but none are. It uses two different wavelengths to mobilize and melt fat; and then uses suction to increase blood flow. It’s totally non-invasive, it’s like having a massage. The patient has to come in two times a week for four to six weeks. (We are now trying protocols to decrease the number of visits, by having longer treatments.) I recommend completing the course of treatment and then coming in for an enhancement at six to 12 months because as women age, they continue to make new cellulite. After treatment, they will see some change in the appearance of the fat. I have seen in some people some change in the size of the area treated as well. What I tell people is the appearance will change, but the measurement may not.



Q. How long do fillers last?
What our experts say:

Prevelle lasts for a few weeks; it’s a low concentration, a low cross-linked, hyaluronic acid. Radiesse lasts six to nine months. Sculptra lasts 12 to 22 months. Juvéderm, Restylane and Perlane last six to 12 months (depending on whether an enhancement injection is done after the initial injection).



Q. What is Sculptra used for? 
What our experts say:

It’s a collagen-stimulating molecule. Whereas other products are used for lifting, sculpting or filling, Sculptra is used for volume replenishment. It causes the body to make collagen, and, unlike the other fillers, it requires a series of injections. It’s absolutely wonderful for sunken cheeks, fallen temples, filling out the jawline, and it can bridge the gap between filling lines and facial volume restoration. As we age,the face loses volume and everything goes south. Sculptra can reinflate the face and pull things north by creating collagen. You can combine Sculptra with other products. This really gives someone a renovation without surgical intervention.



Q. What is Isolaz used to treat?
What our experts say:

It’s another type of laser we use for the treatment of acne. It’s approved for other things, but it’s primarily an acne laser. It combines laser energy with a vacuum. It’s really great at cleaning out the skin.



Q. Can a Fraxel laser be used on other areas of the body?
What our experts say:

It can all be used on other parts of the body. We just have to have the experience and adjust the energy.



Q. What is the best laser of overall facial rejuvenation?
What our experts say:

If you can tolerate the downtime, the CO2 ActiveFX or DeepFX. If they don’t have a few days for downtime, than I would use the Fraxel. It doesn’t go as deep. I also like a pixilated laser, which erases fragments or dots, and allows islands of normal skin to stay. The skin gets red, but typically there is no downtime.



Q. Do fillers in the lips stimulate collagen production?
What our experts say:

There is a lot of information that fillers in any part of the body stimulate collagen production. In some patients, not only does it stimulate collagen production but after a few injections, the products begin to last longer. Between these two mechanisms, the injections get really great results. 



Q. What can I do for thin skin?
What our experts say:

Use things that prevent more thinning – sun protection and not smoking. In addition, try to incorporate vitamin C and Retin A or retinol in your daily skin care regime.



Q. Are there any effective lasers out there used to tighten knee area?
What our experts say:

There are! The trick is to find one that works and then do a series of treatments. I like the radiofrequency device and in my office, I use the Exilis. I have not used the ultrasound machines in this area but think they probably help.



Q. Is it safe to have ipl and yag laser done on the same spots at the same time?
What our experts say:

Probably not- I would use one or the other. They have some overlap and I would be cautious about over treating.



Q. Is it common to have loss of pigment after TCA Peel?
What our experts say:

It sounds like there may be some scarring. Scars tend not to have pigment in them so this may be part of the problem.  It is unusual to see this after a TCA peel if it was done at lower strengths so you should check in with the doc that did the peels to make sure everything is ok. If you are white in some areas there are a few things that one can try to even them out but sun protection and time help immensely. If that does not work, bimatoprost topically may help.



Q. What type of laser is used for hair removal?  Who is the best candidate?  
What our experts say:

The Alexandrite laser made by Candela. It works best on those with light skin and dark hair (the energy that gets focused is on a primary target which is the hair shaft). If the patient has dark skin, diode lasers can be used. We can also use an Alexandrite laser at lower energies. No matter what laser is used, the darker the skin, the harder it is to treat. The same holds true for light hair which is hard to treat because there is just no target.



Q. What type of laser is used to smooth out fine lines and wrinkles?
What our experts say:

I use a Fraxel 1550 by SoltaMedical. I also use the ActiveFX, a CO2 laser for patients who need a deeper peel and can tolerate a little more down time.



Q. What type of laser is used to treat age spots (brown spots)? What are treatment requirements?
What our experts say:

It depends on how light the spots are and where they are. Patients can use a brightening serum, scientificskin.com, that’s my product; or an exfoliator to polish the outer skin (these would be the least invasive treatment methods). A lot of times, we can use a Q-tip and treat each spot with liquid nitrogen, which freezes each spot and then it falls off—it works like a charm.There are also a variety of chemical peels that work; as well as two types of light therapies: Intense Pulsed Light or Photodynamic Therapy (blue light) for the face, neck and chest area. I also use lasers to treat brown spots: The Fraxel 1927, the Alexandrite laser and the Nd:YAG laser (these would be the most invasive treatments). The darker the spot, the more invasive the treatment, and the higher the likelihood of having a white spot afterwards.



Q. Are there risks involved with using Botox?
What our experts say:

Any time we touch someone with a needle there can be injection site discomfort, and some local redness, but these are small risks. Botox has specific risks, such as occasional headaches; and sometimes you can get eyelid or eyebrow heaviness, but that’s most commonly seen in people who are straining their forehead, and using muscles or holding their eyelid or eyebrow up. It’s not really a side effect, but more of an unmasking of something the muscles were compensating for. If we relax their entire forehead and things tend to drop, they may need surgery instead to remove excess skin. A lot of the time, if the forehead is treated in an overly aggressive way, and every line is removed (especially the lower 1/3 of them), that is usually when that complication occurs.



Q. Whats the opinion of plasma replacement therapy for filler?
What our experts say:

I think that PRP can supplement fillers and may make them look better and last longer but thus far the data is not really dramatic so I dont use it in my office, I prefer to use fillers that are reliable.



Q. If you are going to be treated with Juvederm for under eye hollows and to add a bit of volume to your cheeks and also Ulthera for some lifting in the brow area, tightening under the eyes and jowel area, which should be done first and how far apart?
What our experts say:

I would do the Ulthera first so that if you are going to have some tightening, the fillers will be done once the tightening has been accomplished. I would treat about 4-7 days apart.



Q. What do you recommend to treat hypertrophic scars that are flat but have a dark purplish/pinkish color?
What our experts say:

There are many treatments but I like using the pulse dye laser and injecting cortisone directly into the scars. Using this combination has been very successful for me.



Q. I am one of the .3 percent that Botox and Dysport doesn't work for!  Are there alternatives?
What our experts say:

When you say "doesn't work" I would like to know more? did it ever work and now it doesnt? Does it do anything but not last (in which case you probably were not given enough). If you are one of the few people that the products dont work for there is another type A toxin called Xeomin that might work (it wont if you have antibodies that block all type A) or you can try Myobloc which is a type B product.



Q. Does hair removal have any side effects? 
What our experts say:

Yes, there can be increase or decrease of pigment, rarely scarring and occasionally infections. Each of these may occur following treatment but are rare. The frequency with which one sees complications is related to sun exposure in many instances so be careful when getting laser hair removal.



Q. I have a question about Thermage. If you have dental implants and or crowns on teeth can you still get Thermage on your face ?
What our experts say:

No, Thermage will not cause a problem if you have dental implants (or other implants either). While you may pick up the occasional broadcast of Radio Free Havana, you shouldn't have a problem in any other way (just kidding about the last part)



Q. What's the best way to treat sun damage?
What our experts say:

The best way to treat sun damage is with a combination approach such as a topical medication / cosmeceutical (Retin A and vitamin C are two that come to mind) and a light source or laser. For light sources, I recommend Intense Pulsed light or Photodynamic therapy (using a dye with an activation light). For laser, I like the fractionated CO2 or fractionated non ablative laser (Fraxel is one good example of this).



Q. Are cosmeceuticals regulated by the FDA the same way as prescription topicals?
What our experts say:

Cosmeceuticals are not regulated to the same degree as drugs. They fall into a grey area that is not subject to the same regulation as drugs. Any product that claims to make a difference really needs to do so, there is no difference between those sold by doctors and those sold by others. There is no distinction between a cosmeceutical and a skin care product in this regard.



Q. I am a light brown complexion hispanic hyperpigmentation
What our experts say:

Light brown Hispanic skin frequently has hyperpigmentation. In some patients, I pre- treat with topical steroids to decrease the pigment and then treat with the Fraxel 1927 at low energy to decrease the pigment. There are many dermatologists in Florida that have experience treating this and I would call a few in the area where you are and ask if they are comfortable treating you. Be aware that some people have hyperpigmentation that nothing helps (they tend to be mid darkness and take oral contraception).



Q. What kind of acne is this and why do I continue to have flare ups every few weeks?
What our experts say:

You may have a bacterial infection instead of regular acne. One needs to culture it to see what type of bacteria is present and then treat it.  Less likely but possible is a fungal infection- this would need different treatments entirely.  If that does not work, one can use photodynamic therapy (Blu Lights with Levulan) or Isolase to treat it. Finally, isotretinoin may be required to get it under control.



Q. Im forty two with extra pigment on my face for the past twenty I hate it. I want it of my face already.
What our experts say:

Depends on your sun exposure, hormone status (eg are you taking birth control) and pigment type. If you have light pigment irregularity, salicylic acid peels (like those from Theraplex) can help. Intense pulsed lights can also help. Tretinoin and brightening serums can also decrease the pigment. Avoiding sun and anything that will cause the pigment to increase is critical.



Q. i have hair loss from my age of 13. still its same. but no improvements as well as it has not been worse.
What our experts say:

The best supplement to take is iron (FeoSol). I don’t think that food supplements can make a significant difference so I wouldn’t worry about that. I would make sure that your thyroid and other hormones are normal (especially the male hormones). I think that you can use minoxidil and perhaps bimatoprost can help grow hair. Finally, there are some dermatologists that specialize in hair at university centers.



Q. What is the best cream to apply to remove dark pigmentations at the armpit?
What our experts say:

Hydroquinone and tretinoin. 



Q. I have small, thin, hairlike red veins around my cheeks.  Can I get rid of it with a laser and if so, what is the downtime?  Will my skin peel and be very red?
What our experts say:

These are easily treated with Pulsed Dye laser. Typically this requires 3-4 visits. While some lasers don’t produce a lot of bruising, my impression is that the ones that bruise require fewer treatments to get done. I have two different pulse dye lasers and use them frequently. When people have lighter vessels, I use my intense pulsed light to help get rid of them. This is nice because there is usually no bruising.



Q. What if you pop a zit and you accedentally peel your skin off? How can you heal it fast?
What our experts say:

Not a good idea. However , if you have already done this, put on some bacitracin and leave it alone. They usually repair in a few days.



Q. How often do cellulite treatments need to be done for optimum results?
What our experts say:

Depends on the treatment. The ones that I use (Exilis and Smoothshapes) require treatments once a week.  Others such as Zeltiq are done once per area. 



Q. Is there someone knowing something about the RT001 topical gel?
What our experts say:

As I know, there is Botulinum Toxin Type A topical gel being in trial, and is prospective to be approved by FDA. Is that true.  From what is posted on clinicaltrials.gov, this is true. The gel is a topical type of botulinum toxin that is in trials across the US.



Q. How can I make my lips look puffy and plump
What our experts say:

Inject them or use my Eyesculpt product (which my patients have told me is wonderful for lip lines). I like to inject lips with a clear product such as Restylane, Perlane, Juvederm or Belotero.  My patients like a natural look so I try to provide lip definition instead of monkey lips. 



Q. Can lasers can darken melasma?
What our experts say:

Absolutely- any injury can drop pigment into the skin from the outer layers into the dermis. Lasers will do this and the stronger the laser, the higher the chance of darkening. It is far better to use a laser that is gentle and designed to treat melasma or do a series of light peels (salicylic acid such as Theraplex peels) than to do one big procedure.



Q. Is there anything to help with white spots from acne scars? I have been told it is hypopigmentation.
What our experts say:

This is true- it is hypopigmentation (loss of pigment). There are a few things that can be done. If the scars are depressed (as most are) one can get treated with a fractional laser to help this. Once the surface is smoother, scars tend to be less noticeable and in some instances, pigment cells migrate in with the new skin that grows. There are some experimental treatments that grow pigment cells which in the future can be transplanted.



Q. Home vs Professional Microdermabrasion (Diamond Tome)
What our experts say:

The home systems are more gentle and do not do as much. The good part is that they are not as likely to get you into trouble.



Q. If I dont actually peel after my chemical peel, is it still effective?
What our experts say:

Usually it is because a superficial layer will slough. However, some peels are designed to be light and for these, multiple peels are required to see any effectiveness. Peels such as the Theraplex Salicylic Acid peel are effective with minimal slough. Deeper peels such as TCA (trichloracetic acid) will almost always peel.



Q. How are Dysport and Xeomin different from Botox?
What our experts say:

It’s kind of like Coke and Pepsi. In a lot of respects, injectors have a different response depending on a patient’s anatomy and biology. They are all good products. Xeomin is a protein that doesn’t have additional molecules with it that bind the actual active molecule. Some physicians think this is better while others prefer the carrier molecules. Each is manufactured in a different way, and there are subtle differences between them. Each has its own advocates, but Botox still retains the lead in terms of number of injections. The arrival of the two new competitors has increased the amount of people getting injections; so they all are increasing their marketing because of competition.



Q. What is the difference between Restylane and Perlane? Juvéderm? Radiesse? Belotero? Where is each of them used?
What our experts say:

The biggest difference is what they are made of. Restylane, Perlane, Juvéderm, and Belotero are hyaluronic acids or sugar-derived molecules. They are all clear and gel-based. Juvéderm tends to be smoother and great for thin skin and for filling superficial lines. Restylane and Perlane are more particulate and firmer so are better for injectable facelifts and sculpting. To lift up the mid-face, or if there are deeper lines, we use a thicker product like Radiesse. Radiesse is a calcium-based filler, that is white and thicker. Because of its color and thickness, it needs to be placed deeper in the skin. It’s not intended for use in the lips or under the eyes. Any of the hyaluronic acids can be digested, so that if you get a lump or a bump, it’s easy to fix. Radiesse is harder to get rid of, but the flip side is that it lasts longer and has a lot more lifting capability.



Q. What is Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) treat?
What our experts say:

PDT is used to treat age spots, sun damage, and it’s great for photo-rejuvenation. In addition, I use it to treat pre-cancerous spots on the skin. It’s more invasive than Intense Pulsed Light (IPL). When done correctly, it’s like the worst sunburn you could ever have. It will get your attention both during treatment and after. We combine this with IPL, which is great for shaving off a lot of sun-damaged years. Patients treated with PDT or CO2 laser require the most follow up care. We see those people almost daily because without the skin as an intact barrier, patients get into trouble with allergies and irritation. It takes about a week to heal. 



Q. Upper lip - verical wrinkles above the lip
What our experts say:

I like a small amount of Botox, Dysport or Xeomin to relax the muscles around the mouth. I also like to use a firming cream to help stiffen the skin. In many of my patients, I will customize a filler (many of them are too thick for the thin skin of this area) by adding some saline or lidocaine to thin it out. I will then inject it to reduce the lines. Finally, patients with these lines can benefit from ablative (CO2) laser.



Q. Would you rather put fat in a face or Juvéderm, Restylane, Sculptra, or Radiesse?
What our experts say:

Depends on the face but in general, I am not a fan of fat. In my hands, it was unpredictable and lumpy so I stopped it and instead use products that are consistently the same thickness and duration. I like Juvederm for fine lines where I am trying to lift the skin up about 1 mm. I like Restylane and Perlane for thicker lines, lifting cheeks and filling tear troughs. It is wonderful in mid- thick skin. Sculptra is great to add volume in an area that has sunken in and restores a really youthful appearance to the cheeks and temples. I usually combine Sculptra with fillers. Radiesse is a thicker, white product that has great lifting capability. I like it for the hands, cheeks, temples and smile lines. I don’t like it for the tear trough, lips or fine line. Belotero is wonderful for superficial lines around the mouth and also a great product for the tear troughs. I also inject it into the fine lines of the forehead and chin. In Europe, they are using Voluma to lift. It is a thicker hyaluronic acid designed to lift the face.

FAQ



Q. What is a pulse dye laser used to treat?  Does it hurt?  What can I expect my skin to look like after treatment?  
What our experts say:

It’s probably the oldest and most widely used lasers to treat broken blood vessels and scars, or anything that’s red, including stretch marks and rosacea. The only thing I don’t use it for is leg veins. It’s approved to treat that, but I find that it gives unacceptable white spots afterwards. It’s a pretty mild treatment that freezes the skin before the light beam hits it, so it’s pretty comfortable.



Q. Where is Botox most commonly injected? 
What our experts say:

Botox is most commonly injected in the area it’s FDA approved for, frown lines. A close second, is a combination of injections into the forehead and outside the brow to give a brow lift.



Q. How long does Botox take after it’s injected to work?  How long do the effect last?
What our experts say:

There are studies that show that within 48 hours,patients notice an onset, but typically we see maximal onset in 5 to 7 days. Also studies using Dysport, Xeomin, show a very rapid onset, sometimes within 2 to 3 days.  How long it lasts depends on the dose.  If you go to discount place that waters it down, it might only last 4 to 6 weeks; but, in general, the duration is 3 to 4 months; and you get longer duration after several visits.  Patients who have been treated for 8 to 10 years break their habit of wrinkling, so they don’t need to use it again for 6 months or more.



Q. Is collagen still used as a filler?
What our experts say:

No.



Q. How do you treat “lipstick bleed” lines?
What our experts say:

Carefully. I will do a variety of things. Sometime I use dilute hyaluronic acid mixed with saline to thin it out, and inject using a small needle into the fold.  I also use one of botulinum toxins to weaken the pucker muscles, or one of my CO2 lasers to etch out the lines.



Q. What was Evolence?
What our experts say:

It was a pig-derived collagen product that they are no longer marketing in the United States. It was great for filling lines. In my opinion, it’s a shame it got pulled. 



Q. What is the treatment for spider veins?  Does it hurt?  How many treatments do I need?
What our experts say:

If the veins are smaller than a paper clip, then I like to inject them. If they are bigger, then I send the patient to someone for an ultrasound evaluation, and an endovenous intervention. Both of those should be done by someone who does a lot of it. Either a vascular surgeon, an interventional radiologist or a dermatologist with vascular skill. I don’t treat anything bigger than a paperclip. I don’t do anything I can’t do really well.



Q. What does IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) treat?  Who is the best candidate for this?  Does it hurt?
What our experts say:

IPL is great for skin texture, brown spots and red spots. We use it all day. It’s great at reversing the signs of sun damage and aging. I have not had anyone who couldn’t tolerate it. It feels like a rubber band. There is really minimal downtime; the skin gets pink with a little flaking for a few days. The best candidate would be a fair-skinned person who has been exposed to a lot of sun. It would be a patient who could come in a few times for treatments, and then they will need to use sun protection, a skin brightening serum and/or Retina-A. They will proceed gradually and will stick to a program.



Q. What is the best treatment for cellulite? (How long until you see results? How long do results last? How many treatments do you need?)
What our experts say:

Having decent parents! The best treatment for cellulite remains to be seen. Right now, there are two treatments that are good for it. SmoothShapes laser by Cynosure; and Zeltiq. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. I made the decision to use SmoothShapes and I am thrilled with it. It’s not a home run, but none are. It uses two different wavelengths to mobilize and melt fat; and then uses suction to increase blood flow. It’s totally non-invasive, it’s like having a massage. The patient has to come in two times a week for four to six weeks. (We are now trying protocols to decrease the number of visits, by having longer treatments.) I recommend completing the course of treatment and then coming in for an enhancement at six to 12 months because as women age, they continue to make new cellulite. After treatment, they will see some change in the appearance of the fat. I have seen in some people some change in the size of the area treated as well. What I tell people is the appearance will change, but the measurement may not.



Q. How long do fillers last?
What our experts say:

Prevelle lasts for a few weeks; it’s a low concentration, a low cross-linked, hyaluronic acid. Radiesse lasts six to nine months. Sculptra lasts 12 to 22 months. Juvéderm, Restylane and Perlane last six to 12 months (depending on whether an enhancement injection is done after the initial injection).



Q. What is Sculptra used for? 
What our experts say:

It’s a collagen-stimulating molecule. Whereas other products are used for lifting, sculpting or filling, Sculptra is used for volume replenishment. It causes the body to make collagen, and, unlike the other fillers, it requires a series of injections. It’s absolutely wonderful for sunken cheeks, fallen temples, filling out the jawline, and it can bridge the gap between filling lines and facial volume restoration. As we age,the face loses volume and everything goes south. Sculptra can reinflate the face and pull things north by creating collagen. You can combine Sculptra with other products. This really gives someone a renovation without surgical intervention.



Q. What is Isolaz used to treat?
What our experts say:

It’s another type of laser we use for the treatment of acne. It’s approved for other things, but it’s primarily an acne laser. It combines laser energy with a vacuum. It’s really great at cleaning out the skin.



Q. Can a Fraxel laser be used on other areas of the body?
What our experts say:

It can all be used on other parts of the body. We just have to have the experience and adjust the energy.



Q. What is the best laser of overall facial rejuvenation?
What our experts say:

If you can tolerate the downtime, the CO2 ActiveFX or DeepFX. If they don’t have a few days for downtime, than I would use the Fraxel. It doesn’t go as deep. I also like a pixilated laser, which erases fragments or dots, and allows islands of normal skin to stay. The skin gets red, but typically there is no downtime.



Q. Do fillers in the lips stimulate collagen production?
What our experts say:

There is a lot of information that fillers in any part of the body stimulate collagen production. In some patients, not only does it stimulate collagen production but after a few injections, the products begin to last longer. Between these two mechanisms, the injections get really great results. 



Q. What can I do for thin skin?
What our experts say:

Use things that prevent more thinning – sun protection and not smoking. In addition, try to incorporate vitamin C and Retin A or retinol in your daily skin care regime.



Q. Are there any effective lasers out there used to tighten knee area?
What our experts say:

There are! The trick is to find one that works and then do a series of treatments. I like the radiofrequency device and in my office, I use the Exilis. I have not used the ultrasound machines in this area but think they probably help.



Q. Is it safe to have ipl and yag laser done on the same spots at the same time?
What our experts say:

Probably not- I would use one or the other. They have some overlap and I would be cautious about over treating.



Q. Is it common to have loss of pigment after TCA Peel?
What our experts say:

It sounds like there may be some scarring. Scars tend not to have pigment in them so this may be part of the problem.  It is unusual to see this after a TCA peel if it was done at lower strengths so you should check in with the doc that did the peels to make sure everything is ok. If you are white in some areas there are a few things that one can try to even them out but sun protection and time help immensely. If that does not work, bimatoprost topically may help.



Q. What type of laser is used for hair removal?  Who is the best candidate?  
What our experts say:

The Alexandrite laser made by Candela. It works best on those with light skin and dark hair (the energy that gets focused is on a primary target which is the hair shaft). If the patient has dark skin, diode lasers can be used. We can also use an Alexandrite laser at lower energies. No matter what laser is used, the darker the skin, the harder it is to treat. The same holds true for light hair which is hard to treat because there is just no target.



Q. What type of laser is used to smooth out fine lines and wrinkles?
What our experts say:

I use a Fraxel 1550 by SoltaMedical. I also use the ActiveFX, a CO2 laser for patients who need a deeper peel and can tolerate a little more down time.



Q. What type of laser is used to treat age spots (brown spots)? What are treatment requirements?
What our experts say:

It depends on how light the spots are and where they are. Patients can use a brightening serum, scientificskin.com, that’s my product; or an exfoliator to polish the outer skin (these would be the least invasive treatment methods). A lot of times, we can use a Q-tip and treat each spot with liquid nitrogen, which freezes each spot and then it falls off—it works like a charm.There are also a variety of chemical peels that work; as well as two types of light therapies: Intense Pulsed Light or Photodynamic Therapy (blue light) for the face, neck and chest area. I also use lasers to treat brown spots: The Fraxel 1927, the Alexandrite laser and the Nd:YAG laser (these would be the most invasive treatments). The darker the spot, the more invasive the treatment, and the higher the likelihood of having a white spot afterwards.



Q. Are there risks involved with using Botox?
What our experts say:

Any time we touch someone with a needle there can be injection site discomfort, and some local redness, but these are small risks. Botox has specific risks, such as occasional headaches; and sometimes you can get eyelid or eyebrow heaviness, but that’s most commonly seen in people who are straining their forehead, and using muscles or holding their eyelid or eyebrow up. It’s not really a side effect, but more of an unmasking of something the muscles were compensating for. If we relax their entire forehead and things tend to drop, they may need surgery instead to remove excess skin. A lot of the time, if the forehead is treated in an overly aggressive way, and every line is removed (especially the lower 1/3 of them), that is usually when that complication occurs.



Q. Whats the opinion of plasma replacement therapy for filler?
What our experts say:

I think that PRP can supplement fillers and may make them look better and last longer but thus far the data is not really dramatic so I dont use it in my office, I prefer to use fillers that are reliable.



Q. If you are going to be treated with Juvederm for under eye hollows and to add a bit of volume to your cheeks and also Ulthera for some lifting in the brow area, tightening under the eyes and jowel area, which should be done first and how far apart?
What our experts say:

I would do the Ulthera first so that if you are going to have some tightening, the fillers will be done once the tightening has been accomplished. I would treat about 4-7 days apart.



Q. What do you recommend to treat hypertrophic scars that are flat but have a dark purplish/pinkish color?
What our experts say:

There are many treatments but I like using the pulse dye laser and injecting cortisone directly into the scars. Using this combination has been very successful for me.



Q. I am one of the .3 percent that Botox and Dysport doesn't work for!  Are there alternatives?
What our experts say:

When you say "doesn't work" I would like to know more? did it ever work and now it doesnt? Does it do anything but not last (in which case you probably were not given enough). If you are one of the few people that the products dont work for there is another type A toxin called Xeomin that might work (it wont if you have antibodies that block all type A) or you can try Myobloc which is a type B product.



Q. Does hair removal have any side effects? 
What our experts say:

Yes, there can be increase or decrease of pigment, rarely scarring and occasionally infections. Each of these may occur following treatment but are rare. The frequency with which one sees complications is related to sun exposure in many instances so be careful when getting laser hair removal.



Q. I have a question about Thermage. If you have dental implants and or crowns on teeth can you still get Thermage on your face ?
What our experts say:

No, Thermage will not cause a problem if you have dental implants (or other implants either). While you may pick up the occasional broadcast of Radio Free Havana, you shouldn't have a problem in any other way (just kidding about the last part)



Q. What's the best way to treat sun damage?
What our experts say:

The best way to treat sun damage is with a combination approach such as a topical medication / cosmeceutical (Retin A and vitamin C are two that come to mind) and a light source or laser. For light sources, I recommend Intense Pulsed light or Photodynamic therapy (using a dye with an activation light). For laser, I like the fractionated CO2 or fractionated non ablative laser (Fraxel is one good example of this).



Q. Are cosmeceuticals regulated by the FDA the same way as prescription topicals?
What our experts say:

Cosmeceuticals are not regulated to the same degree as drugs. They fall into a grey area that is not subject to the same regulation as drugs. Any product that claims to make a difference really needs to do so, there is no difference between those sold by doctors and those sold by others. There is no distinction between a cosmeceutical and a skin care product in this regard.



Q. I am a light brown complexion hispanic hyperpigmentation
What our experts say:

Light brown Hispanic skin frequently has hyperpigmentation. In some patients, I pre- treat with topical steroids to decrease the pigment and then treat with the Fraxel 1927 at low energy to decrease the pigment. There are many dermatologists in Florida that have experience treating this and I would call a few in the area where you are and ask if they are comfortable treating you. Be aware that some people have hyperpigmentation that nothing helps (they tend to be mid darkness and take oral contraception).



Q. What kind of acne is this and why do I continue to have flare ups every few weeks?
What our experts say:

You may have a bacterial infection instead of regular acne. One needs to culture it to see what type of bacteria is present and then treat it.  Less likely but possible is a fungal infection- this would need different treatments entirely.  If that does not work, one can use photodynamic therapy (Blu Lights with Levulan) or Isolase to treat it. Finally, isotretinoin may be required to get it under control.



Q. Im forty two with extra pigment on my face for the past twenty I hate it. I want it of my face already.
What our experts say:

Depends on your sun exposure, hormone status (eg are you taking birth control) and pigment type. If you have light pigment irregularity, salicylic acid peels (like those from Theraplex) can help. Intense pulsed lights can also help. Tretinoin and brightening serums can also decrease the pigment. Avoiding sun and anything that will cause the pigment to increase is critical.



Q. i have hair loss from my age of 13. still its same. but no improvements as well as it has not been worse.
What our experts say:

The best supplement to take is iron (FeoSol). I don’t think that food supplements can make a significant difference so I wouldn’t worry about that. I would make sure that your thyroid and other hormones are normal (especially the male hormones). I think that you can use minoxidil and perhaps bimatoprost can help grow hair. Finally, there are some dermatologists that specialize in hair at university centers.



Q. What is the best cream to apply to remove dark pigmentations at the armpit?
What our experts say:

Hydroquinone and tretinoin. 



Q. I have small, thin, hairlike red veins around my cheeks.  Can I get rid of it with a laser and if so, what is the downtime?  Will my skin peel and be very red?
What our experts say:

These are easily treated with Pulsed Dye laser. Typically this requires 3-4 visits. While some lasers don’t produce a lot of bruising, my impression is that the ones that bruise require fewer treatments to get done. I have two different pulse dye lasers and use them frequently. When people have lighter vessels, I use my intense pulsed light to help get rid of them. This is nice because there is usually no bruising.



Q. What if you pop a zit and you accedentally peel your skin off? How can you heal it fast?
What our experts say:

Not a good idea. However , if you have already done this, put on some bacitracin and leave it alone. They usually repair in a few days.



Q. How often do cellulite treatments need to be done for optimum results?
What our experts say:

Depends on the treatment. The ones that I use (Exilis and Smoothshapes) require treatments once a week.  Others such as Zeltiq are done once per area. 



Q. Is there someone knowing something about the RT001 topical gel?
What our experts say:

As I know, there is Botulinum Toxin Type A topical gel being in trial, and is prospective to be approved by FDA. Is that true.  From what is posted on clinicaltrials.gov, this is true. The gel is a topical type of botulinum toxin that is in trials across the US.



Q. How can I make my lips look puffy and plump
What our experts say:

Inject them or use my Eyesculpt product (which my patients have told me is wonderful for lip lines). I like to inject lips with a clear product such as Restylane, Perlane, Juvederm or Belotero.  My patients like a natural look so I try to provide lip definition instead of monkey lips. 



Q. Can lasers can darken melasma?
What our experts say:

Absolutely- any injury can drop pigment into the skin from the outer layers into the dermis. Lasers will do this and the stronger the laser, the higher the chance of darkening. It is far better to use a laser that is gentle and designed to treat melasma or do a series of light peels (salicylic acid such as Theraplex peels) than to do one big procedure.



Q. Is there anything to help with white spots from acne scars? I have been told it is hypopigmentation.
What our experts say:

This is true- it is hypopigmentation (loss of pigment). There are a few things that can be done. If the scars are depressed (as most are) one can get treated with a fractional laser to help this. Once the surface is smoother, scars tend to be less noticeable and in some instances, pigment cells migrate in with the new skin that grows. There are some experimental treatments that grow pigment cells which in the future can be transplanted.



Q. Home vs Professional Microdermabrasion (Diamond Tome)
What our experts say:

The home systems are more gentle and do not do as much. The good part is that they are not as likely to get you into trouble.



Q. If I dont actually peel after my chemical peel, is it still effective?
What our experts say:

Usually it is because a superficial layer will slough. However, some peels are designed to be light and for these, multiple peels are required to see any effectiveness. Peels such as the Theraplex Salicylic Acid peel are effective with minimal slough. Deeper peels such as TCA (trichloracetic acid) will almost always peel.



Q. How are Dysport and Xeomin different from Botox?
What our experts say:

It’s kind of like Coke and Pepsi. In a lot of respects, injectors have a different response depending on a patient’s anatomy and biology. They are all good products. Xeomin is a protein that doesn’t have additional molecules with it that bind the actual active molecule. Some physicians think this is better while others prefer the carrier molecules. Each is manufactured in a different way, and there are subtle differences between them. Each has its own advocates, but Botox still retains the lead in terms of number of injections. The arrival of the two new competitors has increased the amount of people getting injections; so they all are increasing their marketing because of competition.



Q. What is the difference between Restylane and Perlane? Juvéderm? Radiesse? Belotero? Where is each of them used?
What our experts say:

The biggest difference is what they are made of. Restylane, Perlane, Juvéderm, and Belotero are hyaluronic acids or sugar-derived molecules. They are all clear and gel-based. Juvéderm tends to be smoother and great for thin skin and for filling superficial lines. Restylane and Perlane are more particulate and firmer so are better for injectable facelifts and sculpting. To lift up the mid-face, or if there are deeper lines, we use a thicker product like Radiesse. Radiesse is a calcium-based filler, that is white and thicker. Because of its color and thickness, it needs to be placed deeper in the skin. It’s not intended for use in the lips or under the eyes. Any of the hyaluronic acids can be digested, so that if you get a lump or a bump, it’s easy to fix. Radiesse is harder to get rid of, but the flip side is that it lasts longer and has a lot more lifting capability.



Q. What is Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) treat?
What our experts say:

PDT is used to treat age spots, sun damage, and it’s great for photo-rejuvenation. In addition, I use it to treat pre-cancerous spots on the skin. It’s more invasive than Intense Pulsed Light (IPL). When done correctly, it’s like the worst sunburn you could ever have. It will get your attention both during treatment and after. We combine this with IPL, which is great for shaving off a lot of sun-damaged years. Patients treated with PDT or CO2 laser require the most follow up care. We see those people almost daily because without the skin as an intact barrier, patients get into trouble with allergies and irritation. It takes about a week to heal. 



Q. Upper lip - verical wrinkles above the lip
What our experts say:

I like a small amount of Botox, Dysport or Xeomin to relax the muscles around the mouth. I also like to use a firming cream to help stiffen the skin. In many of my patients, I will customize a filler (many of them are too thick for the thin skin of this area) by adding some saline or lidocaine to thin it out. I will then inject it to reduce the lines. Finally, patients with these lines can benefit from ablative (CO2) laser.



Q. Would you rather put fat in a face or Juvéderm, Restylane, Sculptra, or Radiesse?
What our experts say:

Depends on the face but in general, I am not a fan of fat. In my hands, it was unpredictable and lumpy so I stopped it and instead use products that are consistently the same thickness and duration. I like Juvederm for fine lines where I am trying to lift the skin up about 1 mm. I like Restylane and Perlane for thicker lines, lifting cheeks and filling tear troughs. It is wonderful in mid- thick skin. Sculptra is great to add volume in an area that has sunken in and restores a really youthful appearance to the cheeks and temples. I usually combine Sculptra with fillers. Radiesse is a thicker, white product that has great lifting capability. I like it for the hands, cheeks, temples and smile lines. I don’t like it for the tear trough, lips or fine line. Belotero is wonderful for superficial lines around the mouth and also a great product for the tear troughs. I also inject it into the fine lines of the forehead and chin. In Europe, they are using Voluma to lift. It is a thicker hyaluronic acid designed to lift the face.

Our Community



About Us | Our Community | Our Events | Our MagazineMembers by: Points | Beers | Places | Posts | Likes | Staff



Comprised of consumers and industry professionals, many of whom started as members of this site, BeerAdvocate's (BA) community is one of the oldest, largest, and most respected beer communities online.


Founded in 1996 by the Alström brothers, BA started as a guide to beer with reviews written exclusively by Jason and Todd. But soon after we installed our first message board (forum) and opened up rating and reviewing to a group of members that steadily grew. Not only was this the birth of today's robust online beer community, but the sense of camaraderie forged by beer (the ultimate social lubricant) quickly extended to beer trading, in-person meetups, and even larger gatherings once we began hosting events.


Today, BA welcomes registered members and millions of new visitors each month who all contribute in various ways to help make our community the go-to resource for beer.
