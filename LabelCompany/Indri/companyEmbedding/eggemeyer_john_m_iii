Walmart® Credit Card


                                            My husband called a customer service dealing with our balance. We've had this card for over 4 years and have only missed one payment. And have not used this card in over 2 years. This is our debt, and we do without some things to make sure it gets paid here lately. He told...show more

AAA Insurance


                                            I submitted a claim for a burglary in April. The beginning of this joke is that the girl that answered the 800 number didn't know where claims were sent. She had me send my claim to the Walnut Creek, California office. When I contacted the adjuster IN OKLAHOMA CITY, he said...show more

                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

Ex-Div Reminder For Saratoga Investment Corporation New (SAR)
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 1/29/15, Saratoga Investment Corporation New will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.22, payable on 2/27/15. As a percentage of SAR's recent stock price of $15.18, this dividend works out to approximately 1.45%, so look for shares of Saratoga Investment Corporation New to trade 1.45% lower — all else being equal — when SAR shares open for trading on 1/29/15.
