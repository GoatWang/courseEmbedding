Brenham Oil & Gas Corp. Signs Production Sharing Contract For 500,000 Acre Block With The Government Of Equatorial Guinea






GlobeNewswire



Dec 20, 2012 1:39 PM EST













 




























































    HOUSTON and KEMAH, Texas, Dec. 20, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brenham Oil & Gas Corp., (OTCBB:BRHM) ("Brenham"), a subsidiary of American International Industries, Inc., (OTCBB:AMIN), announced that it has executed a Production Sharing Contract with the Government of Equatorial Guinea in West Africa. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Brenham received a 15% participating interest in newly-created Block Y, which consolidates four offshore exploration blocks into a single, half-million acre license.  Xuan Energy is the operator of Block Y. The Government's press release on the Block Y signing ceremony can be viewed at:    http://www.equatorialoil.com/html/press_release1.html#pr-dec-17-12  A map showing the location of Block Y, which borders Hess Corporation's Okume Field on the north, east and west, can be viewed at:    http://www.equatorialoil.com/Licence_map_-_Provisional_12_12.pdf  Rog Hardy, Brenham's Vice President of Exploration, stated, "Block Y is between and along a geologic trend with Hess Corporation's large Okume and Ceiba oil and gas field complex (which peaked at more than 80,000 barrels of oil per day) and an undeveloped oil discovery in Block P to the north, with, among other companies, VAALCO Energy. The block awarded to Brenham is large, with plenty of room to run, and is in benign operating conditions and moderate water depths.  We are very excited about the exploration potential of Block Y."  Daniel Dror, Brenham's Chief Executive Officer and President, stated, "Brenham's entry into this high-potential opportunity in West Africa is a result of our team's extensive experience in Africa with companies such as Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Unocal, and years of focused, rigorous geotechnical and commercial evaluations. We believe that Block Y has the right upside-to-risk mix and we intend for this project to be the foundation for additional quality ventures in West Africa and elsewhere. Brenham looks forward to working with the Government of Equatorial Guinea and our other partners to conduct a successful exploration campaign."

Brenham Oil & Gas Corp. Acquires A Producing 394 Acre Oil & Gas Lease In The Gillock, Dickinson And Eagle Bay Field, Galveston County, Texas






GlobeNewswire



Apr 4, 2013 9:38 AM EDT













 




























































    HOUSTON and KEMAH, Texas, April 4, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brenham Oil & Gas Corp., (OTCBB:BRHM) ("Brenham"), a subsidiary of American International Industries, Inc., (OTCBB:AMIN) ("American"), announced that it purchased a producing 394 acre oil and gas lease. Mr. Bryant Mook, President of Brenham, who holds a Master of Engineering degree in Petroleum Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines and a Bachelor of Science degree geology from Southern Methodist University, stated that the acquired acreage is located just west of Galveston Bay, Galveston County, 35 miles southeast of Houston and 15 miles northwest of Galveston. Moreover the acreage is adjacent to and one location away from the Gillock, East Segment Field operated by Alta Mesa Services, and about two miles west of the Eagle Bay Field operated by Sandridge Onshore, LLC and Transtexas Gas Corp.  Mr. Mook further stated that after studying the lease and its location, in addition to existing geological and engineering reports, came to the conclusion that the Dickinson-Gillock-Eagle Bay-South Gillock Fields are segments of a large, complexly faulted deep seated salt dome. Developments to date have shown the uplift to be about 8.3 miles in length and about 6.5 miles in width. The productive closure is about 2,100 feet and the productive area is more than 14,000 acres. Brenham is in the process of purchasing 3D seismic data over the area of its acreage. This data will be integrated into our future drilling and development of the area.  The conclusions of an internal reserve study of the 394 acre lease purchased by Brenham indicate proved undeveloped (PUD) undiscounted revenues of $82,724,800 and discounted NPV of 10% valued at $38,259,500. Possible reserves (POSS) undiscounted valued at $372,043,700 and discounted NPV of 10% valued at $160,050,500. The total of the proved undeveloped and probable reserves, discounted at NPV 10% for a total of $198,310,000.

HOUSTON, Oct. 3, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brenham Oil & Gas Corp., (OTCQB:BRHM) (subsidiary of American International Industries, Inc.)

	The Depository Trust Company (DTC) is a subsidiary of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation DTCC, and manages the electronic clearing and settlement of publicly traded companies.

	Daniel Dror, CEO of Brenham Oil & Gas Corp., stated, "We are pleased to announce that we have obtained DTC eligibility, effective October 2, 2014. Electronic trading is the standard in today's financial markets, and becoming DTC-eligible greatly simplifies the process of trading and exchanging our common stock. We continue to make positive steps to grow the Company. We would like to specifically thank our securities counsel Ronald C. Kaufman of Kaufman Wallis and our transfer agent, Vstock Transfer and their Vice President of Sales Lisa Loew, for their guidance through this process. We will continue to update our shareholders on our progress."

	Should shareholders have any questions or need assistance with regards to their certificates, they can e-mail our securities counsel Ronald C. Kaufman at rkaufman@kaufmanwallis.com.
