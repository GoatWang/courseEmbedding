My friend recommended me and I am very happy with the outcome of my case and the way I was treated. I see his review below (Randolph S.)  I agree with all the good reviews below. I was being sued by Bank of America and they won my case. Now I do not have to pay anything. Mr. Bunch is a great lawyer in court. I also want to say a word about his assistant, Lisa. She always made time for me even when I showed up without an appointment. She is really busy and sometimes she would have to call me back or I would have to leave a message, but she always - and I mean always - called me back. I do not like the Cobb County court. The room was really dingy and the room was too hot with all the people. The staff was okay. I would never be a lawyer, but Mr. Bunch did a good job of preparing me for what to expect. He even arranged for me to go to the courtroom and practiced with me in the actual witness stand so that I would not be as scared when I testified. I think he  spent a lot more time with me than he actually charged me for and he deserves a word of thanks for that. I think I should also mention that this lawyer was always early. Every day I had to meet with him or go to court, he was there before I was. I never had to wait - like a doctors waiting room - except when I did not have an appointment. I probably bugged him too much about my case  but he was always nice about it. I do not like the fact that he will not meet out of the office for lunch. I tried to get him to come to lunch on several occasions but he was always too busy. At least he always was honest about it. Also, I do not like the coffee in his office, it is way way too strong, but I did not think that was a reason to withhold a star.Jackel & Phillips PCpeterthune11 ratedFrom the first time I spoke wi...Above and beyond my expectations!!! From the first time I spoke with Chris and Dana (which was back in 2011) all the way up to our settlement today , they have been tenacious and considerate, even when I was admittedly not the ideal client.  I hired Jackel and Phillips to represent my 5 year old son who was seriously injured in a horrible accident.   These attorneys  were very persistent and organized! They refused to accept the &amp;quot;run around&amp;quot; from ANYONE, espeically the insurance company! I trust them %100. They informed me about EVERYTHING, even if I did not ask. Both Dana and Chris were very easy to contact. On the rare occasion that I had to leave a message, they would return my call usually on the same day. As far as the case goes, I am more than pleased. They got my son WAY more than I ever thought possible and structured the  settlement for maximum returns in the future. They handled everything with genuine care and concern. The whole team at Jackel and Phillips is absolutely THE BEST there is!!!... Steven A CookElizabeth A. ratedHe basically showed up to court, late... and when we went in front of the judge he did the minimal amount of speaking and did not advise me on options at all. He was Very quick to take the payment to the bank and cashed it...m but when we wanted him to represent me (he insisted we pay up-front and immediately before he would look at my file. So payment was sent, and promptly cashed in under 4 days time) and he stopped returning phone calls and certified letters requesting status uodates or any information regarding my drivers license status etc. He ignored certified mail requesting a refund for the 2nd payment and copies of all important documents required to go to the DMV...That was all back in November 2008... he has yet to follow through with anything and other than being able to view his signature on the 2nd check, he still is avoiding me, my whole family and has left a bad taste for him and hes a perfect example of why people say lawyers are sleazy and liars....Harris & Bunch, LLCYasmine A. ratedThis is a good lawyer. Attorney Jeff Bunch gets five stars from me only because I cannot think of anything he could have done better. The first meeting had to be postponed because he had a trial which went one day later than expected, so he met with me on Saturday which impressed me. He told me what to expect at my arraignment and then he convinced the prosecutor to dismiss my case at the first calendar call. I never had to go in front of the judge. one of the best things I think he did was that he made my arrest record disappear. The thing I did not like is that he would always have to call me back, but I could always talk with his paralegal Lisa. I probably called too much, but she always talked to me and Mr. Bunch always called me back when she said he would. I also like the fact that I could make payments and his total charge was less than other lawyers I spoke with. Mr. Bunch is also a pretty nice guy, for a lawyer.Abbott And Abbott PpcMarie D. ratedI received great service while...I received great service when hiring BJ and Parri Abbott for a modification. I met with Parri for my consultation and was told the initial steps, and about how long the first part of the process would take. I was in touch with my paralegal both through phone and email frequently. I didn't feel like any of the filing, communication with opposing attorney, getting in touch with me was longer than what should be expected. Everyone I dealt with was kind and helpful. I didn't want a big firm where I was just a case number. My ex husband and I went through our divorce three years prior handling the paperwork ourselves. Hiring the Abbott firm was my first experience with attorneys. I came to them with a list of expectation and they were all met. I didn't have any of the issues the previous client mentioned. I would use them again in the future if need be. Jones &amp; Swansonmelissa_123 ratedHighly Professional and Compet...Highly Professional and Competent Attorney My name is Louis D. I am a police sergeant with a Metropolitan Atlanta Police Department. In October 2008, I was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident while off-duty; which created substantial property damage and personal injury to me. Realizing the gravity of my situation, I started to search for legal counsel. Initially, I spoke with some of the highly publicized attorneys that you see on television when a co-worker recommended Andrew Jones to me. From the first call to the end of settlement negotiations, Mr. Jones and his staff provided highly competent legal services and outstanding customer service. I highly recommend Attorney Andrew Jones for any legal services that he may be able to assist you with. Law Office Of Carmen V PorreccaKaren bufford B. ratedI have had one terrible experience with a guy that works there. He is aggressive, rude and combative. I can't understand why he is there! Today I hung up on him when I called and heard his voice. THE FLIPSIDE The rest of the team has worked with me on the amount I can pay, and since I have a medical condition, they understand that I sometimes have to pay two months at the same time and have noted my account. If I refused to pay, it might affect my credit but they could never garnish my social security. I'm paying because I want to pay my bill. What I don't understand is how this horrible person keeps his job. I tried to pay my bill today and when I hung up. They can wait until Mondayl.I'll keep calling until a polite person picks up the phone.Benedict & Torpeykabenedict ratedMs. Butler, Thank you for your post. We represented you for approximately 5 weeks. During that period of time, you did not send us any of the information requested. We gladly took your request to handle your case on your own. Ms. Torpey filed the appropriate withdrawal documents. Our Board Rules require service by email or electronic mail. Your adjuster knows this. With regard to the numerous calls you made to this office, I am able to see them on the phone when I am talking to other clients. If you don't leave us a voice message, we are unable to return the call. It is disappointing that you took to such a public forum to verbalize an incorrect rendition of the facts and law. We wish you the best.08/14/13Abbott And Abbott PpcBradley K. ratedAbbott and Abbott were the best choice for my divorce.  I recommend them very highly!  Bj and Parri walked me through everything during my case as well as continuing to help me long after my case concluded.  I got custody of my three children and have contacted them numerous times concerning other issues that have come about.  The never hesitate to help or give me advice.  Let me be very clear...  they are not miracle workers but they are very talented and intelligent.  They will definitely help any way that they can.!!  Highly recommended.Jackel & Phillips PClindabaker925 ratedI was very seriously injured in a car wreck resulting in multiple medical procedures.  I hired JACKEL & PHILLIPS after researching the firm and meeting their "team" to discuss my case. Both Dana and Chris are excellent attorneys who really know the law and how to manage a lawsuit.  They aggressively pursued my case, kept me informed along the way and obtained a fantastic settlement, despite the insurance company fighting who was responsible for the wreck!  I would highly recommend these attorneys for your personal injury case!Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
