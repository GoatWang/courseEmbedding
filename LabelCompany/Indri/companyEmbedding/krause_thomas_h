Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Somewhat Positive Press Coverage Somewhat Unlikely to Affect Broadcom (BRCM) Stock Price


					Posted by Harper Lund on Jul 21st, 2017 // No Comments

Accern ranks coverage of publicly-traded companies on a scale of negative one to one, with scores closest to one being the most favorable. Broadcom earned a media sentiment score of 0.07 on Accern’s scale. Accern also assigned headlines about the semiconductor manufacturer an impact score of 45.7110731531696 out of 100, meaning that recent press coverage is somewhat unlikely to have an effect on the stock’s share price in the near future.
