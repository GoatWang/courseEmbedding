The most common form is seen with an inherited foot type that tends to excessively “pronate” or flatten to a degree that allows a muscle imbalance and secondary bunion to form. Shoe pressure on the bunion produces pain and sometimes inflammation. Treatment after medical evaluation may consist of one or more of the following: shoe pressure avoidance, “pronation” or flatfoot control with custom orthotics to decrease the bunion progression, anti-inflammatory medication use and surgery.Diabetic Foot CareDiabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is metabolic disease characterized by high blood sugar (glucose) levels, which result from defects in insulin secretion, action or both. Symptoms of diabetes may be detected in the feet and diabetes can have numerous negative effects on the feet. These include neuropathy, altered circulation, ulcerations, infections and sometimes amputation. Medical evaluation and treatment of any acute or chronic foot condition by your podiatrist can lessen the occurrence of diabetic complications.Flat FeetFungus ToenailsGeneral PodiatryWelcome to the office of Stephen A. Byrne, DPM! Our practice is dedicated to providing the highest quality foot and ankle health care to our patients in a warm, professional and caring environment. Podiatrists are specialists in the care of foot and ankle conditions. Our practice focuses on providing podiatric care for the entire family; Dr. Byrne serves patients of all ages.HammertoesHeel SpursHeel pain is a painful foot condition, usually caused from inflammation of the plantar fascia (fasciitis), the "bowstring-like" tissue in the bottom of the foot that extends from the heel to the toes. This condition is often seen with people who stand for long periods, are doing activities that excessively strain the plantar fascia or have a foot type that excessively “pronates” or flattens. A “heel spur” may occur as a result of the excessive strain of the plantar fascia at its heel bone attachment. Symptoms usually consist of an aching pain at the inner heel and/or arch that usually occurs when standing after rest and with extended standing activity.  This condition can be secondary to acute trauma or from the micro-trauma of long term arch strain. Treatment usually consists of reducing the inflammation present and controlling the underlying cause. After being medically evaluated, treatment options may consist of one or more of the following: rest, protected “cold” application, oral and injectable anti-inflammatory medications, arch support or custom orthotic use to control excessive pronation present, shockwave therapy and surgery.Heel PainIngrown ToenailsAn ingrown toenail is a common condition that occurs when the toenail edge grows into the skin of the toe. Usually this occurs due to aggressive nail trimming, genetics or shoes that irritate the nail/skin junction. An ingrown toenail can be painful and lead to infection. Nail border trimming may relieve a mild ingrown toenail. For a long standing or severely ingrown toenail, permanent treatment usually consists of removing the ingrown toenail border and its growth center. This is performed as an office procedure.Pediatric Foot CarePodiatric SurgeryDr. Byrne received his Doctor of Podiatric Medicine degree from the Ohio College of Podiatric Medicine in 1980. He completed his post doctoral residency in reconstructive foot and ankle surgery at Highlands Center Hospital in Denver, Colorado. In 1984, he moved to metro Atlanta and opened his Canton office. An Ellijay office was later opened in 1989. Dr. Byrne is board certified in foot and ankle surgery by the American Board of Podiatric Surgery and a member of the American Podiatric Medical Association as well as the Georgia Podiatric Medical Association. Dr. Byrne served two terms as the Chief of Podiatric Surgery at Wellstar Windy Hill Hospital in Marietta, Georgia and one term as a member of the Board of Directors of the Georgia Podiatric Medical Association. Dr. Byrne resides in Sandy Springs, Georgia with his wife Alice.
