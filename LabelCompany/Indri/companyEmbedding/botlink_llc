What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Extended Endurance Aircraft Systems

        We take a multi-tiered approach to manage power distribution and improve the time your unmanned aircraft stays aloft. Our extended endurance system includes sophisticated Power Management and Distribution (PMAD), smart battery, speed and torque motor control and soaring algorithms. We've already doubled flight times in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), but why stop there? More...

Endless Endurance Solar Aircraft Systems

        By adding renewable solar power to your UAS, your aircraft can charge in the air and theoretically fly forever. Packet Digital has teamed with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in an effort to create an endless endurance drone. By combining our extended endurance technology with solar Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and high-efficiency solar cells from the DoD, we believe unlimited flight times are a not-too-distant reality.

Packet Digital is proud to collaborate with this innovative company. More...

New Drone Applications

        We've only scratched the surface of what Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) can do. What if flights were longer, or perpetual? Might it give you new reason to fly? We started a list of possible uses. We'd like you to add more. More...

Drone Software Developer Botlink and Hardware Developer Packet Digital Announce New Partnership

June 4, 2015 Lauren Manning Leave a comment



Aerobotic Innovations, a drone control and safety application, announced recently that it has partnered with Packet Digital LLC to offer new products that will combine their respective state-of-the-art software and hardware technologies. The partnership will operate under Aerobotic Innovations’ existing Botlink brand name. According to Aerobatic Innovations CEO Shawn Muehler, “We are taking two amazing technologies—software and hardware—and combining them in a way that no one else in the entire world has done quite yet.”
 
In 2014, a team of military and professional pilots, software developers, electrical engineers, and communicators created Botlink. The company set out to create the world’s safest and most secure drone operations platform. “We put safety at the top of the list because without safety you cannot realistically fly a drone without the threat of harming someone else,” says Muehler. Including his time as an officer in the U.S. Air Force, Muehler has been flying both manned and unmanned aircraft for over a decade. Noticing a lack of safety solutions for UAV users, pilots, and airports, Muehler saw the need for a service with an emphasis on safety.
 
The company currently offers a software platform that provides farmers and other drone users with a complete picture of the airspace around them. “Let’s say you are looking at a map of your fields, and you know that there is a particular field with wind towers. Using your smart phone or tablet device, you can draw a circle around the wind tower and the drone will not fly into it.” Known as geofencing, this tool allows farmers to fly with ease and alleviates the frustrations associated with navigating around objects manually.
 
“Farmers usually don’t have aviation experience. With Botlink, they can immediately know who is around him, where the tree lines are, and where property lines are located,” explained Muehler. “Essentially, we took the high level knowledge of a pilot and made it easy to digest for the farmer.”
 
In addition to genofencing, Botlink platforms offer a variety of real-world safety features, including real-time, or near real-time, manned and unmanned aircraft overlays with aircraft avoidance alerts and traffic advisories. The application also features complete regulatory compliance and includes temporary flight restrictions, active military operations, and restricted airspace areas. Additionally, the company’s cloud-based platform features fully automated drone control with manual drag-and-drop hand flying that can be performed right from a smart phone or tablet.
 
As a standalone product, Botlink’s software application offers many advantages to farmers possessing even a novice experience with drones and aviation. Combined with Packet Digital’s cutting edge technologies, however, Muehler sees the partnership as poised to gain momentum in the agtech industry.
 
Packet Digital CEO Terri Zimmerman agrees: “Bringing Botlink’s drone control and safety software together with Packet Digital’s efficient drone hardware creates the most robust and powerful cloud based operations platform in the industry.”
 
Packet Digital is in the business of designing, developing, and marketing advanced power management solutions for portable electronic devices and embedded systems. The company’s patented On-Demand Power technology and PowerSage integrated circuits lead to extended battery life in portable electronic devices and help consumer electronic companies and military outfits to develop faster, smarter, and smaller products. Many of Packet Digital’s products have found their way into military equipment.
 
“Current market averages for drones are about 45 minutes to one hour and fifteen minutes for flight time. So, realistically you can only get about 500-600 acres done in one shot before having to land the drone and download the files,” said Muehler. After partnering with Packet Digital, Botlink is on track to increase flight times significantly. “What we are doing with the new platform is increasing electronic efficiencies by four times.”
 
Not only will Botlink drones fly longer, they will also offer real-time data distribution and real-time photo stitching. While some may see this service as a better fit for large-scale operations, Muehler recognizes a real agronomic opportunity for small-scale operations, as well. “I think everyone will want this platform because of the fact that the return on investment for the end user is so great. You can get much more data in real time back to you in a shorter timeframe.”
 
When it comes to small-scale farmers who often lack the labor resources of larger outfits, Muehler thinks that “beaming data back to their device or home computer in real time is the only option that makes sense.” Currently, Botlink offers its safety platform for free and Muehler plans to keep it that way. The Botlink Professional package offers farmers operating up to five drones with security services, up to 1,000 acres per month in photo stitching, cloud data storage, inter-device communication, and its complete drone aviation safety package. Botlink Enterprise, geared toward large-scale operations, offers 5,000 acres per month in photo stitching, unlimited cloud data storage, and a host of other features including the safety package.
 
Zimmerman will serve as Botlink’s CEO, while Muehler will take on the roll of COO. According to Muehler, “The newly formed Botlink, LLC, enables us to accelerate our time to market by leveraging the experience and expertise of both companies. Terri’s business experience and her team’s hardware knowledge are the perfect compliments to our strong aviation and software background.”
 
The joint venture has also set its sights on raising $15 million to launch its cloud-based operations platform for drones. When asked about the current progress toward achieving this goal, Muehler said, “it’s a pretty safe bet so far.”

Botlink and Packet Digital partner to Create Solar Energy Drone

Botlink and Packet Digital partner to Create Solar Energy Drone



Fargo
Partnership

Two Fargo-based companies, Botlink and Packet Digital, announced that they are joining forces to create a drone platform which will not only allow pilots to track their drone flights in real-time, but to fly their drones using solar energy for up to four hours – 4x as long as today’s average flight time.
They are launching the joint venture as a new company, Botlink LLC, and intend to raise $15 million to launch their platform by July. Already, they have raised $5 million.

Botlink, a product of Aerobotic Innovations LLC, is a drone control and safety application that enables pilots to track their drone in real-time, view any other manned and unmanned aircraft in the surrounding airspace, and communicate with other pilots via cellular network. It’s a 1-year-old product being developed by a team of drone military pilots and both software and mechanical engineers.
Packet Digital is a 13-year-old company that develops autonomous system-level power management with a focus on power savings. Recently, they partnered with the Department of Defense to create a solar powered endless endurance drone. What they developed through solar panels on the wings and maximum power point tracking (MPPT), is the ability for a drone to fly for up to 4 hours, whereas currently average flight cycles for drones are 20-90 minutes.
“It’s a perfect merge,” Muehler said. “We [Aerobotic Innovations] are doing all the cellular technology and the software, and then Packet Digital is doing all the internal electronic efficiencies in the drone.”
With this platform, Muehler said, drones move from being a toy to an actual viable product.
Botlink is targeting the commercial market, Zimmerman said, where a high-endurance drone could benefit work like media broadcasting, weather monitoring, or search and rescue, for example. Their technology will also prevent drone crash landings, (such as the recent one from Google), by having power sensors that enable the drone to land upright, Zimmerman said.

“I think we will really enable the industry,” she said.
Botlink, LLC, will first combine efforts and technologies on their cellular drone communications device that allows real-time distribution of data the drone is collecting (sent back to the user’s device or computer), as well as facilitating beyond line of site drone control – all through existing cellular networks. They are also hiring, looking for about nine software developers.
“It just made sense.”
It took a trip to a drone conference in Atlanta, Georgia, for the two Fargo companies to get talking. Muehler and Zimmerman both traveled to check out the top notch drone tech at the AUVSI (Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International) conference in early May. But what they saw was a scramble, gold-rush style, to build more of the same.
“It was a mess,” Muehler said. “Everybody’s trying to build different versions of a mousetrap… Nobody’s actually working on a complete platform that enables every drone to do anything.”
On day one, Muehler and Zimmerman met to discuss what they were seeing. They had not even ordered their lunch when they realized the potential in combining their expertise in hardware and software.
“It just made sense,” Zimmerman said.
“It was like a light bulb moment of, why are we not doing this together? Because we can completely take the entire industry by storm if we can put this into one package,” Muehler added. “It’s been a rocket ship ever since.”
In a little under three weeks, Botlink and Packet Digital had formed their joint venture and are now planning to get their platform to market by the end of June, Zimmerman said. Already, they have spoken with potential customers and investors and are receiving responses that are “very positive,” she said.
“Everyone from DOD guys, to commercialists, to hobbyists – they’re all really excited,” Muehler said.
Building out of Fargo
The partnership of Botlink and Packet Digital is a testimony to Fargo’s style, Zimmerman and Muehler agreed. If they hadn’t met at a Chamber of Commerce dinner here, they might not have talked in Atlanta, Zimmerman said. Moreover, the collaborative environment allowed for a smooth, positive transition combining the two companies.

“People genuinely want other people to do well,” Zimmerman said. “I sense that among companies and entrepreneurs here in Fargo. When Shawn and I started talking about where the industry was going, and what we needed to do as a company, there wasn’t a guardedness of ‘what will you take of mine’, or ‘what’s better for me’, it was ‘what’s better in general.’ There was immediate trust of what could we build together, that would be better than what we could build separate.”
What they can build together, according to the two teams, is something quite remarkable.
“You’re taking two incredibly advanced products into one platform,” Muehler said. “There wasn’t any question about it, this was really the only way forward.”
“I haven’t questioned it since,” Zimmerman added. “I don’t think anybody will be as far along as we are.”

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
