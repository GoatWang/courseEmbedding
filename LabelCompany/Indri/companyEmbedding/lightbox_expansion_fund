Startups »venture capitalLightboxFundingVenture capital firm Lightbox raises about $54MWith the closure of the new fund, the Mumbai-headquartered investment firm now has over $100 million in its coffersBiswarup Gooptu  |  ET Bureau  |   December 23, 2016, 07:39 IST






 Venture capital firm Lightbox has closed a new expansion fund, estimated at about $54 million (about Rs360 crore), as the early-tomid-stage investor looks to double down on its existing portfolio, starting next year.With the closure of the new fund, the Mumbai-headquartered investment firm now has over $100 million in its coffers, a significant portion of which is expected to be deployed as it participates in the growth funding rounds of what is expected to be five of its companies, including Faasos, Furlenco, Droom, Melorra and Embibe.Sandeep Murthy , partner at Light box, confirmed that the investment firm had completed raising the new investment vehicle.“We are launching it to support our existing companies... Our companies are doing well, and as we have gone out and talked about that. We really felt that if we can carry these businesses further, build them bigger, and if we can participate further, in their upside and growth, it will be useful,“ he told ET.Of the five, Faasos, Droom and Furlenco have all closed equity financing rounds over the course of the past 12 months, with each raising about Rs 200 crore. Furlenco's last ro und was a mix of debt and equity financing.Separately, online marketplace for used automobiles and auto services, Droom, is also believed to be in early talks with potential investors to raise $30-50 million in its next round of funding, expected to close early next year.Murthy , however, declined to provide specifics of the capital raising plans of portfolio companies. According to multiple sources, the investment firm started and closed the fund raising process in four months, and could make between four and five fresh investments going forward.Lightbox's expansion fund comes a little over two years after it closed its second fund -Lightbox II -at Rs 600 crore. As with fund II, the expansion fund has, once again, been backed by a mix of new and existing limited partners, which includes endowments, pension funds, fund of funds and family offices.“Everything that we do going forward will come from whatever we have left from our current base of capital and from this new amount. We will look at it as one pool of capital,“ Murthy said.The fresh raise also comes at a time when risk capital funding in the country has plunged, compared with 2015, driven by a combination of global macro conditions and investors tightening their belts.According to VCCEdge, private investment deal volumes in India fell by more than 30% year-on-year in 2016 to 1,203 transactions. Deal values saw even a sharper drop to $10.34 billion from $21.93 billion a year ago.However, earlier this month ET re ported that Accel Partners, one of the most active investors in the country , had closed its fifth and, till date, largest fund at $450 million.Lightbox, which has been very selective in placing its bets in the Indian startup ecosystem, had earlier raised another undisclosed capital pool, called Lightbox Venture I, which was used to buy a portfolio of six investments made by venture firms Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers (KPCB) and Ram Shriram-led Sherpalo Ventures. These include refurbished goods etailer GreenDust and online photo printing service provider ZoomIn.“We are not trying to add tons of companies to our portfolio. We will continue to be deeply engaged with them, support them and be operationally involved. We expect it to be in the 8-10 companies range,“ Murthy said.RELATED
