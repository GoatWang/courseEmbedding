        Boylan settles for $600,000

Boylan





























































The SEC says the former Gemstar-TV Guide executive misled investors.Peter C. Boylan III, the Tulsa-based financial analyst and dealmaker who transformed a small niche video programming company into an international entertainment powerhouse, has agreed to pay $600,000 to settle a federal lawsuit over claims that he helped mislead investors.Boylan, 40, former co-president and co-chief operating officer of Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc., agreed to settle a complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in January.As part of the settlement, Boylan consented to a fraud injunction without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. The settlement is subject to approval by U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.The SEC's complaint alleges that from June 1999 through September 2002, Gemstar, a Pasadena, Calif.-based media and technology company, overstated its total revenue by at least $248 million to meet its ambitious projections for revenue growth.Gemstar publishes TV Guide magazine and develops, licenses and markets an interactive program guide (IPG) for television that enables consumers to navigate through and select television programs.During the three-year period specified in the complaint, Gemstar generated revenue from the IPG by licensing the technology to third parties and selling advertising on the IPG. In statements to securities analysts and the investing public, Gemstar executives repeatedly promoted the IPG technology and IPG advertising revenues as the company's future and as the "value driver" of the company's stock while they downplayed expected declines in revenue from TV Guide magazine, according to the SEC complaint.The complaint also alleges that Boylan participated in Gemstar's fraudulent reporting of transactions relating to IPG advertising. Boylan structured two transactions so that a portion of the amount to be paid to Gemstar was "nominally and artificially" allocated to the sale of IPG advertising, according to the complaint.The complaint also alleges that in press releases, conference calls with securities analysts and annual reports filed with the SEC, Boylan failed to disclose material information regarding the transactions.Boylan was charged with securities fraud, falsifying Gemstar's books and violating four sections of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Boylan's settlement with the SEC includes his agreement to pay back $300,000 of his earnings as well as a civil penalty of $300,000.The SEC said it will seek to have the $600,000 included in a fund established for harmed shareholders of Gemstar in accordance with Section 308 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.In a written statement issued by his law firm, Boylan said, "I am pleased to have this matter behind me so that I can focus my time and attention on new business opportunities."He could not be reached for comment.Boylan's attorneys, Patricia Glaser and Mark Krum of Los Angeles, said Boylan is not barred by the SEC from serving in any capacity with a publicly held company.The SEC is pursuing its case against four other former Gemstar executive officers, including former Chief Executive Officer Henry Yuen and ex-Chief Financial Officer Elsie Leung.The Los Angeles court has scheduled the trial of Yuen, Leung, former Gemstar General Counsel Jonathan B. Orlick and former TV Guide Chief Financial Officer Craig Waggy to begin Jan. 18.Asked if Boylan will be compelled to testify in that trial, Glaser said he will if he is subpoenaed."If he is subpoenaed, he's going to tell the truth. He has told the truth throughout this proceeding," Glaser said. "He has cooperated with the government, and he's happy to have this matter behind him."A 1986 graduate in finance from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Boylan began his career as a financial analyst with LaSalle Partners. He soon moved to the firm's mergers and acquisitions team in Chicago and later took charge of LaSalle Fund III, a $500 million investment vehicle.Boylan soon came to the attention of Larry Flinn, who was then the chairman of United Video Satellite Group, the Tulsa-based telecommunications conglomerate that became a publicly held company in 1993.Boylan refused Flinn's first offer, but he reconsidered when he was offered a piece of the company.
After reviewing the company's assets, which included more than 80 U.S. patents related to the company's program guide and interactive wagering businesses, Boylan told Flinn that the company had two options -- stay small or grow by taking on a strategic partner.United Video grew by teaming with Tele-Communications Inc., the Colorado-based cable TV company with 13.5 million sub scribers.In June 1998, the company announced a blockbuster -- its $2 billion purchase of TV Guide magazine, which morphed into TV Guide Interactive, TV Guide Online and TV Guide Sneak Prevue.A month later, United Video made an unsolicited $2.8 billion cash bid for its top competitor, Gemstar International Group Ltd. United Video and Gemstar, the holder of more than 60 patents relating to its interactive TV technology, had been locked in patent litigation.Their legal differences dissolved 15 months later, in October 1999, when Gemstar and TV Guide Inc. -- which United Video had become -- entered into a merger agreement under which TV Guide became a wholly owned subsidiary of Gemstar.Boylan, who had been president and chief operating officer of TV Guide, became co-president and co-chief operating officer of Gemstar-TV Guide when the deal was completed in July 2000.Boylan resigned in April 2002, forming a new company with Liberty Media.D.R.
