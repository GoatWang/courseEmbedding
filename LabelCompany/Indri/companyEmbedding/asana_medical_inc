Rectal Mucositis
Rectal Mucositis can be caused by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, especially around the abdomen or pelvis. 
There are a number of treatments for rectal mucositis, including endoscopic surgery or enema-based delivery of medicines which are  generally intended to heal the bleeding directly. Asana plans to treat these patients prophylactically, or before they get mucositis, in the hope of minimizing or preventing it from occurring.

About Us | Asana Medical



























































About Us
Asana Medical, Inc., (“Asana” or the “Company”) is an emerging life sciences company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medical devices for gastrointestinal applications. Asana’s lead product, ExtraCellular Matrix Hydrogel (ECMH), is a hydrogel composed of extracellular matrix derived from porcine tissue. ECMH creates an environment favorable for the body to grow new tissue in place of diseased or damaged tissue. Extracellular matrix has been proven to be safe and effective in esophageal repair, hernia grafts, vaginal slings, and burn and wound dressings. Asana’s novel application of this technology will treat multiple GI diseases, including Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn’s Disease, and Rectal Mucositis. Ulcerative colitis (UC), the disease to which Asana’s breakthrough technology will be applied first, is a debilitating disease that renders the colon dysfunctional.
In May 2015, the Company executed a worldwide exclusive license with the University of Pittsburgh for the core technology to facilitate Asana’s ability to develop and use ECMH, a hydrogel (liquid) form of ECM for GI diseases in the intestinal tract. The License included issued patents related to ExtraCellular Matrix Hydrogel and additional in-process IP related to the core technology’s treatment for Ulcerative Colitis and other gastrointestinal diseases. Asana expects this technology will permit the development of additional devices to treat other GI conditions listed above.
Asana is collaborating with Dr. Stephen Badylak of the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine (University of Pittsburgh), a world-class center for tissue engineering, to develop the Company’s ECMH product and to conduct much of the preclinical work. The Company intends to file with the FDA and to use the US filing to support an application for CE marking, allowing commercialization in the EU.

	Device-Based Treatment for Ulcerative Colitis

	 




	 

Marc 
	Ramer


	Founder, CEO

 


	Asana Medical, Inc.



	www.asanamedical.com


 


	Interview conducted by:


	Lynn Fosse, Senior Editor, CEOCFO Magazine, Published � March 16, 2015

 


CEOCFO: 
	Mr. Ramer, would you tell us the concept for Asana?


Mr. Ramer: 
Asana Medical 
	is an early-stage medical device company in the gastrointestinal space. 
	Specifically, we are developing a device-based treatment for ulcerative 
	colitis. Right now, the only therapies available to treat ulcerative colitis 
	are inadequate and there is no good treatment option available. For example, 
	the drugs used to treat ulcerative colitis can potentially have devastating 
	side effects, such as lymphoma, skin cancer or tuberculosis. Even then, 20% 
	to 30% of patients fail to respond to even those severe drugs and have no 
	alternative but have their colons removed, which is a major and life 
	altering surgery. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	How will you do that?


Mr. Ramer: 
	We have come up with a medical device that sets up the colon to heal itself 
	thereby eliminating the symptoms of the disease.

 


CEOCFO: Is 
	that the ECMH?


Mr. Ramer: 
	Yes, that is correct. It is ECMH (extracellular matrix hydrogel).

 


CEOCFO: 
	Would you give us a description of ulcerative colitis?


Mr. Ramer: 
	Ulcerative colitis is a disease in which the body attacks the lining of the 
	colon, called the mucosa; once the body attacks the mucosa, it breaks down 
	and the colon can no longer function properly. Once that happens, it 
	manifests in a series of debilitating symptoms including symptoms like 
	chronic bloody diarrhea, pain, tremendous urgency to use the restroom, and 
	frequent bowel movements. I have heard of cases where UC patients go up to 
	24 times in a day. There is a big psychological component as well, people 
	feel like they are chained to the bathroom. Even worse, it can lead to 
	malnutrition because of chronic dehydration and ultimately a greatly 
	increased risk of colon cancer. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	Did you set out looking for a technology to address this situation or did 
	you come upon it and realize the potential?


Mr. Ramer: 
	This disease is in my family and I saw a family member go through colon 
	removal surgery. I am a biomedical engineer by training and a loving family 
	member, and I had to find a better way. Sitting with that family member 
	post-op, I hatched the idea that ultimately became this company but not with 
	this specific technology. I thought, why couldn�t we somehow replace the 
	diseased mucosa and stimulate the regrowth of healthy new mucosa? After 
	networking through some prominent scientists, I came upon one named Dr. 
	Stephen Badylak. Dr. Badylak is the deputy director of the McGowan Institute 
	for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. He was sold on 
	the concept from our very first conversation. Steve is one of the world�s 
	foremost authorities in tissue-engineered products, which includes ECMH, and 
	he has helped commercialize ECM-based technologies for multiple clinical 
	applications. He immediately saw the potential of this and we have been 
	working together collaboratively ever since. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	Are the people that should know of Asana aware of what you are doing?


Mr. Ramer: 
	It is early but to the extent that is appropriate, we are getting the word 
	out to the medical world. We have a medical advisory board that is unusually 
	strong for a startup company like ours. These key opinion leaders see the 
	potential in what we can do for their patients. Our first task is to develop 
	the product and process, then get it into humans and ultimately 
	commercialize. Right now, it is not as important to get the message out to 
	the clinical world as it is to get it out to the investment world.

 


CEOCFO: 
	What is the market potential here?


Mr. Ramer: 
	It is substantial. Our estimate is that the market ultimately exceeds $4 
	billion and we hope to capture a substantial portion of that. 5.7 million 
	people worldwide have ulcerative colitis. There are about 1.4 million in the 
	EU and nearly 900,000 in North America. The patient population multiplied by 
	the projected price point of ECMH (which will be competitive with the 
	existing biologic drugs) equates to a $4 billion market opportunity. 


 


CEOCFO: 
	Are there competing technologies of which you are aware?


Mr. Ramer: 
	We consider the biologic drugs our primary competition because there is no 
	medical device, that we are aware of, that is positioned to treat ulcerative 
	colitis. Occasionally, a colorectal surgeon or GI will put in a stent, for 
	example, to open a colonic stricture or a narrowing, but that is just 
	treating symptoms. We are unique in that regard. There are stem-cell-based 
	technologies involving tissue-engineering approaches to re-grow colons, but 
	they are only in the preliminary stages and not near commercialization.
	

 


CEOCFO: 
	What is the IP situation for you?


Mr. Ramer: 
	Our IP situation is strong. We have one core patent on which I am an 
	inventor, along with two of our colleagues from the University of 
	Pittsburgh. We are licensing from Pitt two additional patents that describe 
	ECMH�s composition and manufacturing process. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	What part does the FDA play in regulating?


Mr. Ramer: 
	It plays a substantial part. This product is going to be regulated as a 
	device. We are confident of this based on ECM products having been regulated 
	historically as devices. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	What is going on right now at Asana?


Mr. Ramer: 
We are doing 
	preclinical work as part of product development right now. This includes our 
	benchtop testing and our animal testing to develop a product that, 
	ultimately, will be proven safe and effective in a small-scale human 
	clinical trial. We have conducted four animal studies and we have a very 
	important and large one starting soon. That, combined with the benchtop 
	testing, will provide the data we need for an FDA submission.

 


CEOCFO: 
	Have there been any surprises so far?


Mr. Ramer: 
A positive 
	one insofar as we are a medical device startup but the caliber of people we 
	have attracted to the table are the kinds of individuals you typically see 
	at more established companies, people who already have established names and 
	reputations in the field. I think that speaks to the substance of Asana and 
	the great potential of what we are offering. 

 


CEOCFO: What are your plans for developing 
	the company? 


Mr. Ramer: 
Our daily 
	focus has been to cultivate the necessary financial and human resources that 
	will help us continue our rapid device development. The projected cost for 
	us to produce human data in two years is in the neighborhood of $4-5 million 
	dollars. Even if we could afford to self-finance operations and clinical 
	trials, our experience has shown us that joining with the right 
	strategic partners and investors can exponentially improve our chances for 
	success. So we are proceeding along this path. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	What is the interest in ulcerative colitis today?


Mr. Ramer: 
	Given the size of the market and the fact that there is a large unmet market 
	need right now to address IBD, which is Irritable Bowel Disease, there is a 
	substantial market opportunity available. Many people we speak with have a 
	personal link to IBD so they are interested from both a business perspective 
	and a personal one. 

 


CEOCFO: I 
	think it may be helpful that it is easy to understand!


Mr. Ramer: 
	I think people identify with it because even if you have not had one of 
	these diseases, certainly everyone at some point has had some gastric 
	distress. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	What have you learned from your background as a biomedical engineer?


Mr. Ramer: 
	I would say a sense of perspective. In my career, I have worked on 
	everything from advanced R&D, which is the proverbial sketch on the cocktail 
	napkin, to commercialization and post market surveillance. I have seen the 
	full gamut of what it takes to get a product to market and follow it once in 
	the market. Having that perspective means knowing how to leverage your 
	resources appropriately to each stage of the product and process development 
	effort. I have learned especially after having been CEO of Asana, that 
	things do not happen as quickly or as smoothly as you would hope and nobody 
	gets a smooth ride through a medical device startup. It is not about 
	expecting a smooth ride but rather anticipating bumps in the road and 
	knowing how to mitigate those risks and put contingency plans in place.
	

 


CEOCFO: 
	How do people reach out to you if they want more information?


Mr. Ramer: 
	I would say they should first check out our website to learn more about us 
	at www.asanamedical.com. There is a Contact Us page on the website where 
	they can reach out with questions. The emails and phone calls will come to 
	me directly and I would be happy to entertain any questions. 

 


CEOCFO: 
	Why does Asana standout?


Mr. Ramer: 
	Asana truly is a special medical device startup opportunity. The caliber of 
	the individuals we have attracted, people with a record of success already, 
	is special. Likewise, the quality and caliber of our various advisory boards 
	is very high. We have proven that our technology works in a preliminary 
	animal study. We have passion within the team to push this forward because 
	this is personal to me in particular. I believe Asana is poised for success 
	and many smart people are bullish on our prospects. 






 


	�We are a medical device startup but the caliber of people we have attracted

Asana Medical, Inc. Secures Core Technology License for Treatment of IBD Including Ulcerative Colitis


Press Release

												Jun 2, 2015						
 


			June 2, 2015			(Press Release) -
	MIAMI LAKES, FL -  Asana Medical, Inc., ("Asana," the "Company"), an emerging medical device company focused on the development and commercialization of its innovative engineered tissue therapy to treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease ("IBD"), has obtained a world-wide, field specific, exclusive license from the University of Pittsburgh on multiple patents and patent applications covering methods and for treating Inflammatory Bowel Disease without a colectomy, including the use of Extracellular Matrix-derived gels and their methods for preparation and sterilization. This group of technologies will be at the core of the Company's future products focused on treating IBD. Asana Medical will initially target development of a therapy for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis (UC), a disease that affects approximately 5.7 million people worldwide. Other possible disease targets Asana will pursue includes Crohn's Disease, the other major form of IBD. Asana is collaborating with Stephen F. Badylak, DVM, PhD, MD, Deputy Director of the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, recognized as a world-class center for its work in extracellular matrix ("ECM") for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.  "There are limited therapeutic options for these serious gastrointestinal diseases. We're hopeful that these promising regenerative medicine techniques will one day help these tissues heal and function normally, providing relief for many affected individuals," stated Dr. Badylak. Asana's lead product "ECMH," a hydrogel composed of porcine extracellular matrix, will be delivered to the colon using existing technologies to build a protective barrier and create a scaffold for natural tissue recovery to occur. Extracellular matrix products have demonstrated efficacy in multiple clinical applications including esophageal repair, hernia repair, pericardial closures, and burn and wound treatments. ECM has been successfully commercialized for over a decade and has demonstrated an excellent safety profile. ECMH offers the promise of a non-pharmacologic, non-surgical treatment for UC.  "Execution of this license agreement is an important milestone for Asana. It creates additional value for Asana by securing our intellectual capital position and by building credibility with the tissue engineering industry and our stakeholders. The Agreement brings us one step closer to bringing a transformational technology to patients seeking a viable alternative in treating IBD," stated Marc Ramer, CEO of Asana Medical, Inc. Ulcerative Colitis is a disease characterized by recurring episodes of inflammation of the colon lining (mucosa). Typical UC symptoms include pain, chronic diarrhea, bleeding, and urgency to use the restroom. More severe symptoms include malnutrition, stunted growth (in pediatric cases), and a greater risk of colon cancer. There is no known cure for UC. Options to manage the symptoms of UC include 5-ASA (aspirin-like drugs, for mild cases) and systemic corticosteroids and biologics (for moderate to severe cases). While 5-ASA is fairly benign, biologics (immunosuppressing drugs) can lead to severe side effects. Regardless of the treatment option, 20-30% of UC patients are unresponsive to any drugs and have no alternative except to undergo colectomy (removal of the colon), a major surgery that leads to challenging, lifelong lifestyle changes.  Asana will market ECMH to UC patients unresponsive to 5-ASA drugs and be positioned to capture substantial market share from a pharmaceutical-dominated marketplace estimated to exceed $3.7 billion per year by 2021. ABOUT ASANA MEDICAL, INC.Asana Medical is an emerging medical device company developing tissue-engineered therapies for the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The Company's lead therapy, a novel application of a proven technology, will be a first-in-class therapy for patients suffering from UC. This therapy will be positioned to compete in a multi-billion dollar market dominated by biologic- and drug therapies that can have significant side effects. Additionally, 20-30% of patients do not benefit from these therapies and have no alternative except colon removal surgery. Asana has an experienced management team, strong patent protection, world-class advisors in business and medicine, and compelling preclinical proof-of-concept data.

Asana Medical, Inc. Announces Closing of $1.2 Million Convertible Promissory Note Offering
 
MIAMI LAKES, FL - May 10, 2016 - Asana Medical, Inc. ("Asana," the "Company") is pleased to announce that it has closed a $1.2 million offering of convertible promissory notes.  Asana, an emerging life sciences company, is focused on the development and commercialization of an innovative therapy to non-surgically treat Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ("IBD"), including Ulcerative Colitis ("UC"), Crohn's Disease and Rectal Mucositis.
 
Asana's lead product, ExtraCellular Matrix Hydrogel ("ECMH"), is a hydrogel composed of extracellular matrix derived from porcine tissue.  UC, the disease to which Asana's breakthrough technology will be first applied, is a debilitating disease that renders the colon dysfunctional. ECMH creates an environment favorable for the body to grow new tissue in place of diseased or damaged tissue.  Extracellular matrix has been proven to be safe and effective in esophageal repair, hernia grafts, vaginal slings, and burn and wound dressings.
 
"We are very pleased to have concluded this round of private financing with strategic investors that share our dedication to developing a sustainable solution to such physically and psychologically debilitating diseases.  While additional clinical and in vivo testing is necessary, we remain very encouraged by our preliminary results," stated Christine Sapan, CEO of Asana Medical, Inc.   
 
Asana is collaborating with Dr. Stephen Badylak, from the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine (University of Pittsburgh), a world-class center for tissue engineering, to develop the Company's ECMH product and to conduct much of the preclinical work. In May 2015, the Company executed a worldwide exclusive license with the University of Pittsburgh for patented technologies that support the Company's hydrogel product. 
 
ABOUT ASANA MEDICAL, INC.
Asana Medical, Inc. is an emerging life science company developing tissue engineered therapies for the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The Company's lead therapy, a novel application of a proven technology, will be a first-in-class therapy for the more than 1.8 million patients worldwide suffering from Ulcerative Colitis. This therapy is positioned to compete in a multi-billion dollar market dominated by biologic and drug therapies that can have significant side effects.  Additionally, 20-30% of patients do not benefit from these therapies and have no alternative except colon removal surgery. Asana has an experienced management team, strong patent protection, world-class advisors in business and medicine, and compelling preclinical proof-of-concept data.  For more information, visit www.asanamedical.com.
