Backed by established institutional capital, Wheelock has raised four funds to-date, the latest of which closed in April of 2014 with $625 million in capital commitments. Alongside extensive capital markets and investment management expertise, Wheelock has developed deep internal operational and management capabilities in targeted asset classes to provide a competitive advantage in its chosen areas of focus. This vertical integration of investment and real estate skill sets provides Wheelock with the flexibility to work with or without local partners, to react quickly to changing fundamentals or investment opportunities and to maintain hands-on involvement at each stage of the investment process. Current focus areas or "Verticals" include Hospitality, Retail, and Residential Land & Homebuilding, although the firm looks opportunistically at all asset classes. Wheelock employs an experienced team of investment professionals with offices in Boston, New York, Greenwich, Tampa and the DC area.
