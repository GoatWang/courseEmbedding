We're committed to helping you succeed

 



Since 1986, Insperity® CEO Paul Sarvadi envisioned making business owners' lives easier by taking HR and administrative burdens off their plates. So he decided to start a company with little more than 600 square feet of space and one telephone. Since then, Insperity has grown as a result of helping clients reach their goals.
Our business model is simple: We're dedicated to helping businesses succeed by taking care of the things that could be distracting you from the bigger picture. We do this by helping you control expenses, minimize risk exposure and maximize your opportunities for revenue generation.
 
 
 











The start









Insperity launched with little more than a 600-square-foot home office and two employees.
more Insperity history









Co-founder Paul Sarvadi’s business idea was a success. Insperity quickly became one of the largest HR outsourcing firms in the country.









Sarvadi rang the opening bell at the NYSE when Insperity went public. At this time, Insperity had 1,500 client companies across 44 states.









With golf legend Arnold Palmer as its new spokesman, Insperity grew to 5,000 client companies and topped $1 billion in revenue.








Paul Sarvadi still leads Insperity today, serving more than 100,000 client companies with more than 2 million employees.

Giving back to our communities
 
 
 






Our employees receive 12 hours of paid volunteer time each quarter so they can participate in company-sponsored volunteer events or with an organization of their choice. We are so passionate about making a difference in the lives of others that employees recorded more than 62,000 volunteer hours and our philanthropic efforts grossed $3.8 million last year.
 
 
 








 
Insperity volunteers from the San Antonio office donated non-perishable food items to Stand Up For Kids, an organization dedicated to ending the cycle of youth homelessness. 


 
Each summer, Insperity volunteers deliver teddy bears to Texas Children's Hospital to cheer up kids undergoing treatment.

1875 S Grant StSte 900San Mateo, CA 94402









Our company grew significantly in size over the last couple of years and so it was time to say goodbye to our old PEO provider (Professional Employer Organization) and get on board with someone that would be a better fit for our organizational needs. I did a lot of intensive research and compared 6 different HR Outsourcing firms, looking at their pricing structures, benefits packages for employees, overall support towards the health of our company, additional perks, etc. 

Insperity stood out from the get-go with their broad portfolio of services that we would benefit from if we signed up with them. They understood our existing pain points and offered solutions on how they would help us improve in these areas. As of the beginning of this year we made the switch and I have to say, so far I am very impressed! Not only are their rich, comprehensive benefits packages comparable to the ones of Fortune 500 companies, but they also get offered to all our employees at amazing low monthly premiums (and we are still in somewhat of a start-up mode). Their entire employment administration support services (payroll processing and reporting, HR support, simple online on-boarding process for new hires) has been outstanding. 

Pretty much every month they hold workshops at their facilities ranging from "HR Fundamentals for Supervisors" to "Organizational Health" to "Interviewing and Selection Skills in Recruiting". The workshops are included in our services and we can send as many people from our management team there as we please. 

The online portal is modern and straight forward, providing employees with info about their paychecks and withholdings, health benefits, 401(k) accounts, PTO balances and so on. Corporate has administrative access to the portal and we can put together customizable reports with numerous different criteria/data, making day-to-day business reporting so much more effective. The portal also gives access to MarketPlace, where employees can get online discounts at various sites as well as local deals at spas, restaurants, etc. On top of that, employees have access to over hundreds of Skillsoft online learning courses and thousands of e-books through Books 24/7. 

The feedback from the employees since the switch to Insperity has been nothing but positive and management's life has been made much easier. I love Insperity as an employee as well as a manager!

Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP) Stock Rating Lowered by Zacks Investment Research

					Posted by Stanley Muller on Jul 20th, 2017 // No Comments 



Zacks Investment Research lowered shares of Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP) from a hold rating to a sell rating in a research report report published on Tuesday, July 4th. 
According to Zacks, “Insperity is well placed to benefit from the booming PEO industry over the long run. Improved client retention, diversified product portfolio, growth in worksite employees and strength in its ancillary products are the other positives. However, sluggish global macro environment is hindering growth. Also, any further increase in health care costs can mar its profitability to a great extent. For 2017, the company expects average paid WSEs growth in the range of 11–12%, which is near the low end of initial guidance, primarily due to ongoing weakness in net hiring by clients and a slight shift in the timing of enrolment of two large midmarket accounts. The company has underperformed the broader market in past one year.”

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
