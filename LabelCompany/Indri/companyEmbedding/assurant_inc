Its lender-placed manufactured housing insurance consists principally of fire and dwelling hazard insurance for manufactured housing offered through its lender-placed program. Lender-placed insurance for manufactured housing is issued after an insurance tracking process similar to that of lender-placed homeowners insurance. Tracking is performed using an insurance tracking administration system. Lender-placed flood insurance consists of flood insurance offered through its lender-placed program. It provides collateral protection to lenders in mortgaged properties in the event a homeowner does not maintain flood insurance.

The Global connected living business, through partnerships with mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), e-commerce and other retailers and multiple system operators (MSOs), underwrites and provides administrative services for extended service contracts (ESCs). These contracts provide consumers with coverage on mobile devices and consumer electronics and appliances, protecting them from certain covered losses. It pays the cost of repairing or replacing these consumer goods in the event of loss, theft, accidental damage and mechanical breakdown or electronic malfunction after the manufacturer's warranty expires. It provides integrated service offerings to its customers that manages all aspects of the ESC or warranty, such as program design and marketing strategy, risk management, data analytics, customer support and claims handling, supply chain and service delivery, including repair and logistics, and device disposition. In addition to extended protection for multiple devices, its mobile offerings include trade-ins and upgrades and customer support, including device self-diagnostic tools.The Global vehicle protection service business underwrites and provides administrative services for vehicle service contracts (VSCs) and ancillary products providing coverage for vehicles, such as automobiles, trucks, recreational vehicles and motorcycles.

The pre-funded funeral insurance provides insurance or annuity death benefits to fund the costs associated with pre-arranged funerals, which are planned and paid for in advance of death. The Company's pre-funded funeral insurance products are structured to be similar to whole life insurance policies in the United States and offer limited pay or pay for life options. In Canada, its pre-funded funeral insurance products are structured as limited pay annuity contracts. Product choices are based on the health and financial situation of the customer and the distribution channel.

History[edit]
Assurant can trace its roots back to the founding of the La Crosse Mutual Aid Association, which was established to sell disability insurance in Wisconsin in the early 1890s. La Crosse Mutual Aid Association would later become the Time Insurance Company.[5] In 1978, N.V. AMEV of the Netherlands acquired the Time Insurance Company (now Assurant Health) via its U.S. holding company AMEV Holdings, Inc. During the next 12 years, AMEV Holdings, Inc. would expand through acquisition, buying American Security Insurance (credit-related insurance, now Assurant Solutions); United Family (funeral insurance, now Assurant Solutions - Preneed Division); Western Insurance Company (mutual funds, now part of Assurant Employee Benefits); and Superior Insurance (auto insurance).[6] In 1990, N.V. AMEV of the Netherlands acquired VSB Groep NV bank to become the Netherlands first financial conglomerate combining an insurer and a bank, creating Fortis.[7] In 1991, AMEV acquired the group life, accident and health insurance of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company (now part of Assurant Employee Benefits).[8] AMEV Holdings, Inc. was rebranded Fortis, Inc. in 1991. Superior Insurance was sold in 1996.[9] Fortis acquired John Alden in 1998 and American Bankers Insurance in 1999.[10][11]
Fortis' American business was subsequently renamed as Assurant and spun off from the parent company in 2004.[12][13]
On June 10, 2015, Assurant Health’s parent company, Assurant, Inc., announced an exit from the health insurance marketplace to focus on housing and lifestyle specialty protection products and services.[14] Sun Life Financial acquired Assurant Employee Benefits for $940 million in September,[15] and in October, Assurant announced it had completed the sale of certain assets and business lines of Assurant Health to National General Holdings Corporation.[16] National General acquired Assurant Health’s existing supplemental and self-funded business lines.[17] Assurant is in the process of winding down its major medical operations and did not participate in the next Affordable Care Act open enrollment period beginning in November 2015.[14][16]
Operations[edit]
Assurant operates two main businesses:

Assurant Solutions develops, underwrites, and markets specialty insurance, extended service contracts and other risk management solutions in collaborative relationships with financial institutions, retailers, automobile dealers, utilities, funeral homes and other entities. Principal lines of business include debt protection administration, credit insurance, preneed life insurance, and warranties and extended service contracts on appliances, consumer electronics, automobiles, recreational vehicles and boats.[18]
Assurant Specialty Property develops, underwrites, markets and administers specialty property and personal lines of insurance and also offers lender-placed hazard insurance and outsourcing services to mortgage companies, manufactured home builders and dealers, auto finance companies, property management companies, and managing general agents. In addition, the company also offers collateral protection programs for automobiles, manufactured housing insurance, residents insurance, homeowners, watercraft, motorcycle, motor home, federal flood, and farmowners.[19]

Assurant Health policy claim denials and cancellations[edit]
Assurant Health (now divested from Assurant)[20][16] was repeatedly found to cancel health policies for some customers that had serious medical conditions, and 12 states criticized the firm for denying claims, with most of the states levying fines against Assurant.[21][22][23] A number of individual cases have been reported.
In September 2009, the South Carolina Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s verdict that the firm (then known as "Fortis") wrongly revoked the health insurance policy of a holder who had contracted HIV subsequent to getting an insurance policy, and ordered the firm to pay $10 million to the plaintiff. The court found that:

Pursuant to company policy in cases involving long-term disease, Fortis launched an investigation to determine whether [the plaintiff] had failed to disclose a pre-existing condition on his policy application...A Fortis investigator reviewed the records and discovered [an] erroneously-dated intake note in [the doctor’s] files. That information was then forwarded to [a] Fortis Senior Underwriter...for review. [The underwriter]...recommended that [the plaintiff’s] policy be rescinded on the grounds that he had misrepresented his HIV positive status.

Reuters report on the ruling stated that Fortis had a company policy to target every recently diagnosed HIV-positive policyholder for an automatic fraud investigation for a pretext to rescind their policy, according to undisclosed records. As in that case, their insurance policies often were canceled on incorrect information, flimsy evidence, or for no reason at all.[24] In March 2010, the United States Supreme Court rejected the firm's appeal of the ruling[25]
In February 2010, a Boulder, Colorado jury found that Assurant Health had breached its contract with a woman who was severely injured in a hit-and-run accident, and awarded her $183,551 for medical bills and approximately $37.1 million in punitive damages. This was described as "one of the largest bad-faith judgments in Colorado history".[26]

That information was then forwarded to [a] Fortis Senior Underwriter...for review. [The underwriter]...recommended that [the plaintiff’s] policy be rescinded on the grounds that he had misrepresented his HIV positive status.

Reuters report on the ruling stated that Fortis had a company policy to target every recently diagnosed HIV-positive policyholder for an automatic fraud investigation for a pretext to rescind their policy, according to undisclosed records. As in that case, their insurance policies often were canceled on incorrect information, flimsy evidence, or for no reason at all.[24] In March 2010, the United States Supreme Court rejected the firm's appeal of the ruling[25]
In February 2010, a Boulder, Colorado jury found that Assurant Health had breached its contract with a woman who was severely injured in a hit-and-run accident, and awarded her $183,551 for medical bills and approximately $37.1 million in punitive damages. This was described as "one of the largest bad-faith judgments in Colorado history".[26]

History[edit]
Assurant can trace its roots back to the founding of the La Crosse Mutual Aid Association, which was established to sell disability insurance in Wisconsin in the early 1890s. La Crosse Mutual Aid Association would later become the Time Insurance Company.[5] In 1978, N.V. AMEV of the Netherlands acquired the Time Insurance Company (now Assurant Health) via its U.S. holding company AMEV Holdings, Inc. During the next 12 years, AMEV Holdings, Inc. would expand through acquisition, buying American Security Insurance (credit-related insurance, now Assurant Solutions); United Family (funeral insurance, now Assurant Solutions - Preneed Division); Western Insurance Company (mutual funds, now part of Assurant Employee Benefits); and Superior Insurance (auto insurance).[6] In 1990, N.V. AMEV of the Netherlands acquired VSB Groep NV bank to become the Netherlands first financial conglomerate combining an insurer and a bank, creating Fortis.[7] In 1991, AMEV acquired the group life, accident and health insurance of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company (now part of Assurant Employee Benefits).[8] AMEV Holdings, Inc. was rebranded Fortis, Inc. in 1991. Superior Insurance was sold in 1996.[9] Fortis acquired John Alden in 1998 and American Bankers Insurance in 1999.[10][11]
Fortis' American business was subsequently renamed as Assurant and spun off from the parent company in 2004.[12][13]
On June 10, 2015, Assurant Health’s parent company, Assurant, Inc., announced an exit from the health insurance marketplace to focus on housing and lifestyle specialty protection products and services.[14] Sun Life Financial acquired Assurant Employee Benefits for $940 million in September,[15] and in October, Assurant announced it had completed the sale of certain assets and business lines of Assurant Health to National General Holdings Corporation.[16] National General acquired Assurant Health’s existing supplemental and self-funded business lines.[17] Assurant is in the process of winding down its major medical operations and did not participate in the next Affordable Care Act open enrollment period beginning in November 2015.[14][16]
Operations[edit]
Assurant operates two main businesses:

Assurant Solutions develops, underwrites, and markets specialty insurance, extended service contracts and other risk management solutions in collaborative relationships with financial institutions, retailers, automobile dealers, utilities, funeral homes and other entities. Principal lines of business include debt protection administration, credit insurance, preneed life insurance, and warranties and extended service contracts on appliances, consumer electronics, automobiles, recreational vehicles and boats.[18]
Assurant Specialty Property develops, underwrites, markets and administers specialty property and personal lines of insurance and also offers lender-placed hazard insurance and outsourcing services to mortgage companies, manufactured home builders and dealers, auto finance companies, property management companies, and managing general agents. In addition, the company also offers collateral protection programs for automobiles, manufactured housing insurance, residents insurance, homeowners, watercraft, motorcycle, motor home, federal flood, and farmowners.[19]

Assurant Health policy claim denials and cancellations[edit]
Assurant Health (now divested from Assurant)[20][16] was repeatedly found to cancel health policies for some customers that had serious medical conditions, and 12 states criticized the firm for denying claims, with most of the states levying fines against Assurant.[21][22][23] A number of individual cases have been reported.
In September 2009, the South Carolina Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s verdict that the firm (then known as "Fortis") wrongly revoked the health insurance policy of a holder who had contracted HIV subsequent to getting an insurance policy, and ordered the firm to pay $10 million to the plaintiff. The court found that:

Pursuant to company policy in cases involving long-term disease, Fortis launched an investigation to determine whether [the plaintiff] had failed to disclose a pre-existing condition on his policy application...A Fortis investigator reviewed the records and discovered [an] erroneously-dated intake note in [the doctor’s] files. That information was then forwarded to [a] Fortis Senior Underwriter...for review. [The underwriter]...recommended that [the plaintiff’s] policy be rescinded on the grounds that he had misrepresented his HIV positive status.

Reuters report on the ruling stated that Fortis had a company policy to target every recently diagnosed HIV-positive policyholder for an automatic fraud investigation for a pretext to rescind their policy, according to undisclosed records. As in that case, their insurance policies often were canceled on incorrect information, flimsy evidence, or for no reason at all.[24] In March 2010, the United States Supreme Court rejected the firm's appeal of the ruling[25]
In February 2010, a Boulder, Colorado jury found that Assurant Health had breached its contract with a woman who was severely injured in a hit-and-run accident, and awarded her $183,551 for medical bills and approximately $37.1 million in punitive damages. This was described as "one of the largest bad-faith judgments in Colorado history".[26]

Tips for Finding Affordable Health Insurance
It can be a daunting task to find affordable health insurance especially if you are self employed or have a family that's not covered on your health plan at work.   In addition to this, if you have a pre-existing condition, you are in real trouble because in most cases it will not be covered at all.  One of the best ways to get affordable health insurance is with a group plan and this is normally done through an employer.  That employer generally pays some or even all of the insurance cost for the employee but the employee may choose to add a spouse or a family member at an additional cost.
But, if you are self employed or lose a job, these affordable health insurance choices aren't offered to you, which can present a problem. However, you should be able to find something that is available for small business owners and self-employed people but it will be at a much higher cost.  So, this makes it all the more important to shop around to help you find affordable health insurance.  If you get quotes from several different companies, you'll be much more likely to find affordable heath insurance.

Top Health Insurance Carriers
When looking for a top health insurance carrier, you may consider looking into some big companies because they may give you the best rates.  Often a larger company is capable of giving you a much better rate than smaller companies because they have more resources available to them to aid in offering better pricing.  There are many large health insurance carriers to choose from in this day and age that can offer you the highest quality service at an affordable price.  The key to finding one you like is to spend some time in research looking for the best carrier and then getting some quotes from them as well.
You may confuse best rate with best health insurance carrier but be advised that this is often not the case you and may not the quality of insurance you want with a cheaper coverage.  In order to avoid any problems in this area, you should consider doing some research on the quality of coverage of the company you do decide to get your health insurance from. By taking the time to look into their payment history of claims, you can save yourself some time and hassle and know with certainty if you are choosing a top health insurance carrier after all.

Why You Should Compare Health Insurance Quotes
We are all looking for the best possible price we can get on the necessities of life, and health insurance is no different.  This is why it's imperative to compare health insurance quotes to help you find the best one you possibly can.  When you take the time to get several quotes, you are much more likely to get the best deal.  These days it is extremely easy to do this with the aid of the Internet.  You can easily log on these days and visit health insurance Websites and get several quotes at one time.  This can allow us to compare prices and coverage.  You need to be certain you look at the quality of coverage you will receive as well as the cost of the coverage.  This will allow you to get the best of both.
It's very important for you to compare health insurance quotes to make certain you are getting the absolute best coverage possible.  If you just commit to one health insurance company without shopping around, you could be making a huge financial mistake. Therefore, you should invest a few minutes to finding the best health insurance to meet your needs at the best price as well.

We have provided a number of online articles and resources to answer some of the most common question we receive about finding affordable health insurance coverage.

Tips for Finding Affordable Health Insurance
It can be a daunting task to find affordable health insurance especially if you are self employed or have a family that's not covered on your health plan at work.   In addition to this, if you have a pre-existing condition, you are in real trouble because in most cases it will not be covered at all.  One of the best ways to get affordable health insurance is with a group plan and this is normally done through an employer.  That employer generally pays some or even all of the insurance cost for the employee but the employee may choose to add a spouse or a family member at an additional cost.
But, if you are self employed or lose a job, these affordable health insurance choices aren't offered to you, which can present a problem. However, you should be able to find something that is available for small business owners and self-employed people but it will be at a much higher cost.  So, this makes it all the more important to shop around to help you find affordable health insurance.  If you get quotes from several different companies, you'll be much more likely to find affordable heath insurance.

Top Health Insurance Carriers
When looking for a top health insurance carrier, you may consider looking into some big companies because they may give you the best rates.  Often a larger company is capable of giving you a much better rate than smaller companies because they have more resources available to them to aid in offering better pricing.  There are many large health insurance carriers to choose from in this day and age that can offer you the highest quality service at an affordable price.  The key to finding one you like is to spend some time in research looking for the best carrier and then getting some quotes from them as well.
You may confuse best rate with best health insurance carrier but be advised that this is often not the case you and may not the quality of insurance you want with a cheaper coverage.  In order to avoid any problems in this area, you should consider doing some research on the quality of coverage of the company you do decide to get your health insurance from. By taking the time to look into their payment history of claims, you can save yourself some time and hassle and know with certainty if you are choosing a top health insurance carrier after all.

Assurant, Inc. is a holding company with headquarters in New York City. Its businesses provide a diverse set of specialty, niche-market insurance products in the property, casualty, life and health insurance sectors. The company’s two operating segments are Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property.
The company, formerly known as Fortis, Inc., was spun off from Dutch and Belgian financial-services company Fortis Insurance N.V. in 2004. The company’s initial public offering on Feb. 5, 2004 at $1.76 billion was the fourth largest that year. In connection with the public offering, the company changed its name to Assurant, Inc.[2][3]
Assurant is 285 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States.[4]

History[edit]
Assurant can trace its roots back to the founding of the La Crosse Mutual Aid Association, which was established to sell disability insurance in Wisconsin in the early 1890s. La Crosse Mutual Aid Association would later become the Time Insurance Company.[5] In 1978, N.V. AMEV of the Netherlands acquired the Time Insurance Company (now Assurant Health) via its U.S. holding company AMEV Holdings, Inc. During the next 12 years, AMEV Holdings, Inc. would expand through acquisition, buying American Security Insurance (credit-related insurance, now Assurant Solutions); United Family (funeral insurance, now Assurant Solutions - Preneed Division); Western Insurance Company (mutual funds, now part of Assurant Employee Benefits); and Superior Insurance (auto insurance).[6] In 1990, N.V. AMEV of the Netherlands acquired VSB Groep NV bank to become the Netherlands first financial conglomerate combining an insurer and a bank, creating Fortis.[7] In 1991, AMEV acquired the group life, accident and health insurance of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company (now part of Assurant Employee Benefits).[8] AMEV Holdings, Inc. was rebranded Fortis, Inc. in 1991. Superior Insurance was sold in 1996.[9] Fortis acquired John Alden in 1998 and American Bankers Insurance in 1999.[10][11]
Fortis' American business was subsequently renamed as Assurant and spun off from the parent company in 2004.[12][13]
On June 10, 2015, Assurant Health’s parent company, Assurant, Inc., announced an exit from the health insurance marketplace to focus on housing and lifestyle specialty protection products and services.[14] Sun Life Financial acquired Assurant Employee Benefits for $940 million in September,[15] and in October, Assurant announced it had completed the sale of certain assets and business lines of Assurant Health to National General Holdings Corporation.[16] National General acquired Assurant Health’s existing supplemental and self-funded business lines.[17] Assurant is in the process of winding down its major medical operations and did not participate in the next Affordable Care Act open enrollment period beginning in November 2015.[14][16]
Operations[edit]
Assurant operates two main businesses:

Assurant Solutions develops, underwrites, and markets specialty insurance, extended service contracts and other risk management solutions in collaborative relationships with financial institutions, retailers, automobile dealers, utilities, funeral homes and other entities. Principal lines of business include debt protection administration, credit insurance, preneed life insurance, and warranties and extended service contracts on appliances, consumer electronics, automobiles, recreational vehicles and boats.[18]
Assurant Specialty Property develops, underwrites, markets and administers specialty property and personal lines of insurance and also offers lender-placed hazard insurance and outsourcing services to mortgage companies, manufactured home builders and dealers, auto finance companies, property management companies, and managing general agents. In addition, the company also offers collateral protection programs for automobiles, manufactured housing insurance, residents insurance, homeowners, watercraft, motorcycle, motor home, federal flood, and farmowners.[19]

Assurant Health policy claim denials and cancellations[edit]
Assurant Health (now divested from Assurant)[20][16] was repeatedly found to cancel health policies for some customers that had serious medical conditions, and 12 states criticized the firm for denying claims, with most of the states levying fines against Assurant.[21][22][23] A number of individual cases have been reported.
In September 2009, the South Carolina Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s verdict that the firm (then known as "Fortis") wrongly revoked the health insurance policy of a holder who had contracted HIV subsequent to getting an insurance policy, and ordered the firm to pay $10 million to the plaintiff. The court found that:

Pursuant to company policy in cases involving long-term disease, Fortis launched an investigation to determine whether [the plaintiff] had failed to disclose a pre-existing condition on his policy application...A Fortis investigator reviewed the records and discovered [an] erroneously-dated intake note in [the doctor’s] files. That information was then forwarded to [a] Fortis Senior Underwriter...for review. [The underwriter]...recommended that [the plaintiff’s] policy be rescinded on the grounds that he had misrepresented his HIV positive status.

Reuters report on the ruling stated that Fortis had a company policy to target every recently diagnosed HIV-positive policyholder for an automatic fraud investigation for a pretext to rescind their policy, according to undisclosed records. As in that case, their insurance policies often were canceled on incorrect information, flimsy evidence, or for no reason at all.[24] In March 2010, the United States Supreme Court rejected the firm's appeal of the ruling[25]
In February 2010, a Boulder, Colorado jury found that Assurant Health had breached its contract with a woman who was severely injured in a hit-and-run accident, and awarded her $183,551 for medical bills and approximately $37.1 million in punitive damages. This was described as "one of the largest bad-faith judgments in Colorado history".[26]

Assurant, Inc. is a holding company with headquarters in New York City. Its businesses provide a diverse set of specialty, niche-market insurance products in the property, casualty, life and health insurance sectors. The company’s two operating segments are Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property.
The company, formerly known as Fortis, Inc., was spun off from Dutch and Belgian financial-services company Fortis Insurance N.V. in 2004. The company’s initial public offering on Feb. 5, 2004 at $1.76 billion was the fourth largest that year. In connection with the public offering, the company changed its name to Assurant, Inc.[2][3]
Assurant is 285 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States.[4]

History[edit]
Assurant can trace its roots back to the founding of the La Crosse Mutual Aid Association, which was established to sell disability insurance in Wisconsin in the early 1890s. La Crosse Mutual Aid Association would later become the Time Insurance Company.[5] In 1978, N.V. AMEV of the Netherlands acquired the Time Insurance Company (now Assurant Health) via its U.S. holding company AMEV Holdings, Inc. During the next 12 years, AMEV Holdings, Inc. would expand through acquisition, buying American Security Insurance (credit-related insurance, now Assurant Solutions); United Family (funeral insurance, now Assurant Solutions - Preneed Division); Western Insurance Company (mutual funds, now part of Assurant Employee Benefits); and Superior Insurance (auto insurance).[6] In 1990, N.V. AMEV of the Netherlands acquired VSB Groep NV bank to become the Netherlands first financial conglomerate combining an insurer and a bank, creating Fortis.[7] In 1991, AMEV acquired the group life, accident and health insurance of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company (now part of Assurant Employee Benefits).[8] AMEV Holdings, Inc. was rebranded Fortis, Inc. in 1991. Superior Insurance was sold in 1996.[9] Fortis acquired John Alden in 1998 and American Bankers Insurance in 1999.[10][11]
Fortis' American business was subsequently renamed as Assurant and spun off from the parent company in 2004.[12][13]
On June 10, 2015, Assurant Health’s parent company, Assurant, Inc., announced an exit from the health insurance marketplace to focus on housing and lifestyle specialty protection products and services.[14] Sun Life Financial acquired Assurant Employee Benefits for $940 million in September,[15] and in October, Assurant announced it had completed the sale of certain assets and business lines of Assurant Health to National General Holdings Corporation.[16] National General acquired Assurant Health’s existing supplemental and self-funded business lines.[17] Assurant is in the process of winding down its major medical operations and did not participate in the next Affordable Care Act open enrollment period beginning in November 2015.[14][16]
Operations[edit]
Assurant operates two main businesses:

Assurant Solutions develops, underwrites, and markets specialty insurance, extended service contracts and other risk management solutions in collaborative relationships with financial institutions, retailers, automobile dealers, utilities, funeral homes and other entities. Principal lines of business include debt protection administration, credit insurance, preneed life insurance, and warranties and extended service contracts on appliances, consumer electronics, automobiles, recreational vehicles and boats.[18]
Assurant Specialty Property develops, underwrites, markets and administers specialty property and personal lines of insurance and also offers lender-placed hazard insurance and outsourcing services to mortgage companies, manufactured home builders and dealers, auto finance companies, property management companies, and managing general agents. In addition, the company also offers collateral protection programs for automobiles, manufactured housing insurance, residents insurance, homeowners, watercraft, motorcycle, motor home, federal flood, and farmowners.[19]

Assurant Health policy claim denials and cancellations[edit]
Assurant Health (now divested from Assurant)[20][16] was repeatedly found to cancel health policies for some customers that had serious medical conditions, and 12 states criticized the firm for denying claims, with most of the states levying fines against Assurant.[21][22][23] A number of individual cases have been reported.
In September 2009, the South Carolina Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s verdict that the firm (then known as "Fortis") wrongly revoked the health insurance policy of a holder who had contracted HIV subsequent to getting an insurance policy, and ordered the firm to pay $10 million to the plaintiff. The court found that:

Pursuant to company policy in cases involving long-term disease, Fortis launched an investigation to determine whether [the plaintiff] had failed to disclose a pre-existing condition on his policy application...A Fortis investigator reviewed the records and discovered [an] erroneously-dated intake note in [the doctor’s] files. That information was then forwarded to [a] Fortis Senior Underwriter...for review. [The underwriter]...recommended that [the plaintiff’s] policy be rescinded on the grounds that he had misrepresented his HIV positive status.

Reuters report on the ruling stated that Fortis had a company policy to target every recently diagnosed HIV-positive policyholder for an automatic fraud investigation for a pretext to rescind their policy, according to undisclosed records. As in that case, their insurance policies often were canceled on incorrect information, flimsy evidence, or for no reason at all.[24] In March 2010, the United States Supreme Court rejected the firm's appeal of the ruling[25]
In February 2010, a Boulder, Colorado jury found that Assurant Health had breached its contract with a woman who was severely injured in a hit-and-run accident, and awarded her $183,551 for medical bills and approximately $37.1 million in punitive damages. This was described as "one of the largest bad-faith judgments in Colorado history".[26]

Assurant, Inc. is a holding company with headquarters in New York City. Its businesses provide a diverse set of specialty, niche-market insurance products in the property, casualty, life and health insurance sectors. The company’s two operating segments are Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property.
The company, formerly known as Fortis, Inc., was spun off from Dutch and Belgian financial-services company Fortis Insurance N.V. in 2004. The company’s initial public offering on Feb. 5, 2004 at $1.76 billion was the fourth largest that year. In connection with the public offering, the company changed its name to Assurant, Inc.[2][3]
Assurant is 285 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States.[4]

History[edit]
Assurant can trace its roots back to the founding of the La Crosse Mutual Aid Association, which was established to sell disability insurance in Wisconsin in the early 1890s. La Crosse Mutual Aid Association would later become the Time Insurance Company.[5] In 1978, N.V. AMEV of the Netherlands acquired the Time Insurance Company (now Assurant Health) via its U.S. holding company AMEV Holdings, Inc. During the next 12 years, AMEV Holdings, Inc. would expand through acquisition, buying American Security Insurance (credit-related insurance, now Assurant Solutions); United Family (funeral insurance, now Assurant Solutions - Preneed Division); Western Insurance Company (mutual funds, now part of Assurant Employee Benefits); and Superior Insurance (auto insurance).[6] In 1990, N.V. AMEV of the Netherlands acquired VSB Groep NV bank to become the Netherlands first financial conglomerate combining an insurer and a bank, creating Fortis.[7] In 1991, AMEV acquired the group life, accident and health insurance of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company (now part of Assurant Employee Benefits).[8] AMEV Holdings, Inc. was rebranded Fortis, Inc. in 1991. Superior Insurance was sold in 1996.[9] Fortis acquired John Alden in 1998 and American Bankers Insurance in 1999.[10][11]
Fortis' American business was subsequently renamed as Assurant and spun off from the parent company in 2004.[12][13]
On June 10, 2015, Assurant Health’s parent company, Assurant, Inc., announced an exit from the health insurance marketplace to focus on housing and lifestyle specialty protection products and services.[14] Sun Life Financial acquired Assurant Employee Benefits for $940 million in September,[15] and in October, Assurant announced it had completed the sale of certain assets and business lines of Assurant Health to National General Holdings Corporation.[16] National General acquired Assurant Health’s existing supplemental and self-funded business lines.[17] Assurant is in the process of winding down its major medical operations and did not participate in the next Affordable Care Act open enrollment period beginning in November 2015.[14][16]
Operations[edit]
Assurant operates two main businesses:

Assurant Solutions develops, underwrites, and markets specialty insurance, extended service contracts and other risk management solutions in collaborative relationships with financial institutions, retailers, automobile dealers, utilities, funeral homes and other entities. Principal lines of business include debt protection administration, credit insurance, preneed life insurance, and warranties and extended service contracts on appliances, consumer electronics, automobiles, recreational vehicles and boats.[18]
Assurant Specialty Property develops, underwrites, markets and administers specialty property and personal lines of insurance and also offers lender-placed hazard insurance and outsourcing services to mortgage companies, manufactured home builders and dealers, auto finance companies, property management companies, and managing general agents. In addition, the company also offers collateral protection programs for automobiles, manufactured housing insurance, residents insurance, homeowners, watercraft, motorcycle, motor home, federal flood, and farmowners.[19]

Assurant Health policy claim denials and cancellations[edit]
Assurant Health (now divested from Assurant)[20][16] was repeatedly found to cancel health policies for some customers that had serious medical conditions, and 12 states criticized the firm for denying claims, with most of the states levying fines against Assurant.[21][22][23] A number of individual cases have been reported.
In September 2009, the South Carolina Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s verdict that the firm (then known as "Fortis") wrongly revoked the health insurance policy of a holder who had contracted HIV subsequent to getting an insurance policy, and ordered the firm to pay $10 million to the plaintiff. The court found that:

Pursuant to company policy in cases involving long-term disease, Fortis launched an investigation to determine whether [the plaintiff] had failed to disclose a pre-existing condition on his policy application...A Fortis investigator reviewed the records and discovered [an] erroneously-dated intake note in [the doctor’s] files. That information was then forwarded to [a] Fortis Senior Underwriter...for review. [The underwriter]...recommended that [the plaintiff’s] policy be rescinded on the grounds that he had misrepresented his HIV positive status.

Reuters report on the ruling stated that Fortis had a company policy to target every recently diagnosed HIV-positive policyholder for an automatic fraud investigation for a pretext to rescind their policy, according to undisclosed records. As in that case, their insurance policies often were canceled on incorrect information, flimsy evidence, or for no reason at all.[24] In March 2010, the United States Supreme Court rejected the firm's appeal of the ruling[25]
In February 2010, a Boulder, Colorado jury found that Assurant Health had breached its contract with a woman who was severely injured in a hit-and-run accident, and awarded her $183,551 for medical bills and approximately $37.1 million in punitive damages. This was described as "one of the largest bad-faith judgments in Colorado history".[26]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
