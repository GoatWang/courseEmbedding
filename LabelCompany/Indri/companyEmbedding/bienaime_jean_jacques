 Portola Pharmaceuticals Appoints Jean-Jacques Bienaime to Board of Directors 
 Thu, 09/23/2010 - 4:36am 
 Comments 
 by The Associated Press  

 



Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. today announced the appointment of
 Jean-Jacques Bienaime to the company's board of directors. Mr.
 Bienaime currently serves as chief executive officer of BioMarin
 Pharmaceutical Inc. He is chairman of the board of NeurogesX, Inc., a
 member of the board of BIO and a member of the advisory board of
 Bellevue Asset Management's BioVentures II fund."Jean-Jacques Bienaime is a biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry
 veteran with more than 25 years of experience," said William Lis,
 chief executive officer of Portola. "His experience as a CEO managing
 and building fully integrated biotechnology companies and his
 expertise commercializing anti-thrombotic products will be invaluable
 to Portola as we advance our two lead partnered product candidates,
 elinogrel and betrixaban, and our pipeline of proprietary products in
 cardiovascular disease and inflammation through clinical development
 and into commercialization."Mr. Bienaime joined BioMarin, which develops and commercializes
 innovative biopharmaceuticals for serious diseases and medical
 conditions, in May 2005 as chief executive officer and member of the
 board of directors. Prior to joining BioMarin, he served as chairman,
 chief executive officer and president of Genencor, a biotechnology
 company focused on industrial bioproducts and targeted cancer
 biotherapeutics. Before that, he served as chairman, chief executive
 officer and president of Sangstat Medical Corporation, an
 immunology-focused biotechnology company that he guided to
 profitability prior to its acquisition by Genzyme Corporation. Earlier
 in his career, Mr. Bienaime held several senior management positions
 at Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Pharmaceuticals (now sanofi-aventis)
 culminating in the position of senior vice president of worldwide
 marketing and business development responsible for, among other
 things, the launch of Lovenox@ (for the prevention of pulmonary
 embolism and treatment of unstable angina) in the United States. He
 also worked at Genentech, Inc. where he was involved in the launch of
 tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) for the treatment of heart
 attacks.He received an M.B.A. from the Wharton School at the University of
 Pennsylvania and an undergraduate degree in economics from the Ecole
 Superieure de Commerce de Paris.About Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Portola Pharmaceuticals develops
 innovative therapeutics based on targets with established proofs of
 concept that are designed to provide significant advances over current
 treatments for cardiovascular disease and inflammation. The company
 has global development and commercialization agreements with two of
 the world's leading pharmaceutical companies collectively valued at
 about $1 billion in upfront and milestone payments plus double-digit
 royalties on future sales. Betrixaban, its oral direct Factor Xa
 inhibitor, is licensed to Merck & Co., Inc., and elinogrel, its
 competitive, reversible P2Y12 ADP receptor antagonist, is licensed to
 Novartis Pharma AG. Both are Phase 2 product candidates that have
 features to address the global multi-billion dollar hospital,
 specialty and chronic care anticoagulant and antiplatelet markets,
 respectively.Portola's proprietary pipeline programs are focused on the discovery
 and development of PRT061103, a thromboxane receptor antagonist, which
 is targeted to address a significant unmet need as a potential aspirin
 alternative for patients intolerant to aspirin; PRT064445, a Factor Xa
 inhibitor antidote to help manage or reverse the bleeding
 complications in the tens of millions of patients expected to be
 treated with Factor Xa inhibitors or low-molecular weight heparin
 worldwide in the next decade; and PRT062607, a novel, oral
 Syk-specific kinase inhibitor to treat chronic inflammatory diseases,
 including rheumatoid arthritis, and certain cancers, including
 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. For

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.
