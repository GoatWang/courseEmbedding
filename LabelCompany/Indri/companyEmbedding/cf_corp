                CF Corp. to Buy Fidelity & Guaranty for $1.8 Bln (CFCO, FGL)            


    By Rebecca McClay | Updated May 24, 2017 — 12:44 PM EDT    






Share





















































CF Corp. (CFCO​) has reached a deal to buy Fidelity & Guaranty Life (FGL) for $1.84 billion in an all-cash deal.
CF Corp., through an acquisition company affiliated with Blackstone Group L.P. (BX) and Fidelity National Financial Inc. (FNF), offered $31.10 per share for Fidelity & Guaranty Life, the companies announced.
The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter this year and will be financed with $1.2 billion from CF Corp.’s IPO last year and with forward purchase agreements. The takeover requires CF Corp. to assume $450 million of Fidelity & Guaranty’s existing debt. Fidelity's management team will remain intact, with Chris Littlefield continuing to serve as president and CEO. (See also: How Fidelity, T. Rowe Price Buy Hot Stocks Ahead of IPOs.) 
Credit Suisse is acting as lead financial advisor to FGL and Jefferies is acting as co-financial advisor to FGL. 
Des Moines, Iowa-based Fidelity & Guaranty Life, which provides fixed index annuity and life insurance products, has about $28 billion in total assets and an adjusted book value of $1.6 billion. From 2012 to 2016, the company grew sales by about 10 percent each year amid changing retirement demographics in the U.S.
“FGL is a very high-quality business with attractive demographic tailwinds,” CF Corp. co-founder Chinh E. Chu said in a statement. “We look forward to working with management to continue to build a premier insurance platform and accelerate value creation for shareholders."
Earlier this week, Fidelity National Financial announced it had acquired Hudson & Marshall, a full-service auction company, although the amount of the deal was not disclosed.
Fidelity & Guaranty Life shares are up 21.1 percent year to date, and up 15.5 percent the past year. CF Corp. shares are up 1.1 percent year to date, and up 4.5 percent since its IPO last last year. Both companies' stocks were noting gains early in Wednesday's session.

cf-DNA Preservative Tubes Norgen's cf-DNA Preservative Tubes are closed, evacuated plastic tubes for the collection and the preservation of cell-free circulating DNA/circulating tumor DNA in human whole blood samples during storage and shipping. Using these tubes in combination with Norgen's Plasma/Serum Cell-Free Circulating DNA Purification Kits or Norgen's Plasma/Serum Circulating DNA Purification Kits (Slurry Format) enables the purification and concentration of an inhibitor-free cell-free circulating DNA/circulating tumor DNA in a very small elution volume that is compatible with any downstream application.
This product is for research use only and not for use in diagnostic procedures.
Performance
Norgen's cf-DNA Preservative Tubes abridge the collection/processing of whole blood for the subsequent purification of cell-free circulating DNA. The cf-DNA Preservative Tubes preserve and inhibit the programmed cell-death (apoptosis) of the blood, hence preventing the release of intracellular DNA into plasma (see Figure 4). Moreover, the cell-free circulating DNA/circulating tumor DNA levels are stable for up to 30 days at room temperature or up to 8 days at 37°C (Figure 1 and Figure 5). Whole blood samples can be shipped and stored at room temperature for the subsequent processing of plasma.
Plasma samples produced from the whole blood sample collected into Norgen’s cf-DNA Preservative Tubes and purified using Norgen's Plasma/Serum Cell-Free Circulating DNA Purification Kits or Norgen's Plasma/Serum Circulating DNA Purification Kits (Slurry Format) yield concentrated, high-quality and inhibitor-free cf-DNA/ct-DNA for any downstream application assays, including PCR, qPCR, methylation-sensitive PCR, Southern Blot analysis, microarrays and NGS.
