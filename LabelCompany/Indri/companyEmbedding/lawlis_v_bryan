V. Bryan Lawlis, Ph.D. Promoted To CEO Of Aradigm (ARDM)











Tweet








10/19/2005 5:08:55 PM



HAYWARD, Calif., July 1  /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Aradigm Corporation  today announced that it has promoted V. Bryan Lawlis, Ph.D. to the position of President and Chief Executive Officer from his previous post of President and Chief Operating Officer effective August 1, 2004. Aradigm's Chairman and current CEO, Richard Thompson, will remain as Chairman of the Board of Directors.  Dr. Lawlis has more than 20 years of senior management experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries and, since joining Aradigm in 2001, has been responsible for leading the day-to-day operations of the company.
(Photo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20040701/SFTH006 )
Richard Thompson stated:  "This promotion is part of a planned succession, and acknowledges the significant contributions that Bryan has made throughout his career and during his time at Aradigm. I am confident in Bryan's ability to lead the company, and I look forward to working closely with him in his new role.  I will continue to be active in the company, focusing on commercial and financial strategies as we move towards our first product launch."
Dr. Lawlis commented on his near-term objectives as CEO:  "We will accelerate Aradigm's path to market using the Intraject technology, which is being validated in clinical trials this summer.  Intraject delivery is appropriate for both small molecules and proteins and offers an accelerated clinical and regulatory route for products already dosed by subcutaneous injection. Aradigm will move forward aggressively to realize this potential through its own product development efforts and with partners.  At the same time, we will continue to work with Novo Nordisk on our Phase 3 development program for the pulmonary delivery of insulin using our AERx platform and with our other partners for the AERx technology who are pursuing earlier-stage pulmonary drug delivery programs."
Dr. Lawlis began at Aradigm in 2001 as Chief Operating Officer and was promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer in June 2003.
