                Brookfield Property Partners' Impressive Portfolio of Assets (BPY)            


    By Timothy Melvin | October 20, 2015 — 10:35 AM EDT    






Share





















































Brookfield Property Partners (BPY) is one of the best collection of commercial real estate properties in the world, but you rarely hear the company discussed when investors talk about real estate securities. It is a partnership, not a real estate investment trust (REIT), and the company has a complex ownership structure. Some of their investments are joint ventures and partnerships with other real estate firms so it takes a pencil and some time to figure out the value of shares. Given that the shares trade at a significant discount to management’s estimate of value, it would seem to be worthwhile to take some time and figure out the value of this global, best-in-class property portfolio. (For related reading, see also: Simple Ways to Invest in Real Estate.)
Ownership Structure
When you consider the direct ownership of shares by its parent organization, Brookfield Asset Management (BAM), and the percentage ownership represented by the Redemption-Exchange Units established when the partnership was created, Brookfield Asset Management controls 61% of the partnership. This puts investors in a minority position. Since investors are limited partners they have no vote on corporate matters. While this may seem worrisome it really is not if you look at the bigger picture. This partnership was created specifically to be Brookfield Asset Management's flagship public commercial property entity and serve as the primary vehicle for the company’s commercial real estate investing activities around the globe.
To be comfortable owning shares of Brookfield Property we have to be comfortable with Brookfield Asset Management. The Canadian company is one of the largest asset owners in the world with over $200 billion invested in real estate, infrastructure assets, private equity and renewable energy companies. BAM has been in business for 100 years and has a solid history of earning good returns for its shareholders. In order for BAM to profit from its investment on Brookfield Property Partners, it has to increase the value and cash flows for investors as unit holders.
Property Portfolio
When we invest in Brookfield Property we can invest in an incredible portfolio of properties. The partnership owns 100% of Brookfield Office Properties which includes 250 office properties with over 123 million square feet of leasable space. Most of it is located in the downtown central business districts of major cities like New York, Washington D.C., Houston and Los Angeles in the United States. In Canada the company owns premier downtown properties in Toronto, Calgary and Ottawa. In Australia they have central business district buildings in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. They also own a 22% interest in the Canary Wharf Complex in London that has some of the city's most sought after office space. (For more, see: Find Fortune in Commercial Real Estate.)
Brookfield Property also has substantial exposure to the retail property markets though ownership of a significant stake in several retail real estate operations. They own 29% of General Growth Properties (GGP) that owns 120 high-end retail properties including locations like Woodlands Mall in Texas, Water Tower Place in Oakbrook, Ill., the Ala Moana Center in Honolulu and the Fashion Show in Las Vegas. The partnership also owns 34% of Rouse Properties (RSE) than owns another 30 malls in 19 states with approximately 21 million square feet of retail space.
Along with Brookfield Asset Management they own multi-family properties through Fairfield Residential. Fairfield owns 28,000 multi-family units across the United States and has also formed Brookfield Fairfield U.S. Multi-family Value Add Fund to pursue further multi-family opportunities.
The industrial portfolio is also a joint venture with Brookfield Asset Management that owns 44 million square feet of logistics assets with land sites to develop an additional 69 million square feet of distribution facilities near major markets and transportation routes in North America, Europe and China. The partnership is also invested in a portfolio of hotels that includes 12 hotels in North America and Australia with 8,859 guest rooms. Flagship Properties include Atlantis Hotel in the Bahamas, the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, and the Diplomat Resort in South Florida. The company also recently formed the limited partnership Capital Automotive LP that leases a triple net basis of about 15.6 million square feet to automobile dealers. (For more, see also: 7 Steps to a Hot Commercial Real Estate Deal.)
High Total Return Potential
Through its direct holdings, joint ventures and partnerships, Brookfield Property Partners gives investors a chance to own a world-class portfolio of commercial properties with significant holdings in several market sectors. The property portfolio generates significant cash flows and the shares are yielding about 5% right now. Management has also adopted a dividend policy based on paying out all cash flows after expenses, development and improvement costs. In their most recent shareholder presentation they said they thought they could grow the payout by 5 to 8% annually.
In the second quarter supplemental information included with the earning release, it was estimated that unit holder equity value was $30.19 a share, which is significantly above the current price quote. Management addressed this discount market valuation in the accompanying shareholder letter saying that they are “very focused on narrowing this discount, which will provide additional upside to investors.” As part of its efforts to reduce or eliminate the discount, the company announced plans to renew its prior normal course issuer bid for a one-year period and buy back up to 13,142,359 limited partnership units, representing approximately 5% of the company.
The Bottom Line
Brookfield Property Partners represents a unique opportunity to invest in commercial real estate markets at a discounted price. The potential narrowing of the price to management's estimate of value, along with a generous and growing dividend, represents outstanding total return potential for long-term investors.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year
