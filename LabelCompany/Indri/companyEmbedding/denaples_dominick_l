LOUIS DeNAPLES
Dunmore businessman





Dunmore businessmen Louis and Dominick DeNaples and their wives owe more than $4.6 million in unpaid federal taxes on interest income from a 2001 settlement the state paid them for land for the Casey Highway, a U.S. Tax Court judge has ruled.
In a ruling issued Tuesday, Senior Judge Arthur L. Nims III backed the Internal Revenue Service, which argued the DeNapleses could not exempt part of the interest in the settlement from taxation as they did on their 2003, 2004 and 2005 tax returns.
Judge Nims ruled on an appeal of an IRS decision by Louis DeNaples and his wife, Betty Ann; and his brother Dominick DeNaples and his wife, Mary Ann.
Efforts to reach the DeNapleses through a spokeswoman and their lawyer on the tax case, attorney Barry H. Frank of Philadelphia, were unsuccessful.
The case dates back to the 1990s when the state Department of Transportation was building the 16-mile highway and needed to acquire land for it.
The DeNaples-owned land bought by PennDOT included 34 separate properties, but the property that received the major public attention was 122 acres in Louis and Dominick DeNaples' Keystone Sanitary Landfill in Dunmore. The state wanted to acquire the land through its power of eminent domain, which allows governments to take private land in exchange for fair compensation.
The Lackawanna County Board of View, which decides disputes on land value in eminent domain cases, set the value of the 122 acres at $237 million, based partly on the value of trash the landfill would no longer be able to accept.
Believing the valuation excessive, PennDOT appealed to county court. A few days into the trial, it was interrupted by the settlement, announced Nov. 8, 2001, by Transportation Secretary Bradley L. Mallory.
Under the settlement, PennDOT agreed to pay $40.9 million to resolve the dispute over the 122 acres and the DeNapleses' claims on the other 33 properties along the highway. Of that, $24,638,555 was for the value of the land and $16,261,445 was interest, some of it dating back to 1993.
Between the two DeNaples families, they reported a total of $4,365,312 of the interest as taxable, but excluded from their returns $13,015,466 in interest, arguing it was tax-exempt under IRS rules.
In his opinion, Judge Nims said the interest could not be excluded because the DeNapleses had not shown the amount of interest paid by PennDOT was excessive and because state law requires interest to be paid in settlements.
Lawyers for the DeNapleses had argued the excluded interest was the part that was excessive and was a product of negotiations and was paid through state borrowing rather than because state law required interest to be paid.
The ruling also sheds some light on the structure of the DeNaples family companies.
It shows Dominick and Louis DeNaples each own half shares of D&L Realty, which owns thousands of acres of land in the region, half shares of Keystone Co. and half shares of Rail Realty Inc. Rail Realty is the sole owner of F&L Realty Inc., another large land-owning company.
Based on the DeNapleses' calculations, PennDOT paid $11,342,265 of interest for a 1,044-day delay of payment on the $17,185,384 fair market value of Keystone Co.'s share of Keystone Landfill; $1,260,263 in interest for a 1,044-day delay on the payment of the $1,909,487 fair market value of F&L's share of the landfill; $3,622,240 of interest for a 2,382-day delay on the payment of $5,488,236 fair market value of D&L's share of the landfill's mineral rights and $36,588 of interest for a 1,893-day delay in payment of the $55,347 fair market value of F&L's share of the landfill's mineral rights, according to the ruling.
The ruling deemed the division of the dollar amounts of principal and interest in the settlement to be arbitrary "rather than a mathematical computation of interest" based on prevailing commercial loan rates.
The highway is named after late Gov. Robert P. Casey, the Scranton native who pushed through its construction.
