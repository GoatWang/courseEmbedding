Risk Factors

Our potential risks and uncertainties are presented in the section titled “Item 1A. Risk Factors” disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements:


We have announced that our board of directors has established a special committee (the "Special Committee") comprised of the board's independent directors to respond to the receipt of an unsolicited proposal (the “Proposal”) from an entity (the “Proposing Entity”) sponsored by an affiliate of American Realty Capital VII, LLC, the Company’s sponsor (the “Sponsor”), relating to a potential strategic transaction with the Proposing Entity (the “Proposed Transaction”). Our board of directors has not made a decision to enter into any transaction at this time, and there can be no assurance that the discussions and evaluation will result in a definitive agreement or that any such transaction would be approved by our stockholders.
All of our executive officers and directors are also officers, managers or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in American Realty Capital Healthcare III Advisors, LLC (our "Advisor") and other entities affiliated with AR Global Investments, LLC (the successor business to AR Capital, LLC, "AR Global"), the parent of our Sponsor. As a result, our executive officers and directors, our Advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by our Advisor's compensation arrangements with us and other investment programs advised by affiliates of AR Global and conflicts in allocating time among these investment programs and us. These conflicts could result in unanticipated actions that adversely affect us.
Because investment opportunities that are suitable for us may also be suitable for other investment programs advised by affiliates of AR Global, our Advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest relating to the purchase of properties and other investments and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, meaning that we could invest in less attractive assets, which could reduce the investment return to our stockholders.
No public market currently exists, or may ever exist, for shares of our common stock which are, and may continue to be, illiquid.
We focus on acquiring a diversified portfolio of healthcare-related assets located in the United States and are subject to risks inherent in concentrating investments in the healthcare industry. We have $16.4 million in cash on hand. While we may use a portion of cash on hand to consummate additional acquisitions, we generally expect to use cash on hand to fund distributions or for working capital needs.
Our initial public offering (the "IPO") raised significantly less capital than expected and we may not be able to access capital to fund our needs. As a result, we will be unable to achieve certain of our investment objectives, such as the anticipated size and diversification of our portfolio, without accessing other sources of capital.
  The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and new laws or regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could result in the inability of tenants to make lease payments to us.
  We are depending on our Advisor to conduct our operations. Adverse changes in the financial condition of our Advisor or our relationship with our Advisor could adversely affect us.
We may be unable to pay or maintain cash distributions or increase distributions over time.
We are permitted to pay distributions from unlimited amounts of any source. We have used, and may continue to use, net proceeds from our IPO, which has lapsed in accordance with its terms, and may borrow to fund distributions until we have sufficient cash flows from operations. There are no established limits on the amount of net proceeds and borrowings that we may use to fund distribution payments, except for those imposed by our organizational documents or Maryland law.
We are obligated to pay fees, which may be substantial, to our Advisor and its affiliates.
Our revenue is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants.
Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments.
We are subject to risks associated with any dislocations or liquidity disruptions that may exist or occur in the credit markets of the United States from time to time.
We may fail to continue to qualify to be treated as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ("REIT"), which would result in higher taxes.
 We may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"), and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act.
Commencing on the net asset value ("NAV") pricing date, the offering price of shares sold pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan ("DRIP") and the repurchase price for our shares under our Share Repurchase Plan (our "SRP") will be based on NAV, which may not represent what a stockholder may receive on a sale of the shares, what they may receive upon a liquidation of our assets and distribution of the net proceeds or what a third party may pay to acquire the Company.

 BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. 

Purpose. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and any AR Global Entity regarding the Website or any service thereon, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Section (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. If you have a Dispute with any AR Global Entity or any of their officers, directors, employees or agents that cannot be resolved through negotiation within the time frame described in the “Notice of Dispute” clause below, other than those matters listed in the Exclusions from Arbitration clause, you and the entity that you have a Dispute with agree to seek resolution of the Dispute only through arbitration of that Dispute in accordance with the terms of this Section, and not litigate any Dispute in court. Arbitration means that the Dispute will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court by a judge or jury.
Exclusions from Arbitration. YOU AND THE AR GLOBAL ENTITIES AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR BY ANY AR GLOBAL ENTITY IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION.
RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WITHIN 30 DAYS. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IN THIS SECTION, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION MUST BE MAILED TO AR GLOBAL GENERAL COUNSEL, 405 PARK AVENUE, 14TH FLOOR, NEW YORK, NY 10022 AND MUST INCLUDE: (1) YOUR NAME, (2) YOUR ADDRESS, (3) YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER, IF YOU HAVE ONE, AND (4) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH THE AR GLOBAL ENTITIES THROUGH ARBITRATION.
Notice of Dispute. IF YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH ANY AR GLOBAL ENTITY, YOU MUST SEND WRITTEN NOTICE TO AR GLOBAL General Counsel, 405 Park Avenue, 14th Floor, New York, NY 10022 TO GIVE SUCH AR GLOBAL ENTITY YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE
INFORMALLY THROUGH NEGOTIATION. You agree to negotiate resolution of the Dispute in good faith for no less than 60 days after you provide notice of the Dispute. If AR Global or the AR Global Entity you have a Dispute with does not resolve your Dispute within 60 days from receipt of notice of the Dispute, you, AR Global or the AR Global Entity you have a Dispute with may pursue your claim in arbitration pursuant to the terms in this Section.
Class Action Waiver. ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL ACTION, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE AR GLOBAL ENTITY WITH WHICH YOU HAVE A DISPUTE SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION. 
Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator. If you or the entity you have a Dispute with elect to resolve your Dispute through arbitration, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding may initiate it with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org, or JAMS www.jamsadr.com. The terms of this Section govern in the event they conflict with the rules of the arbitration organization selected by the parties.
Arbitration Procedures. Because the software and/or service provided to you by the entity you have a Dispute with concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, applicable federal or state law may also apply to the substance of any Disputes. For claims of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (“Supplementary Procedures”) shall apply including the schedule of arbitration fees set forth in Section C-8 of the Supplementary Procedures; for claims over $75,000, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and relevant fee schedules for non-class action proceedings shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Further, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided notice to and negotiated in good faith with the entity you had a Dispute with as described above, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal law afforded to the entity you have a Dispute with or you. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.

Risk Factors








Risk Factors
Our potential risks and uncertainties are presented in the section titled “Item 1A. Risk Factors” disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements:


 Certain of our executive officers and directors are also officers, managers or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in Healthcare Trust Advisors, LLC (our "Advisor") and other entities affiliated with AR Global Investments, LLC (the successor business to AR Capital, LLC, "AR Global"), the parent of our sponsor, American Realty Capital VII, LLC (the "Sponsor"). As a result, certain of our executive officers and directors, our Advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by our Advisor's compensation arrangements with us and other investment programs advised by affiliates of AR Global and conflicts in allocating time among these investment programs and us. These conflicts could result in unanticipated actions that adversely affect us.
 Because investment opportunities that are suitable for us may also be suitable for other investment programs advised by affiliates of AR Global, our Advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest relating to the purchase of properties and other investments and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, meaning that we could invest in less attractive assets, which could reduce the investment return to our stockholders.
 Although we intend to seek a listing of our shares of common stock on a national stock exchange when we believe market conditions are favorable to do so, there is no assurance that our shares of common stock will be listed. No public market currently exists, or may ever exist, for shares of our common stock and our shares are, and may continue to be, illiquid.
 We focus on acquiring and owning a diversified portfolio of healthcare-related assets located in the United States and are subject to risks inherent in concentrating investments in the healthcare industry.
 If our Advisor loses or is unable to obtain qualified personnel, our ability to continue to achieve our investment strategies could be delayed or hindered.
 The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and new laws or regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could result in the inability of tenants to make lease payments to us. 
 We are depending on our Advisor to select investments and conduct our operations. Adverse changes in the financial condition of our Advisor and its affiliates or our relationship with our Advisor could adversely affect us.
 We may be unable to fund distributions from cash flows from operations, or maintain cash distributions or increase distributions over time.
 We are obligated to pay fees, which may be substantial, to our Advisor and its affiliates.
 We depend on tenants for our revenue and, accordingly, our revenue is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants.
 We may not be able to achieve our rental rate objectives on new and renewal leases and our expenses could be greater, which may impact our results of operations.
 Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and limit our ability to pay distributions.
 Any distributions, especially those not covered by our cash flows from operations, may reduce the amount of capital available for other purposes included investment in properties and other permitted investments and may negatively impact the value of our stockholders' investment.
 We have not and may not in the future generate cash flows sufficient to pay our distributions to stockholders and, as such, we may be required to fund distributions from borrowings, which may be at unfavorable rates and could restrict the amount we can borrow for investments and other purposes, or depend on our Advisor or our property manager, Healthcare Trust Properties, LLC (the "Property Manager") to waive fees or reimbursement of certain expenses and fees to fund our operations. There is no assurance these entities will waive such amounts or that we will be able to borrow funds at all.
 We are subject to risks associated with any dislocations or liquidity disruptions that may exist or occur in the credit markets of the United States from time to time.
 We are subject to risks associated with changes in general economic, business and political conditions including the possibility of intensified international hostilities, acts of terrorism, and changes in conditions of United States or international lending, capital and financing markets.
 We may fail to continue to qualify to be treated as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ("REIT"), which would result in higher taxes, may adversely affect our operations and would reduce the value of an investment in our common stock and the cash available for distributions.
 We may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"), and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act.
 The offering price and repurchase price for our shares, including shares sold pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan ("DRIP") may not, among other things, accurately reflect the value of our assets and may not represent what a stockholder may receive on a sale of the shares, what they may receive upon a liquidation of our assets and distribution of the net proceeds or what a third party may pay to acquire the Company.

American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust III, Inc. To Sell Substantially All Assets To Healthcare Trust, Inc. For Approximately $120 Million And Liquidate









PR Newswire




Jun 19, 2017 10:57 AM EDT













 


















































      NEW YORK , June 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --   American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust III , Inc. (the "Company") announced today that the special committee of the board of directors unanimously approved the sale of substantially all of the Company's assets to Healthcare Trust, Inc. ("HTI") for approximately $120 million. Following the closing of the transaction, the Company expects to liquidate and dissolve.       The special committee of the Company's board of directors, which consists solely of the independent members of the board of directors, was formed to identify, examine, and consider a range of strategic alternatives and has approved the transaction, subject to the approval of the Company's stockholders of the transaction and the Company's liquidation following the transaction.    Sue Perrotty, Chair of the Board and Lead Independent Director of the Company, explained, "The board of directors of the Company formed the special committee, which consists of the independent members of the board, to identify, examine, and consider a range of strategic alternatives. After an extensive, 12-month-plus process, the special committee feels the asset sale to HTI is the best option to maximize shareholder value. The all-cash transaction provides liquidity to shareholders and the institutional buyer serves to mitigate any execution risk."   Strategic and Financial Benefits of the Transaction     Full-Cycle Liquidity Event:   Transaction provides Company shareholders with a full cycle liquidity event.    All-Cash Transaction:   Company shareholders receive liquidity in an all-cash transaction. Any distributions of the proceeds from the transaction made to stockholders will be subject to payment or provision for the Company's remaining liabilities and obligations. The Company cannot predict the amount or timing of any liquidating distributions to its stockholders.    Reduced Future Risks Associated with Business Operations, Liquidity Events, and Distribution Levels:   Given its inefficient size and unsustainable operations on a long-term basis, an all-cash liquidity event reduces risks associated with 1) ongoing business operations, 2) the execution of a successful liquidity event in the future, and 3) future distributions.    Institutional Buyer Mitigates Execution Risk:   As a large institutional buyer with a conservatively levered balance sheet, HTI mitigates execution risk for Company shareholders. The Company and HTI each are sponsored and advised by affiliates of AR Global Investments, LLC.    Shareholder Approval Required:   The transaction requires approval from Company shareholders of the transaction and the Company's plan of liquidation.    Maximizes Value:   The Special Committee completed a thorough strategic review process evaluating all options and is prepared to move forward with the proposed transaction to maximize shareholder value.     Terms of the Transaction and Timing  Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will sell substantially all of its assets to HTI for $120 million, less the principal balance of an outstanding mortgage loan on one of the Company's properties that will either be assumed by HTI or repaid by the Company at closing and associated costs. $6 million of this amount will be deposited into an escrow account at closing and will be released in installments following the closing date. The total amount payable at closing is subject to customary prorations and closing adjustments in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  The agreement provides that the Company will pay a termination fee of $3.6 million to HTI if the Company enters into a strategic transaction other than this transaction or if the Company's board of directors changes its recommendation regarding this transaction. The Company has agreed to reimburse up to $850,000 of certain of HTI's transaction-related expenses in the event that the agreement is terminated because the Company's stockholders do not approve the transaction.   Completion of the transaction is subject to the approval of the Company's stockholders of the transaction and the Company's liquidation as well as satisfying customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the third or fourth quarter of 2017.   Financial Advisors  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. is serving as exclusive financial advisor to the Company's special committee. Shapiro Sher Guinot & Sandler is serving as legal counsel to the Company's special committee.   KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. is serving as exclusive financial advisor to HTI's special committee. Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP is serving as legal counsel to HTI's special committee.   Proskauer Rose LLP is serving as outside legal counsel to both the Company and HTI.    Additional Information about the Proposed Transaction and Where to Find It  This communication does not constitute a solicitation of any vote or approval.

NEW YORK, June 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust III, Inc. (the "Company") announced today that the special committee of the board of directors unanimously approved the sale of substantially all of the Company's assets to Healthcare Trust, Inc. ("HTI") for approximately $120 million. Following the closing of the transaction, the Company expects to liquidate and dissolve.


The special committee of the Company's board of directors, which consists solely of the independent members of the board of directors, was formed to identify, examine, and consider a range of strategic alternatives and has approved the transaction, subject to the approval of the Company's stockholders of the transaction and the Company's liquidation following the transaction. 
Sue Perrotty, Chair of the Board and Lead Independent Director of the Company, explained, "The board of directors of the Company formed the special committee, which consists of the independent members of the board, to identify, examine, and consider a range of strategic alternatives. After an extensive, 12-month-plus process, the special committee feels the asset sale to HTI is the best option to maximize shareholder value. The all-cash transaction provides liquidity to shareholders and the institutional buyer serves to mitigate any execution risk."
Strategic and Financial Benefits of the Transaction

Full-Cycle Liquidity Event: Transaction provides Company shareholders with a full cycle liquidity event. 
All-Cash Transaction: Company shareholders receive liquidity in an all-cash transaction. Any distributions of the proceeds from the transaction made to stockholders will be subject to payment or provision for the Company's remaining liabilities and obligations. The Company cannot predict the amount or timing of any liquidating distributions to its stockholders. 
Reduced Future Risks Associated with Business Operations, Liquidity Events, and Distribution Levels: Given its inefficient size and unsustainable operations on a long-term basis, an all-cash liquidity event reduces risks associated with 1) ongoing business operations, 2) the execution of a successful liquidity event in the future, and 3) future distributions. 
Institutional Buyer Mitigates Execution Risk: As a large institutional buyer with a conservatively levered balance sheet, HTI mitigates execution risk for Company shareholders. The Company and HTI each are sponsored and advised by affiliates of AR Global Investments, LLC. 
Shareholder Approval Required: The transaction requires approval from Company shareholders of the transaction and the Company's plan of liquidation. 
Maximizes Value: The Special Committee completed a thorough strategic review process evaluating all options and is prepared to move forward with the proposed transaction to maximize shareholder value.

Terms of the Transaction and TimingUnder the terms of the agreement, the Company will sell substantially all of its assets to HTI for $120 million, less the principal balance of an outstanding mortgage loan on one of the Company's properties that will either be assumed by HTI or repaid by the Company at closing and associated costs. $6 million of this amount will be deposited into an escrow account at closing and will be released in installments following the closing date. The total amount payable at closing is subject to customary prorations and closing adjustments in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
The agreement provides that the Company will pay a termination fee of $3.6 million to HTI if the Company enters into a strategic transaction other than this transaction or if the Company's board of directors changes its recommendation regarding this transaction. The Company has agreed to reimburse up to $850,000 of certain of HTI's transaction-related expenses in the event that the agreement is terminated because the Company's stockholders do not approve the transaction. 
Completion of the transaction is subject to the approval of the Company's stockholders of the transaction and the Company's liquidation as well as satisfying customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the third or fourth quarter of 2017.
Financial AdvisorsSunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. is serving as exclusive financial advisor to the Company's special committee. Shapiro Sher Guinot & Sandler is serving as legal counsel to the Company's special committee. 
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. is serving as exclusive financial advisor to HTI's special committee. Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP is serving as legal counsel to HTI's special committee. 
Proskauer Rose LLP is serving as outside legal counsel to both the Company and HTI.

NEW YORK, June 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Healthcare Trust, Inc. (the "Company") announced today that the special committee of the board of directors unanimously approved the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust III, Inc. ("HT III") for approximately $120 million. 


The special committee of the Company's board of directors, which consists solely of the independent members of the board of directors, was formed to review strategic alternatives and address potential conflicts of interest in the proposed transaction and has approved the transaction. 
Leslie D. Michelson, Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of Director of the Company explained, "We are excited about HTI's acquisition of assets from HT III, which represents a positive step in the evolution of our company in line with our plans for the deployment of additional capital. This accretive acquisition enhances HTI's portfolio through increased occupancy, a broadened base of tenants and operators, further geographic diversification, and the addition of more medical office buildings and private pay assets.  We believe this transaction will help us create greater shareholder value, improve our leverage profile and increase our distribution coverage."
Strategic and Financial Benefits of the Transaction

Enhances Company's Portfolio: Improves size, scale, and diversification of the Company's portfolio. 

Increases overall portfolio occupancy 
Broadens tenant/operator base with additional investment grade tenants 
Expands geographic diversification of the portfolio 
Provides greater private pay-focused asset base

Improves Leverage Profile: Unencumbered asset pool lowers Company's leverage. 
Accretive Transaction: We believe the acquisition will be accretive and improve distribution coverage for Company shareholders. 
Acquiring Primarily Medical Office Building (MOB) portfolio: Increases exposure to MOB assets. 
Executes 2017 Growth Initiatives: Deploys additional capital into the healthcare sector, particularly medical office and seniors housing. 
Supports Future Growth: Combined $2.47 billion portfolio (based on the cost of investments) we believe, will result in increased access to the capital markets and, we believe, positions the Company for further growth. 
Eliminates Perceived Management Conflicts: Company and HT III each are sponsored and advised by affiliates of AR Global Investments, LLC and have the same management team. Following the transaction, the management team will be solely focused on the Company. Eliminates need for an acquisition allocation agreement between the Company and HT III.

Terms of the Transaction and Timing
Under the terms of the agreement, HT III will sell substantially all of its assets to the Company for $120 million, less the principal balance of an outstanding mortgage loan on one of HT III's properties that the Company will assume or HT III will repay at closing and associated costs. $6 million of this amount will be deposited into an escrow account at closing and will be released in installments following the closing date. The total amount payable at closing is subject to customary prorations and closing adjustments in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
The agreement provides that HT III will pay a termination fee of $3.6 million to the Company if HT III enters into a strategic transaction other than this transaction or if the HT III board of directors changes its recommendation regarding this transaction. HT III has agreed to reimburse up to $850,000 of certain of the Company's transaction-related expenses in the event that the agreement is terminated because HT III's stockholders do not approve the transaction.  
Completion of the transaction is subject to the approval of HT III's stockholders of the transaction and HT III's plan of liquidation as well as satisfying customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the third or fourth quarter of 2017.
