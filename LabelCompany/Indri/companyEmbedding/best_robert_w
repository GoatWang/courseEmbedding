The stitched collar, stylized deer antler buttons and the loden wool are quintessential features of the traditional Austrian Alpine style.  Worn for generations by the rugged men of the Alps, this authentic jacket makes an impression anywhere.

The shell is made from a loden woven by Mapel Stelloni in Italy and assembled by Allwerk in Hungary. The 75% Merino wool, 25% polyamide fiber mix creates a tough, warm and water-resistant fabric that keeps its shape for many years.  


The jacket is fully lined with viscose, a silky, breathable semi-synthetic fabric derived from wood pulp. The jacket is sized like a sport coat or suit but due to the unique split in the back it provides a greater range of movement.  


The jacket has two inside pockets and four exterior pockets which come closed, but can be opened as well. The jacket weighs nearly two pounds.
