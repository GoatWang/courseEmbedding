Governing Law
Use of this website and these Terms and Conditions of Use shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York of the United States of America, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.  If any portion of these Terms and Conditions of Use are deemed unenforceable, unlawful or void by a Court of competent jurisdiction, then that portion of the Terms and Conditions of Use will be deemed severable and will not affect the enforceability or validity of the remaining portions of these Terms and Conditions of Use.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in these Terms and Conditions, Alkeon may at any time seek injunctive or other appropriate relief against you and/or against others, in any state or federal court in the state of New York or in any other court having jurisdiction, in the event that Alkeon believes that you have violated or threatened to violate any of Alkeon�s intellectual property rights and, in such case, you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such court.  

In the event that any portion of these Terms and Conditions are deemed unenforceable, unlawful or void by a Court of competent jurisdiction, in any jurisdiction for any reason, including but not limited to the scope, duration or area of its applicability, unless narrowed by construction, such provision shall for purposes of such jurisdiction only, be construed as if such invalid, prohibited or unenforceable provision had been more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable (or if such language cannot be drawn narrowly enough, the court making any such determination shall have the power to modify, to the extent necessary to make such provision or provisions enforceable in such jurisdiction, such scope, duration or area or all of them, and such provision shall then be applicable in such modified form in such jurisdiction).  If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such provision would be held to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction for any reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction only, shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, prohibition or unenforceability, without invalidating the remaining provisions.  No narrowed construction, court-modification or invalidation of any provision shall affect the construction, validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. No waiver by Alkeon of any term or condition of these Terms and Conditions shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or of any other term or condition, and Alkeon�s failure to assert any right or demand compliance with any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any such right or provision.

Governing Law
Use of this website and these Terms and Conditions of Use shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York of the United States of America, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.  If any portion of these Terms and Conditions of Use are deemed unenforceable, unlawful or void by a Court of competent jurisdiction, then that portion of the Terms and Conditions of Use will be deemed severable and will not affect the enforceability or validity of the remaining portions of these Terms and Conditions of Use.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in these Terms and Conditions, Alkeon may at any time seek injunctive or other appropriate relief against you and/or against others, in any state or federal court in the state of New York or in any other court having jurisdiction, in the event that Alkeon believes that you have violated or threatened to violate any of Alkeon�s intellectual property rights and, in such case, you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such court.

If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such provision would be held to be invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction for any reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction only, shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, prohibition or unenforceability, without invalidating the remaining provisions.  No narrowed construction, court-modification or invalidation of any provision shall affect the construction, validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. No waiver by Alkeon of any term or condition of these Terms and Conditions shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or of any other term or condition, and Alkeon�s failure to assert any right or demand compliance with any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any such right or provision.
