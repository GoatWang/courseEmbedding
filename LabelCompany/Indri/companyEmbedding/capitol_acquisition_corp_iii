Combination to Provide a Public Currency and Financial Flexibility to Expand Cision's Growth and Global Leadership in Media Communication Technology and Analytics 
Combined Company to be Well Positioned to Capitalize on the Rising Importance of Earned Media with a First-of-its-Kind Cloud-Based Platform – the Cision Communications Cloud™


Investor Conference Call Scheduled for Monday, March 20th, at 11:00am EDT
CHICAGO and WASHINGTON, March 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The parent company of Cision, a leading global provider of cloud-based earned media solutions, and Capitol Acquisition Corp. III (NASDAQ:    CLAC; "Capitol"), a public investment vehicle, announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement in which Cision will become a publicly listed company with an anticipated initial enterprise value of approximately $2.4 billion.
Cision delivers a sophisticated, easy-to-use platform for communicators to reach relevant media influencers and craft compelling campaigns that impact customer behavior. With rich monitoring and analytics, the Cision Communications Cloud™ arms brands with the insights they need to link their earned media to strategic business objectives, while aligning it with owned and paid channels.  This platform enables companies and brands to build consistent, meaningful and enduring relationships with influencers and buyers in order to amplify their marketplace influence. 
Cision's management team, led by CEO Kevin Akeroyd and CFO Jack Pearlstein, will continue to run the combined company post-transaction.  Capitol Chairman and CEO, Mark Ein, will join the combined company's board of directors and serve as Vice Chairman.  Capitol's President and CFO, Dyson Dryden, will also join the board.
"There is a shift in corporate marketing spend to the earned channel driven by its higher ROI and proven success in building brands and the declining efficacy of traditional paid media advertising," said Mark Ein, Chairman and CEO of Capitol.  "We are investing in Cision, a market leader, to get behind this large, important trend and position the company for accelerated future growth.  We think the combined company will deliver superior returns for investors long into the future." 
The rise of marketing technology is driving increased investment in communications and PR.  According to Gartner Inc., marketing technology spend is expected to exceed spend on core enterprise IT by 2017 and is growing at a much faster rate (12% vs. 3%, respectively).  With the effectiveness of paid advertising declining, as evidenced by GlobalWebIndex research indicating that 60% of desktop users have used ad-blockers, marketing technology spend is shifting toward earned media channels. These tailwinds, coupled with strategic flexibility provided by the merger, will broaden Cision's market opportunity beyond leadership in global communications intelligence software and services, a $3 billion industry according to Burton-Taylor International Consulting LLC, into the marketing software market, which IDC estimates will reach $32 billion by 2018, and ultimately into the broader digital marketing and data markets.
"This transaction reflects the significant progress Cision has made in its effort to build the most comprehensive media intelligence platform in the world," said GTCR Managing Director Mark Anderson. "We look forward to Cision continuing to expand and accelerate its global leadership position as a public company with access to new sources of capital."  
"We appreciate GTCR's ongoing sponsorship, which has been instrumental in building the business, and with this transaction are thrilled to also partner with Capitol as we execute our vision for the company," said CEO Kevin Akeroyd. "This transaction marks a key milestone for Cision. We are extremely well positioned to accelerate our growth following our acquisition of PR Newswire and the recent launch of the Cision Communications Cloud™ which enhanced our scale, comprehensive SaaS product set and global reach."
"We are excited to partner with the Cision team as they execute on their platform growth strategy," said Dyson Dryden, President and CFO of Capitol. "We believe Kevin's prior experience at Oracle, where he built the Marketing Cloud business unit from a nascent stage into one of the largest Marketing and Ad Tech providers in the industry and Jack's long successful track record, including serving as CFO of four previous GTCR companies, uniquely qualifies them to execute the company's long-term growth plan."
Summary of Transaction 
Under the terms of the proposed transaction, the combination will be effected through a "contribution and exchange" pursuant to which Cision will be contributed to a wholly owned subsidiary of Capitol ("Holdings") that will become a publicly traded entity following a subsequent merger of a subsidiary of Holdings into Capitol.  The combined company will have an anticipated initial enterprise value of approximately $2.4 billion implying a 10.5x multiple of projected 2017 Adjusted EBITDA and a multiple of 9.2x projected 2018 Adjusted EBITDA.  
GTCR and current management are retaining 100% of their equity in the company.  At closing, current Cision shareholders and current stockholders of Capitol will hold approximately 68% and 32%, respectively, of the issued and outstanding shares of the new publicly traded company's common stock, with GTCR remaining a majority owner.  A portion of the consideration to Cision's shareholders will be in the form of incentive earnout shares totaling up to 6 million common shares, issued in 2 million increments when the combined company's stock price reaches $13.00, $16.00 and $19.00 per share.
The net cash proceeds from this transaction are expected to be used to pay down Cision's existing second lien debt.
The boards of directors of both Capitol and Cision have unanimously approved the proposed transaction. Completion of the transaction, which is expected in the second quarter of 2017, is subject to approval by Capitol stockholders and other customary closing conditions.
For additional information on the transaction, see Capitol's Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed promptly and which can be obtained, without charge, at the Securities and Exchange Commission's internet site (http://www.sec.gov).
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Credit Suisse served as financial and capital markets advisors to Capitol.  PJT Partners served as financial advisor to Cision.  Latham & Watkins LLP and Graubard Miller acted as legal advisors to Capitol and Kirkland & Ellis LLP acted as legal advisor to Cision.

Capitol intends to file a proxy statement, prospectus and other relevant documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") to be used at its annual meeting of stockholders to approve the proposed transaction with Cision.

Combined Company to be Well Positioned to Capitalize on the Rising Importance of Earned Media with a First-of-its-Kind Cloud-Based Platform – the Cision Communications Cloud™
Investor Conference Call Scheduled for Monday, March 20th, at 11:00am EDT
CHICAGO and WASHINGTON, March 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — The parent company of Cision, a leading global provider of cloud-based earned media solutions, and Capitol Acquisition Corp. III (NASDAQ: CLAC; “Capitol”), a public investment vehicle, announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement in which Cision will become a publicly listed company with an anticipated initial enterprise value of approximately $2.4 billion.
Cision delivers a sophisticated, easy-to-use platform for communicators to reach relevant media influencers and craft compelling campaigns that impact customer behavior. With rich monitoring and analytics, the Cision Communications Cloud™ arms brands with the insights they need to link their earned media to strategic business objectives, while aligning it with owned and paid channels.  This platform enables companies and brands to build consistent, meaningful and enduring relationships with influencers and buyers in order to amplify their marketplace influence.
Cision’s management team, led by CEO Kevin Akeroyd and CFO Jack Pearlstein, will continue to run the combined company post-transaction.  Capitol Chairman and CEO, Mark Ein, will join the combined company’s board of directors and serve as Vice Chairman.  Capitol’s President and CFO, Dyson Dryden, will also join the board.
“There is a shift in corporate marketing spend to the earned channel driven by its higher ROI and proven success in building brands and the declining efficacy of traditional paid media advertising,” said Mark Ein, Chairman and CEO of Capitol.  “We are investing in Cision, a market leader, to get behind this large, important trend and position the company for accelerated future growth.  We think the combined company will deliver superior returns for investors long into the future.”
The rise of marketing technology is driving increased investment in communications and PR.  According to Gartner Inc., marketing technology spend is expected to exceed spend on core enterprise IT by 2017 and is growing at a much faster rate (12% vs. 3%, respectively).  With the effectiveness of paid advertising declining, as evidenced by GlobalWebIndex research indicating that 60% of desktop users have used ad-blockers, marketing technology spend is shifting toward earned media channels. These tailwinds, coupled with strategic flexibility provided by the merger, will broaden Cision’s market opportunity beyond leadership in global communications intelligence software and services, a $3 billion industry according to Burton-Taylor International Consulting LLC, into the marketing software market, which IDC estimates will reach $32 billion by 2018, and ultimately into the broader digital marketing and data markets.
“This transaction reflects the significant progress Cision has made in its effort to build the most comprehensive media intelligence platform in the world,” said GTCR Managing Director Mark Anderson. “We look forward to Cision continuing to expand and accelerate its global leadership position as a public company with access to new sources of capital.”
“We appreciate GTCR’s ongoing sponsorship, which has been instrumental in building the business, and with this transaction are thrilled to also partner with Capitol as we execute our vision for the company,” said CEO Kevin Akeroyd. “This transaction marks a key milestone for Cision. We are extremely well positioned to accelerate our growth following our acquisition of PR Newswire and the recent launch of the Cision Communications Cloud™ which enhanced our scale, comprehensive SaaS product set and global reach.”
“We are excited to partner with the Cision team as they execute on their platform growth strategy,” said Dyson Dryden, President and CFO of Capitol. “We believe Kevin’s prior experience at Oracle, where he built the Marketing Cloud business unit from a nascent stage into one of the largest Marketing and Ad Tech providers in the industry and Jack’s long successful track record, including serving as CFO of four previous GTCR companies, uniquely qualifies them to execute the company’s long-term growth plan.”
Summary of Transaction
Under the terms of the proposed transaction, the combination will be effected through a “contribution and exchange” pursuant to which Cision will be contributed to a wholly owned subsidiary of Capitol (“Holdings”) that will become a publicly traded entity following a subsequent merger of a subsidiary of Holdings into Capitol.  The combined company will have an anticipated initial enterprise value of approximately $2.4 billion implying a 10.5x multiple of projected 2017 Adjusted EBITDA and a multiple of 9.2x projected 2018 Adjusted EBITDA.
GTCR and current management are retaining 100% of their equity in the company.  At closing, current Cision shareholders and current stockholders of Capitol will hold approximately 68% and 32%, respectively, of the issued and outstanding shares of the new publicly traded company’s common stock, with GTCR remaining a majority owner.  A portion of the consideration to Cision’s shareholders will be in the form of incentive earnout shares totaling up to 6 million common shares, issued in 2 million increments when the combined company’s stock price reaches $13.00, $16.00 and $19.00 per share.
The net cash proceeds from this transaction are expected to be used to pay down Cision’s existing second lien debt.
The boards of directors of both Capitol and Cision have unanimously approved the proposed transaction. Completion of the transaction, which is expected in the second quarter of 2017, is subject to approval by Capitol stockholders and other customary closing conditions.
For additional information on the transaction, see Capitol’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed promptly and which can be obtained, without charge, at the Securities and Exchange Commission’s internet site (http://www.sec.gov).
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Credit Suisse served as financial and capital markets advisors to Capitol.  PJT Partners served as financial advisor to Cision.  Latham & Watkins LLP and Graubard Miller acted as legal advisors to Capitol and Kirkland & Ellis LLP acted as legal advisor to Cision.
Additional Information and Where to Find It
Capitol intends to file a proxy statement, prospectus and other relevant documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to be used at its annual meeting of stockholders to approve the proposed transaction with Cision. The proxy statement will be mailed to stockholders as of a record date to be established for voting on the proposed business combination. INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF CAPITOL, CISION AND HOLDINGS ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT, PROSPECTUS AND OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS THAT WILL BE FILED WITH THE SEC CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION.  Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of the proxy statement, prospectus and other documents containing important information about Capitol, Cision and Holdings once such documents are filed with the SEC, through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.  Copies of the documents filed with the SEC by Capitol and/or Cision when and if available, can be obtained free of charge on Capitol’s website at www.capitolacquisition.com or by directing a written request to Capitol Acquisition Corp.

Additional information regarding the interests of participants in the solicitation of proxies in connection with the proposed business combination will be included in the Registration Statement that Capitol intends to cause Holdings to file with the SEC.

"We look forward to Cision continuing to expand and accelerate its global leadership position as a public company with access to new sources of capital."   "We appreciate GTCR's ongoing sponsorship, which has been instrumental in building the business, and with this transaction are thrilled to also partner with Capitol as we execute our vision for the company," said CEO Kevin Akeroyd. "This transaction marks a key milestone for Cision. We are extremely well positioned to accelerate our growth following our acquisition of PR Newswire and the recent launch of the Cision Communications Cloud ™ which enhanced our scale, comprehensive SaaS product set and global reach." "We are excited to partner with the Cision team as they execute on their platform growth strategy," said Dyson Dryden, President and CFO of Capitol. "We believe Kevin's prior experience at Oracle, where he built the Marketing Cloud business unit from a nascent stage into one of the largest Marketing and Ad Tech providers in the industry and Jack's long successful track record, including serving as CFO of four previous GTCR companies, uniquely qualifies them to execute the company's long-term growth plan."  Summary of Transaction  Under the terms of the proposed transaction, the combination will be effected through a "contribution and exchange" pursuant to which Cision will be contributed to a wholly owned subsidiary of Capitol ("Holdings") that will become a publicly traded entity following a subsequent merger of a subsidiary of Holdings into Capitol.  The combined company will have an anticipated initial enterprise value of approximately $2.4 billion implying a 10.5x multiple of projected 2017 Adjusted EBITDA and a multiple of 9.2x projected 2018 Adjusted EBITDA.   GTCR and current management are retaining 100% of their equity in the company.  At closing, current Cision shareholders and current stockholders of Capitol will hold approximately 68% and 32%, respectively, of the issued and outstanding shares of the new publicly traded company's common stock, with GTCR remaining a majority owner.  A portion of the consideration to Cision's shareholders will be in the form of incentive earnout shares totaling up to 6 million common shares, issued in 2 million increments when the combined company's stock price reaches $13.00, $16.00 and $19.00 per share. The net cash proceeds from this transaction are expected to be used to pay down Cision's existing second lien debt.

CHICAGO and WASHINGTON, June 29, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The parent company of Cision, a leading global provider of cloud-based earned media solutions, and Capitol Acquisition Corp. III (NASDAQ:    CLAC; "Capitol 3"), a publicly traded investment vehicle, today announced the closing of their merger following the receipt of stockholder approval at Capitol 3's annual meeting held today. In connection with the consummation of the merger, the combined company was renamed Cision Ltd., and anticipates that starting on June 30, 2017, its ordinary shares and warrants will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE MKT under the symbols CISN and CISN WS, respectively.

PRESS RELEASE
CHICAGO and WASHINGTON, March 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — The parent company of Cision, a leading global provider of cloud-based earned media solutions, and Capitol Acquisition Corp. III (NASDAQ: CLAC; “Capitol”), a public investment vehicle, announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement in which Cision will become a publicly listed company with an anticipated initial enterprise value of approximately $2.4 billion.
Cision delivers a sophisticated, easy-to-use platform for communicators to reach relevant media influencers and craft compelling campaigns that impact customer behavior. With rich monitoring and analytics, the Cision Communications Cloud™ arms brands with the insights they need to link their earned media to strategic business objectives, while aligning it with owned and paid channels. This platform enables companies and brands to build consistent, meaningful and enduring relationships with influencers and buyers in order to amplify their marketplace influence.
Cision’s management team, led by CEO Kevin Akeroyd and CFO Jack Pearlstein, will continue to run the combined company post-transaction. Capitol Chairman and CEO, Mark Ein, will join the combined company’s board of directors and serve as Vice Chairman. Capitol’s President and CFO, Dyson Dryden, will also join the board.
“There is a shift in corporate marketing spend to the earned channel driven by its higher ROI and proven success in building brands and the declining efficacy of traditional paid media advertising,” said Mark Ein, Chairman and CEO of Capitol. “We are investing in Cision, a market leader, to get behind this large, important trend and position the company for accelerated future growth. We think the combined company will deliver superior returns for investors long into the future.”
The rise of marketing technology is driving increased investment in communications and PR. According to Gartner Inc., marketing technology spend is expected to exceed spend on core enterprise IT by 2017 and is growing at a much faster rate (12% vs. 3%, respectively). With the effectiveness of paid advertising declining, as evidenced by GlobalWebIndex research indicating that 60% of desktop users have used ad-blockers, marketing technology spend is shifting toward earned media channels. These tailwinds, coupled with strategic flexibility provided by the merger, will broaden Cision’s market opportunity beyond leadership in global communications intelligence software and services, a $3 billion industry according to Burton-Taylor International Consulting LLC, into the marketing software market, which IDC estimates will reach $32 billion by 2018, and ultimately into the broader digital marketing and data markets.
“This transaction reflects the significant progress Cision has made in its effort to build the most comprehensive media intelligence platform in the world,” said GTCR Managing Director Mark Anderson. “We look forward to Cision continuing to expand and accelerate its global leadership position as a public company with access to new sources of capital.”
“We appreciate GTCR’s ongoing sponsorship, which has been instrumental in building the business, and with this transaction are thrilled to also partner with Capitol as we execute our vision for the company,” said CEO Kevin Akeroyd. “This transaction marks a key milestone for Cision. We are extremely well positioned to accelerate our growth following our acquisition of PR Newswire and the recent launch of the Cision Communications Cloud™ which enhanced our scale, comprehensive SaaS product set and global reach.”
“We are excited to partner with the Cision team as they execute on their platform growth strategy,” said Dyson Dryden, President and CFO of Capitol. “We believe Kevin’s prior experience at Oracle, where he built the Marketing Cloud business unit from a nascent stage into one of the largest Marketing and Ad Tech providers in the industry and Jack’s long successful track record, including serving as CFO of four previous GTCR companies, uniquely qualifies them to execute the company’s long-term growth plan.”
Summary of Transaction
Under the terms of the proposed transaction, the combination will be effected through a “contribution and exchange” pursuant to which Cision will be contributed to a wholly owned subsidiary of Capitol (“Holdings”) that will become a publicly traded entity following a subsequent merger of a subsidiary of Holdings into Capitol. The combined company will have an anticipated initial enterprise value of approximately $2.4 billion implying a 10.5x multiple of projected 2017 Adjusted EBITDA and a multiple of 9.2x projected 2018 Adjusted EBITDA.
GTCR and current management are retaining 100% of their equity in the company. At closing, current Cision shareholders and current stockholders of Capitol will hold approximately 68% and 32%, respectively, of the issued and outstanding shares of the new publicly traded company’s common stock, with GTCR remaining a majority owner. A portion of the consideration to Cision’s shareholders will be in the form of incentive earnout shares totaling up to 6 million common shares, issued in 2 million increments when the combined company’s stock price reaches $13.00, $16.00 and $19.00 per share.
The net cash proceeds from this transaction are expected to be used to pay down Cision’s existing second lien debt.
The boards of directors of both Capitol and Cision have unanimously approved the proposed transaction. Completion of the transaction, which is expected in the second quarter of 2017, is subject to approval by Capitol stockholders and other customary closing conditions.
For additional information on the transaction, see Capitol’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed promptly and which can be obtained, without charge, at the Securities and Exchange Commission’s internet site (http://www.sec.gov).
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Credit Suisse served as financial and capital markets advisors to Capitol. PJT Partners served as financial advisor to Cision. Latham & Watkins LLP and Graubard Miller acted as legal advisors to Capitol and Kirkland & Ellis LLP acted as legal advisor to Cision.

Capitol intends to file a proxy statement, prospectus and other relevant documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to be used at its annual meeting of stockholders to approve the proposed transaction with Cision. The proxy statement will be mailed to stockholders as of a record date to be established for voting on the proposed business combination.
