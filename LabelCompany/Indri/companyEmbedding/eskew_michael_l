      ■ Michael Eskew was an engineer with a flair for organization:
      processes preoccupied him, and his assignments as he climbed the corporate
      ladder at the United Parcel Service (UPS) involved everything from
      reorganizing parking spaces to the logistics of opening service to
      hundreds of millions of Chinese customers. His hobbies included golfing,
      but most significant for his place in history may have been his avidly
      reading nonfiction books, because he developed exceptional writing skills
      that he put to use in speeches and official documents. His skill at
      coining apt descriptions made "synchronization" a catchword
      for organizing businesses to meet the challenges at the beginning of the
      21st century and made "constructively dissatisfied" a
      favorite of journalists for describing his management style. By going out
      into the field and listening to what customers said they wanted, he
      developed the

          . 
        


      principle that global markets should be run by the desires of the end
      customers in transactions. He was a gifted speaker, eloquent and quotable,
      who became an outstanding advocate of the globalization of business and of
      the free market system: "No development in the history of mankind
      has brought greater opportunity, greater prosperity, greater
      understanding, and greater hope for peace in the world than democratic
      market trade," said Eskew in a speech at the Town Hall of Los
      Angeles (April 10, 2002).
    

      INDUSTRIAL ENGINEER
    

      In 1972 Eskew received a BS in industrial engineering from Purdue
      University, and he sought employment in his native Indiana. He found work
      with UPS and was first assigned the job of redesigning parking lots so
      that more trucks could fit
       in them. He next conducted time-motion studies, working out the
      efficiency of the processes that brought parcels to, through, and out of
      UPS. At the time UPS served only 37 states and was working through complex
      legal requirements to serve more.
    

      In 1976 UPS began internal service within West Germany, and Eskew was sent
      there to oversee the development of the company's business in that
      country. In Germany he learned how to coordinate aircraft and truck parcel
      transfers while developing the skills he would need to establish
      guaranteed, on-time delivery to customers. In 1984 UPS created UPS
      Airlines and made Eskew its industrial engineering manager. He organized
      the airline's systems to make deliveries reliable, eventually
      creating UPS's Next Day Air service, which became a large part of
      the company's business. It was during his time at UPS Airlines that
      Eskew began developing his ideas for coordinating and tracking individual
      parcels. In the 1980s UPS packed parcels randomly in its delivery trucks,
      and drivers had to hunt through them to find which package to deliver at
      each address; Eskew eventually changed this costly procedure with
      supply-chain management. Probably of greater concern for his bosses during
      his time at UPS Airlines was the selection of aircraft; they trusted
      Eskew's judgment and put him in charge of buying the planes as well
      as of strategic planning and technology. By 1989, thanks in part to
      Eskew's efforts, UPS service was available in 180 countries and
      territories.
    

      Eskew completed the advanced management program at Wharton School of
      Business of the University of Pennsylvania in 1993, which gave him
      academic qualifications that may have helped him win promotions; it
      demonstrated his dedication to management. Also in 1993 UPS began offering
      logistics management to business customers, which was the beginning of its
      development of supply-chain management services. In 1994 Eskew was
      promoted to corporate vice president in charge of industrial engineering
      for UPS, as well as of logistics management services for clients.
    

      OPENING THE WORLD FOR UPS
    

      Eskew was named group vice president of engineering in 1996. He was in
      charge of all of UPS's engineering worldwide, and he supervised all
      development and maintenance of UPS sites and buildings. Already skilled at
      coordinating airline and truck pickups and deliveries, Eskew took on the
      responsibility of coordinating all of UPS's air and ground
      operations around the world. He was also given accountability for making
      UPS more environmentally friendly, and under his leadership the
      company's engineers experimented with schemes for cutting pollution
      from UPS's vehicles, including developing an engine that could run
      on corn oil; eventually new, cleaner diesel technologies won out over the
      other alternatives for engine design. Eskew focused much attention on
      finding ways to reduce the number of miles driven by UPS trucks, cars, and
      motorcycles, reasoning that fewer miles driven meant less pollution, as
      well as savings in fuel costs. In 1996 UPS grossed $22.4 billion and
      netted $1.15 billion, up from a gross of just $1 billion in 1972.
    

      A tough year followed 1996 because in August 1997, the International
      Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), representing about 200,000 UPS employees,
      went on strike for 15 days. The president of the IBT, Ron Carey, was up
      for reelection that year, and he called the strike as a way to rally union
      members behind him. UPS's business suffered as a result of the
      strike. Many customers switched their business to Federal Express and the
      United States Postal Service (USPS); UPS had won customers by claiming
      greater reliability than the USPS, but many former customers did not
      return after the strike. UPS lost $350 million in revenue to their two
      competitors.
    

      Eskew was elected to the board of directors for UPS in 1998, and he found
      himself in charge of UPS Capital, which provided financial services to
      clients. UPS's logistics coordination enabled company loan officers
      to know how much inventory a client had and to use that knowledge to
      secure loans with the client's inventory. It was a quick and
      efficient process that enabled businesses to get loans tailored to their
      immediate needs and to pay those loans back swiftly.
    

      SYNCHRONIZED COMMERCE
    

      In 1999 UPS created a new post especially for Eskew, that of executive
      vice president. Eskew remained in charge of engineering for UPS, and he
      was given new responsibilities, including corporate strategic planning. He
      also developed UPS's information services; he vigorously pursued
      the company's entry into Internet commerce. Further, he took charge
      of the UPS Logistics division. By being accountable for all these areas,
      Eskew had an overview of UPS's vast and diverse operations and saw
      links among them, inspiring him to add freight hauling and document
      delivery to the company's portfolio of services and to develop a
      new way of coordinating his various responsibilities into what he called
      "synchronized commerce."
    

      Synchronized commerce involved arranging all of UPS's processes so
      that each matched the others in perfect timing. The vision for the
      existing system had a UPS truck picking up a parcel at a given time, then
      delivering it for sorting at exactly the time there would be space for it.
      Next it would be put on a UPS aircraft just before the aircraft took off
      and then picked up by a truck at exactly the moment the aircraft landed.
      Finally, it would be delivered at a prearranged time. This process had had
      an enormous amount of waste in it because none of the elements had meshed
      with the others. Using the Internet, Eskew led the development of tracking
      services that enabled clients and UPS to know exactly where a parcel was
      at any given moment. This system saved clients millions of dollars in
      inventory costs because they did not need to store property for
       extended periods. They could arrange with UPS to have what they needed
      delivered to them just when they needed it, not earlier, and manufacturers
      could arrange through UPS to produce exactly what was needed, with nothing
      extra, for when they had buyers.
    

      In 1999 UPS went public with what was then the largest initial public
      offering in history. Its shares were inflated at $73 apiece because
      speculators overestimated UPS's initial value as an Internet
      company. The company grossed $29.8 billion for the year. When he was
      selected to be vice chairman in 2000, Eskew became the heir apparent to
      the CEO and chairman, James P. Kelly.
    

      With Eskew in charge of developing UPS's information systems, the
      company had spent between $11 billion and $15 billion on information
      technology between 1985 and 2000. Eskew wanted to use this infrastructure
      to interconnect businesses around the world. He wanted a small
      businessperson in Africa to be able to discover clients on other
      continents through UPS; he reasoned that such businesspeople would then
      use UPS to ship what they sold.
    

      Essential to Eskew's ambitions for UPS was the opening of Asian
      markets to the company's services, especially mainland China. He
      believed that world commerce was undergoing an epochal upheaval that would
      change how everyone did business and that globalization was an essential
      part of this revolution. He argued publicly that the changes would be the
      inevitable result of a universal human aspiration to be connected to other
      people. "Only elastic, adaptable corporations—and
      people—can survive this once-in-a-lifetime upheaval,"
      asserted Eskew in a press release (March 30, 2000). This belief led him to
      pursue what he called the "consumer-pull business model," in
      which end customers drove the marketplace through their demands for goods,
      which meant UPS would be best served by making sure that their end
      customers received what they wanted when they wanted it.
    

      During 2000 Eskew lobbied the United States Congress and the Chinese
      government to allow UPS Airlines to fly between the United States and
      China. In a rare convergence of interests, both Eskew and James P. Hoffa,
      the president of the IBT, lobbied Congress to approve the flights. Hoffa
      realized that expanding UPS business into China would result in more jobs
      for his membership. The lobbying worked; China and the United States
      granted UPS Airlines air rights for the transport of American and Chinese
      goods between the two nations. In 2000 UPS grossed $29.8 billion, while
      netting $2.93 billion. Eskew was paid $857,348 in salary and bonuses.
    

      The next year began well for Eskew and UPS. After years of working on the
      project, Eskew finally led UPS into hauling freight, using its
      synchronized commerce system to help manufacturers keep track of their
      inventories and to reduce the overhead incurred by storing unneeded items.
      On January 10, 2001, UPS ordered 60 planes from Airbus for flying to Asia.
      In August Kelly announced that he would retire from UPS on January 1,
      2002, and UPS's board of directors quickly named Eskew as
      Kelly's successor. Although Eskew noted that the world economy was
      flatlining, depressing sales of UPS's services, the creation of new
      business lines had so far enabled UPS to continue growing. This changed on
      September 11, 2001, when terrorists flew airliners into the World Trade
      Center in New York City, destroying the buildings and killing thousands of
      people.
    

      "I've learned to stay out of the way and let our folks run
      the system" (October 1, 2001), Eskew later explained to account for
      why Manhattan District UPS employees were able to organize themselves
      within a few hours after the disaster. Eskew and other executives had
      developed a corporate culture in which local managers were given the
      authority not only to respond to emergencies but to suspend UPS rules when
      they needed to. Within hours of the attack, UPS's tracking system
      accounted for all of their New York City employees and vehicles; four
      trucks had been crushed, but all employees, including those who worked in
      the towers, were accounted for and were put to work sorting parcels by
      hand.
    

      Eskew was now on top of UPS's worldwide operations and almost
      immediately began rearranging the company's services. There were
      many UPS Airlines craft in the air over America when the United States
      government ordered all aircraft grounded. The UPS airplanes landed in many
      unexpected places, their cargo far from where it was supposed to go.
      Normally, at any given moment, UPS delivered 13.6 million parcels,
      carrying 7 percent of America's gross national product, making its
      delivery services important to the functioning of America's
      economic engine. Using the tracking systems he had helped create, Eskew
      had his employees identify parcels and reorganize delivery schedules
      according to the availability of UPS trucks and other vehicles; those
      packages that could be delivered on the ground within three days were
      given top priority. Eskew reasoned that the government would allow UPS
      Airlines flights within one week and that they could then quickly
      transport the remaining parcels to their destinations. He proved to be
      correct. Meanwhile, workers in UPS's Manhattan District filled 27
      tractor trailers with parcels that could not be delivered to seven
      Manhattan zip codes. (Two of the zip codes no longer existed, and five
      others were inaccessible.) Using its synchronized system information, UPS
      identified intended recipients who had been murdered in the attack and
      then tracked down people or businesses who had legitimate claims to the
      Manhattan parcels; remarkably, all of them were delivered. UPS grossed
      $30.6 billion, while netting $2.4 billion for the year, a decline from
      2000 mostly attributable to a decrease in commerce because of the
      destruction of the World Trade Center. Eskew was paid $953,864.
    

      SUPPLY-CHAIN MANAGEMENT
    

      On January 1, 2002, Eskew became UPS's chairman and its ninth CEO.
      That year the company opened an aircraft hub in the Philippines to serve
      Asia; UPS had spent $200 million on the hub and on new aircraft to serve
      the distant continent. The company served 451 markets in over 200 nations
      and territories around the world.
    

      Eskew initiated a $45 million ad campaign, the biggest in UPS's
      history. He hoped to expand the company by offering new services to
      existing customers. UPS Capital began collecting payments for business
      clients from their clients' customers. This helped clients expand
      their businesses, which in turn meant more shipping business for UPS. The
      company put its synchronized commerce skills to good use in contracts with
      computer manufacturers to pick up and repair their customers'
      broken computers with as little as a 24-hour turnaround. In addition, UPS
      managed the inventories for many clients, decreasing their overhead costs.
      In an era of mistrust of corporations because of the misdeeds of the
      management at Enron, WorldCom, and other companies, Eskew took pride in
      maintaining transparent corporate finances, where anyone could find out
      where UPS's money was going.
    

      Eskew pushed hard for UPS to expand its supply-chain management, which he
      believed was a $3 trillion global market waiting to be tapped.
      UPS's strengths in shipping, parcel tracking, and synchronized
      commerce enabled it to find ways to reorganize client companies'
      supply chains, making them more efficient and enabling them to focus on
      their core businesses while UPS took care of the delivery of supplies and
      the transportation of their manufactured products. Eskew saw this as an
      important service to the business world because it could enable
      clients' expansions into new markets. UPS's supply-chain
      services were expected to grow 20 percent to 30 percent annually.
    

      Eskew became an outspoken proponent of global business, and he insisted
      that globalization was inevitable. To him, globalization satisfied a basic
      human need to be connected to other people, as well as the desire for
      economic opportunities and individual empowerment. He believed businesses
      should clarify what they meant by globalization and should help people
      hurt by the changes in old economies wrought by globalization. Further, he
      advocated regulation, believing businesses should be held accountable for
      their actions. For instance, the destruction of local environments because
      of business activity should not be tolerated.
    

      In January 2002 UPS and the IBT began negotiating a new contract. The
      issues were common ones: wages, benefits, and retirement funds. The IBT
      president, James P. Hoffa, did not wish to send business to nonunion
      companies such as Federal Express, but he did not wish to appear soft on
      UPS's management, either. The union represented 230,000 of
      UPS's 370,000 workers; that 60 percent of the drivers owned stock
      in the company was a strong point for UPS. Even so, Hoffa bargained hard.
      On July 16, 2002, UPS and the IBT agreed on a contract to be submitted for
      a vote to UPS's union members that gave them a 22 percent wage
      increase over the contract's six-year duration.
    

      In 2003 UPS invested $600 million to reorganize its delivery network in
      the United States. UPS Airlines had 265 aircraft, making it the ninth
      largest aircraft fleet in the United States and the eleventh largest in
      the world, carrying 1.2 million parcels per day of their total of 13.3
      million. The company grossed $31.3 billion.
    

      Eskew was appointed to the President's Export Council in 2002, and
      in 2004 he was elected chairman of the United States-China Business
      Council. On February 11, 2004, Eskew submitted his written recommendations
      for USPS reform to the Committee on Government Reform Special Panel on the
      Postal Service of the United States House of Representatives. Eskew
      worried about competing against a governmentsupported monopoly. He argued
      that the USPS should focus on delivering standard mail, first-class mail,
      and periodicals and leave most other services to public competition.
      Further, he wanted the USPS to have financial transparency so that its
      spending could be tracked and made more effective, that it not be allowed
      to use its subsidies to the detriment of private businesses, and that
      regulators be given more authority over how it conducted business.
    

      As for UPS, Eskew wanted the company to emphasize solutions instead of
      products; clients should be shown how UPS could solve some of their
      problems. Eskew believed that UPS was no longer best characterized as a
      delivery company but as a global commerce company because of the diverse
      services it offered. He said that UPS relied on the flow of orders, the
      flow of goods, and the flow of money; how well it managed these flows
      would affect how much it prospered. Even though the company's
      supply-chain services alone sorted 350,000 parcels per hour, he still
      wanted each parcel to be treated as if it were the only one UPS was caring
      for rather than as if it were one of many.

The Board of Directors of Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) has elected Michael L. Eskew, former chairman and chief executive officer of United Parcel Service, Inc.

Eskew, who served as chairman and chief executive officer of UPS from January, 2002 until December, 2007, brings over 35 years of global corporate management experience to the Lilly board. "We are very pleased to welcome Mike Eskew to the Lilly board," said Sidney Taurel, Lilly chairman and chief executive officer.  "His extensive management experiences and his outstanding track record of leadership in a customer-centered organization such as UPS ideally suit him to provide guidance and oversight to Lilly as it transforms itself into a truly patient- centered enterprise.  
Mike's experience as a board member of other leading American companies will also serve our company well." Eskew, 58, began his UPS career in 1972 as an industrial engineering manager.  After several global assignments with increasing responsibility, he was named corporate vice president for industrial engineering in 1993. In 1996 he became group vice president for engineering, and in 1998, he was elected to the UPS Board of Directors.

his current term, which ends on April 21, 2008.

Fisher is currently a senior advisor for Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, is the presiding director of General Motors Corporation, and is a director of Visant Corporation. "George has been an invaluable source of guidance and leadership during his time on the Lilly board, and he has served our company and its shareholders extraordinarily well during a very challenging period.  Both the company and I personally have benefited from his insights, and we thank him for his service to Lilly and wish him well," said Taurel. Lilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing portfolio of first-in-class and best-in-class pharmaceutical products by 
applying the latest research from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with eminent scientific organizations.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
