Central States Capital Markets, LLC Key Developments

Central States Capital Markets Agrees to Settle the Securities and Exchange Commission's Charges by Paying $289,827.80 in Disgorgement and Interest and an $85,000 Civil Penalty
Mar 15 16
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Central States Capital Markets, its CEO, and two employees for breaching their fiduciary duty by failing to disclose a conflict of interest to a municipal client. The case is the SEC's first to enforce the fiduciary duty for municipal advisors created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which requires these advisors to put their municipal clients‚Äô interests ahead of their own. According to the SEC‚Äôs order, while Central States served as a municipal advisor to a client on municipal bond offerings in 2011, two of its employees, in consultation with the CEO, arranged for the offerings to be underwritten by a broker-dealer where all three worked as registered representatives. The order found that Central States CEO John Stepp and employees Mark Detter and David Malone did not inform the client, identified in the order as the City, of their relationship to the underwriter or the financial benefit they obtained from serving in dual roles. Municipal advisors advise municipal and conduit borrowers about the terms of offerings, including interest rates, the selection of underwriters, and underwriting fees. In the three offerings, Central States collected fees from the City for the municipal advisory work and received 90% of the underwriting fees the City paid to the broker-dealer. The SEC's order found that Central States, Stepp, Detter, and Malone, breached their duty to the City by failing to disclose the conflict of interest. The order found that Detter and Malone were aware of the conflict and that Detter emailed Malone that Stepp, Detter, and Malone should resign as municipal advisor to serve solely as underwriter on the offerings. By failing to disclose their financial interest in the underwriting of the Citys offerings, Central States-the City's municipal advisor-and its employees deprived the City of the opportunity to seek unbiased financial advice, said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC's Enforcement Division. A municipal advisors first duty should be to its municipal client, not its own bottom line. Without admitting or denying the findings, Central States, Detter, Malone, and Stepp consented to the SECs order that they cease and desist from similar future securities-law violations and violations of Rule G-17 of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) that requires advisors to deal fairly with their clients. Detter, Malone, and Stepp also agreed to cease and desist from future violations of MSRB Rule G-23 that bars those acting as municipal advisors on a bond offering from underwriting that offering. Central States agreed to settle the SEC‚Äôs charges by paying $289,827.80 in disgorgement and interest and an $85,000 civil penalty. Detter agreed to settle the charges by paying a $25,000 civil penalty and agreeing to a bar from the financial services industry for a minimum of two years. Malone agreed to settle the charges by paying a $20,000 civil penalty and agreeing to a bar from the financial services industry for a one-year minimum. Stepp agreed to settle the charges by paying a $17,500 civil penalty and agreeing to a six-month suspension from acting in a supervisory capacity with any broker-dealer, investment adviser, or municipal advisor. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit members Sally Hewitt, Eric Celauro, Jason Howard, Jon Wilcox, Brian Fagel, and Deputy Chief Mark Zehner, with assistance from members of the SECs National Exam Program in the Chicago Regional Office, including Thomas J. Meier, Stephen G. Vilim, Ambar Freyre, and Thomas F. Murphy.

Capital One¬Æ Secured Mastercard¬Æ


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

Alfa Insurance


                                            I have (had) been with Alfa for 23 years. Over the course of the last few years, my premiums kept going up. $20 here, $30 there - well, this last time it went up over $200 with the new renewal. I have a perfect driving record- no tickets, no wrecks- and yet my insurance jumps up...show more
