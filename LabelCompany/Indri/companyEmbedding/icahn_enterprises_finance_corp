History[edit]
The Sands Casino Hotel in Atlantic City New Jersey and several of the adjacent lots were purchased for $274.8 million by Pinnacle Entertainment in November 2006.[3]
On April 23, 2007 it was announced that American Casino & Entertainment Properties was being sold to Whitehall Street Real Estate Funds, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs, for $1.3 billion.[3][4][5] The sale is subject to approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission and the Nevada State Gaming Control Board.
On September 17, 2007, American Real Estate Partners changed its name to Icahn Enterprises L.P. and its NASDAQ ticker symbol from ACP to IEP. The company remains a master limited partnership.
In February 2016, Icahn Enterprises purchased Trump Entertainment Resorts out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy, acquiring the Trump Taj Mahal resort casino in Atlantic City, N.J. Shortly thereafter, an agreement was announced for the Taj Mahal to be managed by another Icahn affiliate, Tropicana Entertainment.[6] Icahn also stated he would withhold a planned $100-million investment into the property if New Jersey approved casinos in the northern region of the state.[7]
On August 3, 2016, it was announced that the Trump Taj Mahal would be shut down permanently on October 10, 2016.

History[edit]
The Sands Casino Hotel in Atlantic City New Jersey and several of the adjacent lots were purchased for $274.8 million by Pinnacle Entertainment in November 2006.[3]
On April 23, 2007 it was announced that American Casino & Entertainment Properties was being sold to Whitehall Street Real Estate Funds, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs, for $1.3 billion.[3][4][5] The sale is subject to approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission and the Nevada State Gaming Control Board.
On September 17, 2007, American Real Estate Partners changed its name to Icahn Enterprises L.P. and its NASDAQ ticker symbol from ACP to IEP. The company remains a master limited partnership.
In February 2016, Icahn Enterprises purchased Trump Entertainment Resorts out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy, acquiring the Trump Taj Mahal resort casino in Atlantic City, N.J. Shortly thereafter, an agreement was announced for the Taj Mahal to be managed by another Icahn affiliate, Tropicana Entertainment.[6] Icahn also stated he would withhold a planned $100-million investment into the property if New Jersey approved casinos in the northern region of the state.[7]
On August 3, 2016, it was announced that the Trump Taj Mahal would be shut down permanently on October 10, 2016.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
