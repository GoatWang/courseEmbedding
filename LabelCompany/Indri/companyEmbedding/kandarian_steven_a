Insurance is a key component in helping you recover from accidents, disasters and lawsuits. At Kandarian Steven A, we have you covered. Our agents and support staff are here to give you the right insurance related advice based on your specific needs – helping you get the right coverage for you, your family and/or your business. While we can help you with almost any type of insurance, or guide you to the right partner of ours here are some of the key areas that most folk require insurance -

Home Insurance (including renters insurance, condo insurance) – every community and locality has specific needs. Some areas are more prone to fires, others to floods. Our agents understand the vagaries of homeowners insurance needed in the New York, NY area and we can help you get great insurance coverage for – fire protection, flood insurance, insuring valuables, and even personal umbrella insurance – coverage that gives you additional peace of mind.
Auto Insurance – in the vast majority of states it is illegal to drive without at the very minimum liability insurance coverage for a vehicle you drive. But, the nuances are different from state to state and in some cases county and city rules may require special consideration. Our agents can help you navigate the different auto insurance coverages, riders and recommend carriers, pricing and adequate coverage based on your specific needs.
Business insurance – every business has different needs. While all businesses need some form of liability insurance; professional services need additional E&O, there are specific needs for each and every class of business - for example construction/contractors may need specific coverage based on the location (New York, NY); and many blue collar businesses need special commercial auto insurance and workers compensation coverages.
Pick up the phone – call 800-633-4542, we would love to hear your story, give you some great insurance advice, and if you think we can get you some comparative quotes, we will use our expertise to your advantage.

Life and career[edit]
Kandarian grew up in West Hartford, Connecticut, the son of Lillian and Albert Kandarian. He graduated from William H. Hall High School and held several roles in private equity, including as founder and managing partner of Orion Partners, LP and executive director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.[3] He is a board member of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation and a member of the Financial Services Forum and the Economic Club of New York. He received a B.A. from Clark University, a J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center, and a M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.
MetLife[edit]
Prior to becoming CEO, Kandarian was MetLife's chief investment officer since April 2005. As CIO, Kandarian oversaw a number of initiatives that strengthened MetLife's investment portfolio, enhanced the company’s focus on effective risk management and contributed to the bottom line. [1] He is credited with preparing MetLife's portfolio prior to the 2007 recession, partly by anticipating the housing bubble and selling Stuyvesant Town—Peter Cooper Village in Manhattan in 2006.[4]
In his first three months as CEO, Kandarian expanded the company’s senior leadership team with the hiring of Frans Hijkoop to head human resources [5] and Martin Lippert to oversee global technology.[6] He also announced MetLife’s 25-year agreement to acquire the naming rights to the home of the New York Giants and New York Jets,[7] which is now known as MetLife Stadium.
In addition, Kandarian has also moved the company away from retail banking. On July 21, 2011, MetLife said the company would seek to sell its deposit banking business.[8] In announcing the move, Kandarian said it "was not appropriate for the overwhelming majority of our business to be governed by regulations written for banking institutions."[2] Three months later, MetLife said it would look to sell its residential mortgage lending business as well, saying the marketplace and regulatory environment for the business was uncertain and that the company needed to focus its resources on its global insurance and employee benefits businesses.[9]
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation[edit]
Kandarian is a former executive director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation[3], an agency of the United States Government. Kandarian was appointed to head the PBGC on Dec. 2, 2001, by Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao, announcing his departure in January 7, 2004 to return to his family in Boston. [4] He left on February 13, 2004.[5]
Protests[edit]
In May 2016, Kandarian became the target of protests by animal rights activists angered at MetLife's partnership with the New York Blood Center (NYBC), which abandoned 66 lab chimpanzees with no food and water on islands in Liberia. The chimpanzees, who were used by NYBC in invasive medical experiments for over the course of three decades, have earned the organization an estimated $500 million in royalties.[10] The protests, which have taken place at Kandarian’s home in Summit, NJ, and at the MetLife building in NYC, were staged after activists’ year-long attempts to meet with Kandarian and MetLife were rebuffed.[11] World renowned primatologist Dr. Jane Goodall has dismissed NYBC’s claim that the Liberian government should pay for the care of the chimps: "This seems irrelevant since NYBC was responsible for funding the acquisition of these chimpanzees, some of whom were taken from the wild after shooting their mothers”.[12]




Animal rights activists stage a demonstration at Kandarian's house on behalf of 66 Chimpanzees abandoned by the New York Blood Center.






Animal rights activists march through Kandarian's home suburb of Summit, NJ.

Steven A. Kandarian 




Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer

MetLife, Inc.
Steven A. Kandarian is chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), a leading provider of insurance, annuities and employee benefit programs to approximately 100 million customers in nearly 50 markets around the world. He became president and CEO on May 1, 2011 and chairman of the board of directors on January 1, 2012. For 2016, MetLife had $63.5 billion in revenue. The company ranked 42nd on the most recent FORTUNE 500®.
Kandarian joined MetLife in April 2005 as executive vice president and chief investment officer (CIO). From 2007 to 2012, he also led MetLife’s enterprise-wide strategy, which identified key areas of focus for the company. His direction contributed to MetLife’s global expansion and led to significant cost savings as well as efforts to address the insurance needs of the underserved U.S. middle market.
As CIO, Kandarian oversaw the company’s more than $450 billion general account portfolio and led a number of initiatives that strengthened the portfolio and contributed to MetLife’s bottom line. He enhanced the company’s focus on effective risk management and diversified MetLife’s investment portfolio, in part through the $5.4 billion sale of Peter Cooper Village/Stuyvesant Town in 2006. Under Kandarian’s leadership, MetLife identified the housing bubble early and reduced its exposure to sub-prime mortgage-backed securities, raised the overall quality of its corporate credit portfolio, and increased its focus on low loan-to-value commercial and agricultural mortgages. His efforts helped MetLife emerge from the 2008 credit crisis with the financial strength to complete the company’s $16.4 billion purchase of Alico.
From 2001 to 2004, Kandarian was executive director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). During his tenure, he made the public case for comprehensive reform of the pension funding rules to put the defined benefit system and the PBGC on a sound financial footing, helping to lay the groundwork for the enactment of the Pension Protection Act of 2006.
Previously, Kandarian was founder and managing partner of Orion Partners, LP, a private equity firm based in the Boston area. Earlier he was managing director of Lee Capital Holdings. He began his career as an investment banker with Houston-based Rotan Mosle, Inc.
Kandarian is a board member of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation, the Institute of International Finance, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Neuberger Berman and the Partnership for New York City. He is a member of the Business Council and the Business Roundtable. Kandarian earned his B.A. from Clark University, J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center, and M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.

Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries.
MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligations to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.
Edward A. Spehar - Head-Investor Relations, MetLife, Inc.
Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and our quarterly financial supplements.
A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.
Now let me call to your attention four new disclosures in our quarterly financial supplement this quarter. First, expenses and sales for our non-US businesses, Latin America, Asia and EMEA. Second, business segment returns on both allocated and tangible equity as discussed on our December outlook call. Third, operating earnings and premiums, fees and other revenues on a constant currency basis. And four, an earnings (02:30) table for corporate and other, which was previously only available in our 10-Q and 10-K filings. We believe these additional disclosures provide greater transparency for our businesses and address some of the questions that we have received from the investor community in the past.

Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report good results for the first quarter of 2015. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 4.8% from the first quarter of 2014. And operating earnings per share were $1.44, a 5.1% increase over the prior year period.
Growth in the quarter was dampened by broad-based weakness in foreign currencies. Premiums, fees, and other revenues, or PFOs, were essentially flat versus the prior year but up 4% on a constant currency basis. In Latin America, reported PFOs were flat versus the prior year but up 13% on a constant currency basis. And in Asia, reported PFOs were down 6% but up 6% on a constant currency basis.
Earnings were also negatively impacted by the strong dollar. Operating earnings grew 5% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis. We believe MetLife's global platform should deliver attractive growth and returns over time, but currency translation can be a source of volatility. The increase in operating earnings in the quarter was driven by business growth and a rebound in underwriting margins. As you may recall, underwriting margins were below normal in the prior year period.
Investment margins remain healthy in the quarter with an average investment spread of 211 basis points for U.S. product lines. However, the spread was at the low end of the 210 to 240 basis point range of the past few years. Margin pressure from low interest rates was only partially offset by variable investment income. Expenses as a percentage of PFOs continue to trend downward. The operating expense ratio was 23.5% in the first quarter versus 24.1% in the prior year period.
Our goal is to grow overall revenues at a faster rate than expenses, and we have sharpened our focus on expense control to help offset the drag on earnings in the current economic environment. However, we will not forego the investments necessary to become a more customer-centric company simply to boost GAAP earnings in the near term. Accordingly, we plan to reinvest $225 million this year to modernize the company's infrastructure and make it easier for customers to do business with us. We believe these improvements will generate additional savings and make customers more willing to recommend us to others.
Just as becoming customer-centric is a key element of our strategy, so too is growing sales of capital efficient, protection-oriented products. We made good progress on this initiative in the first quarter. For example, accident and health sales outside the U.S. increased by 24%. Involuntary accident and health and non-life product sales in the U.S. grew by 57%.
I would now like to discuss return on equity. Operating ROE was 11.7% in the quarter and tangible ROE was 14.4%. However, low interest rates and the impact of regulatory uncertainty in capital management are challenges for ROE going forward. I want to remind you what we have said over the past three years about return on equity and provide you an updated outlook.
We introduced our new strategic plan in May 2012 with a 2016 operating ROE goal of 12% to 14%. Since that time, we have provided sensitivities for ROE related to interest rates and share repurchases. We have said that persistent low interest rates would bring down our 2016 operating ROE to the low end of our 12% to14% range. Unfortunately, the 10-year Treasury yield has averaged 2.2% since May 2012 and our current plan assumes rates rising less than we initially assumed.

We have also said that our strategic plan contemplated $8 billion of share repurchases from 2012 to 2016 and that no buybacks over this period would reduce ROE by 100 basis points. We have been cautious on share repurchases because capital requirements remain unknown for non-bank, systemically important financial institutions. We have not yet seen draft capital rules, and there is no clarity on when those rules will be issued. As a result, it is likely that share repurchases will be substantially lower than we had assumed in our strategic plan.
In the first quarter, we completed the $1 billion buyback program announced in December 2014. As an opportunistic buyer, we took advantage of price weakness to aggressively repurchase shares at an average price of $49.56 per share. Given regulatory uncertainty, our overall approach to share repurchases remains conservative. Since May 2012, buybacks have totaled $2 billion, or one-fourth of the total contemplated in our 2016 ROE target.
Below-plan M&A activity has also had a negative impact on returns. The acquisitions we have made have contributed approximately $200 million to earnings, or half of what was contemplated in our strategic plan. MetLife has consistently been a disciplined buyer, and we will not relax our acquisition standards simply to boost ROE in the short term.
The 10-year Treasury yield has been hovering around 2%, the regulatory environment remains uncertain, and it is unlikely that M&A will contribute as much to earnings as we had hoped. With only eight months to go until 2016, we believe it is appropriate to reflect these realities in the ROE outlook. As a result, we estimate that MetLife's operating ROE will be approximately 11% next year. An 11% operating ROE would mean a return that is approximately 9 percentage points above the current 10-year Treasury yield.
A 9 percentage point spread over the 10-year would be close to the pre-financial crisis levels, while the quality of MetLife's ROE has improved, largely due to lower leverage and derisking in the U.S. business. Despite macro and regulatory challenges, we are optimistic about MetLife's prospects. This optimism is underscored by our board's willingness to increase the common stock dividend.
As you know, on April 28, we announced a 7% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend per share. With this increase, our annual common stock dividend will be $1.50 per share, and based on MetLife's current share price, the dividend yield will be 2.9%. We have now raised the common stock dividend for three consecutive years, resulting in a cumulative increase of 103%. Going forward, it is our goal to increase the common stock dividend as our earnings grow.
Turning to regulatory issues, I would like to begin by restating one of the core principles that guides our thinking on these matters. Simply put, it is that regulators should preserve a level playing field for all of the companies in the life insurance industry. Regulators in the United States and Europe correctly point out the virtues of competition in an antitrust context. We believe that same commitment to robust competition should apply to insurance regulation, and for the same reason. Competition provides consumers with the best products at the best prices.
We were pleased when the Federal Reserve recently made clear that it will develop a single capital standard for all of the insurance companies it supervises through a formal rule-making process. If the Fed had elected to establish prudential standards for insurers by order rather than by rule, the result could've been different orders for different companies, with potentially harmful effects on competition.
Developing capital standards through a rule-making process will address one threat to competition by holding all federally-regulated insurance companies to the same standard. However, there's still a risk that these additional capital rules for federally-regulated insurers will put them at a competitive disadvantage to companies regulated exclusively at the state level. So it will be important for regulators to ensure consistency across multiple and potentially conflicting capital regimes.

In closing, MetLife had a good quarter, especially considering the pressure from low rates and the strong dollar. Looking forward, we believe MetLife will continue to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns on equity.
Finally, I am pleased that we have been able to offer higher current income to shareholders by more than doubling our common stock dividend over the past three years.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses, and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.
Operating earnings in the first quarter were $1.6 billion and $1.44 per share, both up 5% from the prior year period and 10% on a constant currency basis. This quarter included one notable item in our P&C business. We had higher than budgeted catastrophe experience, partially offset by favorable prior-year development, which decreased operating earnings by $16 million, or $0.01 per share.
Adjusting for the notable items in both periods, as disclosed in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement, or QFS, operating earnings were up 6% year-over-year and 11% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were business growth and underwriting improvement, partially offset by lower variable and recurring investment income.
Turning to our bottom-line results. First quarter net income was $2.1 billion, or $1.87 per share. Net income was $490 million, above operating earnings in the quarter. Three items that explain most of this difference are, number one, derivative net gains of $394 million after-tax, which reflects changes in foreign currencies and gains from lower interest rates.
Number two, investment portfolio net gains of $113 million after-tax, as credit-related losses continue to be modest in the portfolio. And these were partially offset by, number three, charges of $35 million after-tax associated with insurance contracts and other market value adjustments. Of the total $490 million difference between operating earnings and net income, we attribute $455 million to asymmetrical accounting and noneconomic adjustments.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $50.45 at March 31, up 6% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $41.32 at March 31, up 9% year-over-year. With respect to first quarter margins, underwriting results improved year-over-year by approximately $0.05 per share after adjusting for notable items in both periods. This was primarily due to improved mortality and morbidity experience in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, or GVWB, as well as better underwriting in Corporate Benefit Funding.
These favorable results were partially offset by adverse claims experienced in Retail Life. Retail Life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 59.3%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 56.9%. Results this quarter were negatively impacted by higher than normal accidental deaths, particularly accidental falls, which we believe is related to this adverse winter weather. The Group Life mortality ratio, which now includes AD&D, was 90.7% in the quarter. This was favorable to the prior year quarter of 91.9%, driven primarily by lower Term Life claim severity.
The Group Life mortality ratio is seasonally high in the first quarter. Therefore, we would expect the mortality ratio to be toward the top end of the 85% to 90% annual range. The non-medical health interest-adjusted loss ratio, which now excludes AD&D, was 77.0%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 79.9% and at the low end of the targeted 77% to 82% range.

Dental had favorable margins compared to the prior year and plan due to lower utilization. We believe lower utilization was a function of adverse winter weather and anticipate some increase in utilization similar to what we saw last year. Disability was in line with the prior year period, and we expect improvement for the balance of the year.
In property and casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 89.3% in Retail and 101.2% in Group. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 79.4% in Retail and 89.7% in Group. The more favorable Retail P&C combined ratio reflects less exposure to the Northeast, which experienced particularly severe winter weather. Overall, P&C underwriting results were favorable versus the prior year due to lower non-CAT losses, partially offset by higher CATs.
Turning to investment margins, please note annuity spreads in the QFS are now based on total annuities. The total annuities spread, which includes deferred annuities and single-premium immediate annuities, better depicts investment margins for the business than our prior disclosure of deferred annuities only. While investment margins have been resilient, we have seen some modest decline in spreads. The average of the four U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 211 basis points in the quarter, down 17 basis points year-over-year and one basis point sequentially.
Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 181 basis points, down six basis points versus the prior year and two basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower variable investment income and core yields. Pre-tax variable investment income was $371 million, within our 2015 quarterly guidance range of $325 million to $425 million. After taxes and the impact of DAC, VII was $241 million, down $33 million versus the prior year due to weaker private equity returns, partially offset by higher prepays. Core yields declined as a result of the low interest rate environment. Average new money yields are running roughly 100 to 150 basis points below the average yield on assets rolling off the portfolio.
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.5%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 24.1% and slightly favorable to 23.6% after adjusting for a legal settlement with New York in the first quarter of 2014. Gross expense saves were $244 million in the first quarter and net saves were $180 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $31 million and one-time cost of $33 million.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Please note that our segment earnings in the current and prior year period reflected the changes discussed on our December outlook call. Retail operating earnings were $653 million, up 3% versus the prior year quarter and up 8% after adjusting for notable items. Growth in Retail was driven by favorable separate account performance in annuities and partially offset by unfavorable underwriting in Life.
Life and other reported operating earnings of $203 million, down 20% versus the prior year quarter and 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were tighter core spreads, higher corporate expenses, and lower closed block earnings. Underwriting, while below expectations, was only modestly unfavorable to the prior year quarter as adverse mortality and life was mostly offset by favorable P&C experience.
Life and other PFOs were $2.0 billion, essentially flat year-over-year as growth in the open block was partially offset by the runoff of the closed block. Core Retail Life sales were up 23% year-over-year, driven by increases in Whole Life and Term. The performance this quarter supports our view that Life sales bottomed in 2014.

Annuities reported operating earnings of $450 million, up 18% versus the prior year quarter and 22% after adjusting for excess variable investment income in the prior year. This strong performance was primarily due to separate account returns, which were 2.7% in the quarter and lower expenses. Variable annuity sales were flat year-over-year. As you know, we introduced our new VA-guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, on February 17. As the application process is typical for one month VAs, FlexChoice had little impact on first quarter results.
GVWB reported operating earnings of $228 million, up 20% versus the prior year quarter and 27% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in the quarter was driven by underwriting improvement in most products. GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 3% year-over-year, and sales increased 5% due to strong growth in voluntary products. Voluntary sales accounted for 16% of GVWB sales in the first quarter of 2015, and we would expect this percentage to grow from this level.
Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $369 million, up 9% versus the prior year quarter and 14% after adjusting for notable items. The key drivers were favorable underwriting and business growth. CBF PFOs were $543 million, up 27% year-over-year due to pension closeout and structured settlements. On closeouts, we continue to see a good pipeline of small to mid-sized cases.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $131 million, down 17% from the prior year quarter and 3% on a constant currency basis. Business growth and underwriting improvement were offset by lower inflation, higher taxes, and higher expenses in U.S. Direct. Latin America PFOs were $1 billion, essentially unchanged from the prior year quarter and up 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth across the region. Sales were up 11% on a constant currency basis, driven by Brazil, Mexico, and U.S. Direct.
Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $327 million, down 2% from the prior year quarter and up 8% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth. Additionally, effective April 1, 2015, the government of Japan enacted a tax reform plan that would lower the Japanese tax rate by approximately 2%. As a result, the company expects to record a one-time benefit of $170 million to $180 million, which includes an increase in Asia's second quarter operating earnings by approximately $60 million. In addition, we expect this tax law change will favorably affect our estimated annual effective tax rate for 2015 by approximately 0.2% as compared to 2014.
Asia PFOs were $2.2 billion, down 6% from the prior year quarter but up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth and solid persistency in core markets. Asia sales were 4% on a constant currency basis, driven by a 32% increase in accident and health sales in Japan.
In EMEA, operating earnings were $70 million, down 1% but up 35% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth as well as favorable underwriting and lower expenses, both of which were better than expected for the quarter. Going forward, we believe underwriting margins and expenses will be closer to expectations.
EMEA PFOs were $629 million, down 14% from the prior year period but up 2% on a constant currency basis. PFO growth was dampened by certain product and accounting reclassifications in 2014, which had no bottom-line impact to earnings but did impact the growth rate. Adjusting for that, underlying PFO growth was approximately 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong employee benefit sales in the last two quarters.
Total EMEA sales increased 14% on a constant currency basis due to strong growth in employee benefits and A&H sales. As Steve noted, we had strong growth in A&H. In the quarter, A&H sales outside the U.S. were $1.2 billion, which was 23% of total combined sales in Latin America, Asia, and EMEA.

I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.7 billion at March 31. This amount reflects the completion of our buyback program, the issuance of senior debt to fund an upcoming debt maturity, cash contributions to our life insurance captives, which we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, and the payment of our quarterly common dividend.
Turning to our capital position, the combined risk-based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies, excluding Alico, at year-end 2014 was 410%. Also, our Japan solvency ratio was 1036% as of December 31. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.2 billion and statutory net income was approximately $1.3 billion. Statutory operating earnings were up 53% from the restated prior year quarter, primarily due to separate account returns and improved underwriting. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $30 billion as of March 31, up 7% from December 31.
In conclusion, MetLife had a good first quarter. Investment margins remained healthy despite pressure from low rates. Expenses are well-controlled, and underwriting improved for the third consecutive quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong, and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

And our first question will come from Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to just ask some questions on the updated guidance, first, the new 11% guidance for 2016. In terms of a interest rate assumption, does this contemplate the 3.5% yield that you assume is part of your business plan for 2016, that you've laid out in the 10-K? Or does it assume flat interest rates through the end of the year – or through the end of 2016?

Hi, Seth. We've assumed lower rates, as I mentioned, than our original plan that we put out in 2012. For 2015, we're assuming 2.46% for the 10-year Treasury and for 2016, 3.11%.
Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thanks. And if we think about also M&A, you mentioned that accretion from M&A was roughly half of what was assumed back in that original plan. When we think about more limited M&A than what was planned, is this a function of the regulatory uncertainty or a function of availability of opportunities in the market?
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
The main thing is remaining a disciplined buyer. The regulatory uncertainty has some impact upon that as well, in the sense that, as a designated non-bank SIFI, we're mindful of considerations, in terms of that designation, related to our business model. So there's some things we'd probably be less likely to pursue in that environment than if that environment didn't exist.
But the main reason why we did not, to-date, acquire businesses with earnings of the $400 million we were assuming in our original plan of 2012, really relates to being a disciplined buyer, looking at the marketplace. We've reviewed a number of transactions that were of interest to us, but the pricing that was attractive to us to move forward on did not ultimately end up being the pricing that the transactions went for. They went for higher numbers. So that's the main driver there. And let me just mention, on the interest rate numbers I gave you, those were year-end assumptions for the 10-year Treasury.

Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thank you.

And our next question will come from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. My first question is just on capital deployment. And I think, Steve, you had mentioned last time on the call that you, given the regulatory uncertainty, might not consider doing an immediate buyback after the current one at the time had been completed. So now that it's done, what's your view on potential buybacks through the remainder of the year? Are you ruling those out, or would you still consider them at some point later this year?
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Jimmy, we have not made a decision yet as to whether or not we would do more share repurchases this calendar year. What I said before is that the most recent program was completed more rapidly than we anticipated, because we were buying more shares at – when the price of our stock was lower, below certain levels. So that program concluded more rapidly than we had anticipated, and we're going to take a pause for a while and reassess things further on in the year.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then, just one question on the Japan business. You had pretty strong sales in A&H. Can you discuss what drove this? Is it the new products you introduced last year, or something else? And to what extent do you view the results as an ongoing trend versus an aberration?
Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region
So, yes, Chris Townsend here. The A&H results for Japan were up 32%, and that helped lift all of Asia, from an A&H perspective, up 25% for the quarter. So we did bring in new products called Flexi Plus and Flexi Gold (34:08) a little over six months ago, and the performance has been very strong since we launched those products. So we expect to see continued good growth through the second and third quarter, but the fourth quarter will be more challenging from a comparison perspective, because we had a very strong fourth quarter 2014, given that we launched these products right at the start of that fourth quarter.
Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC

And our next question will come from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Good morning. Steve, just one question. Why the update on the ROE guidance right now? Is it simply you're close enough to 2016 or – I'm just curious, why now? That's the first question.
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Tom, I think you answered it. We are now only eight months away from the start of 2016. And we have more visibility, obviously, not only to this year, but our 2016 plan and, given where rates are, given our view of where rates are likely to be, given the M&A issue I'd mentioned before, given what's realistic in terms of share repurchases in the current environment related to our SIFI designation. As you rerun those numbers, staying in that 12% to 14% range, it doesn't look likely.
And certainly, analysts on the Street have already baked that into their projections for 2016 ROE. I think the average that we've seen out there is 11.1% for 2016 ROE for MetLife. So I think it's pretty well understood how the math works, given all these factors, most of which are not within our control here at MetLife.
Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Right. And I guess, Steve, that was going to be my point, too. I was just looking at where consensus numbers are, and I think most people have figured that out. So it clearly doesn't look like that estimates look out of whack. But the other question, just as a follow-up to that, did you say the interest rate assumption for year-end 2015 is 2.46% and year-end 2016 is 3.11%? Those are year-end figures?

Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I have to correct myself. Those are actually average 10-year rates.
Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. Those are average 10-year rates. And then, one, my follow-up is, I guess for Chris Townsend. Your strong Japan sales, particularly in A&H, was followed by – Aflac also had very strong A&H sales growth as well. Is the A&H market growing again? Or are you all taking share from the domestic competitors? Can you give a little color for what's happening there?
Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region
Sure. The products we launched were launched after fairly detailed customer insights, so they're pretty focused customer-centric products. They're effectively hospital cash products with a range of surgical benefits and the way they work is that we have some very low-cost options for certain types of customers and we have some products, which are more appropriate for the more discerning customer, which have some more specialized covers of.
So I think the products are fairly broad in terms of their offering, which helps to drive growth overall. So probably the market for the A&H business is growing at about 3% to 5% overall. So as have been indicated, we've got well-positioned products which we're distributing through that multichannel approach which we've spoken to you about previously.
Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. And not a sense for whether it's coming from share – share is being taken from the domestics or otherwise?
Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region
Yes, I think the market's grown probably about 3% to 5%. We're clearly outpacing that growth at the moment, but they're a new range of product. So we're comfortable with where we're at and we'll continue to drive pretty good growth out of these products for the rest of the year.

And our next question will come from Erik Bass with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Thank you. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about capital return relative to the free cash flow that you're generating? And should we view all free cash flow generated as being potentially available for redeployment? Or does your ROE guidance assume that there's some additional capital build at the holdco?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So this is John. And we view, ultimately, other than an appropriate buffer at the holding company when we find out what the capital rules are, that we will be living under, that that would be truly free cash flow. It is for common dividends, for buybacks or for acquisitions. So that's why we're quantifying that for you now on a regular basis, and once we finally know the capital rules, we can come up with an appropriate capital management plan.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Got it. But I guess your revised ROE guidance, does that assume that there is further capital build at the holdco?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
We are assuming a consistent conservative nature of capital in our projections.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. And then maybe one question just quickly on Latin America. Can you quantify the size of the loss related to the U.S. Direct business? And how we should think about the investment being made there in 2015?
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division
Sure. Erik, this is Bill Wheeler. So remember, our U.S. Direct business is now being reported inside the Latin American segment. And the total loss for the quarter was up about $6 million year-over-year, $5 million I guess. Just keep in mind that that's different. We've now – all the direct activities that MetLife was pursuing in the U.S. are now pulled together under one management organization and being reported in Latin America.

So that was a small reason for the decline in Latin American performance. But we expect losses in that segment as we're sort of investing in growth for the remainder of 2015. Sales growth is very good there, and we don't have the ability to capitalize the acquisition cost quite like we do in our more traditional businesses.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Got it. Would you expect the kind of expenses to continue at a similar run rate or increase as sales volumes pick up?
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division
My guess is, if anything, they'll decline a little bit in terms of – the acquisition costs will be steady, I think, throughout the year. But the bottom line losses will probably drop a little bit.
Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Thank you.

And our next question will come from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. The $225 million of reinvestment spend that Steve mentioned, is that in addition to the $400 million per year that you've already guided to? Or is that part of the $400 million?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
That is within – this is John. That was within the $400 million long-term that we're seeking for.
Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Got it. And then on the interest rate assumptions, you gave the 10-year assumption. I assume there's also some change in the shape of the yield curve which could impact your Corporate Benefit Funding business? Can you give any color there on what you're assuming?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
We haven't given exact details, but we are assuming a flattening of the curve. If you look at – we based most of this on consensus outlooks, and you see the short end coming up throughout the next 18 months or so, up to the end of 2016.
Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Got it. And then last one if I could just revisit the question I asked last quarter now that the year-end statutory statements are finalized, you've been talking about the statutory capital impact over the last couple of years from being domiciled in New York. Can you give us any more detail on what the cumulative statutory capital or RBC impact has been to MetLife from the stricter New York insurance rules?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure. This is John. For those of you who enjoy reading blue books, you'll see on page 19 of MetLife Insurance Company, there's a table that lists versus NAIC with the prescribed practices required by New York create the difference in reserves. And there's about a $1 billion difference between those two printed numbers.
However, if you look at, as we've analyzed the impact of New York and other requirements that they request we follow, the total number is actually $3 billion difference in statutory reserves. This would include about $700 million in reserves because of the fact we did not use life captives. So that's within that $3 billion. The other point I would tell you on this is that the $3 billion difference in statutory reserves has very little tax impact, not very tax effective reserves.
Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. Very helpful.

And our next question will come from Sean Dargan with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Thanks. Looking at the group non-medical health loss ratio, 77%, I'm wondering how LTC did within that business. Was the, I guess, underwriting performance in line or better than you would've expected?
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division
Sean, it's Bill Wheeler. Yes, LTC did perform better than expected. That was one reason that medical health overall loss ratio, 77%, was quite good. I think another, probably equally important reason is dental utilization. If you recall last year, the first quarter because of bad weather, we saw low utilization in the dental area, and then a catch-up for the remainder of the year. And I think it's going to happen the same way this year, where we saw low utilization because of poor weather, especially here in the Northeast. And there'll probably be a catch-up for the remainder of the year. So that's – look, I think the ratio would've been – the non-medical health ratio would've been good in any case. But these are the two factors that made it especially good.

Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Okay. And just one follow-up on LTC in terms of maybe some strategic options because you did write all that business out of a New York company and you're probably better reserved than most, and we saw a private capital transaction recently for an LTC block. Is this something that you would consider selling even if maybe the purchase price wasn't particularly high just to make it go away and never have to talk about it again?
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division
Well, I would never exclude anything. I wouldn't put anything off the table. But I don't think that's likely or in the cards. Our block is significant. That transaction was quite small. And there's a lot of – in terms of if you think about price increases that we've been asking for through the state regulatory process, we're having a lot of success there. That's helping the block become I think more attractive over time, and so there's a lot of state of play there. And I wouldn't expect us to leave that on the table and transact anytime soon.
Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.

And our next question will come from the Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So first question going back to the ROE target, the revised ROE target, now as it pertains to M&A, so I just want to clarify the $200 million of earnings as opposed to the $400 million that was expected, that is from M&A that was expected from 2012 on, so it has no bearing on the Alico acquisition or how that's performed?
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
That's correct.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay.
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
We were assuming $400 million of additional earnings by 2016 from acquisitions when we put the plan together in 2012.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And, Steve, you said that the non-bank SIFI designation has maybe dampened the appetite for some deals that you would've otherwise considered or some businesses you would've otherwise considered. Can you give us maybe a couple of examples of businesses that you find less attractive with this designation?
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I won't give you specific examples, but you can imagine things that would be considered in the process of designating a company as a SIFI, those kinds of factors went into our thinking in terms of what we would consider acquiring, and there were certain businesses and blocks of businesses that were for sale, particularly in the United States, that we were impacted by that factor.
Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And last question, Steve, given that the initial target of 12% to 14% by the end of 2016 has come up against a few headwinds that were clearly not foreseen in the beginning of 2012, have you and the board, have you had any discussions over the retirement age of 65, which I think would've probably brought to a change at the helm around the end of 2016? Have you considered maybe extending your tenure?
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
The policy you're referring to is a internal policy for senior management, executive management of age 65. Again, it's not in our bylaws, so it's something the board could waive if it chose to do so but no decisions have been made.

And our next question will come from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Hey. Thank you. Just on buybacks and kind of the regulatory piece. I understand the comments that your authorization's complete because you still are unsure what will happen with the rules. But I guess the question is, aren't things kind of going in the right direction? You got the Collins fix, the bank-centric draft rule that was a risk seems off the table now from the Fed. It seems like it's possible you're not going to know what these final rules are for some time, so I'd be interested in getting a sense of your increased confidence to maybe have to make decisions on capital deployment if you don't have kind of a final answer on the rules maybe by the end of this year.

Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
That has factored into our thinking to date. In other words, we had said we weren't going to do repurchases several years ago when SIFI designation was still being determined for us. And then because the rules were delayed in terms of being promulgated by the Fed, we took actions in two separate cases of each $1 billion of share repurchases. And we did that because the timeframe had shifted on us in terms of our expectations of knowing the rules.
So I've said this before, it's art more than science when you don't know what the numbers are going to be, and there's no indications that you can rely upon in terms of what the capital standards ultimately are that you live under. So we have taken I think a measured approach in terms of both share repurchases and the issuance of a higher dividend on our common stock in light of what you just said, which is the delay in the timing that we were all expecting for knowing the rules.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
But I guess the core of the question is, I mean do you think things are going in the right direction? Or are these wins with the Collins fix and kind of making progress with the Fed, is that not material enough to change your decision-making process?
Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
The amendment to Dodd-Frank that you're referring to that occurred in December of last year is encouraging. It gives the Fed the flexibility to write rules appropriate for the insurance industry, as opposed to their interpretation of the Collins Amendment, which they thought required them to use no less than bank standards, in this case Basel III standards, even on non-bank SIFIs. So that is encouraging. But all that does is give them the flexibility to write rules they think are appropriate for the insurance industry.
We don't know yet what that methodology will be. We don't yet know how those rules may differ from state rules that we live under today. We don't know yet how the rules they come up with may impact us differently than the state rules, because they may look at certain aspects of our balance sheet differently than the state rules than the ASC (51:53) rules look at those assets and liabilities today. So there's no way for us to really have a good estimate of the amount of capital we need to hold under a regime the Fed has yet to put out, even in draft form.
Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
All right. Thank you.

Our next question will come from John Nadel with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray
Hi. Thanks. I just had one quick question for you this morning. If we look at the core adjusted for unusual items in the annuities segment, the after-tax ROA, if I look back over the past maybe three, four, five quarters, it's been averaging somewhere in the low to mid-70%s. In 1Q, it's – I think if my calculation's correct, it's about 85 or 86 basis points. It's a huge stair-step. Just a question for you, what drove that? Is that sustainable? Is there some outcome there on the expense side or otherwise that we should believe is trendable from here?
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division
John, it's Bill Wheeler. So, I wouldn't think that that's a run rate, $450 million of earnings. And there's a couple reasons for that. Annuities had a number of smaller positive factors this quarter. One was separate account performance. Even though the S&P 500 growth was pretty modest this quarter, separate account performance was much stronger. The broader stock indexes did much better. The bond market did much better. Remember, a big percentage of our assets now in the separate accounts are actually fixed income.
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray

Yeah.
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division
So separate account performance was 2.4%, and that obviously helped. The second thing is investment spread, you noticed that actually picked up a little bit this quarter, and there were some, I would say, some more unusual investment income which we don't think is repeatable. But there's also – part of the reason the investment margins went up is, when we collapsed our variable annuity captive, or Bermuda captive last year, there was a pool of cash which is now being redeployed into longer-term investments. So yields are up, so that's part of the reason, but the other part is some investment earnings which are not sustainable. So I think the right run rate's a little lower than $450 million, but overall, the annuity business is performing pretty well.
John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray
Thanks very much.

And our next question will come from Humphrey Lee with Dowling Partners. Please go ahead.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Good morning, guys. Just a quick question on LatAm – in the press release, you mentioned that there's some earnings sensitivity to low inflation, and I was just wondering if you can help us to kind of quantify the impact of low inflation in LatAm, and how that affect the earnings outlook, if inflation remained low in the region?
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division
Yeah, so a little background here. Obviously, certain Latin America economies historically have been prone to high levels of inflation, and it's a risk that we need to take into account when we develop an investment strategy in those countries. Because in a couple of countries, we do sell longer-term immediate annuities, especially Chile. And so, in Chile, there is a portfolio of assets where the yields on the bonds is linked to the official inflation rate.
And the inflation right now in Chile is quite low, and so that means that the yield on those bonds is near zero, and the overall impact – it was actually probably the biggest driver of under-earning performance in Latin America, was this low-inflation phenomenon. I'm trying to get the exact number here. Well, it's roughly $8 million after-tax, is what it cost us, in terms of the inflation rate in Latin America. So, this isn't just a Chile issue, but it's mainly in Chile.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And then, in terms of the annuity sales outlook you talked about, there's a little bit of a timing issue when the FlexChoice product was being launched. How (56:30) the application process to date and the overall sales in the second quarter year-to-date, as you reported today, has been trending?
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division
Yes, so applications are good. The product is getting good market acceptance. We had forecast, in 2015, a pretty meaningful increase in our annuity business sales, and a piece of that growth was driven by FlexChoice. It wasn't the whole reason for growth, but it was a big piece of it. And so we're seeing apps trending, and we're seeing a lot of good sales coming out of that, and a lot of, I would say, recapturing of sales where our own sales force was selling third-party business and now, instead, they're using FlexChoice as their key living benefit rider product.
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
So, no change to your kind of 50% increase for 2015?
William J. Wheeler - President-American Division
We still think that's a good projection.

And our next question will come from Suneet Kamath with UBS.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could update us on what the current benefit you're getting from the interest rate hedges through – and investment income, and how are you thinking about that trending going forward?

John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Hi. This is John. We haven't given out that specific amount. I would say that they've held up quite well historically and into this year. We expect next year to see somewhat of a slight drop-off, but we have hedge protection on this going off well into the next decade, so into the early 2020s timeframe.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And then just one more on the ROE. I'm just trying to reconcile the interest rate sensitivity on the ROE to what you have in the 10-K? Maybe I'm not thinking about it right, but if I look at the business plan that you have in your 10-K and where the rates are versus a 2% 10-year Treasury assumption, it looks like a bigger decline, obviously, relative to your current lowered interest rate assumptions, but even if I use that 10-K sensitivity, it seems like you're pointing to an operating earnings impact of $5 million, which for a company of Met's size is de minimis. So I must be missing something on the interest rate sensitivity in terms of why it's putting so much pressure on the ROE.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Okay. So this is John. The 10-K update we give at the end of the year, and that's an outlook, what happens if rates stay kind of at a low level versus what we assume in our plan. Our plan had already been adjusted down, as Steve had indicated, to reflect a lower consensus already.
And the other thing that's going on there, which you'll see in the segment sensitivities is compared to our plan, which assumes a more flattening of the yield curve, which reduces sec lending earnings, the scenario that's given assumes a steeper yield curve so the long end stays down but so does the short end, and so that causes a net benefit compared to the plan. So you'll notice that in the sensitivities we give, and CBF is actually a positive in the rest of the plan. So there's really a combination of things. It's a lower long end rate in that sensitivity, but the lower short end rate is a net positive when it comes to the sec lending book of business.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And then just one quick follow-up for you, John. I think in response to Ryan's question when he was asking about being regulated by the New York regulator, I thought in your comments you had said that part of the differential is that you don't use life captives. Were you specifically referring to the VA or are you talking about XXX and AXXX as well?
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
That is not including any assumptions for variable annuity captives. It's only life insurance captives for AXXX and XXX.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. So you were just referring to the VA. In other words, the differential's not because you don't use life captives. You do use life captives.
John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
We are limited in New York as to how much we can do in life captives. So if we were a non-New York-domiciled company, we estimate that the statutory reserves could be $700 million lower by the use of captives for Universal Life and Term Insurance that takes into account XXX and AXXX reserves.
Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC

Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife First Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results in the business and the products of the Company and its subsidiaries.
MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the risks factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.
John Hall
Thank you, Greg and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's first quarter 2017 earnings call. On this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures.
Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of MetLife.com in our earnings release and on our quarterly financial supplement. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because of MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and that derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.
Joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of Senior Management.
After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven Kandarian
Thank you, John and good morning everyone. Last night, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $1.41up from a $1.20 per share a year ago. Overall it was a strong quarter across most business segments with favorable results from a variable investment income, expense management and underwriting. Equity markets which rose by 5.5% in the quarter as measured by the S&P 500 create a tailwind for earnings. Well, low interest rates in a strong U.S. dollar remain as headwinds.
Adjusting for notable items operating earnings were $1.46 per share, which compares to $1.31 per share on the same basis in the prior year period. Net notable items of $0.05 per share in the quarter including higher catastrophe losses, expenses to support our unit cost initiative, illegal settlement and a Penn Treaty guarantee fund assessment. These are offset in part by a retail life insurance reserve release.

As noted in my annual letter to shareholders. MetLife has a leading position in group benefits with a market share of 25% among the large employers. We are also experiencing strong growth in the mid-market and have over 40,000 small employer relationships. What we pioneered this business as century ago, we consider group benefits an avenue for future growth and highlighted the segment as one of our growth engines and our November Investor Day.
During the quarter sales of Group Benefits were up by 29% with strength across all market segments and product lines. Our national accounts sales were particularly strong especially among clients with more than 25,000 employees. We continue to invest in this business to create differentiated customer experiences, supported by strong enabling technology and leading data protection capabilities.
Over the years our group customers have put their confidence in us, because of our financial strength and strong service capabilities. Today they're also trusting us to protect claim privacy in an uncertain world.
The macroeconomic environment in the last eight years has affected our business units in different ways. Our group for example, is correlated to the health of the U.S. employment market. We have been able to grow premiums and fees in the group business at a compound annual rate to 4.5% over the past five years. Despite modest U.S. labor force and wage growth among large employers, all else being equal a stronger U.S. job market would drive faster growth in our Group Benefits business.
I have also made note of our shift away from capital intensive [indiscernible] Life Insurance in Japan. This decision was driven by our requirement for appropriate internal rates of return and payback periods for the products we sell. The shift in our product mix resulted in lower Japanese sales for most in 2016, but we have started to turn the corner, in the first quarter 2017, Japan sales grew by 8% which strengthened foreign currency denominated whole life as well as accident & health products. Although this is too early to declare a trend from a single quarter, we are pleased with the overall direction or sales transition in Japan.
MetLife's net derivative losses in the quarter totaled $602 million. With interest rates ending in the first quarter of roughly where they started, much of the derivatives loss were driven by strength in the U.S. equity markets and costs associated with executing the separation of Brighthouse Financial.
As part of a supplemental disclosure we've again included an exhibit that details that firm value movement of our derivative portfolio. As promised at meetings with investors throughout the first quarter, we are providing on this call an update on RemainCo MetLife hedging strategy. We refreshed our hedging strategy to protect free cash flow from both falling and rising interest rates. This was accomplished through a process that sought to optimize free cash flow, well balancing several key statutory economic and GAAP metrics. While the restructuring of the RemainCo hedge program is largely complete the program is dynamic. You actively monitor and rebound when market conditions warrant. John Hele offer more detail on this topic.
Moving to investments, variable investment income totaled $343 million in the quarter, of this amount $272 million is attributable to RemainCo MetLife, which is above the high end of the quarterly guidance range of $250 million provided our outlook call in December, private equity investments for the largest contributor to the outperformance. In addition, hedge fund returns improved significantly from a year ago.
In the quarter, our global new money yields stood at 3.34%, this comparison average rollout of 4.45% over the past four quarters. In the fourth quarter, our new money rate was 3.15%. Lower yields continued to pressure the life insurance industry.

I would now like to provide an update on our plan to separate a substantial portion of our U.S. retail business. Maybe you have asked whether the separation of Brighthouse Financial will still occur in the first half of 2017. Given the complexity of the transaction we do not believe we have the necessary approvals to complete the separation in that timeframe. The MetLife and Brighthouse Financial teams continue to work diligently with our regulators in all aspects of the disaffiliation. While we did not have an exact estimate of when that work will be complete. We are hopeful it will be in the coming months. Operationally the separation is proceeding on schedule and we have reached several important milestones.
In January, Brighthouse Financial began to operate as in Penn Treaty under MetLife. In March, most significantly Brighthouse Financial began doing business under its own name. In April, Brighthouse Financial launched its first broadcast advertising campaign called predictability. You may have seen some of the ads during March Madness, the Masters or on Squawk Box. And most recently, we finalized a form of financing for Brighthouse captive to hold you ULSG liabilities. This captive will aid Brighthouse's capital efficiency and reduce statutory capital volatility.
Looking ahead, the next regulatory milestone will be the declaration of a hearing date by the Delaware Department of Insurance. We remain confident that the separation will position both companies for success in the respective marketplaces. For MetLife the separation remains the cornerstone of our transformation to a company with lower market sensitivity in a higher and more sustainable free cash flow ratio.
Turning to regulatory matters, I would like to provide a brief update on the government's appeal of the court ruling that rescinded our status as a Systemically Important Financial Institution or SIFI. On April 21st the Trump Administration issued a memorandum directing the Secretary of the Treasury to report within 180 days of the SIFI designation process used by the Financial Stability Oversight Council or FSOC. On April 24th MetLife filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, asking the court to hold the appeal in abeyance until that report is complete.
As we said in our filing, we believe in abeyance will enable the new administration to determine whether any of FSOC's positions in this case should be reconsidered and whether it is appropriate for the government to continue pressing the appeal. The timing for a ruling on our emotion is at the discretion of the Court of Appeals.
Before I close, I want to update you on our share repurchase program. During the first quarter, we repurchased $858 million of our common shares. To date, we have bought back approximately $1.5 billion of our common shares, well roughly half of our $3 billion authorization that we announced in November 2016. We are on track to fully execute this authorization by year end 2017.
With that I will turn the call over John to discuss our Q1 financial results in greater detail.
John Hele
Thank you, Steve and good morning. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results including a discussion of our insurance underwriting margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.
In addition to our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement, last evening we released disclosure labeled 1Q 2017 supplemental slides. That addresses the net derivative loss in the quarter. I will speak to these slides later my presentation. We will continue to release additional supplemental slides when we have complex elements in a quarter.
Operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.5 billion or a $1.41 share. This quarter included five notable items totaling the negative $61 million that we highlighted in our news release and quarterly financial supplement.

First, unfavorable catastrophe experience net of prior year development in Property & Casualty, decreased operating earnings by $45 million, or $0.04 per share, after tax.
Second, Corporate & Other was negatively impacted by a guaranty fund assessment for the Penn Treaty insolvency and an increase in litigation reserves, which decreased operating earnings by $44 million, or $0.04 per share, after tax.
Third, expenses related to a cost initiative also in Corporate & Other decreased operating earnings by $21 million, or $0.02 per share, after tax.
Fourth, reserve adjustments primarily resulting from modeling improvements of individual life products, which increased operating earnings in MetLife Holdings by $34 million or $0.3 per share after tax.
In addition, activity related to separation resulted in an increase to operating earnings of $42 million in MetLife Holdings and offsetting $42 million decrease to operating earnings in Brighthouse Financial.
Finally, variable investment income was above the company's 2017 quarterly business plan range excluding Brighthouse Financial, increased in operating earnings by $15 million, or $0.01 per share, after tax, and the impact of deferred acquisition costs or DAC.
Adjusted for all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 11% year-over-year and 12% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis operating earnings adjusted for all notable items or $1.46 up 11% percent year-over-year and 12% on a constant currency basis.
Turning to our bottom line results. We had first quarter net income of $820 million or $0.75 per share. Net income was $726 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of net derivative losses of $602 million after tax. For more details about the difference between net income and operator earnings please reference Page 3 in our supplemental slide disclosure this quarter. Page 4 in the supplemental slides shows the attribution of the after tax derivative loss. As Steve noted, the derivative losses driven by strength in the U.S. equity market and the repositioning of our hedging strategies.
For the total company, the $602 million GAAP derivative net loss included, number one, $402 million or two thirds of the total for asymmetrical and non-economic accounting, which including cost to reposition to remain co-hedges to protect from changes in interest rates on a statutory basis. Number two, $139 million of VA hedge ineffectiveness primarily in Brighthouse Financial including the impact of the transition to their new hedging strategy, with number three, the balance of $61 million largely driven by other risks in VA embedded derivatives. The asymmetrical non-economic accounting it's a recurring feature under U.S. GAAP, as the derivative assets and mark-to-market, but a significant portion of MetLife's VA and life liabilities are not.
As Steve mentioned, we've made significant progress at RemainCo with protecting our statutory capital and thus free cash flow from future changes in interest rates. We have obtained further hedge accounting treatment on a statutory basis and restructured the hedges such that our free cash flow percentage is expected to stay within a 65% to 75% band on average over two years with a range of the 10 year Treasury rate from 1.5% to 4%.
As stated in the recently filed Form 10 Amendment, Brighthouse Financial has made significant progress in repositioning to its new strategy. This strategy targets hedging to the statutory measurement of CTE (95) while also holding a targeted buffer of $2 billion to $3 billion. The new hedges protect on the downside using a portion of buffer, but on the upside potential of the Brighthouse Financial. Brighthouse Financial believes this new strategy will reduce hedging cost overtime and improve statutory results.

Brighthouse Financial and MetLife share a common philosophy of preserving free cash flow to the hedging strategies and protecting statutory capital. But the circumstances of the companies are bit different. Brighthouse Financial is hedging to CTE(95), Brighthouse Financial has a greater concentration of variable annuity business than RemainCo and this capital measured better reflects Brighthouse Financial's business. This Brighthouse Financial maintains a large capital buffering it can retain some risk like a deductible reducing hedge costs. In contrast RemainCo has a more diverse business with a lower concentration in variable annuities and no longer rights new variable annuity business in the U.S.
Book value per share excluding AOCI other FCTA with $50.52 as of March 31st down 5% year-over-year primarily due to the impact of derivative losses as well as the actual assumption review in the second quarter of 2016. Tangible book value per share was $41.64 of March 31st down 6% year-over-year.
With respect to first quarter underwriting margins, total company earnings were lower by approximately $0.13 per share versus the prior quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting in Brighthouse Financial accounted for approximately $0.10 of the total decrease. This is primarily due to the previously disclosed impact from the loss of the aggregation benefit, in variable in universal life and the second quarter 2016 modeling changes.
Excluding Brighthouse Financial underwriting earnings were lower by proximately $0.03 per share year-over-year. This is primarily due to higher claim volumes in Mexico and the impact of DAC assumption change in the company's Chile pension business, as well as a one-time reserve adjustment in Japan. In the U.S. underwriting results were essentially in line with the prior year quarter.
The Group life mortality ratio was 86.9%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 85.7%, but below the midpoint of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. This is the second lowest, first quarter mortality ratio for Group life in 13 years only the first quarter of 2016 was lower.
MetLife Holdings interest adjusted benefit ratio for life products was $48.6% and $53.8% after adjusting for notable items discussed earlier. This result was favorable to the prior year quarter of 56.6% and in the low end of the targeted range of 53% to 58%.
Finally the Group nonmedical health interest adjusted benefit ratio was 79.9% favorable to the prior-year quarter of 81.2% and within the 2017 annual target range of 76% to 81%. Favorable underwriting results were primarily due to renewal actions and dental and lower new claims severity and disability.
Turning to investment margins, the weighted average of the three products spreads presented in our QFS was 165 basis points in the quarter, up 25 basis points year-over-year. Pre-tax variable investment income or VII, was $343 million, up $178 million versus the prior year quarter, driven by strong private equity and hedge fund performance. Product spreads excluding VII were 129 basis points this quarter, down 2% year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. Overall, higher investment margins in the quarter accounted for approximately $0.01 of EPS improvement year-over-year.
In regards to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 22.5% and 21.6% after adjusting for the notable items this quarter related to the Penn Treaty litigation reserves and the Company's unit cost initiative. The ratio was favorable to the prior year quarter of 23.8% primarily due to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group and expense efficiencies. Overall, better expense margins contributed approximately $0.08 of EPS improvement versus the prior-year quarter.

I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Group Benefits reported operating earnings of $174 million, up 37% and 34% adjustment for notable items in both quarters. The primary drivers were favorable expense margins and strong nonmedical health underwriting results.
Group Benefits operating PFOs were $4.3 billion, up 5% year-over-year, driven by growth across all markets. This is the high end of our guidance of 3% to 5% which excluded the loss of one large dental contract which will occur in the second quarter. Group Benefits sales were up 29% with growth across all markets. We saw our particular strength in the jumbo case market due to more core activity and higher closing ratios, while persistency continues to be favorable.
Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, reported operating earnings of $218 million, up 16% but down 1% after adjusting for notable items in the both quarters due to less favorable underwriting. RIS operating PFOs were $479 million, essentially unchanged year-over-year. While one 1Q tends to be the seasonally the weakest for PRT transactions we continue to see a good PRT pipeline and we expect 2017 to be an active year for transactions of all sizes. Our approach will continue to balance growth with an efficient use of capital.
Property & Casualty or P&C, operating earnings were $29 million, up 32% but down 3% after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. Elevated catastrophes net of prior year development reduced operating earnings by $45 million in both quarters. Nearly half of these cats were due to hail storm activity in northern Texas. We have taken steps to address this. And as a result of our homeowner policy count in this area has declined 18% year-over-year. We expect the pace of decline will accelerate to additional rate increases and management actions.
Our P&C combined ratio excluding cats and private development with 89.8% modestly better than the prior year quarter of 90.0%. We continue to see improvement in our non-cat auto results, which posted a combined ratio excluding cats in prior year development of 97.2%, well below the 100.7% in the prior year quarter. Lower auto claim frequency was partially offset by higher severity as repair costs continue to increase on technology-laden vehicles. We have been taking targeted rate increases in auto over the last 12 months of 7% to 8% and expect to take similar lead actions in the immediate future.
P&C operating PFOs were $875 million, down 1% year-over-year. Overall P&C sales were down 5% to due to price increases and management actions to drive value.
Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $295 million, down 3% from the prior year quarter and 4% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. Volume growth and lower expenses were offset by higher reserves and taxes due the change in the Japan effective tax rate.
Asia operating PFOs were $2.1 billion, up 3% and up 1% on a constant currency basis. PFO's included in the joint ventures and ownership was up 3% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were up 35% on the constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were up 8% driven by foreign currency life and accident & health growth. Other Asia sales were up 89% representing good growth in all markets, during particularly by China with the growth of our protection business through our professional agency channel as well as a large group case in Australia.
Latin America reported earnings of $143 million down 5% and down 8% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. The key drivers are less favorable underwriting due to higher claims in Mexico and the impact of an assumption change in a company's Chile pension business. Favorable market impact due to better yields in Mexico and time as well as volume growth will partial offsets.

Latin-America operating PFOs $916 million up 5% and 6% on a constant currency basis. Total sales for the region were up 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong employee benefit sales, particularly offset by lower pension sales in Mexico.
EMEA operating earnings were $75 million, up 19% and 34% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were favorable expense margins and volume growth. While unit cost improvement is ahead of plan a meaningful portion of the year-over-year decline expenses is related to timing and favorable items that are not expected to repeat in subsequent quarters. EMEA operating PFOs were $614 million, essentially unchanged from the prior-year period on a 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in Turkey as well as employee benefits in the UK and Egypt. Total EMEA sales increased 4% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see a favorable shift with higher margin products in the region.
MetLife Holdings, which primarily consists of our legacy retail and long term care runoff businesses, reported operating earnings of $385 million, up 44% and 12% adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were improves underwriting and market results. MetLife Holdings operating PFOs were $1.5 billion, down 8% mostly due to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group, which included the Company's affiliated broker dealer unit. As previously guided with operating PFOs declined by approximately 12% in 2017 versus 2016.
Corporate & Other, at an operating loss of $99 million compared to an operating loss of $190 million in the first quarter 2016. Adjusting for notable items in the current period, the operating loss of $30 million, this unusually low quarterly loss for Corporate & Other is primarily due to the incremental tax benefit of $151 million reflected in the earnings by source table at the bottom of Page 28 in the QFS. The incremental tax benefit is acquired by GAAP accounting rules to adjust the Company's overall consolidated queerly tax rate to equal the Company's annual projected effective tax rate. As a result it enables the consolidated tax rate to be consistent period over a period it causes Corporate & Other to fluctuate on a quarterly basis.
As with the Company's effective tax rate respected, we expected to be between 21% to 22% for 2017 down from 23% as previously guided, the primary reason is the benefit of non-U.S. operation rates lower than the U.S. tax rate of 35%. Brighthouse Financial operating earnings were $244 million down 25% and 17% of adjusting for notable items in both quarters. The key drivers of the earnings decline primarily related to the previously mentioned unfavorable, underwriting including $39 million a loss of the aggregation benefit and $10 million from the previously discussed 2Q 2016 modeling changes.
As a reminder Brighthouse Financial same results within MetLife's financial statements do not match the financial statements of Brighthouse Financial Inc. and related companies shown in the most recent Brighthouse Financial Form 10 due to accounting timing differences. Brighthouse Financial PFO's were $1.1 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the first quarter 2016.
Overall annuity sales are down 35% and life sales are down 54% mostly resulting from the suspension of sales through one distributor and lower sales in the MetLife Premier Client Group. Sales of the Company's index linked annuity product, Shield Level Selector remain strong in the first quarter 2017 at $455 million up 25% year-over-year.
I will now discuss the cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $3.8 billion at March 31st which is down from $5.8 billion at December 31st. This decrease reflects the net effects of share repurchases, payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses. Please note that first quarter cash at the holding companies include minimal dividends from our operating subsidiaries, and we expect operating subsidiary dividends to increase in the second quarter.

Consistent with our prior guidance. We expect MetLife to receive between $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion in dividends from Brighthouse Financial prior to separation subject to regulatory approvals. Next I would like to provide you with an idea on our capital position. Our combined risk based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies excluding Alico was 465% on an ASC basis at year end 2016.
For our U.S. companies preliminary first quarter statutory results were operating earnings of approximately $870 million and a net loss of $107 million. Statutory operating earnings were up 18% for the prior year quarter, primarily due to favorable underwriting and lower operating expenses. The net loss was primarily the result of losses underivatives.
We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $24.1 billion as of March 31st down 2% from $24.6 billion at December 31st. The decrease in statutory capital is driven by Brighthouse Financial with total adjusted capital or TAC reduced by $1.2 billion. This drop was a function of certain restructuring transaction to separation, which caused the reserves to be less responsive to equity markets in the quarter. Several restructuring and capitalization actions are expected to occur prior to the separation, which possibly impact in TAC. Many of these have been completed in the month of April.
As a result, Brighthouse Financial combined TAC has increased by approximately $1.5 billion since quarter end. On a pro-forma basis as of March 31st 2017 and to give effect to our restructuring and separation related transactions including those in April, we continue to estimate a buffer of approximately $2.1 billion above CTE (95). This result in a combined pro forma RBC ratio for Brighthouse Financial of approximately 650% as of March 31 2017. Further details will be included in the next amendment to the Form 10, which we expect to file in May. For Japan, a solvency margin ratio was 909% as of December 31st, which is the latest public data.
Overall MetLife had a strong first quarter in 2017. Highlighted by favorable impacts in equity markets, lower expenses and solid underwriting in the U.S. Top line growth was particularly strong with sales up 15% year-over-year for MetLife as a whole and 21% for MetLife on post-separation basis.
GAAP net income was negatively impacted by net derivative losses, two thirds of which were asymmetrical and non-economic. In addition, our cash and capital position remain strong, and we remain confident that the actions we are taking to implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow, and driving at long term and create long term sustainable value to our shareholders.
And with that I would turn it back to the operator for your question.
Question-and-Answer Session
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Q - Tom Gallagher
Good morning. Steve, just a question on the separation, you've mentioned the complexity that may delay the timing, just a question on that, do you still feel confident in the structure of the transaction, in terms of the dividends, the capital for each business or do you see the delay being more administrative complexity.
Steven Kandarian
Hi Tom, nothing changes in terms of our expectations other than the timing. In the timing I use the word months, I didn't use the word quarters. It is the complex transaction. We're working closely with our regulator. There's a lot of information to impart. We are working very diligently and providing information as fast as humanly possible. But it is a large volume of information and analysis that is going on.
So that's what's resulted in the expected delay from what our initial thought was, which was made many months ago, over many quarters ago in terms of expectations around timing once you get into these transactions and you see the complexity associated with them. You see what occurs in terms of the amount of work that has to get done to make sure that everything is detailed appropriately and headlines appropriately.

Tom Gallagher
Okay. Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then just a question on expenses to make sure I have had my head wrapped around these. So John, if I'm understanding the flow of the strategic expenses for RemainCo that would imply you still have another $260 million to $270 million left for the balance of the year. That would come through operating and corporate? That was my first question on expenses. And then also on Brighthouse, I just wanted to get a sense for how much of the kind of annualized $200 million increase in expenses this year is embedded in the 1Q result?
John Hele
The answer to your first question is yes, that's why you expect for the year and could you say the second question again, I quite get that?
Tom Gallagher
Yeah in the Form 10 it indicates Brighthouse expenses you're expected to go up $200 million in 2017 versus 2016 levels, and I just want to understand how much of that planned increase is embedded in the 1Q number. Is any of that or is a small amount just you know some indication of how much is in the 1Q number?
John Hele
Probably about $30 million of that is in Q1.
Tom Gallagher
$30 million on an annualized basis?
John Hele
No $30 million in the quarter, it's…
Tom Gallagher
In the quarter building to like $50 million quarterly run rate?
John Hele
Yeah, yeah.
Tom Gallagher
Okay, so little more than half. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.
Ryan Krueger
Hi thanks. Good morning. My first question was in regard to the changes you made to the derivatives program. Should we expect any impact to the to your ongoing benefit from some of the low interest rate hedges that would come through that would have been coming through operating earnings?
Steven Kandarian
There's not a material change to the benefit that we get from those hedges, of course rates are higher now so we get less benefit, but those are still essentially there.
Ryan Krueger
Okay. So no material change, other than the interest rates are moving. And then just secondly, coming into the year you had guided to $450 million to $650 million of corporate losses excluding the expense initiative costs. Does that change now that you lowered your consolidated tax rate outlook?
John Hele
Yeah, so we expect still to be within that range, but we do expect the lower tax rate for the year now.
Ryan Krueger
Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Jimmy Bhullar
Hi good morning. First, I just had a question on the derivatives losses. Obviously the derivatives loss declined significantly from 4Q, but was still relatively large. So I was a little surprised with the loss in interest rates and that rates were generally flat or lowered depending on which part of the curve you look at. So just wondering what caused that was that related to sales some of that depreciations or something else. And then how the GAAP loss in on the hedging program affected yours whether it had any effect on stat capital?
Steven Kandarian
So there's a few things going on Jimmy. First is although the 1-year Treasury dropped a little or almost flat quarter-to-quarter swap rates were up a little bit. So some noise from that that's asymmetrical on non-economic, but you get the GAAP noise from that, and you also had some strong equity market in the quarter and you've got some GAAP noise in that as well. We also as we pointed out had some hedge ineffectiveness in the quarter and that impacted the total GAAP net income.
Jimmy Bhullar
And then just in terms of the change is implemented I'm assuming you change from swaps to swaps and as you had discussed before, but is that correct and how if you can discuss some of the other changes that you have made and whether you changed the size of the hedge program whether made it bigger or smaller?

Steven Kandarian
We actually did a variety of things. We were able to get some more statutory hedge accounting for some types of derivatives by changing their technique and structure. We did move from two different instruments like that. And we have accomplished our primary goal of making stat couple of RemainCo less sensitive to changes in interest rates. And as you can see from the numbers and the breakouts RemainCo has less sensitivity across the board in terms of equities it is relatively insensitive.
I mean there's always movements and every time you look at these results every quarter there's a lot going on in a quarter when you have derivatives as well as variable annuities. There is the time decay of the derivatives is aging the portfolio your basis risk or otherwise is going to VA hedge ineffectiveness and all these get grouped together. So there are sensitivities going up and down we minimize that, but there always be some move movement here due to all these factors.
Jimmy Bhullar
Okay. And then lastly just you mentioned the strong sales in Asia and Japan. I think up to 8% to what extent do you view this as sort of a turn in their sales since the results had been pretty weak the last few quarters versus maybe some front selling related to the discount rate changes are going into effect in the second quarter?
Christopher Townsend
So let me touch, I'm Christopher Townsend here, so Japan sales were up 8% year-on-year and this driven primarily by cant see life sale growth were obliviously 1% as you know we made that shift from the end market volume for July the end of 2015, beginning of 2016, it's very strong growth in Asia is up 6%. So the foreign currency business now makes up about 70% of alternative life sales we think that fairly consistent at the mix going forward and as the number of our competitors have pulled the end life products and change pricing for the discount rate range.
We think Asia is being pushed towards a foreign currency life products and we're very well positioned to provide that given the distribution we've got, so we see that as a fairly interesting team we probably did benefit from around [indiscernible] product we repriced in April, and as you know for the reserve discount price in the financial year and we expect sales with the full often in the second quarter. Overall we're very comfortable in terms of Japan sales, but it's too early to sort of break that guidance at the moment.
Jimmy Bhullar
Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous. Please go ahead.
Erik Bass
Hi. Thank you. In Group benefits can you just talk about the competitive environment and where you're seeing the best opportunities and given relatively strong industry results in recent quarters you've seen any uptick in price competition?
Maria Morris
Hi this is Maria Morris. First of all I just want to say we were very pleased with our group sales results in 2017. It's a competitive market as you know it's always competitive. But having said that, I'd say that life and disability has been rational. We've seen a little bit more of intense competition in dental, especially down market, but overall we feel very comfortable with the market that we are in. You probably saw that we had strong growth and strong persistency. We've been able to get our renewal actions. And overall it's been a rational market.
Erik Bass
Got it. And then one thing to clarify just on the pace of buybacks, should we expect it to slow it all until you receive the dividend payment from Brighthouse and I'm assuming that $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion is contingent on the transaction being approved. And I guess also are there any restrictions to your being in the market around the time of the transaction?

Steven Kandarian
No we don't anticipate any change in the program that we put in place between our existing cash reserves and earnings. We believe we're on track for the program being completed by 2017.
Erik Bass
Got it. OK. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Sean Dargan
Thank you. And just to follow up on Erik's question around the share repurchase. As I understand it there was kind of a bright line test that RBC couldn't fall below 400% and it sounds like whatever happened with hedge losses in the first quarter didn't bring you close to that. But is that 400% applied to the statutory entities related to RemainCo or are all of the current MetLife?
Steven Kandarian
Well RBC as measured once a year and so were half of long term projections that we always knew that there's a lot of pluses and minuses as you do this restructuring unwinding reinsurance transaction to see the pieces moving back and forth and the Brighthouse 10 of RBC we haven't done the debt infusion yet from that. So there's a lot of moving pieces here, and you have to look and if take that into account we're strongly capitalized across the board for all our businesses.
Sean Dargan
Okay. That would be great, thanks. And then just on MetLife Holdings the results were stronger on a normalized basis than I would have thought. I mean broadly speaking should we think that in quarters and where just you have - you see favorable equity market performance that MetLife Holdings will not run off as quickly, as you guided to?
Steven Kandarian
Whether it's a block of VAs in MetLife Holdings. And so for equity markets we had better fees on an ongoing basis, and that will continue to be one of the factors.
Sean Dargan
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Nadel
Thank you, good morning. My question about the group insurance business, Steve, it's been a long time since and since I can remember you sort of starting off the conference call talking about or highlighting that business. Given your size and scale there particularly at the large case market is there anything beyond further economies of scale that you think you could gain from a large acquisition within that business line. And relatedly why do you think you're seeing more success particularly in the jumbo case market has competition declined there or have you just gotten a bit more aggressive.
Steven Kandarian
John the first part of your question, we always look at any opportunities out there in the marketplace. And the Group business is one of which we have a very favorable view going forward and it's been a strong part of our company for many decades. So if there's opportunities in the marketplace to make an accretive acquisition, we certainly be quite interested in looking at that. Maria you want to take the second part of the question?
Maria Morris
Sure in terms of where we've been investing in group insurance, I think we're seeing the benefits of our investment in our growth. So as an example, we've been investing in our voluntary benefit platform, and so we're seeing large groups as well as medium sized groups really gravitate toward carriers both for their core benefit programs and to offer voluntary benefits to their employees toward a carrier like MetLife where we're in a position to do that.
We've talked historically about benefiting as an example from the exchanges where we're in some cases the only non-medical carrier on the health exchanges and I think going forward the other place we really put investments in our ability to ensure that employee records are secure. So a lot of work in our security platforms that's been very helpful at market as we've look to bring on new Group life and disability business as well.

John Nadel
So Maria is it fair to say that when you talk about really strong growth in sales at the jumbo case market that a good chunk of that is actually voluntary not employer paid?
Maria Morris
It's actually both. I would say that we've had a very strong sales quarter up and down the market. So double digit growth in the jumbo market, but we've had high single digit growth in the regional market. And as you know smart market is actually not seasonally first quarter focused, but even there we've had strong growth. We've had growth in both our core business and our voluntary business, our voluntary business is up double digits from a sales perspective. So overall very strong sales quarter Group.
John Nadel
Thank you. And then a question for John, on the change in the hedging strategy implemented if both Brighthouse and RemainCo. Can you give us some senses to the duration of the program that you've put in place now and how often some of these hedges need to roll. I'm just trying to understand how the new instruments compare with some of the older hedges I'm not sure if you even still have them that had extended into the 2020s?
John Hele
So on RemainCo the duration is about the same and it's basically some longer term hedges mainly in that. Brighthouse is like a one to three year type restructuring of hedges that they're doing and they've made significant progress to get their hedging done now. So if you think about future sensitivities, we point out look at the Form 10 that was recently published. The sensitivity to VA as well as you ULSG in there and you can see both on a stat and a GAAP basis with expect to senses should be going forward.
John Nadel
No I understand that that disclosure is there, I was just trying to understand duration and you know maybe the risk of having to roll?
John Hele
So for balances is about one to three years.
John Nadel
Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath up from Citi. Please go ahead.
Suneet Kamath
Thanks. Just want to start with the stat capital, I guess it was down about a $1 billion from year end despite not taking any dividends out. So John can you just walk the mechanics in terms of why the capital was down?
John Hele
Is going down $500 million from $24.6 million to $24.1 million, and as I said most of those Brighthouse Financial and they had some of the restructuring costs, less sensitivity to the reserves. The total of CTE (95) which is what they're really hedging to in their strategy, is still as a buffer when we take into account all the transactions that will happen so on a pro forma basis, but as of March 31st you are seeing partway through the restructuring and all the steps that have to happen. So you've seen that sort of the low point and is - as I said in my script it's up significantly from March 31st and there will be a whole series of further that have to happen to get there. So we gave you sort of the pro forma view of it and expect to be in like a 650 RBC pro forma for all that as of - if all that had happened as of March 31.
Suneet Kamath
Okay. And just another question on the update Form 10 to the changes or that the debt to capital of Brighthouse is now going to be 25% and then CTE (95) buffer has gone from I guess around $3 billion, to $2 billion to $3 billion so can you just discuss why - what drove those two changes?
John Hele
So the first Form 10 all the calculations the values as well as all the core assumptions and projections were all done as of June 30th last year. And the updated Form 10 as of December 31st and things change a lot between June 30th and December 31st. So there's a series of changes and I think Brighthouse will be a dynamic company and how they manage their business. And that's the reason for that still strongly capitalized and will provide good value over time to shareholders.

Suneet Kamath
Okay and just one last clarification question if could on the 9% ROE target for Brighthouse. Is that the guidance for sort of out of the gate or is that more of a longer term expectation?
John Hele
I think what happens with Brighthouse is for the next little while it is about that type of range, because of just how kind of GAAP works and there - their key focus is to build up overtime to reduce the hedging cost to start getting cash out of the company. And that's the key focus is to run it mainly on statutory basis.
Suneet Kamath
Okay, thanks.
Operator
And your final question today comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.
Humphrey Lee
Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just to follow up on John does question regarding kind of the appetite for group market acquisition given your capital position like what like what size of the transaction would you be more comfortable doing it with kind of seeking external capital?
John Hele
Hi Humphrey. Well, first of all we certainly will have some capital in reserve for acquisitions, but please remember that we do acquisitions of larger size like the Travelers deal back in 2005 the Alico deal in 2010. We would access the capital markets for any funds necessary above and beyond we hold at the holding company. And it is just important to reiterate our philosophy on acquisitions they have to make sense strategically in terms of what we are planning for the company going forward direction in businesses we want to be in.
And second of all they have to be creative for shareholders and create shareholder value have to earn more than their cost of capital. And any point in time when there is an acquisition opportunity we look at the capital markets, which of course is to raise capital in all kinds of returns would expect from acquisition including synergies and we make a determination in terms of what we're willing to pay for that business.
Humphrey Lee
Got it. And then just a housekeeping question, do you have any updates regarding the dividends to offer in some of your debt cost right now?
Steven Kandarian
Well, we do not believe that this will be a factor going forward. We have steps that we can take if we need to adjust for this. So that's something that we can plan for if we need to execute it.
Humphrey Lee
Got it. Thank you.
Operator
And at this time there are no further questions. So I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Hall.
John Hall
