Description & Objective
Hawaiian Tax-Free Trust is a municipal bond mutual fund designed especially for Hawaii residents.
The Trust seeks to provide as high a level of current income exempt from Hawaii state and regular federal income taxes as is consistent with preservation of capital by investing in municipal obligations which pay interest exempt from Hawaii state and federal income taxes. To achieve this objective, the Trust will invest primarily in tax-free municipal obligations of investment grade quality – the kind of securities that finance schools, highways, airports, hospitals, and water and sewer facilities in Hawaii.
Hawaiian Tax-Free Trust does not hold Puerto Rico bonds.


Investor Profile►

Hawaii taxpayers who can benefit from income that is exempt from federal and state income taxes. For certain investors, some dividends may be subject to federal and state taxes, including Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Please consult your professional tax adviser. The Trust is not appropriate for tax-deferred retirement plans, such as IRAs.

How to Invest►

You may invest in any of the Aquila Group of Funds through your professional financial advisor at the public offering price as described in the prospectus, or by completing the Fund’s application. The Fund offers both Front-Payment Class Shares (Class A Shares) or Level-Payment Class Shares (Class C Shares). The maximum sales charge included in the offering price of Class A Shares varies by fund. Please see the prospectus for details, or fund-specific information on this site. Class C Shares do not have a sales charge, but do have a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) of 1% if a redemption occurs within the first 12 months of purchase. Class F, Class I, Class T and Class Y shares are available to investors only through a professional financial advisor or a financial institution. Before investing, carefully read about and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other information found in the Fund prospectus. The prospectus is available on this site and from your financial advisor, or by calling 800-437-1020.

How to Redeem►

You may redeem all or part of your investment on any business day at the next-determined Net Asset Value of the Fund’s shares after acceptance of your redemption request. You should be aware that investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. The prospectus outlines a number of different ways you may redeem your shares. A 1% contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) applies to Class C Shares redeemed within the first 12 months of purchase.

Disclosures
Performance data represents past performance, but does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate; shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the data presented. Class A shares have a maximum sales charge of 4.00%; Class C shares have no initial sales charge, but a 1.00% contingent deferred sales charge applies to Class C shares redeemed within 12 months of their purchase date. Class Y shares have no initial or contingent deferred sales charge. Class A MOP (maximum offering price) returns reflect deduction of the maximum 4.00% sales charge; Class A NAV returns do not reflect deduction of the sales charge and would be lower if that charge were reflected. Class C returns without CDSC do not reflect deduction of the 1% CDSC applicable in the first 12 months; if applied, the CDSC would reduce the performance quoted. 
Lipper rankings are based on total return without sales charge relative to all share classes of funds with similar objectives as determined by Lipper. Lipper ratings are not intended to predict future results, and Lipper does not guarantee the accuracy of this information. Lipper category is as of the quarter-end date indicated and may not accurately represent the current composition of the portfolio.
Before investing in one of the Aquila Group of Funds, carefully read about and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other information found in the Fund prospectus. The prospectus is available here, from your financial advisor, or by calling 800-437-1020.

Annual Tax Information

Disclosures
Data displayed represents past performance which does not guarantee future results. Due to market conditions, current yields may be higher or lower than the yields shown. The 30-Day SEC yield is a mutual fund’s yield, calculated as required by the SEC, based on the earnings of the fund’s portfolio during a 30-day period, divided by the offering price per share at the end of the period. This calculation reflects an estimated yield to maturity. It should be regarded as an estimate of the fund’s rate of investment income, and it may not equal the fund’s actual income distribution rate. The fund’s Distribution Rate is the percentage at which a mutual fund has distributed income to its shareholders. It is calculated by dividing a fund’s annualized dividend amount by its current offering price.
Before investing in one of the Aquila Group of Funds, carefully read about and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other information found in the Fund prospectus. The prospectus is available here, from your financial advisor, or by calling 800-437-1020.
Dividends for all bond funds (tax-free municipal and corporate) in the Aquila Group of Funds are declared daily and paid monthly. For shareholders who receive monthly dividends by check from BNY Mellon, the funds’ shareholder servicing agent, rather than having them reinvested in additional shares or directly deposited into a bank account, we make every attempt to have monthly checks consistently arrive by the first of each month. In order to facilitate this, payments are processed and mailed prior to month-end, with the exception of December, when the dividend is declared on the 31st for tax reporting purposes. If your needs have changed and you wish to alter your investment directive from cash to reinvest, or to receive your cash dividends more efficiently through direct deposit, please call your financial professional or the fund’s shareholder servicing agent at 1-800-437-1000.

Annual Tax Information

Disclosures
Data displayed represents past performance which does not guarantee future results. Due to market conditions, current yields may be higher or lower than the yields shown. The 30-Day SEC yield is a mutual fund’s yield, calculated as required by the SEC, based on the earnings of the fund’s portfolio during a 30-day period, divided by the offering price per share at the end of the period. This calculation reflects an estimated yield to maturity. It should be regarded as an estimate of the fund’s rate of investment income, and it may not equal the fund’s actual income distribution rate. The fund’s Distribution Rate is the percentage at which a mutual fund has distributed income to its shareholders. It is calculated by dividing a fund’s annualized dividend amount by its current offering price.
Before investing in one of the Aquila Group of Funds, carefully read about and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other information found in the Fund prospectus. The prospectus is available here, from your financial advisor, or by calling 800-437-1020.
Dividends for all bond funds (tax-free municipal and corporate) in the Aquila Group of Funds are declared daily and paid monthly. For shareholders who receive monthly dividends by check from BNY Mellon, the funds’ shareholder servicing agent, rather than having them reinvested in additional shares or directly deposited into a bank account, we make every attempt to have monthly checks consistently arrive by the first of each month. In order to facilitate this, payments are processed and mailed prior to month-end, with the exception of December, when the dividend is declared on the 31st for tax reporting purposes. If your needs have changed and you wish to alter your investment directive from cash to reinvest, or to receive your cash dividends more efficiently through direct deposit, please call your financial professional or the fund’s shareholder servicing agent at 1-800-437-1000.

Description & Objective
Hawaiian Tax-Free Trust is a municipal bond mutual fund designed especially for Hawaii residents.
The Trust seeks to provide as high a level of current income exempt from Hawaii state and regular federal income taxes as is consistent with preservation of capital by investing in municipal obligations which pay interest exempt from Hawaii state and federal income taxes. To achieve this objective, the Trust will invest primarily in tax-free municipal obligations of investment grade quality – the kind of securities that finance schools, highways, airports, hospitals, and water and sewer facilities in Hawaii.
Hawaiian Tax-Free Trust does not hold Puerto Rico bonds.


Investor Profile►

Hawaii taxpayers who can benefit from income that is exempt from federal and state income taxes. For certain investors, some dividends may be subject to federal and state taxes, including Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Please consult your professional tax adviser. The Trust is not appropriate for tax-deferred retirement plans, such as IRAs.

How to Invest►

You may invest in any of the Aquila Group of Funds through your professional financial advisor at the public offering price as described in the prospectus, or by completing the Fund’s application. The Fund offers both Front-Payment Class Shares (Class A Shares) or Level-Payment Class Shares (Class C Shares). The maximum sales charge included in the offering price of Class A Shares varies by fund. Please see the prospectus for details, or fund-specific information on this site. Class C Shares do not have a sales charge, but do have a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) of 1% if a redemption occurs within the first 12 months of purchase. Class F, Class I, Class T and Class Y shares are available to investors only through a professional financial advisor or a financial institution. Before investing, carefully read about and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other information found in the Fund prospectus. The prospectus is available on this site and from your financial advisor, or by calling 800-437-1020.

How to Redeem►

You may redeem all or part of your investment on any business day at the next-determined Net Asset Value of the Fund’s shares after acceptance of your redemption request. You should be aware that investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. The prospectus outlines a number of different ways you may redeem your shares. A 1% contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) applies to Class C Shares redeemed within the first 12 months of purchase.

Disclosures
Performance data represents past performance, but does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate; shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the data presented. Class A shares have a maximum sales charge of 4.00%; Class C shares have no initial sales charge, but a 1.00% contingent deferred sales charge applies to Class C shares redeemed within 12 months of their purchase date. Class Y shares have no initial or contingent deferred sales charge. Class A MOP (maximum offering price) returns reflect deduction of the maximum 4.00% sales charge; Class A NAV returns do not reflect deduction of the sales charge and would be lower if that charge were reflected. Class C returns without CDSC do not reflect deduction of the 1% CDSC applicable in the first 12 months; if applied, the CDSC would reduce the performance quoted. 
Lipper rankings are based on total return without sales charge relative to all share classes of funds with similar objectives as determined by Lipper. Lipper ratings are not intended to predict future results, and Lipper does not guarantee the accuracy of this information. Lipper category is as of the quarter-end date indicated and may not accurately represent the current composition of the portfolio.
Before investing in one of the Aquila Group of Funds, carefully read about and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other information found in the Fund prospectus. The prospectus is available here, from your financial advisor, or by calling 800-437-1020.

Data displayed represents past performance which does not guarantee future results. Due to market conditions, current yields may be higher or lower than the yields shown. The 30-Day SEC yield is a mutual fund’s yield, calculated as required by the SEC, based on the earnings of the fund’s portfolio during a 30-day period, divided by the offering price per share at the end of the period. This calculation reflects an estimated yield to maturity. It should be regarded as an estimate of the fund’s rate of investment income, and it may not equal the fund’s actual income distribution rate. The fund’s Distribution Rate is the percentage at which a mutual fund has distributed income to its shareholders. It is calculated by dividing a fund’s annualized dividend amount by its current offering price.
Before investing in one of the Aquila Group of Funds, carefully read about and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other information found in the Fund prospectus. The prospectus is available here, from your financial advisor, or by calling 800-437-1020.
Dividends for all bond funds (tax-free municipal and corporate) in the Aquila Group of Funds are declared daily and paid monthly. For shareholders who receive monthly dividends by check from BNY Mellon, the funds’ shareholder servicing agent, rather than having them reinvested in additional shares or directly deposited into a bank account, we make every attempt to have monthly checks consistently arrive by the first of each month. In order to facilitate this, payments are processed and mailed prior to month-end, with the exception of December, when the dividend is declared on the 31st for tax reporting purposes. If your needs have changed and you wish to alter your investment directive from cash to reinvest, or to receive your cash dividends more efficiently through direct deposit, please call your financial professional or the fund’s shareholder servicing agent at 1-800-437-1000.

Example


This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds.


The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods.� The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same. Six years after the date of purchase, Class C Shares automatically convert to Class A Shares. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover


The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual Fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund's performance.� During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 7% of the average value of its portfolio.


Principal Investment Strategies


Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the Fund's net assets will be invested in municipal obligations that pay interest exempt, in the opinion of bond counsel, from Kentucky income and regular Federal income taxes, the income paid upon which will not be subject to the Federal alternative minimum tax on individuals.� In general, almost all of these obligations are issued by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, its counties and various other local authorities; these obligations may also include certain other governmental issuers, such as American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.� We call these "Kentucky Obligations." These securities may include participation or other interests in municipal securities and variable rate demand notes.� A significant portion of the Kentucky Obligations in which the Fund invests consist of revenue bonds, which are backed only by revenues from certain facilities or other sources
and not by the issuer itself.� These obligations can be of any maturity, but the Fund's average portfolio maturity has traditionally been between 9 and 15 years.


At the time of purchase, the Fund's Kentucky Obligations must be of investment grade quality. This means that they must either





*
be rated within the four highest credit ratings assigned by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations or,








*
if unrated, be determined to be of comparable quality by the Fund's Manager, Aquila Investment Management LLC.





The Manager selects obligations for the Fund's portfolio in order to best achieve the Fund's objective by considering various characteristics including quality, maturity and coupon rate.


Principal Risks


You may lose money by investing in the Fund.� Following is a summary description of certain risks of investing in the Fund.


Market Risk. The market prices of the Fund's securities may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to general market conditions, such as real or perceived adverse economic, political or regulatory conditions, inflation, changes in interest rates, lack of liquidity in the bond markets or adverse investor sentiment.� When market prices fall, the value of your investment will go down.� In the past several years, financial markets, such as those in the United States, Europe, Asia and elsewhere, have experienced increased volatility, depressed valuations, decreased liquidity and heightened uncertainty.� Governmental and non-governmental issuers have defaulted on, or been forced to restructure, their debts.� These conditions may continue, recur, worsen or spread.� The U.S. government and the Federal Reserve, as well as certain foreign governments and their central banks, have taken steps to support financial markets, including
by keeping interest rates at historically low levels.� This and other government intervention may not work as intended, particularly if the efforts are perceived by investors as unlikely to achieve the desired results.� The Federal Reserve has reduced its market support activities and recently has begun raising interest rates.� Certain foreign governments and central banks are implementing or discussing so-called negative interest rates (e.g., charging depositors who keep their cash at a bank) to spur economic growth.� Further Federal Reserve or other U.S. or non-U.S. governmental or central bank actions, including interest rate increases or contrary actions by different governments, could negatively affect financial markets generally, increase market volatility and reduce the value and liquidity of securities in which the Fund invests.


Interest Rate Risk.� The value of your investment will generally go down when interest rates rise. A rise in rates tends to have a greater impact on the prices of longer term or longer duration securities.� Interest rates in the U.S. have been historically low, so the Fund faces a heightened risk that interest rates may rise.� A general rise in interest rates may cause investors to move out of fixed income securities on a large scale, which could adversely affect the price and liquidity of fixed income securities and could also result in increased redemptions from the Fund.� The maturity of a security may be significantly longer than its effective duration.� A security's maturity may be more relevant than its effective duration in determining the security's sensitivity to other factors such as changes in credit quality or in the yield premium that the market may establish for certain types of securities.


Credit Risk. If an issuer or obligor of a security held by the Fund or a counterparty to a financial contract with the Fund defaults or is downgraded, or is perceived to be less creditworthy, or if the value of the assets underlying a security declines, the value of your investment will typically decline.� Securities in the lowest category of investment grade (i.e., BBB/Baa) may be considered to have speculative characteristics.


Rating Agency Risk. Investment grade debt securities may be downgraded by a major rating agency to below investment grade status, which would increase the risk of holding these securities. In addition, a rating may become stale in that it fails to reflect changes to an issuer's financial condition. Ratings represent the rating agency's opinion regarding the quality of the security and are not a guarantee of quality. In addition, rating agencies are subject to an inherent conflict of interest because they are often compensated by the same issuers whose securities they grade.


Risks Associated with Investments in Kentucky and Other Municipal Obligations. The Fund may be affected significantly by adverse economic, political or other events affecting Kentucky and other municipal issuers in which the Fund may invest.� Continued economic recovery in Kentucky will be affected by, among other factors, employment growth and energy production, including the market for Kentucky coal, as well as by uncertainty related to Federal fiscal policy, slower growth in the global economy, geopolitical risks, and business and consumer uncertainty related to these issues.� Continued losses in mining-related jobs is an on-going concern.� Federal policies may significantly reduce the demand for Kentucky coal.� Municipal issuers may be adversely affected by rising health care costs, increasing unfunded pension liabilities, and by the phasing out of federal programs providing financial support.� Kentucky's retirement systems
are underfunded by about 58%, with a total unfunded pension liability of approximately $35 billion.� Unfavorable conditions and developments relating to projects financed with municipal securities can result in lower revenues to issuers of municipal securities, potentially resulting in defaults.� Issuers often depend on revenues from these projects to make principal and interest payments.� The value of municipal securities also can be adversely affected by changes in the financial condition of one or more individual municipal issuers or insurers of municipal issuers, regulatory and political developments, tax law changes or other legislative actions, and by uncertainties and public perceptions concerning these and other factors.� In recent periods an increasing number of municipal issuers have defaulted on obligations, been downgraded or commenced insolvency proceedings. Financial difficulties of municipal issuers may continue or get worse.

2/ Aquila Churchill Tax-Free Fund of Kentucky






Tax Risk. The income on the Fund's Kentucky Obligations and other municipal obligations could become subject to Federal and/or state income taxes due to noncompliant conduct by issuers, unfavorable legislation or litigation or adverse interpretations by regulatory authorities.


Liquidity Risk. The Fund may make investments that are illiquid or become illiquid after purchase.� Illiquid assets may also be difficult to value. If the Fund is forced to sell an illiquid security to meet redemption requests or other cash needs, the Fund may be forced to sell the security at a loss.� The Fund may not receive its proceeds from the sale of certain securities for an extended period (for example, several weeks or even longer).� In extreme cases, this may constrain the Fund's ability to meet its obligations (including obligations to redeeming shareholders).


Prepayment or Call Risk. Many issuers have a right to prepay their securities.� Issuers may be more likely to prepay their securities if interest rates fall.� If this happens, the Fund will not benefit from the rise in the market price of the securities that normally accompanies a decline in interest rates, and will be forced to reinvest prepayment proceeds at a time when yields on securities available in the market are lower than the yield on prepaid securities. The Fund may also lose any premium it paid on prepaid securities.


Extension Risk.� If interest rates rise, repayments of fixed income securities may occur more slowly than anticipated by the market.� This may drive the prices of these securities down because their interest rates are lower than the current interest rate and they remain outstanding longer.


Portfolio Selection Risk. The value of your investment may decrease if the Manager's judgment about the quality, relative yield, value or market trends affecting a particular security, industry, sector or region, or about interest rates, is incorrect.


Valuation Risk.� The sales price the Fund could receive for any particular portfolio investment may differ from the Fund's valuation of the investment, particularly for securities that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology.� Investors who purchase or redeem Fund shares on days when the Fund is holding fair-valued securities may receive fewer or more shares or lower or higher redemption proceeds than they would have received if the Fund had not fair-valued securities or had used a different valuation methodology.� The Fund's ability to value its investments may be impacted by technological issues and/or errors by pricing services or other third party service providers.


Redemption Risk.� The Fund may experience heavy redemptions that could cause the Fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.


Non-Diversification Risk.� The Fund is classified as a "non-diversified" investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"). Thus, compared with "diversified" funds, it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in obligations of a small number of issuers. In general, the more the Fund invests in the securities of specific issuers or issues of a similar project type, the more the Fund is exposed to risks associated with investments in those issuers or types of projects.� Also, the Fund may be more risky than a more geographically diverse fund.


These risks are discussed in more detail later in the Prospectus or in the SAI.


Fund Performance


The following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund's performance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual total returns for the designated periods compare with those of a broad measure of market performance. The Fund's past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available at www.aquilafunds.com or by calling 800-437-1020 (toll-free).


The Fund acquired the assets and liabilities of Churchill Tax-Free Fund of Kentucky (the "Predecessor Fund") on October 11, 2013.� As a result of the reorganization, the Fund is the accounting successor of the Predecessor Fund.� Performance shown for periods prior to October 11, 2013, is the performance of the Predecessor Fund.

Aquila Harmonizes Its Funds' Names and Refreshes Its Brand and Web Site
New Aquila Municipal Trust and Aquila Funds Trust seek to improve efficiency and enhance fund operations



















October 21, 2013 09:23 ET

 | Source: Aquila Group of Funds





New York, NY, Oct. 21, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  The Aquila Group of
Funds (Aquila) is pleased to introduce the results of a series
of initiatives designed to increase efficiencies in the
administration and oversight of its funds, enhance investor access
to its fund line-up, provide investors with new fund resources, and
boost its brand awareness.   
Following shareholder approval, five of its seven municipal bond
funds are now organized as a series of Aquila Municipal
Trust.  This structure is expected to make operations more
efficient and flexible, and simplify compliance monitoring. The
Aquila brand name is now included in the name of each fund in the
series.  The investment objectives, principal investment
strategies and investment management teams of each fund remain
unchanged. The funds within Aquila Municipal Trust are now known
as:
·         Aquila Tax-Free Trust
of Arizona
·         Aquila
Tax-Free Fund of Colorado
·         
Aquila Churchill Tax-Free Fund of Kentucky
·         
Aquila Narragansett Tax-Free Income Fund
·         Aquila
Tax-Free Fund For Utah

Aquila
Tax-Free Trust of Oregon (previously Tax-Free Trust of Oregon)
now also carries the Aquila brand name, although it is not a series
of Aquila Municipal Trust. And, Hawaiian
Tax-Free Trust, the largest and oldest municipal bond fund in
the Aquila Group of Funds, continues to operate under its same name
and structure.


Aquila Three Peaks Opportunity Growth Fund and Aquila
Three Peaks High Income Fund are now series of Aquila Funds
Trust. While the funds now operate under a new structure, their
respective investment objectives, strategies and investment
management teams remain unchanged.
"First and foremost we want investors and their financial
advisors to readily recognize the full range of funds we offer and
the opportunity, within our product line, to meet a range of
investment objectives.  Adding the Aquila brand name to our
municipal bond funds is an essential step in that direction,"
explained Diana Herrmann, CEO of Aquila Investment Management LLC,
advisor to the Aquila Group of Funds. "Establishing the new Aquila
Municipal Trust and Aquila Funds Trust series structures, should
provide efficiencies and enhanced services that we believe will be
significant for investors and their advisors."
Further, the company has updated and streamlined its investor
communication tools, including the Aquila Group of Funds web site
along with corporate and fund-related print communication. Both
mediums incorporate a clarified statement of the company's
identity, highlighting its distinguishing attributes, capabilities
and investment strategies, and integrate a fresh design of its
brand, which has been implemented across the fund family. 
Aquila's new web site, a major new element in the company's
efforts, features improvements in the layout and navigation, gives
greater visibility to the latest fund information, and provides a
platform for future communication enhancements.
"We believe our investors and their advisors will appreciate the
re-design of our web site.  While the appearance is fresh,
they will instantly recognize the Aquila brand, and the
improvements will make it easier for visitors to navigate the site
and find valuable information on our funds and insights from our
investment managers," said Marie Aro, co-president of Aquila
Distributors, Inc.  "The enhancements to our web site and
print materials more effectively represent our firm and our
investment capabilities. They will help us better interact with our
existing investors as well as establish new investor
relationships," she added.

The economic side effects of the student loan crisis

June 28 / Rick Rieder
A college degree is still a must today; those without higher education face higher unemployment rates and lower earnings power. But the high cost of a degree is discouraging, especially to those who cannot afford college without loans in the first place. This could leave some unprepared for the workplace, worsening the class divide. The student loan crisis is a hardship for much more than just the borrowers.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

4 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 4 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 160 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks as high a level of current income exempt from Oregon State and regular Federal income taxes as is consistent with preservation of capital.




Strategy



Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the fund's net assets will be invested in municipal obligations that pay interest exempt, in the opinion of bond counsel, from Oregon state and regular Federal income taxes, the income paid upon which will not be subject to the Federal alternative minimum tax on individuals. These obligations can be of any maturity, but the fund's average portfolio maturity has traditionally been between 6 and 16 years. The fund is non-diversified.


Risk



The municipal market can be affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Municipal funds carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) They also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Although state-specific municipal funds seek to provide interest dividends exempt from both federal and state income taxes and some of these funds may seek to generate income that is also exempt from federal alternative minimum tax, outcomes cannot be guaranteed, and the funds may generate some income subject to these taxes. Residency in the state is usually required for the state income tax exemption. Generally, municipal securities are not appropriate for tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average

This fund scores Below Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



The municipal market can be affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Municipal funds carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) They also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Although state-specific municipal funds seek to provide interest dividends exempt from both federal and state income taxes and some of these funds may seek to generate income that is also exempt from federal alternative minimum tax, outcomes cannot be guaranteed, and the funds may generate some income subject to these taxes. Residency in the state is usually required for the state income tax exemption. Generally, municipal securities are not appropriate for tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit  and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. The current yield reflects the current earnings of the fund, while the total return refers to a specific past holding period. The 7-Day Yield is the average income return over the previous seven days, assuming the rate stays the same for one year and that dividends are reinvested. It is the Fund's total income net of expenses, divided by the total number of outstanding shares and includes any applicable waiver or reimbursement.
7. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
8. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
9. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
10. Fixed Income StyleMap� StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit quality and interest rate sensitivity.  Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's holdings, are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
