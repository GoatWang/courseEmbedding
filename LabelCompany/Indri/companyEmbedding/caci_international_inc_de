(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  There are statements made herein which do not address historical facts and, therefore, could be interpreted to be forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. The factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include, but are not limited to, the following: legal, regulatory, and political change as a result of transitioning to a new presidential administration that could result in economic uncertainty; changes in U.S. federal agencies, current agreements with other nations, foreign events, or any other events which may affect the global economy; regional and national economic conditions in the United States and globally; terrorist activities or war; changes in interest rates; currency fluctuations; significant fluctuations in the equity markets; changes in our effective tax rate; failure to achieve contract awards in connection with re-competes for present business and/or competition for new business; the risks and uncertainties associated with client interest in and purchases of new products and/or services; continued funding of U.S. government or other public sector projects, based on a change in spending patterns, implementation of spending cuts (sequestration) under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), or any legislation that amends or changes discretionary spending levels under that act; changes in budgetary priorities or in the event of a priority need for funds, such as homeland security; government contract procurement (such as bid protest, small business set asides, loss of work due to organizational conflicts of interest, etc.) and termination risks; the results of government audits and reviews conducted by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency, or other governmental entities with cognizant oversight; individual business decisions of our clients; paradigm shifts in technology; competitive factors such as pricing pressures and/or competition to hire and retain employees (particularly those with security clearances); market speculation regarding our continued independence; material changes in laws or regulations applicable to our businesses, particularly in connection with (i) government contracts for services, (ii) outsourcing of activities that have been performed by the government, and (iii) competition for task orders under Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) and/or schedule contracts with the General Services Administration; the ability to successfully integrate the operations of our recent and any future acquisitions; our own ability to achieve the objectives of near term or long range business plans; and other risks described in our SEC filings.  Overview  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is provided to enhance the understanding of, and should be read together with, our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that appear elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  We derived 93.8 percent and 93.5 percent of our revenue during the six months ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, from contracts with U.S. government agencies. These were derived through both prime and subcontractor relationships.

We are a proven provider with decades of experience delivering start-to-finish investigation and litigation support, leveraging technology to help customers manage documents and acquire and present evidence from pre-filing investigation through complaint, discovery, and trial; then post-trial and appeals. With our American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors/Laboratory Accreditation Board (ASCLD/LAB) International-accredited computer and audio/video forensics lab, we analyze digital evidence to support criminal and civil investigations, litigations, and security inquiries. We offer scalable cloud hosting solutions that are stable, secure, and fast, with access to industry-leading e-Discovery tools.

We develop and manage logistics information systems as well as specialized simulation and modeling toolsets, and provide logistics engineering services.   Surveillance and Reconnaissance - CACI integrates surveillance and reconnaissance technologies into platforms that enhance individual and unit situational awareness, mobility, and interoperability, while supporting identification of potential targets and enhancing troop safety. We develop and integrate state-of-the-art surveillance and reconnaissance sensors into air and ground systems, leveraging our mission-customized software and electronics. We provide integration, development, and technical support services in support of military, intelligence, and homeland security missions throughout the U.S. and around the world. We have over 20 years of experience developing quick-reaction solutions for IC and DoD customers. We use system-of-systems engineering and integration, agile development and deployment, and end-to-end lifecycle support to deliver net-centric solutions that meet the needs of U.S. forces, combatant commands, the IC, DoD, the Department of Homeland Security, and other government agencies.  We continue to carefully follow federal budget, legislative and contracting trends and activities and evolve our strategies to take these into consideration. Since March 2013, the federal government has been operating under sequestration required by the BCA. Under sequestration, constraints on discretionary expenditures have taken place each of the government's fiscal years since 2013 and, unless the BCA is amended or repealed, will continue through the government's Fiscal Year 2025. At the end of October 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA) was passed and signed into law, raising the discretionary spending caps under the BCA by $50 billion and $30 billion in the government's Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017, respectively. Prior to the end of the government's Fiscal Year 2016, no appropriations legislation for the government's Fiscal Year 2017 was enacted. As a result, at the end of September 2016, a continuing resolution was signed into law, which kept the government operating until December 9, 2016. When Congress reconvened following the November general election, a second continuing resolution was passed and signed into law by the President that keeps the government operating until April 28, 2017. Subsequent to the inauguration of the new administration, Congress is expected to address the Fiscal Year 2017 budget and the funding of the government through September 2017. We expect the impact of the above legislation and actions Congress will take on contracts and task orders we hold, and may receive, to continue throughout our FY17.  We are continuously reviewing our operations in an attempt to identify those programs that are potentially at risk from the consequences of sequestration beyond the coverage of the BBA so that we can make appropriate contingency plans, should that be necessary. We are experiencing reduced funding on some of our programs, and may experience further reductions, but we do not expect the cancellation of any of our major programs.  We also continue to face some uncertainties due to the current general business environment, and we continue to see protests of major contract awards and delays in government procurement activities. In addition, many of our federal government contracts require us to employ personnel with security clearances, specific levels of education and specific past work experience. Depending on the level of clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain and competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense. In addition, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty, or to decide not to exercise options to renew contracts. Additional factors that could affect our federal government contracting business include an increase in set-asides for small businesses and budgetary priorities limiting or delaying federal government spending in general.

The table below sets forth revenue by customer type with related percentages of total revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively: Three Months Ended December 31, Change (dollars in thousands) 2016 2015 $ % Department of Defense $ 684,673 64.8 % $ 543,716 65.5 % $ 140,957 25.9 % Federal civilian agencies 308,053 29.1 232,773 28.0 75,280 32.3 Commercial and other 64,804 6.1 53,948 6.5 10,856 20.1 Total $ 1,057,530 100.0 % $ 830,437 100.0 % $ 227,093 27.3 %  For the three months ended December 31, 2016, total revenue increased by 27.3 percent, or $227.1 million, compared to the same period a year ago. This growth in revenue resulted primarily from the NSS acquisition completed February 1, 2016 and other recent acquisitions. Revenue generated from the date a business is acquired through the first anniversary of that date is considered acquired revenue. Excluding acquired revenue, organic revenue decreased by 4.7 percent primarily due to reduced customer requirements and government purchasing delays.  DoD revenue increased 25.9 percent, or $141.0 million, for the three months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period a year ago. This growth was primarily from the NSS acquisition. Excluding acquired revenue of $172.9 million, DoD revenue decreased by 5.9 percent primarily due to reduced customer requirements. DoD revenue includes services provided to the U.S. Army, our largest customer, where our services focus on supporting readiness, tactical military intelligence, and communications systems. DoD revenue also includes work with the U.S. Navy and other DoD agencies across all of our major service offerings.  Revenue from federal civilian agencies increased 32.3 percent, or $75.3 million, for the three months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period a year ago. This increase was primarily attributable to the NSS acquisition for information technology support services. Excluding the acquired revenue of $78.5 million, federal civilian agency revenue decreased by 1.4 percent. Federal civilian agency revenue also includes services provided to non-DoD national intelligence agencies.  Commercial and other revenue increased 20.1 percent, or $10.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period a year ago, primarily from our international and domestic technology services and cyber security products. This increase was attributable to increased product orders and managed services revenue from NSS and other acquisitions. Excluding acquired revenue of $14.7 million, commercial and other revenue decreased by 7.1 percent. Commercial and other revenue is derived from both international and domestic operations. Of the total commercial and other revenue, international operations accounted for 51.7 percent, or $33.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 68.4 percent, or $36.9 million over the same period a year ago due to growth of managed services business from acquisitions. Domestic operations accounted for 48.3 percent, or $31.3 million as compared to 31.6 percent, or $17.0 million over the same period a year ago due to increased technology and security product sales.  Income from Operations. The following table sets forth the relative percentage that certain items of expense and earnings bear to revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   Dollar Amount Percentage of Revenue Three Months Ended Three Months Ended December 31, December 31, Change (dollars in thousands) 2016 2015 2016 2015 $ % Revenue $ 1,057,530 $ 830,437 100.0 % 100.0 % $ 227,093 27.3 % Costs of revenue Direct costs 705,321 547,140 66.7 65.9 158,181 28.9 % Indirect costs and selling expenses 253,822 213,144 24.0 25.7 40,678 19.1 Depreciation and amortization 18,132 14,670 1.7 1.7 3,462 23.6 Total costs of revenue 977,275 774,954 92.4 93.3 202,321 26.1 Income from operations 80,255 55,483 7.6 6.7 24,772 44.6 Interest expense and other, net 12,325 8,180 1.2 1.0 4,145 50.7 Income before income taxes 67,930 47,303 6.4 5.7 20,627 43.6 Income taxes 25,510 16,851 2.4 2.0 8,659 51.4 Net income $ 42,420 $ 30,452 4.0 3.7 $ 11,968 39.3  Income from operations for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was $80.3 million. This was an increase of $24.8 million, or 44.6 percent, from income from operations of $55.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015. This increase was due to the acquisition of NSS and the absence of one-time transaction costs related to acquisitions that were incurred during the period ended December 31, 2015. Our operating margin of 7.6 percent for the period ended December 31, 2016 increased from 6.7 percent during the period ended December 31, 2015.  As a percentage of revenue, direct costs were 66.7 percent and 65.9 percent for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Direct costs include direct labor and other direct costs (ODCs), which include, among other costs, subcontracted labor and material purchases. ODCs are common in our industry and may vary from period to period. Direct labor was $324.5 million and $259.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in direct labor was primarily driven by the acquisition of NSS. ODCs were $380.8 million and $287.3 million during the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in ODCs was primarily driven by the acquisition of NSS which has a greater percentage of subcontract work partially offset by reduced customer requirements.  Indirect costs and selling expenses include fringe benefits (attributable to both direct and indirect labor), marketing and bid and proposal costs, indirect labor, and other discretionary expenses. Indirect costs and selling expenses increased $40.7 million or 19.1 percent comparing the three months ended December 31, 2016 to the three months ended December 31, 2015. This increase in indirect costs and selling expenses was primarily due to the NSS acquisition, and also fringe benefit costs related to increased direct labor.  Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.5 million or 23.6 percent for the three months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period a year ago. This increase was the result of additional intangible amortization and depreciation expense related to the NSS acquisition, partially offset by the run-off of amortization expense related to prior acquisitions.  Interest expense and other, net increased $4.1 million or 50.7 percent during the three months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period a year ago. The increase primarily relates to interest on $550 million of additional indebtedness incurred to fund the acquisition of NSS.  The effective tax rate was 37.6 percent and 35.6 percent during the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate during the three months ended December 31, 2016 was negatively impacted by losses from the change in value of assets invested in corporate owned life insurance (COLI) policies. The effective tax rate during the three months ended December 31, 2015 was positively impacted by gains from these policies. If gains or losses on these COLI investments throughout the rest of the current fiscal year vary from our estimates, our effective tax rate will fluctuate in future quarters of the year ending June 30, 2017.

History[edit]
CACI was founded by Herb Karr and Harry Markowitz, who left RAND Corporation in 1962 to commercialize the SIMSCRIPT simulation programming language.[3] The company went public in 1968.[1] "CACI," which was originally an acronym for "California Analysis Center, Incorporated,"[4] was changed to stand for "Consolidated Analysis Center, Incorporated" in 1967. In 1973, the acronym alone was adopted as the firm's official name; reflecting the name customers had grown familiar with. In 1975 CACI Limited was founded in the UK.

CACI grows largely through acquisitions of other IT companies.

Controversies[edit]
Abu Ghraib[edit]
On June 9, 2004, a group of Iraqis sued CACI International and Titan Corporation (now Engility)[40] in U.S. federal court. The plaintiffs, former detainees, allege that the companies directed and participated in torture, war crimes, crimes against humanity, sexual assault, as well as cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment at Abu Ghraib prison. The U.S. Government had hired CACI and Titan to provide interrogation and translation services at military prisons in Iraq.[41]
In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled in CACI’s favor in the lawsuit and ordered its dismissal.[42] The U.S. Supreme Court then declined to review that decision.[43] 
CACI employee Steven Stephanowicz and several military officers were investigated in the Taguba inquiry. A subsequent investigation of military intelligence operations at Abu Ghraib found that "contractors were involved in 36 percent of the [Abu Ghraib] proven incidents" and identified 6 employees as "individually culpable", but none have been prosecuted.[44]
CACI Response[edit]
According to CACI's website, "the company provided a range of Information Technology (IT) and intelligence services in Iraq. These services included intelligence analysis, background investigations, screenings, interrogation, property management and recordkeeping, and installation of computer systems, software and hardware. Only a small portion of these employees worked as interrogators." The company states that "no CACI employee or former employee has been indicted for any misconduct in connection with this work, and no CACI employee or former employee appears in any of the photos released from Abu Ghraib." CACI also adds that they "are no longer providing interrogation services in Iraq", which concluded in the early fall of 2005 upon the conclusion of a contract with the Department of the Army.
CACI also adds "nonetheless, we do not condone, tolerate or endorse any illegal behavior by our employees in any circumstance or at any time. We will act forcefully if the evidence shows that any of our employees acted improperly, but we will not rush to judgment on the basis of speculation, innuendo, partial reports or incomplete investigations."
CACI also claims on their website that U.S. Government reports generally "concluded that civilian interrogators performed their duties in an appropriate fashion and made a major contribution to the U.S. mission in Iraq." CACI further claims a March 2005 report by U.S. Navy Inspector General and Vice Admiral Albert T. Church shows that despite the publicity surrounding Abu Ghraib, "we found very few instances of abuse involving contractors."[45]
CACI Chairman of the Board Dr. Jack London[46] defended the company with a book: CACI: Our Good Name.
Lawsuit[edit]
In May 2008, four former Abu Ghraib prison detainees brought separate lawsuits in four U.S. courts against CACI and L-3 Communications as well as against three civilians. One of these former inmates, Emad al-Janabi, sued L-3 and CACI for allowing their employees to abuse him physically and mentally at the prison.[47] In a statement released on its website, CACI has stated that these lawsuits are "baseless" and they "reject emphatically this latest plaintiff's allegations and claims" calling on "numerous and thorough government investigations" in these allegations.[48]
On March 19, 2009, US District Judge Gerald Bruce Lee rejected claims by CACI that it could not be sued because its interrogators were performing duties prescribed by the contract with the U.S. government. CACI responded that it vowed to "pursue all of its legal alternatives to defend itself and vindicate the company's good name" and that "From day one, CACI has rejected the outrageous allegations against the company in this lawsuit and continues to do so."[49]
On September 11, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that CACI did in fact fall under U.S. military chain of command and thus had government contractor immunity.[50] Subsequently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reheard the appeal, with all active judges participating, and in an 11-3 decision held that the appeal was premature.[51] The action was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.[51]
On remand, the plaintiffs were able to conduct full discovery into their claims. After that discovery, the plaintiffs had not identified any evidence that showed that anyone affiliated with CACI had any contact with the plaintiffs. In June 2013, Judge Lee dismissed the suit due to lack of jurisdiction.[52]
On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit found that the lower court had erred in dismissing the suit in June 2013, as it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case because the alleged incidents occurred overseas.[53] The appellate court vacated the district court’s decision and remanded the case for a determination of whether plaintiffs’ claims were barred by the political question doctrine.[54] 
In June 2015, the U.S. District Court again dismissed the case against CACI, holding that CACI’s actions were controlled by the U.S. military and that assessing torture and war crimes claims would require impermissible review of the U.S. military’s judgment, and thus the issues in the case present a “political question” that the judiciary cannot appropriately answer.[55] 
In October 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reinstated the case.[56] The court concluded that CACI’s actions are protected from judicial review under the political question doctrine if they were lawful when committed and occurred under actual control of the U.S. military or involved sensitive military judgments.[56] The court remanded the case to the U.S. District Court to re-examine its subject matter jurisdiction as outlined in the U.S. Court of Appeal’s opinion.[56]

History[edit]
CACI was founded by Herb Karr and Harry Markowitz, who left RAND Corporation in 1962 to commercialize the SIMSCRIPT simulation programming language.[3] The company went public in 1968.[1] "CACI," which was originally an acronym for "California Analysis Center, Incorporated,"[4] was changed to stand for "Consolidated Analysis Center, Incorporated" in 1967. In 1973, the acronym alone was adopted as the firm's official name; reflecting the name customers had grown familiar with. In 1975 CACI Limited was founded in the UK.

Controversies[edit]
Abu Ghraib[edit]
On June 9, 2004, a group of Iraqis sued CACI International and Titan Corporation (now Engility)[40] in U.S. federal court. The plaintiffs, former detainees, allege that the companies directed and participated in torture, war crimes, crimes against humanity, sexual assault, as well as cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment at Abu Ghraib prison. The U.S. Government had hired CACI and Titan to provide interrogation and translation services at military prisons in Iraq.[41]
In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled in CACI’s favor in the lawsuit and ordered its dismissal.[42] The U.S. Supreme Court then declined to review that decision.[43] 
CACI employee Steven Stephanowicz and several military officers were investigated in the Taguba inquiry. A subsequent investigation of military intelligence operations at Abu Ghraib found that "contractors were involved in 36 percent of the [Abu Ghraib] proven incidents" and identified 6 employees as "individually culpable", but none have been prosecuted.[44]
CACI Response[edit]
According to CACI's website, "the company provided a range of Information Technology (IT) and intelligence services in Iraq. These services included intelligence analysis, background investigations, screenings, interrogation, property management and recordkeeping, and installation of computer systems, software and hardware. Only a small portion of these employees worked as interrogators." The company states that "no CACI employee or former employee has been indicted for any misconduct in connection with this work, and no CACI employee or former employee appears in any of the photos released from Abu Ghraib." CACI also adds that they "are no longer providing interrogation services in Iraq", which concluded in the early fall of 2005 upon the conclusion of a contract with the Department of the Army.
CACI also adds "nonetheless, we do not condone, tolerate or endorse any illegal behavior by our employees in any circumstance or at any time. We will act forcefully if the evidence shows that any of our employees acted improperly, but we will not rush to judgment on the basis of speculation, innuendo, partial reports or incomplete investigations."
CACI also claims on their website that U.S. Government reports generally "concluded that civilian interrogators performed their duties in an appropriate fashion and made a major contribution to the U.S. mission in Iraq." CACI further claims a March 2005 report by U.S. Navy Inspector General and Vice Admiral Albert T. Church shows that despite the publicity surrounding Abu Ghraib, "we found very few instances of abuse involving contractors."[45]
CACI Chairman of the Board Dr. Jack London[46] defended the company with a book: CACI: Our Good Name.
Lawsuit[edit]
In May 2008, four former Abu Ghraib prison detainees brought separate lawsuits in four U.S. courts against CACI and L-3 Communications as well as against three civilians. One of these former inmates, Emad al-Janabi, sued L-3 and CACI for allowing their employees to abuse him physically and mentally at the prison.[47] In a statement released on its website, CACI has stated that these lawsuits are "baseless" and they "reject emphatically this latest plaintiff's allegations and claims" calling on "numerous and thorough government investigations" in these allegations.[48]
On March 19, 2009, US District Judge Gerald Bruce Lee rejected claims by CACI that it could not be sued because its interrogators were performing duties prescribed by the contract with the U.S. government. CACI responded that it vowed to "pursue all of its legal alternatives to defend itself and vindicate the company's good name" and that "From day one, CACI has rejected the outrageous allegations against the company in this lawsuit and continues to do so."[49]
On September 11, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that CACI did in fact fall under U.S. military chain of command and thus had government contractor immunity.[50] Subsequently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reheard the appeal, with all active judges participating, and in an 11-3 decision held that the appeal was premature.[51] The action was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.[51]
On remand, the plaintiffs were able to conduct full discovery into their claims. After that discovery, the plaintiffs had not identified any evidence that showed that anyone affiliated with CACI had any contact with the plaintiffs. In June 2013, Judge Lee dismissed the suit due to lack of jurisdiction.[52]
On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit found that the lower court had erred in dismissing the suit in June 2013, as it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case because the alleged incidents occurred overseas.[53] The appellate court vacated the district court’s decision and remanded the case for a determination of whether plaintiffs’ claims were barred by the political question doctrine.[54] 
In June 2015, the U.S. District Court again dismissed the case against CACI, holding that CACI’s actions were controlled by the U.S. military and that assessing torture and war crimes claims would require impermissible review of the U.S. military’s judgment, and thus the issues in the case present a “political question” that the judiciary cannot appropriately answer.[55] 
In October 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reinstated the case.[56] The court concluded that CACI’s actions are protected from judicial review under the political question doctrine if they were lawful when committed and occurred under actual control of the U.S. military or involved sensitive military judgments.[56] The court remanded the case to the U.S. District Court to re-examine its subject matter jurisdiction as outlined in the U.S. Court of Appeal’s opinion.[56]

History[edit]
CACI was founded by Herb Karr and Harry Markowitz, who left RAND Corporation in 1962 to commercialize the SIMSCRIPT simulation programming language.[3] The company went public in 1968.[1] "CACI," which was originally an acronym for "California Analysis Center, Incorporated,"[4] was changed to stand for "Consolidated Analysis Center, Incorporated" in 1967. In 1973, the acronym alone was adopted as the firm's official name; reflecting the name customers had grown familiar with. In 1975 CACI Limited was founded in the UK.

Controversies[edit]
Abu Ghraib[edit]
On June 9, 2004, a group of Iraqis sued CACI International and Titan Corporation (now Engility)[40] in U.S. federal court. The plaintiffs, former detainees, allege that the companies directed and participated in torture, war crimes, crimes against humanity, sexual assault, as well as cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment at Abu Ghraib prison. The U.S. Government had hired CACI and Titan to provide interrogation and translation services at military prisons in Iraq.[41]
In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled in CACI’s favor in the lawsuit and ordered its dismissal.[42] The U.S. Supreme Court then declined to review that decision.[43] 
CACI employee Steven Stephanowicz and several military officers were investigated in the Taguba inquiry. A subsequent investigation of military intelligence operations at Abu Ghraib found that "contractors were involved in 36 percent of the [Abu Ghraib] proven incidents" and identified 6 employees as "individually culpable", but none have been prosecuted.[44]
CACI Response[edit]
According to CACI's website, "the company provided a range of Information Technology (IT) and intelligence services in Iraq. These services included intelligence analysis, background investigations, screenings, interrogation, property management and recordkeeping, and installation of computer systems, software and hardware. Only a small portion of these employees worked as interrogators." The company states that "no CACI employee or former employee has been indicted for any misconduct in connection with this work, and no CACI employee or former employee appears in any of the photos released from Abu Ghraib." CACI also adds that they "are no longer providing interrogation services in Iraq", which concluded in the early fall of 2005 upon the conclusion of a contract with the Department of the Army.
CACI also adds "nonetheless, we do not condone, tolerate or endorse any illegal behavior by our employees in any circumstance or at any time. We will act forcefully if the evidence shows that any of our employees acted improperly, but we will not rush to judgment on the basis of speculation, innuendo, partial reports or incomplete investigations."
CACI also claims on their website that U.S. Government reports generally "concluded that civilian interrogators performed their duties in an appropriate fashion and made a major contribution to the U.S. mission in Iraq." CACI further claims a March 2005 report by U.S. Navy Inspector General and Vice Admiral Albert T. Church shows that despite the publicity surrounding Abu Ghraib, "we found very few instances of abuse involving contractors."[45]
CACI Chairman of the Board Dr. Jack London[46] defended the company with a book: CACI: Our Good Name.
Lawsuit[edit]
In May 2008, four former Abu Ghraib prison detainees brought separate lawsuits in four U.S. courts against CACI and L-3 Communications as well as against three civilians. One of these former inmates, Emad al-Janabi, sued L-3 and CACI for allowing their employees to abuse him physically and mentally at the prison.[47] In a statement released on its website, CACI has stated that these lawsuits are "baseless" and they "reject emphatically this latest plaintiff's allegations and claims" calling on "numerous and thorough government investigations" in these allegations.[48]
On March 19, 2009, US District Judge Gerald Bruce Lee rejected claims by CACI that it could not be sued because its interrogators were performing duties prescribed by the contract with the U.S. government. CACI responded that it vowed to "pursue all of its legal alternatives to defend itself and vindicate the company's good name" and that "From day one, CACI has rejected the outrageous allegations against the company in this lawsuit and continues to do so."[49]
On September 11, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that CACI did in fact fall under U.S. military chain of command and thus had government contractor immunity.[50] Subsequently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reheard the appeal, with all active judges participating, and in an 11-3 decision held that the appeal was premature.[51] The action was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.[51]
On remand, the plaintiffs were able to conduct full discovery into their claims. After that discovery, the plaintiffs had not identified any evidence that showed that anyone affiliated with CACI had any contact with the plaintiffs. In June 2013, Judge Lee dismissed the suit due to lack of jurisdiction.[52]
On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit found that the lower court had erred in dismissing the suit in June 2013, as it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case because the alleged incidents occurred overseas.[53] The appellate court vacated the district court’s decision and remanded the case for a determination of whether plaintiffs’ claims were barred by the political question doctrine.[54] 
In June 2015, the U.S. District Court again dismissed the case against CACI, holding that CACI’s actions were controlled by the U.S. military and that assessing torture and war crimes claims would require impermissible review of the U.S. military’s judgment, and thus the issues in the case present a “political question” that the judiciary cannot appropriately answer.[55] 
In October 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reinstated the case.[56] The court concluded that CACI’s actions are protected from judicial review under the political question doctrine if they were lawful when committed and occurred under actual control of the U.S. military or involved sensitive military judgments.[56] The court remanded the case to the U.S. District Court to re-examine its subject matter jurisdiction as outlined in the U.S. Court of Appeal’s opinion.[56]

Controversies[edit]
Abu Ghraib[edit]
On June 9, 2004, a group of Iraqis sued CACI International and Titan Corporation (now Engility)[40] in U.S. federal court. The plaintiffs, former detainees, allege that the companies directed and participated in torture, war crimes, crimes against humanity, sexual assault, as well as cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment at Abu Ghraib prison. The U.S. Government had hired CACI and Titan to provide interrogation and translation services at military prisons in Iraq.[41]
In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled in CACI’s favor in the lawsuit and ordered its dismissal.[42] The U.S. Supreme Court then declined to review that decision.[43] 
CACI employee Steven Stephanowicz and several military officers were investigated in the Taguba inquiry. A subsequent investigation of military intelligence operations at Abu Ghraib found that "contractors were involved in 36 percent of the [Abu Ghraib] proven incidents" and identified 6 employees as "individually culpable", but none have been prosecuted.[44]
CACI Response[edit]
According to CACI's website, "the company provided a range of Information Technology (IT) and intelligence services in Iraq. These services included intelligence analysis, background investigations, screenings, interrogation, property management and recordkeeping, and installation of computer systems, software and hardware. Only a small portion of these employees worked as interrogators." The company states that "no CACI employee or former employee has been indicted for any misconduct in connection with this work, and no CACI employee or former employee appears in any of the photos released from Abu Ghraib." CACI also adds that they "are no longer providing interrogation services in Iraq", which concluded in the early fall of 2005 upon the conclusion of a contract with the Department of the Army.
CACI also adds "nonetheless, we do not condone, tolerate or endorse any illegal behavior by our employees in any circumstance or at any time. We will act forcefully if the evidence shows that any of our employees acted improperly, but we will not rush to judgment on the basis of speculation, innuendo, partial reports or incomplete investigations."
CACI also claims on their website that U.S. Government reports generally "concluded that civilian interrogators performed their duties in an appropriate fashion and made a major contribution to the U.S. mission in Iraq." CACI further claims a March 2005 report by U.S. Navy Inspector General and Vice Admiral Albert T. Church shows that despite the publicity surrounding Abu Ghraib, "we found very few instances of abuse involving contractors."[45]
CACI Chairman of the Board Dr. Jack London[46] defended the company with a book: CACI: Our Good Name.
Lawsuit[edit]
In May 2008, four former Abu Ghraib prison detainees brought separate lawsuits in four U.S. courts against CACI and L-3 Communications as well as against three civilians. One of these former inmates, Emad al-Janabi, sued L-3 and CACI for allowing their employees to abuse him physically and mentally at the prison.[47] In a statement released on its website, CACI has stated that these lawsuits are "baseless" and they "reject emphatically this latest plaintiff's allegations and claims" calling on "numerous and thorough government investigations" in these allegations.[48]
On March 19, 2009, US District Judge Gerald Bruce Lee rejected claims by CACI that it could not be sued because its interrogators were performing duties prescribed by the contract with the U.S. government. CACI responded that it vowed to "pursue all of its legal alternatives to defend itself and vindicate the company's good name" and that "From day one, CACI has rejected the outrageous allegations against the company in this lawsuit and continues to do so."[49]
On September 11, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that CACI did in fact fall under U.S. military chain of command and thus had government contractor immunity.[50] Subsequently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reheard the appeal, with all active judges participating, and in an 11-3 decision held that the appeal was premature.[51] The action was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.[51]
On remand, the plaintiffs were able to conduct full discovery into their claims. After that discovery, the plaintiffs had not identified any evidence that showed that anyone affiliated with CACI had any contact with the plaintiffs. In June 2013, Judge Lee dismissed the suit due to lack of jurisdiction.[52]
On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit found that the lower court had erred in dismissing the suit in June 2013, as it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case because the alleged incidents occurred overseas.[53] The appellate court vacated the district court’s decision and remanded the case for a determination of whether plaintiffs’ claims were barred by the political question doctrine.[54] 
In June 2015, the U.S. District Court again dismissed the case against CACI, holding that CACI’s actions were controlled by the U.S. military and that assessing torture and war crimes claims would require impermissible review of the U.S. military’s judgment, and thus the issues in the case present a “political question” that the judiciary cannot appropriately answer.[55] 
In October 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reinstated the case.[56] The court concluded that CACI’s actions are protected from judicial review under the political question doctrine if they were lawful when committed and occurred under actual control of the U.S. military or involved sensitive military judgments.[56] The court remanded the case to the U.S. District Court to re-examine its subject matter jurisdiction as outlined in the U.S. Court of Appeal’s opinion.[56]

History[edit]
CACI was founded by Herb Karr and Harry Markowitz, who left RAND Corporation in 1962 to commercialize the SIMSCRIPT simulation programming language.[3] The company went public in 1968.[1] "CACI," which was originally an acronym for "California Analysis Center, Incorporated,"[4] was changed to stand for "Consolidated Analysis Center, Incorporated" in 1967. In 1973, the acronym alone was adopted as the firm's official name; reflecting the name customers had grown familiar with. In 1975 CACI Limited was founded in the UK.

In June 2015, the U.S. District Court again dismissed the case against CACI, holding that CACI’s actions were controlled by the U.S. military and that assessing torture and war crimes claims would require impermissible review of the U.S. military’s judgment, and thus the issues in the case present a “political question” that the judiciary cannot appropriately answer.[55] 
In October 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reinstated the case.[56] The court concluded that CACI’s actions are protected from judicial review under the political question doctrine if they were lawful when committed and occurred under actual control of the U.S. military or involved sensitive military judgments.[56] The court remanded the case to the U.S. District Court to re-examine its subject matter jurisdiction as outlined in the U.S. Court of Appeal’s opinion.[56]
