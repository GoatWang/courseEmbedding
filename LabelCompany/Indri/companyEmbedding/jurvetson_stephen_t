 Venture TEAM
Steve Jurvetson
Partner

     









Purpose-driven companies deliver in the end much more value than money-driven ones.  								
  								Steve Jurvetson fosters companies at the forefront of technology. The smartest people in tech walk through DFJ's doors each day, and for Steve, it's like being a kid in a candy shop.

Fascination with technology started early for Steve, as a computer programmer in grade school and chip designer in college. As far back as he can remember, he has been passionate about the fringe ideas, the edge of complexity, and biological metaphors in information technology.

He looks for unconventional companies in deep learning, commercial space, synthetic biology, genomics, robotics, and sustainable transportation—purpose-driven companies that will transform massive industries.

His current board responsibilities include D-Wave, Flux, Mythic, Planet, SpaceX, Synthetic Genomics, and Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA). He was the founding VC investor in Hotmail (Microsoft), Interwoven (NASDAQ: IWOV), Kana (NASDAQ: KANA), and NeoPhotonics (NYSE: NPTN). Steve was also the first VC investor and board member at deep learning company Nervana, acquired by Intel in 2016. 

He always has a passion for the cutting edge of technology and the frontiers of the unknown. Steve has electrical engineering (BS and MS) degrees from Stanford, where he graduated number one in his class. He went on to earn an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business and was named an Arjay Miller Scholar. He then worked at leading companies like HP, Apple, NeXT Software, and Bain & Company.

On June 8, 2017, Steve received the Visionary Award from SV Forum for his role in fostering the spirit of entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley. In 2016, President Barack Obama announced Steve's position as a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship at the Seventh Global Entrepreneurship Summit at Stanford University. Steve has also been honored as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum, and as the Venture Capitalist of the Year by Deloitte. He was also chosen by the San Francisco Chronicle and San Francisco Examiner as one of "the ten people expected to have the greatest impact on the Bay Area in the early part of the 21st century." Forbes has recognized Steve several times on the Midas List, and named him one of "Tech's Best Venture Investors."

Here's Why Investor Steve Jurvetson Saved Elon Musk's Space Dreams

SpaceX
  founder Elon Musk.

Orlando
  Sentinel




  In 2008, Elon
  Musk was dead set on colonizing Mars, and building
  electric sports cars and just about broke. Steve
  Jurvetson was the venture capitalist who saved him.

  On Thursday night Jurvetson, a board member of both SpaceX and
  Tesla,
  talked about why he invested in Musk's companies when the
  entrepreneur was out of money and the rest of the world thought
  Musk was crazy.

  The answer: Jurvetson wants to fly to the moon.

  Jurvetson, who is a managing partner at 
  Draper Fisher Jurvetson, spoke at the prestigious Silicon
  Valley Churchill Club, a local tech-industry event series. He
  accepted the club's Game Changer award on behalf of SpaceX. 

  He was boyishly gleeful as he talked about SpaceX. His admiration
  for Musk and the SpaceX mission oozed.





  During an interview conducted by Internet pioneer Esther
  Dyson, Jurvetson dropped several tidbits.
Musk's original plan was to colonize Mars. He
  started building rockets because he thought it was crazy that
  rockets were not reusable. He had to solve the affordable-rocket
  problem before he could get to Mars.

  He's still planning on going to Mars.

  "SpaceX lowered the cost of going into space by 10x. The
  ministers of China say, 'We can't compete on price with that. In
  how many industries have you heard ministries of China say ever
  say that?" Jurvetson laughs.

  Musk thought that it would take $50 million to get his first trip
  to Mars. He was $200 million in and had "spent all of his money
  between that and Tesla and he went into personal debt" by 2008.
  Things were looking dismal.

  But Musk is the "most risk-immune person I've ever met," he says.
  "He's really an American hero, more than anyone I've ever met."

  Musk "called me around the darkest times," he remembers. "I was a
  believer all along, and just wanted my partners to let me invest
  in something this cool. I really like rockets."

  Jurvetson had invested in Musk's other company, Tesla Motors,
  which was proving electric cars could be green, stylish, and
  fast. Jurvetson is actually the owner of the first Tesla
  Model S, No. 1 off the production line.

  So, will he take a rocket flight? Absolutely.

  "But not the first or second," said Jurvetson. "I think that's
  crazy stuff." That line drew a big laugh from the audience.

  Jurvetson's dreams are simpler than Musk's. He doesn't want to go
  all the way to Mars, just a simple orbit around it. He thinks
  other people will want to do the same because a SpaceX flight
  should be affordable.

  "Putting seven people in orbit should not cost more than flying a
  commercial jet around earth," said Jurvetson, who argued it
  should actually cost less. "Go to the moon, that's my dream."

  Given that SpaceX was the first commercial entity to ever
  successfully dock with a space station, it seems pretty likely
  that dream will soon come true.

Early life and education[edit]
Jurvetson's father Tõnu Jürvetson fled Estonia through Germany just before Soviet re-occupation in 1944. Tõnu was married to another Estonian immigrant, Tiiu Tia Jurvetson. Even though within family Estonian language was used, Steve never learned it and his parents used it as a secret language between themselves.[9] Steve Jurvetson was the first non-European to become an e-resident of Estonia.[10]
Career[edit]




The first production Tesla Model S (with owner Tesla Board member Steve Jurvetson) in June 2015, three years after the car's market release.


Jurvetson graduated from Dallas's St. Mark's School of Texas in 1985. At Stanford University, Jurvetson finished his degree in electrical engineering in 2.5 years[3] and graduated No. 1 in his class. He then earned an M.S. in electrical engineering and an M.B.A., also from Stanford. His first job out of Stanford[11] was an R&D engineer at Hewlett-Packard. After two years at HP, he moved on as a product marketer at Apple and then NeXT Software.[12] As a consultant with Bain & Company, Jurvetson developed executive marketing, sales, engineering and business strategies for a wide range of companies in the software, networking, and semiconductor industries.[13] He first joined DFJ after his second year of business school, and became a partner after proving his talent on several investments.[14]
Jurvetson was named to Forbes' "Midas List" of Tech's Top Investors in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016.[13][15][16][17][18][12]
Deloitte named Jurvetson "Venture Capitalist of the Year" in 2012.[19]
Jurvetson was named to the MIT TR35 in 1999 for "recognize young entrepreneurs who can deliver", including making the first investment in Hotmail.[20]
Jurvetson and DFJ were early financial backers of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos and continue to be supportive of this controversial enterprise.[21]

U.S. market share was 100% in 1980, but dropped to 0% as the U.S. suppliers consolidated into a monopoly.  Now @SpaceX is the great revival.https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/885635670315642881 …

Early life and education[edit]
Jurvetson's father Tõnu Jürvetson fled Estonia through Germany just before Soviet re-occupation in 1944. Tõnu was married to another Estonian immigrant, Tiiu Tia Jurvetson. Even though within family Estonian language was used, Steve never learned it and his parents used it as a secret language between themselves.[9] Steve Jurvetson was the first non-European to become an e-resident of Estonia.[10]
Career[edit]




The first production Tesla Model S (with owner Tesla Board member Steve Jurvetson) in June 2015, three years after the car's market release.


Jurvetson graduated from Dallas's St. Mark's School of Texas in 1985. At Stanford University, Jurvetson finished his degree in electrical engineering in 2.5 years[3] and graduated No. 1 in his class. He then earned an M.S. in electrical engineering and an M.B.A., also from Stanford. His first job out of Stanford[11] was an R&D engineer at Hewlett-Packard. After two years at HP, he moved on as a product marketer at Apple and then NeXT Software.[12] As a consultant with Bain & Company, Jurvetson developed executive marketing, sales, engineering and business strategies for a wide range of companies in the software, networking, and semiconductor industries.[13] He first joined DFJ after his second year of business school, and became a partner after proving his talent on several investments.[14]
Jurvetson was named to Forbes' "Midas List" of Tech's Top Investors in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016.[13][15][16][17][18][12]
Deloitte named Jurvetson "Venture Capitalist of the Year" in 2012.[19]
Jurvetson was named to the MIT TR35 in 1999 for "recognize young entrepreneurs who can deliver", including making the first investment in Hotmail.[20]
Jurvetson and DFJ were early financial backers of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos and continue to be supportive of this controversial enterprise.[21]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
