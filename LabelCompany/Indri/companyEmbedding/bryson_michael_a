206 hip-hop | The Physics "'High Society" EP



New Physics EP. Download it on their blog for free. Physics are a chill laid back hip-hop group from Seattle, they are deffinatly like the "cool older brother" in the hip-hop game because of their mature sound, but they still like to joke around every now and again.

Art | Poster I made in my Social Activism class

LINKZ WEEK 1of5 | Vik Muniz



 Vic Muniz is an artist who was born in São Paulo, Brazil and now lives and works in New York City.This is great because if you listen to this mans background, would you guess he would become such a great artist, and with such great humor.The fact that he uses such simple mediums (sugar, chocolate) is great. You don't need a piece of paper and pencil to create art. And his presentation is great, you can see how his art has evolved from one medium to the next, flawlessly.

Betty White plays beer pong with Jimmy Fallon



I don't know what to say about this, I am still in awe. How cool is it that the Late Night crew got BETTY WHITE to play beer pong with Jimmy Fallon, even though she lost. People don't know this but backstage after the show Betty and Jimmy downed a bottle of Jack Daniels, then Jimmy drunk dialed Rue McClanahan from Betty's iphone.

Graphic Designer | Adolphe Mouron Cassandre



I'm doing some serious cramming for my History of Design final and I had to stop and post this picture designed by A.M. Cassandre. He was a great graphic designer around the 1940's. Heavily influenced the Art Deco movement. I really really like this.

Interactive Music Video: Labuat “Soy Tu Aire” (“I’m Your Air”)



This is a spectacular piece of art. As the song plays you move your cursor around the screen creating a line drawing that changes with the song. As you controll the elegantly fluid cursor, the line will morph into birds, pictures, music notes, etc. You have heard me say it before, and I will say it again, interactive music videos are commin, and they are commin strong!This new medium takes the viewers attention and holds on to it through the whole song. There is no way to play this animation without watching it all the way till the end.I wish I knew the lyrics in English to understand the video better, but the fact that I have no idea what she is saying is quite beautiful as I create this wandering doodle not knowing what is comming next. its just great!

Design is...


Design is the first signal of human intention - William McDonough
There is no design without discipline. There is no discipline without intelligence. - Massimo Vignelli
Create your own visual style… let it be unique for yourself and yet identifiable for others. - Orson Welles
Computers are to design as microwaves are to cooking. - Milton Glaser
People think that design is styling. Design is not style. It’s not about giving shape to the shell and not giving a damn about the guts. Good design is a renaissance attitude that combines technology, cognitive science, human need, and beauty to produce something that the world didn’t know it was missing. - Paola Antonelli

In 4 days it would have been your 6th birthday. I miss you so much. The pain hasn't gotten any easier, but that will be my present to you this year. To finally grieve.  I'm just scared because sometimes the pain is so much that it literally feels like I'm choking and my heart is going to give out. I know that you don't want me to feel that way when I think of you. So, my beautiful perfect son, your present this year is for me to grieve. 
You are my sunshine. I love you Bry-Bry

Bryson,
From the moment I saw you on the ultra sound, I knew my life was complete. I know you are in a wonderful place and I can't wait to be reunited with my wonderful son again. I miss you every day. Everyday I wonder what you would be doing this very moment if you were still here. I try not to focus on it to much though because that's when the wave of pain comes crashing down. I am extremely blessed to be your mother. I still love to brag about you. It may be the same things over and over again, but it still gives me the chance to let others know how truly AMAZING you are. I miss you!!
I love you with all of my heart and soul,
Love,
Mommy
