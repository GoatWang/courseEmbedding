ICSC Elects Kenneth F. Bernstein as Chairman for 2017-2018

						Published May 22, 2017
                        in
                        Press Releases




NEW YORK, (May 22, 2017) – The International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC), announced today at RECon, the global retail real estate convention, that Kenneth F. Bernstein, President and Chief Executive Officer of Acadia Realty Trust, has been elected by ICSC’s Board of Trustees to serve as the organization’s  Chairman for the 2017-2018 term. Bernstein is the ICSC’s 58th Chairman, succeeding Elizabeth I. Holland, CEO of Abbell Associates LLC.
The President and Co-founder of Acadia Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust specializing in the acquisition, redevelopment and management of open air retail properties, Bernstein oversees over 180 properties totaling approximately $4.5 billion in gross value. With a strong focus on developing a location-driven real estate portfolio, Acadia has assets in New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Washington D.C. and Boston among other holdings in the Midwest, Northeast and down the East Coast.
Prior to co-founding Acadia, Mr. Bernstein served as Chief Operating Officer of RD Capital until its merger with Mark Centers Trust in 1998. Preceding that, he was an associate with the New York law firm Battle Fowler, LLP. Mr. Bernstein received his BA from the University of Vermont and his JD from Boston University School of Law.
“Ken’s aptitude for retail real estate development and his extensive experience within the field will be a valuable asset for ICSC,” said Tom McGee, ICSC President and CEO. “Ken’s knowledge on the value of retail real estate development will prove crucial when advocating for the members of ICSC in front of the press and in Washington DC with legislative issues such as e-Fairness and tax reform on the agenda.”
Bernstein is ready to take on the challenge at hand: “ICSC is at an interesting crossroads where it must remain strong on legislative initiatives that impact retail real estate and create durable relationships with the media to tell complete stories about our industry.” Bernstein’s experience shaping and developing projects from the ground up will help him truly understand the complexities of advocating for consumer real estate. “I’m excited to serve at the forefront of an organization of my peers that can help shape the future of retail real estate.”
Mr. Bernstein has a productive and active history with both ICSC and other real estate organizations. In addition to serving as a member of the Board of Trustees at ICSC, Mr. Bernstein is also a member of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) (and formerly served on its Board of Governors), the Urban Land Institute (ULI) and the Real Estate Roundtable. Additionally, he is an active member of the Young Presidents’ Organization (YPO), where he was the founding chairman of The Real Estate Network. Mr. Bernstein is also a member of the Advisory Board of the Department of Real Estate at Baruch College.
