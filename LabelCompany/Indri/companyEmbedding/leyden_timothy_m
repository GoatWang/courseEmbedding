While you have homeowners insurance to help protect you and that investment, what exactly does it cover? Homeowners policies usually help provide coverage from damage from certain hazards (or perils), such as fire, hail or vandalism. This overview of homeowners insurance is a great place to start, but it's also a good idea to you review your policy so you know your specific coverage.Learn More Rental Car InsuranceYou found a great deal online for a car rental. But now you're standing at the rental counter, wondering if you need all the rental insurance offered and whether it's worth paying the higher price. Chances are you can avoid the unexpected expense, because the rental company's coverage may duplicate the auto insurance coverage you already have. Your credit card company may also offer insurance if you use their card for the rental. Avoid the confusion and stay in your vacation budget - talk to me about what's covered before you get to the rental counter.Learn More Rent Or Own CalculatorIf you're wondering whether you should rent or own, there's a lot to consider. Aside from whether the space is right for you, how much maintenance you want to be responsible for and how to decorate, this decision can have financial implications. You'll need to consider monthly as well as long-term expenses in your decision. Use this calculator to help you compare the costs and whether renting or buying makes the most sense for you.Learn More What Is Whole Life Insurance?You know life insurance is a great way to help protect your loved ones, but do you know what kind of life insurance might be best for you? If you're looking for life-long protection, predictable costs and a savings vehicle, whole life insurance might be a good fit. Take a look at this overview to see if it's something that interests you. I'd be happy to tell you more about whole life insurance and help you decide if it's the right choice for you.Learn More Liability Insurance for Your BusinessPart of owning a business is staying one-step ahead and managing risks before they happen. But no amount of planning can keep accidents from happening, and it's good to have some backup. That's where liability insurance comes in - it may help protect your business in the event of a work-related accident or mistake that damages a third party. I'm here to answer any questions you may have, but keep these questions in mind when you're choosing liability coverage for your business.Learn More Motorcycle Passenger ProtectionSometimes the best way to enjoy a ride is with a friend on the back of your motorcycle. Before you take a friend or family member out for a ride, though, keep in mind that protection is essential for you and your passenger. Aside from donning helmets and safety gear, it's also a good idea to check your motorcycle insurance covers for passengers. Before you hit the road, take a look at these motorcycle passenger coverage requirements and tips for reducing accidents.Learn More Motorhome Insurance BasicsIf you own a motorhome or are thinking about purchasing one, here are some things you may want to consider when it comes to protecting your home on wheels.Learn More Condo Association CoverageIf you own a condo, you may find that two different insurance policies help protect separate parts of your unit. While you are typically responsible for insuring your personal property such as furniture, clothing and other inside components, the condo association's master insurance policy usually helps protect the building's structure and common areas shared by multiple residents. It's important to understand what your condo association's insurance covers so that you can make arrangements to protect other aspects of your home.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it. And that makes paying more than you need to that much more uncomfortable.With a policy from Allstate, you can help keep your insurance costs low with the wide variety of discounts we offer. Keep in mind, not all discounts are available in every state. The best way to get all that you qualify for is to get an insurance quote specific to Chicago.You can get a rough "ballpark" insurance quote from many companies online, but talking with an agent allows you to ask questions and get a quote for coverage that matters most to you. As an Allstate agent, I can prepare a quote that details the coverage, deductibles (your portion of a loss) and cost (premium) of your insurance policy.Insurance products and services offered at my Allstate agency include:Auto InsuranceCar InsuranceFlood InsuranceInsuranceLife InsuranceMotorcycle InsuranceHome InsuranceInsurance QuoteInsurance AgencyBusiness InsuranceAnnuitiesRetirementCollege Savings PlanContactPhone(773) 233-3773(773) 233-3773Email:timothyleyden@allstate.comtimothyleyden@allstate.comAddress:10521 S Western AveChicago, IL 60643Get DirectionsAreas Served:Proud to serve the areas of Chicago IL, Calumet Park IL, Riverdale IL, Blue Island IL, Merrionette Park IL, Dixmoor IL, Dolton IL, Posen IL, Robbins IL, Phoenix IL, Harvey IL, Evergreen Park IL, Alsip IL, Burnham IL, Midlothian IL.
