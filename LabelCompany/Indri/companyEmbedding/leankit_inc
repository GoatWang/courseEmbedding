            LeanKit supports the implementation of Lean principles, practices, and work methodologies across all business functions, to help organizations create an environment of continuous improvement and innovation to deliver customer value, faster.  By visualizing your work as it flows through your process, LeanKit provides a big-picture understanding of the work that helps teams work together more effectively.
          Evolve As You Go
            See how work flows through your team’s process using virtual Kanban boards. LeanKit lets you define and evolve your process without restricting the way you work. Use vertical lanes to visualize each step in your flow and horizontal swimlanes to represent parallel processes on the same board. As your process changes, easily modify your board layout to ensure that it accurately reflects the steps your team follows to get work done.
          Work in Context
            LeanKit provides a go-to place that helps teams stay connected and informed, regardless of whether you’re in the same room or geographically distributed. Reduce the risk of misunderstandings, oversights, and handoff delays with built-in collaboration features that make it easy to ask questions and share status updates. Many teams also display their LeanKit boards on a touchscreen monitor to collaborate on work planning and execution.
          Business in Sight
            Powerful reporting and analytics help you identify opportunities for continuous improvement. Measure the effectiveness of your process using insightful metrics such as flow, quality, throughput and lead time. Understand who did what and when with audit trail details. Both team level and enterprise roll-up reporting is available, with the option to combine LeanKit data with other company data to support custom reporting needs.
          Stay Transparent & Aligned
            Coordinate the flow of work within and across connected teams to improve the delivery of customer value. LeanKit gives all team members and project stakeholders a shared understanding of the work, providing the right level of visibility and detail to track progress and identify potential problems --even when a project spans multiple teams and boards.
          Anytime, Anywhere
            Status updates and new information can happen at any time, making it crucial to stay informed and immediately communicate changes to your team. LeanKit can be easily accessed anytime, anywhere from a browser or mobile device. Mobile apps for iOS and Android let you check status, make updates and add comments while you’re on the go. Any changes made from your mobile device are instantly visible to the entire team.

The workplace has evolved dramatically, but project management tools haven’t kept up with today’s needs.Status updates are difficult to manage, and teams spend hours in status meetings only to emerge with guesstimates of how much effort a project will take. Meanwhile, management struggles to know who’s doing what work and when. Our founders wanted to find a better way.Before LeanKit, our founders spent several, aggravating years on the hamster wheel of corporate IT. The standard method of team collaboration required archaic tools such as physical whiteboards fed by list-based project management systems (and of course, the ubiquitous spreadsheet). Roadblocks popped up almost daily, consuming valuable time and delaying deliverables.Drawing from the principles of Lean, Agile and Kanban, our founders built LeanKit to revolutionize the way work is managed. As a result, we have witnessed the emergence of a more collaborative, proactive and successful workplace.

The trial is free, but after that, yeah, you’ll need to subscribe to one of our plans to continue using dapulse. Don’t give us that look ;) We’re committed to building an amazing product that provides real and tangible value to you every day. At 16 cents per user a day, our Basic plan sets you back less than a pencil per person. There’s no greater investment than pulling your team together and finding a great way to get work done, and many of our customers tell us that their experience with dapulse is truly invaluable. Imagine never missing another deadline, totally eliminating angry phone calls from clients, or putting an end to painful email threads—for real. Imagine actually enjoying your everyday life at work. Priceless, no?     How does your pricing work?    We’re a tiered subscription service, and our pricing is based on the number of people on your team as well as the plan that’s best for you. Check out our handy calculator above to get a personalized quote pronto.     Which plan is right for me?    That’s a good question and there are a number of factors to consider. Reach out to our Customer Success Team-—we’ll be happy to help you figure it out.     Can I pay monthly?    Sure. We offer monthly, yearly, and two-yearly plans. A lot of our customers prefer to go for yearly or two-yearly because they’re the most economical choice—you can save up to 32%. But monthly is totally cool, too.     Can I use this for my whole organization, or just my team?    Either or both! That’s the beauty of dapulse—we have huge enterprises using it organization-wide as well as one and two-people teams. You’re a small team working inside a huge corporation, you say? That’s good, too. Plenty of our customers use dapulse to improve the way their own team or department operates.     Do you offer discounts?    We’re happy to offer discounted pricing to nonprofits and NGOs. Or if you can beat us in Street Fighter 2. (But we’re realllllly good… just saying.) Contact our Customer Success Team for more info.     What forms of payment do you accept?    We accept all major credit cards.

Lliterlly, time management solutions to the max! #timeforteamwork— Truffle Social (@TruffleSocial) April 6, 2016              The gift of management, built in We made dapulse to be way more than just a single place to manage high and low level projects together. We realized there's a pain that runs much deeper than this. A pain that stems from the fact that most managers simply give people tasks. With dapulse you're able to manage the week, and then the month. You plan the week and then harness the whole team to achieve something great together. With the visual synchronization of High and Low level, you get a gift of management - the ability to set priorities and not just give out tasks on a day to day basis. When you manage the week, you can start looking ahead, planning, and achieving greatness together. And this is something that dapulse gives you right off the bat.            You're never alone We're nice people. We like other people. We're not sales people.

Contact Us                    Avishai Abrahami | CEO & Co-founder at Wix.com   A company's structure is the result of leadership that creates a culture. We wanted a culture of togetherness, of people getting recognition. Today, at Wix parties, I can approach any employee and talk to them about their work. It blows their minds. They're like 'how do you know?' and the answer is dapulse! Do you know what that does to their motivation?                Roee Adler | Head of Digital Products at WeWork   dapulse is the best way I know to manage product management processes, especially those involving lots of creative design. It allows our team to visualise our high-level plan and prioritize it in a collaborative way. dapulse excels in that like no other tool I know (and I know lots of them…)                Brad Wohlgemuth | Art Director at Discovery   dapulse has allowed us to better concentrate on actually creating and executing on projects versus spending time sifting through e-mails and lost communication. It can accommodate a large number of projects and create an easy to use atmosphere where project managers and designers have full access to the entire life cycle of a project.                Hope Horner | Founder & CEO at Lemonlight Media   Today, quite literally, everyone gets in in the morning, and they look at the dapulse to see the top priorities. At any given point, we have roughly 300 clients running through various parts of their production or distribution cycle. Prior to dapulse, I had zero insight where our customers were in their life cycle without digging through emails or other software programs. dapulse gave me a simple way to see exactly where each customer was in their life cycle at any given point.                Bernard-Burton Koomson | CRM Content Manager at Adidas   dapulse is a great tool that really helps the team stay connected, we all use it on a daily basis and would recommend it to anyone who is trying to bridge the gap between working with a large team of project managers.                Pamela Becker | VP Global Marketing at Matomy   It’s not just about managing projects…dapulse is an excellent project collaboration tool. Whether working internally or with outside partners using shareable boards, everyone on the team knows where the project stands in real time, and what needs to be done next and when. Plus, all the supportive documents are inside. Thanks dapulse!                Amit Elisha | VP Product at Outbrain   dapulse lets us make sense out of the cluttered world of an agile organization.

Avishai Abrahami | CEO & Co-founder at Wix.com   A company's structure is the result of leadership that creates a culture. We wanted a culture of togetherness, of people getting recognition. Today, at Wix parties, I can approach any employee and talk to them about their work. It blows their minds. They're like 'how do you know?' and the answer is dapulse! Do you know what that does to their motivation?        Roee Adler | Head of Digital Products at WeWork   dapulse is the best way I know to manage product management processes, especially those involving lots of creative design. It allows our team to visualise our high-level plan and prioritize it in a collaborative way. dapulse excels in that like no other tool I know (and I know lots of them…)        Brad Wohlgemuth | Art Director at Discovery   dapulse has allowed us to better concentrate on actually creating and executing on projects versus spending time sifting through e-mails and lost communication. It can accommodate a large number of projects and create an easy to use atmosphere where project managers and designers have full access to the entire life cycle of a project.        Hope Horner | Founder & CEO at Lemonlight Media   Today, quite literally, everyone gets in in the morning, and they look at the dapulse to see the top priorities. At any given point, we have roughly 300 clients running through various parts of their production or distribution cycle. Prior to dapulse, I had zero insight where our customers were in their life cycle without digging through emails or other software programs. dapulse gave me a simple way to see exactly where each customer was in their life cycle at any given point.        Bernard-Burton Koomson | CRM Content Manager at Adidas   dapulse is a great tool that really helps the team stay connected, we all use it on a daily basis and would recommend it to anyone who is trying to bridge the gap between working with a large team of project managers.        Pamela Becker | VP Global Marketing at Matomy   It’s not just about managing projects…dapulse is an excellent project collaboration tool. Whether working internally or with outside partners using shareable boards, everyone on the team knows where the project stands in real time, and what needs to be done next and when. Plus, all the supportive documents are inside. Thanks dapulse!        Amit Elisha | VP Product at Outbrain   dapulse lets us make sense out of the cluttered world of an agile organization.

            LeanKit supports the implementation of Lean principles, practices, and work methodologies across all business functions, to help organizations create an environment of continuous improvement and innovation to deliver customer value, faster.  By visualizing your work as it flows through your process, LeanKit provides a big-picture understanding of the work that helps teams work together more effectively.
          Evolve As You Go
            See how work flows through your team’s process using virtual Kanban boards. LeanKit lets you define and evolve your process without restricting the way you work. Use vertical lanes to visualize each step in your flow and horizontal swimlanes to represent parallel processes on the same board. As your process changes, easily modify your board layout to ensure that it accurately reflects the steps your team follows to get work done.
          Work in Context
            LeanKit provides a go-to place that helps teams stay connected and informed, regardless of whether you’re in the same room or geographically distributed. Reduce the risk of misunderstandings, oversights, and handoff delays with built-in collaboration features that make it easy to ask questions and share status updates. Many teams also display their LeanKit boards on a touchscreen monitor to collaborate on work planning and execution.
          Business in Sight
            Powerful reporting and analytics help you identify opportunities for continuous improvement. Measure the effectiveness of your process using insightful metrics such as flow, quality, throughput and lead time. Understand who did what and when with audit trail details. Both team level and enterprise roll-up reporting is available, with the option to combine LeanKit data with other company data to support custom reporting needs.
          Stay Transparent & Aligned
            Coordinate the flow of work within and across connected teams to improve the delivery of customer value. LeanKit gives all team members and project stakeholders a shared understanding of the work, providing the right level of visibility and detail to track progress and identify potential problems --even when a project spans multiple teams and boards.
          Anytime, Anywhere
            Status updates and new information can happen at any time, making it crucial to stay informed and immediately communicate changes to your team. LeanKit can be easily accessed anytime, anywhere from a browser or mobile device. Mobile apps for iOS and Android let you check status, make updates and add comments while you’re on the go. Any changes made from your mobile device are instantly visible to the entire team.

            LeanKit supports the implementation of Lean principles, practices, and work methodologies across all business functions, to help organizations create an environment of continuous improvement and innovation to deliver customer value, faster.  By visualizing your work as it flows through your process, LeanKit provides a big-picture understanding of the work that helps teams work together more effectively.
          Evolve As You Go
            See how work flows through your team’s process using virtual Kanban boards. LeanKit lets you define and evolve your process without restricting the way you work. Use vertical lanes to visualize each step in your flow and horizontal swimlanes to represent parallel processes on the same board. As your process changes, easily modify your board layout to ensure that it accurately reflects the steps your team follows to get work done.
          Work in Context
            LeanKit provides a go-to place that helps teams stay connected and informed, regardless of whether you’re in the same room or geographically distributed. Reduce the risk of misunderstandings, oversights, and handoff delays with built-in collaboration features that make it easy to ask questions and share status updates. Many teams also display their LeanKit boards on a touchscreen monitor to collaborate on work planning and execution.
          Business in Sight
            Powerful reporting and analytics help you identify opportunities for continuous improvement. Measure the effectiveness of your process using insightful metrics such as flow, quality, throughput and lead time. Understand who did what and when with audit trail details. Both team level and enterprise roll-up reporting is available, with the option to combine LeanKit data with other company data to support custom reporting needs.
          Stay Transparent & Aligned
            Coordinate the flow of work within and across connected teams to improve the delivery of customer value. LeanKit gives all team members and project stakeholders a shared understanding of the work, providing the right level of visibility and detail to track progress and identify potential problems --even when a project spans multiple teams and boards.
          Anytime, Anywhere
            Status updates and new information can happen at any time, making it crucial to stay informed and immediately communicate changes to your team. LeanKit can be easily accessed anytime, anywhere from a browser or mobile device. Mobile apps for iOS and Android let you check status, make updates and add comments while you’re on the go. Any changes made from your mobile device are instantly visible to the entire team.

Additional Information



Overview of LeanKit Enterprise kanbanUpdated: May 10, 2017LeanKit Enterprise kanban OverviewLeanKit Enterprise is a project and workflow management software solution for your business. The software was designed by LeanKit Inc., headquartered in Tennessee, United States. It also provides instant workflow visibility and easier communication of complex information.

LeanKit Enterprise kanban Average Rating  This software product is not yet rated
LeanKit Enterprise kanban Typical CustomersThe software is a useful project management solution for all sizes of businesses, including freelancing ventures. The software has also been used by various nonprofit organizations and public administrations. For the purpose of efficient project management, it has been deployed in a wide range of industries.
If you need increased visualization of your workflow and detailed tracking and supervision of business processes, LeanKit is a reliable solution for that purpose. The software has been used all over the world by small companies and large enterprises.
Some noteworthy customers of LeanKit Enterprise include VertaForce, REA Group, MEDarchon, Vaco, CoreCommerce, Absolute Software, and Lumension Security etc.
LeanKit Enterprise kanban FeaturesThe primary aim of the software is to provide simple workflow mapping and visual team collaboration. The software uses Kanban-based tools for the visual mapping of business processes on virtual whiteboards. Different colored cards are available to represent and track different kinds of works based on their priority and urgency.
The software offers automated reports and notifications along with real-time updates of various processes. You have the facilities of project file attachments and a variety of free workflow templates. Additional important features include cycle time analytics, statistical process control, WIP limits, audit trail, efficiency diagrams, and work distribution diagrams.
LeanKit Enterprise is touchscreen compatible and offers separate app for iOS and Android mobile devices. Information needed for accurate forecasting and targeted process improvement is available and record is maintained of a particular problem and its history.  

LeanKit Enterprise kanban 5 Pros Historical data on the software can be exported and merged with current data and custom reporting. The dashboard uses cards of different colors for problems of different priorities and categories. All the steps of a particular process can be visually mapped on the virtual whiteboard of the software. You have integration facilities with QuickBooks and SalesForce. The interface is touchscreen compatible and you also have separate app for mobile devices.
LeanKit Enterprise kanban 2 Cons The software does not offer built-in integrations and option of third party tools. The options of branding and configuration are not available on LeanKit Enterprise.  
LeanKit Enterprise kanban AlternativesTwo important competitors of LeanKit are Pivotal Tracker and ProWorkflow. Pivotal Tracker is a web based project management solution with a feature set that is somewhat limited compared to LeanKit Enterprise. Important LeanKit Enterprise features that are not available on Pivotal Tracker include automated reports and notifications, work distribution diagrams, cycle time analytics, and sample workflow templates.

On the other hand, some features of Pivotal Tracker that area not offered by LeanKit Enterprise are release management, iterative management workflow, built-in integration, and availability of third party tools. Unlike LeanKit Enterprise, Pivotal Tracker does not offer integration with QuickBooks and SalesForce.

ProWorkflow offers quite an extensive set of features, although differences do exist when we compare it with LeanKit Enterprise. For instance, core features of LeanKit Enterprise that you will not find on ProWorkflow include touchscreen compatibility, workflow distribution diagrams, and cycle time analytics etc.

ProWorkflow, conversely, offers various features that are not available on LeanKit Enterprise. These include branding and configuration, desktop time tracker widgets, timesheet entry options, Gantt style timeline, and import of templates contacts.

ProWorkflow has wider platform support compared to LeanKit Enterprise. Just like LeanKit, it also offers integration with QuickBooks, although not with SalesForce. All three solutions support multi-location operations but not multi-language capabilities. 
LeanKit Enterprise kanban Pricing InformationThe software is available in three editions of basic, team and portfolio. Basic edition is available free of cost. Team and portfolio editions, on the other hand, are available for $15 per month per user and $19 per month per user respectively.

Pros:Dynamic Issue TrackingIf issue tracking features are an important selling point for you, you should know that LeanKit allows users to resolve issues through multiple workflows. This means that hiccups in your new product development project can be handled differently than bugs in your latest IT implementation.Cross Project Resource AllocationLeanKit has a great resource management function that allows users to allocate resources across various projects and monitor availability at scale.Full Function Task ManagementTask management in PM software is sometimes overlooked as a simple to-do list; however, if utilized correctly, it can make your project teams extremely efficient. LeanKit stands out by incorporating a rich list of task management features from setting task priorities to grouping tasks by projects.Custom ReportingReports are the keys to improvement. Without the data on what went wrong, there's no way to analyze and learn from failed or delayed projects. LeanKit has the typical reporting dashboard, but the big pro here is that it allows users to create custom reports. Your business intelligence team will thank you.Agile CapableAgile development isn't just for software developers, and a nice clean card view like the one LeanKit has is great for organization and visibility throughout a project.


Cons:No Gantt ChartsFor a product that covers traditional project management, it's disappointing to see that LeanKit does not have gantt charts. Granted, gantt charts aren't the only thing you use project management software for, but they're still important to have.

About LeanKit
LeanKit Inc., based in Franklin, TN, is an enterprise project management SaaS solution that supports the implementation of Lean principles, practices, and work methodologies across all business functions, to help organizations create an environment of continuous improvement and innovation to deliver customer value, faster. By visualizing your work as it flows through your process, LeanKit provides a big-picture understanding of the work that helps teams work together more effectively.
Using LeanKit, managers can create boards, as a Lean-style pipeline, to manage projects. On boards, Agile-style incremental progress can be tracked with unlimited lanes and sub-lanes, tasks and sub-tasks. Within lanes, Kanban-style cards are assigned for tasks that can be visually identified immediately based upon color, person assigned, title, date due, and the sub-task progress. Users can be notified of changes to LeanKit boards and cards in a variety of ways. Email notifications are utilized for a multitude of events, including when a new card is created, when cards are moved into certain lanes, when sub-tasks are moved into certain lanes, etc. Card-specific communications can take place upon opening the card comments, where users can be @ messaged and notified via email. LeanKit can even be used as a document management system; documents can be uploaded as card attachments, viewable when opening the card. Users can even view the history of cards, so anyone on the board knows at a glance when the card was last modified, who created it, and other events.
LeanKit has proven success with enterprise – class organizations across a variety of industries including; software, technology, telecommunications, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, construction and retail. From small teams to distributed enterprises, thousands of customers use LeanKit everyday to work more effectively. TechnologyAdvice even uses LeanKit across a number of internal teams to manage tasks and projects in marketing, HR, public relations, content management, and operations. LeanKit offers multiple editions, paid per user either annually or monthly.

Your wall full of sticky notes goes digital.

OverallEase of UseFunctionalityPriceSupport



 Reviewed on December 5, 2014







What do you like best about this product?
I love the accessibility of the tool.  I have it loaded on my phone, laptop, and tablet and it allows me and my team to add notes on the go.  Our team uses it to track our projects over time into several stages, so it is great to take a quick glance at any time of how many projects are in each stage at any given time.
What could be improved about this product?
Creating the layout/template take a lot of up-front time.  It’s not as intuitive as I would like it to be. 
What was your main concern about buying this software?
Worried if my team would adopt the tool since it does take a bit of work to configure.  Ultimately, it has worked when we find the right projects to track and it has helped us visually understand our work flow.
What business problems are you solving? What benefits have you seen?
We kept a whiteboard in the office up-to-date with our progress on projects.  This meant that if you weren’t in the office or wanted to check the status, you’d have to wait to come back to the office, often times writing and re-writing the list.  This tool allows the whiteboard to be digital and everyone can update in real time, on the go.
How likely would you be to recommend this software to a friend or colleague?
8/10

            LeanKit supports the implementation of Lean principles, practices, and work methodologies across all business functions, to help organizations create an environment of continuous improvement and innovation to deliver customer value, faster.  By visualizing your work as it flows through your process, LeanKit provides a big-picture understanding of the work that helps teams work together more effectively.
          Evolve As You Go
            See how work flows through your team’s process using virtual Kanban boards. LeanKit lets you define and evolve your process without restricting the way you work. Use vertical lanes to visualize each step in your flow and horizontal swimlanes to represent parallel processes on the same board. As your process changes, easily modify your board layout to ensure that it accurately reflects the steps your team follows to get work done.
          Work in Context
            LeanKit provides a go-to place that helps teams stay connected and informed, regardless of whether you’re in the same room or geographically distributed. Reduce the risk of misunderstandings, oversights, and handoff delays with built-in collaboration features that make it easy to ask questions and share status updates. Many teams also display their LeanKit boards on a touchscreen monitor to collaborate on work planning and execution.
          Business in Sight
            Powerful reporting and analytics help you identify opportunities for continuous improvement. Measure the effectiveness of your process using insightful metrics such as flow, quality, throughput and lead time. Understand who did what and when with audit trail details. Both team level and enterprise roll-up reporting is available, with the option to combine LeanKit data with other company data to support custom reporting needs.
          Stay Transparent & Aligned
            Coordinate the flow of work within and across connected teams to improve the delivery of customer value. LeanKit gives all team members and project stakeholders a shared understanding of the work, providing the right level of visibility and detail to track progress and identify potential problems --even when a project spans multiple teams and boards.
          Anytime, Anywhere
            Status updates and new information can happen at any time, making it crucial to stay informed and immediately communicate changes to your team. LeanKit can be easily accessed anytime, anywhere from a browser or mobile device. Mobile apps for iOS and Android let you check status, make updates and add comments while you’re on the go. Any changes made from your mobile device are instantly visible to the entire team.

The workplace has evolved dramatically, but project management tools haven’t kept up with today’s needs.Status updates are difficult to manage, and teams spend hours in status meetings only to emerge with guesstimates of how much effort a project will take. Meanwhile, management struggles to know who’s doing what work and when. Our founders wanted to find a better way.Before LeanKit, our founders spent several, aggravating years on the hamster wheel of corporate IT. The standard method of team collaboration required archaic tools such as physical whiteboards fed by list-based project management systems (and of course, the ubiquitous spreadsheet). Roadblocks popped up almost daily, consuming valuable time and delaying deliverables.Drawing from the principles of Lean, Agile and Kanban, our founders built LeanKit to revolutionize the way work is managed. As a result, we have witnessed the emergence of a more collaborative, proactive and successful workplace. We are excited to be on the forefront of helping people focus on the work that makes them happy.Dedicated to busting the myth that people are the reason projects fail, our founders created visual management and forecasting software designed to optimize individual and team effectiveness. Using a humanistic, rather than mechanistic, approach to productivity, LeanKit wants to help pave the way for the future of work by creating a visual tool that reinvents the way teams get stuff done.LeadershipTim MulronCo-CEOTim has more than 22 years’ experience in successfully executing senior finance and operating positions with fast-growth companies. Prior to LeanKit, he served as Chief Strategy Officer at Emma, Inc., and CFO of Asurion’s $400 million insurance business. He has also held senior finance and operating roles at two Silicon Valley technology start-ups that went public – @Home Network and Big Band Networks – one of which he helped grow to $1 billion in revenue and Fortune 100 status. Tim began his postgraduate career at HBO. He received his MBA in finance and strategic planning from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.Jon TerryCo-CEOJon has been a leader in Agile transformations for some of the largest healthcare organizations in the U.S., including hospital-giant HCA Healthcare and its subsidiary, HealthTrust Purchasing Group.

Jon not only helps LeanKit customers discover how to increase effectiveness using the LeanKit tool, he also actively seeks to raise awareness of the benefits of Kanban and visual project management.Stephen FranklinChief Information OfficerStephen earned his stripes in Lean/Kanban while leading development teams as a Domain Architect at Healthtrust Purchasing Group and Chief Software Architect at eDoc4u.

The trial is free, but after that, yeah, you’ll need to subscribe to one of our plans to continue using dapulse. Don’t give us that look ;) We’re committed to building an amazing product that provides real and tangible value to you every day. At 16 cents per user a day, our Basic plan sets you back less than a pencil per person. There’s no greater investment than pulling your team together and finding a great way to get work done, and many of our customers tell us that their experience with dapulse is truly invaluable. Imagine never missing another deadline, totally eliminating angry phone calls from clients, or putting an end to painful email threads—for real. Imagine actually enjoying your everyday life at work. Priceless, no?     How does your pricing work?    We’re a tiered subscription service, and our pricing is based on the number of people on your team as well as the plan that’s best for you. Check out our handy calculator above to get a personalized quote pronto.     Which plan is right for me?    That’s a good question and there are a number of factors to consider. Reach out to our Customer Success Team-—we’ll be happy to help you figure it out.     Can I pay monthly?    Sure. We offer monthly, yearly, and two-yearly plans.

Can I use this for my whole organization, or just my team?    Either or both! That’s the beauty of dapulse—we have huge enterprises using it organization-wide as well as one and two-people teams. You’re a small team working inside a huge corporation, you say? That’s good, too. Plenty of our customers use dapulse to improve the way their own team or department operates.

Lliterlly, time management solutions to the max! #timeforteamwork— Truffle Social (@TruffleSocial) April 6, 2016              The gift of management, built in We made dapulse to be way more than just a single place to manage high and low level projects together. We realized there's a pain that runs much deeper than this. A pain that stems from the fact that most managers simply give people tasks. With dapulse you're able to manage the week, and then the month. You plan the week and then harness the whole team to achieve something great together. With the visual synchronization of High and Low level, you get a gift of management - the ability to set priorities and not just give out tasks on a day to day basis. When you manage the week, you can start looking ahead, planning, and achieving greatness together. And this is something that dapulse gives you right off the bat.            You're never alone We're nice people. We like other people. We're not sales people.

Contact Us                    Avishai Abrahami | CEO & Co-founder at Wix.com   A company's structure is the result of leadership that creates a culture. We wanted a culture of togetherness, of people getting recognition. Today, at Wix parties, I can approach any employee and talk to them about their work. It blows their minds. They're like 'how do you know?' and the answer is dapulse! Do you know what that does to their motivation?                Roee Adler | Head of Digital Products at WeWork   dapulse is the best way I know to manage product management processes, especially those involving lots of creative design. It allows our team to visualise our high-level plan and prioritize it in a collaborative way. dapulse excels in that like no other tool I know (and I know lots of them…)                Brad Wohlgemuth | Art Director at Discovery   dapulse has allowed us to better concentrate on actually creating and executing on projects versus spending time sifting through e-mails and lost communication. It can accommodate a large number of projects and create an easy to use atmosphere where project managers and designers have full access to the entire life cycle of a project.                Hope Horner | Founder & CEO at Lemonlight Media   Today, quite literally, everyone gets in in the morning, and they look at the dapulse to see the top priorities. At any given point, we have roughly 300 clients running through various parts of their production or distribution cycle. Prior to dapulse, I had zero insight where our customers were in their life cycle without digging through emails or other software programs. dapulse gave me a simple way to see exactly where each customer was in their life cycle at any given point.                Bernard-Burton Koomson | CRM Content Manager at Adidas   dapulse is a great tool that really helps the team stay connected, we all use it on a daily basis and would recommend it to anyone who is trying to bridge the gap between working with a large team of project managers.                Pamela Becker | VP Global Marketing at Matomy   It’s not just about managing projects…dapulse is an excellent project collaboration tool. Whether working internally or with outside partners using shareable boards, everyone on the team knows where the project stands in real time, and what needs to be done next and when. Plus, all the supportive documents are inside. Thanks dapulse!                Amit Elisha | VP Product at Outbrain   dapulse lets us make sense out of the cluttered world of an agile organization.

So thankful we found dapulse   We tried a few different apps and dapulse was by far the best! We can now track our many projects in many different phases. All our employees can access the projects and know what to do and when to act. We live on dapulse. Julie-Anne Reid         A company with a sense of humanity   I was impressed by all the features of this project management tool from the outstart. The user interface is intuitive and the tool itself is powerful and flexible. Sat Tara Singh Khalsa         Dapulse - everything you need to get everything done!   I really think that this is the best way to organize tasks and share projects with my co-workers. The fact that you can link the dates to your calendar is all the more helpful when planning to tackle my "to-dos" so that I don't forget! Kelly Stevens         I love Dapulse   Since using Dapulse our productivity has at least doubled. We used to have reams of spreadsheets on computers and shared folders. Den Lennie         Great balance of simplicity and functionality.   Many project management tools have so many features and functions that keep those tools updated (required for them to be useful) becomes a significant job in itself. Tim         Liked by a technology curmudgeon   I'm a total technology curmudgeon. The company that I work for had tried 3 to 4 other project management programs that none of which were met with resistance, especially from me because it was too difficult to use... Katie         Can you say customization???   As a company providing specialty healthcare services, this product allows each of our providers the ability to stay connected and informed as we independently work with our clients. Vanesa Lewinger         Most Effective Organizing Program on the Market   I've been using organizing programs for business and life, long before they were fashionable. Initially it was always hard to find something flexible enough to suit my way of working and thinking.

Avishai Abrahami | CEO & Co-founder at Wix.com   A company's structure is the result of leadership that creates a culture. We wanted a culture of togetherness, of people getting recognition. Today, at Wix parties, I can approach any employee and talk to them about their work. It blows their minds. They're like 'how do you know?' and the answer is dapulse! Do you know what that does to their motivation?        Roee Adler | Head of Digital Products at WeWork   dapulse is the best way I know to manage product management processes, especially those involving lots of creative design. It allows our team to visualise our high-level plan and prioritize it in a collaborative way. dapulse excels in that like no other tool I know (and I know lots of them…)        Brad Wohlgemuth | Art Director at Discovery   dapulse has allowed us to better concentrate on actually creating and executing on projects versus spending time sifting through e-mails and lost communication. It can accommodate a large number of projects and create an easy to use atmosphere where project managers and designers have full access to the entire life cycle of a project.        Hope Horner | Founder & CEO at Lemonlight Media   Today, quite literally, everyone gets in in the morning, and they look at the dapulse to see the top priorities. At any given point, we have roughly 300 clients running through various parts of their production or distribution cycle. Prior to dapulse, I had zero insight where our customers were in their life cycle without digging through emails or other software programs. dapulse gave me a simple way to see exactly where each customer was in their life cycle at any given point.        Bernard-Burton Koomson | CRM Content Manager at Adidas   dapulse is a great tool that really helps the team stay connected, we all use it on a daily basis and would recommend it to anyone who is trying to bridge the gap between working with a large team of project managers.        Pamela Becker | VP Global Marketing at Matomy   It’s not just about managing projects…dapulse is an excellent project collaboration tool. Whether working internally or with outside partners using shareable boards, everyone on the team knows where the project stands in real time, and what needs to be done next and when. Plus, all the supportive documents are inside. Thanks dapulse!        Amit Elisha | VP Product at Outbrain   dapulse lets us make sense out of the cluttered world of an agile organization. It gives us the big picture of everything we’re doing and allows us to connect our small sprints to the greater story of what we’re trying to achieve.
