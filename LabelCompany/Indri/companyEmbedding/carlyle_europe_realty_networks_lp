Carlyle was founded in 1987 in Washington D.C. by William E. Conway Jr., Daniel A. D'Aniello, and David Rubenstein and currently operates with more than 1,700 employees across 35 offices in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia.

According to a 2015 ranking called the PEI 300 based on capital raised over the last five years, Carlyle was ranked No. 1 as the largest private equity firm in the world.[2]

Founding and early history[edit]
Carlyle was founded in 1987 as an investment banking boutique by five original partners with backgrounds in finance and government: William E. Conway, Jr., Stephen L. Norris, David M. Rubenstein, Daniel A. D'Aniello and Greg Rosenbaum.[7] The founding partners named the firm after the Carlyle Hotel in New York City where Norris and Rubenstein had often met to discuss the formation of their new investment business.[8] Rubenstein, who was a Washington-based lawyer, had worked in the Carter Administration. Norris and D'Aneillo had previously worked together at Marriott Corporation while Conway was a finance executive at MCI Communications. Of the founding five partners Rubenstein, Conway and D'Aneillo remain active in the business while Rosenbaum left in the first year[9] and Norris departed in 1995.[8][10] Carlyle was founded with $5 million of financial backing from T. Rowe Price, Alex. Brown & Sons, First Interstate Equities, and the Richard King Mellon family.[11][12]
In the late 1980s, Carlyle raised capital on a deal-by-deal basis to pursue leveraged buyout investments including a failed takeover battle for Chi-Chi's.[9][12] The firm raised its first dedicated buyout fund with $100 million of investor commitments in 1990. In its early years, Carlyle also advised in transactions including a $500 million investment by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, in Citigroup in 1991.[12]




The Crusader weapon system, developed by United Defense, Carlyle's largest investment in the defense industry, was cancelled in May 2002[13]


Carlyle initially developed a reputation for acquiring businesses related to the defense industry. In 1992, Carlyle completed the acquisition of the Electronics division of General Dynamics Corporation, renamed GDE Systems, a producer of military electronics systems.[14] Carlyle would later sell the business to Tracor in October 1994.[15] Carlyle acquired Magnavox Electronic Systems, the military communications and electronic-warfare systems segment of Magnavox, from Philips Electronics in 1993.[16] Carlyle sold Magnavox for approximately $370 million to Hughes Aircraft Company in 1995. Carlyle also invested in Vought Aircraft through a partnership with Northrop Grumman.[17] Carlyle's most notable defense industry investment came in October 1997 with its acquisition of United Defense Industries. The $850 million acquisition of United Defense represented Carlyle's largest investment to that point.[13][18] Carlyle was able to complete an IPO of United Defense on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2001 selling a significant portion of its interest in the company. Carlyle completed a sale of its remaining United Defense stock and exited the investment in April 2004.[19] In more recent years, Carlyle has deemphasized its focus on defense industry investments.[20]
Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001. In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported that Shafiq bin Laden, a member of the Bin Laden family, had been the "guest of honor", and that they were investors in Carlyle managed funds.[21][22][23][24][25] Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle's $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time.[26] These connections would later be profiled in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911. The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11th attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group's name became impolitic.[27]
2002–2006[edit]




The Carlyle Group Logo


Following the collapse of the Dot-com bubble in 2000 and 2001, buyout activity declined significantly. Marked by the two-stage buyout of Dex Media at the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain significant high yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed. Carlyle, together with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, led a $7.5 billion buyout of QwestDex. The buyout was the third largest corporate buyout since 1989. QwestDex's purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East in November 2002 and a $4.30 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West in 2003. R. H. Donnelley Corporation acquired Dex Media in 2006. Shortly after Dex Media, other larger buyouts would be completed signaling the resurgence in private equity was underway.
Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO of IBM and Nabisco, was appointed chairman of Carlyle in January 2003, replacing Frank Carlucci. Gerstner would serve in that position through October 2008.[28][29] The hiring of Gerstner, was intended to reduce the perception of Carlyle as a politically dominated firm.[30] At the time, Carlyle, which had been founded 15 years earlier had accumulated $13.9 billion of assets under management and had generated annualized returns for investors of 36%.[29]
Carlyle also announced the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom from Verizon in May 2004.[31] Carlyle's investment was immediately challenged when Hawaii regulators delayed the closing of the buyout. The company also suffered billing and customer-service issues as it had to recreate its back-office systems. Hawaiian Telcom ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, costing Carlyle the $425 million it had invested in the company.[32]




Carlyle led the $15 billion buyout of Hertz in 2005


As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group, and TPG Capital. In 2005, Carlyle, together with Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Merrill Lynch completed the $15.0 billion leveraged buyout of The Hertz Corporation, the largest car rental agency from Ford.[33][34]
The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and its Riverstone Holdings affiliate partnered with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, the company's co-founder and a former president of Enron.[35]
In September 2006, Carlyle led a consortium, comprising Blackstone Group, Permira and TPG Capital, in the $17.6 billion takeover of Freescale Semiconductor. At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout of SunGard. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last-minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale's former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply. In addition, in the recession of 2008–2009, Freescale's chip sales to automakers fell off, and the company came under great financial strain.[36][37]
Earlier that year, in January 2006, Carlyle together with Blackstone Group, AlpInvest Partners, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Thomas H. Lee Partners acquired Nielsen Company, the global information and media company formerly known as VNU in an $8.9 billion buyout.[38][39][40] Also in 2006, Carlyle acquired Oriental Trading Company which ultimately declared bankruptcy in August 2010[41] as well as Forba Dental Management, the owner of Small Smiles Dental Centers, the largest US chain of dental clinics for children.[42]

Ownership changes[edit]
For the first 25 years of its existence, Carlyle operated as a private partnership controlled by its investment partners. In 2001, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), which had been an investor in Carlyle managed funds since 1996, acquired a 5.5% holding in Carlyle's management company for $175 million.[91] The investment was valued at approximately $1 billion by 2007 at the height of the 2000s buyout boom.[92]
In September 2007, Mubadala Development Company, an investment vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates, purchased a 7.5% stake for $1.35 billion.[92][93]
In February 2008, California legislators targeted Carlyle and Mubdala, proposing a bill that would have barred CalPERS from investing money "with private-equity firms that are partly owned by countries with poor records on human rights." The bill, which was intended to draw attention to the connection between Carlyle and Mubadala Development was later withdrawn.[94]
In May 2012, Carlyle completed an initial public offering of the company, listing under the symbol CG on the NASDAQ. The firm, which at the time managed approximately $147 billion of assets, raised $671 million in the offering. Following the IPO, Carlyle's three remaining founding partners, Rubenstein, D'Aniello and Conway retained the position as the company's largest shareholders.[95]
In June 2017, Carlyle took its non-traded BDC, TCG BDC, Inc., public in the first business development company IPO since 2014.[96][97]
Subsidiaries and joint-ventures[edit]
Carlyle has been actively expanding its investment activities and assets under management through a series of acquisitions and joint-ventures.
Carlyle Capital Corporation[edit]
In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, established in August 2006[98] for the purpose of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its remaining assets.[99] Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans.[100] In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.[101]
On 12 March 2008, BBC News Online reported that "instead of underpinning the mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect, giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset" and that Carlyle Capital Corp. "will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets."[102] On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernsey[103] for a "compulsory winding up proceeding" to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court-appointed liquidator.[104]
The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital are reported to be "minimal from a financial standpoint".[105]
In documentaries[edit]
Carlyle has been profiled in two notable documentaries: Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and William Karel's The World According to Bush.
In Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group.[106] Moore focused on Carlyle's connections with George H. W. Bush and his Secretary of State James Baker, both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes author Dan Briody, who claimed that the Carlyle Group "gained" from the September 11 attacks because it owned United Defense, a military contractor, although the firm’s $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the United States Army is one of the few weapons systems cancelled by the Bush administration.[20] A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several other Private equity firms.[107] Carlyle also has provided detail on its links with the Bin Laden family, specifically the relatively minor investments by an estranged half brother.[citation needed]
In The World According to Bush, William Karel interviewed Frank Carlucci to discuss the presence of Shafiq bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's estranged brother, at Carlyle's annual investor conference while the September 11 attacks were occurring.[22][108]

As one of the largest private equity and alternative investment firms in the world, Carlyle specializes in four key business areas: corporate private equity, real assets, global market strategies, and investment solutions.
Carlyle's corporate private equity business has been one of the largest investors in leveraged buyout transactions over the decade 2004–2014 (or perhaps 2000–2010),[citation needed] while its real estate business has actively acquired commercial real estate. Since its inception, Carlyle has at various times had investments in companies such as Booz Allen Hamilton, Dex Media, Dunkin' Brands, Freescale Semiconductor, Getty Images, HCR Manor Care, Hertz, Kinder Morgan, Nielsen, and United Defense.
Carlyle was founded in 1987 in Washington D.C. by William E. Conway Jr., Daniel A. D'Aniello, and David Rubenstein and currently operates with more than 1,700 employees across 35 offices in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia. Over the course of two decades, Carlyle has amassed a portfolio of $193 billion in assets under management across 130 funds and 156 fund of fund vehicles and has made investments in more than 200 companies and more than 250 real estate investments. In 2012, Carlyle completed a $700 million initial public offering and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange on May 3, 2012.
According to a 2015 ranking called the PEI 300 based on capital raised over the last five years, Carlyle was ranked No. 1 as the largest private equity firm in the world.[2]

Founding and early history[edit]
Carlyle was founded in 1987 as an investment banking boutique by five original partners with backgrounds in finance and government: William E. Conway, Jr., Stephen L. Norris, David M. Rubenstein, Daniel A. D'Aniello and Greg Rosenbaum.[7] The founding partners named the firm after the Carlyle Hotel in New York City where Norris and Rubenstein had often met to discuss the formation of their new investment business.[8] Rubenstein, who was a Washington-based lawyer, had worked in the Carter Administration. Norris and D'Aneillo had previously worked together at Marriott Corporation while Conway was a finance executive at MCI Communications. Of the founding five partners Rubenstein, Conway and D'Aneillo remain active in the business while Rosenbaum left in the first year[9] and Norris departed in 1995.[8][10] Carlyle was founded with $5 million of financial backing from T. Rowe Price, Alex. Brown & Sons, First Interstate Equities, and the Richard King Mellon family.[11][12]
In the late 1980s, Carlyle raised capital on a deal-by-deal basis to pursue leveraged buyout investments including a failed takeover battle for Chi-Chi's.[9][12] The firm raised its first dedicated buyout fund with $100 million of investor commitments in 1990. In its early years, Carlyle also advised in transactions including a $500 million investment by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, in Citigroup in 1991.[12]




The Crusader weapon system, developed by United Defense, Carlyle's largest investment in the defense industry, was cancelled in May 2002[13]


Carlyle initially developed a reputation for acquiring businesses related to the defense industry. In 1992, Carlyle completed the acquisition of the Electronics division of General Dynamics Corporation, renamed GDE Systems, a producer of military electronics systems.[14] Carlyle would later sell the business to Tracor in October 1994.[15] Carlyle acquired Magnavox Electronic Systems, the military communications and electronic-warfare systems segment of Magnavox, from Philips Electronics in 1993.[16] Carlyle sold Magnavox for approximately $370 million to Hughes Aircraft Company in 1995. Carlyle also invested in Vought Aircraft through a partnership with Northrop Grumman.[17] Carlyle's most notable defense industry investment came in October 1997 with its acquisition of United Defense Industries. The $850 million acquisition of United Defense represented Carlyle's largest investment to that point.[13][18] Carlyle was able to complete an IPO of United Defense on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2001 selling a significant portion of its interest in the company. Carlyle completed a sale of its remaining United Defense stock and exited the investment in April 2004.[19] In more recent years, Carlyle has deemphasized its focus on defense industry investments.[20]
Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001. In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported that Shafiq bin Laden, a member of the Bin Laden family, had been the "guest of honor", and that they were investors in Carlyle managed funds.[21][22][23][24][25] Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle's $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time.[26] These connections would later be profiled in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911. The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11th attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group's name became impolitic.[27]
2002–2006[edit]




The Carlyle Group Logo


Following the collapse of the Dot-com bubble in 2000 and 2001, buyout activity declined significantly. Marked by the two-stage buyout of Dex Media at the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain significant high yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed. Carlyle, together with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, led a $7.5 billion buyout of QwestDex. The buyout was the third largest corporate buyout since 1989. QwestDex's purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East in November 2002 and a $4.30 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West in 2003. R. H. Donnelley Corporation acquired Dex Media in 2006. Shortly after Dex Media, other larger buyouts would be completed signaling the resurgence in private equity was underway.
Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO of IBM and Nabisco, was appointed chairman of Carlyle in January 2003, replacing Frank Carlucci. Gerstner would serve in that position through October 2008.[28][29] The hiring of Gerstner, was intended to reduce the perception of Carlyle as a politically dominated firm.[30] At the time, Carlyle, which had been founded 15 years earlier had accumulated $13.9 billion of assets under management and had generated annualized returns for investors of 36%.[29]
Carlyle also announced the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom from Verizon in May 2004.[31] Carlyle's investment was immediately challenged when Hawaii regulators delayed the closing of the buyout. The company also suffered billing and customer-service issues as it had to recreate its back-office systems. Hawaiian Telcom ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, costing Carlyle the $425 million it had invested in the company.[32]




Carlyle led the $15 billion buyout of Hertz in 2005


As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group, and TPG Capital. In 2005, Carlyle, together with Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Merrill Lynch completed the $15.0 billion leveraged buyout of The Hertz Corporation, the largest car rental agency from Ford.[33][34]
The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and its Riverstone Holdings affiliate partnered with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, the company's co-founder and a former president of Enron.[35]
In September 2006, Carlyle led a consortium, comprising Blackstone Group, Permira and TPG Capital, in the $17.6 billion takeover of Freescale Semiconductor. At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout of SunGard. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last-minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale's former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply. In addition, in the recession of 2008–2009, Freescale's chip sales to automakers fell off, and the company came under great financial strain.[36][37]
Earlier that year, in January 2006, Carlyle together with Blackstone Group, AlpInvest Partners, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Thomas H. Lee Partners acquired Nielsen Company, the global information and media company formerly known as VNU in an $8.9 billion buyout.[38][39][40] Also in 2006, Carlyle acquired Oriental Trading Company which ultimately declared bankruptcy in August 2010[41] as well as Forba Dental Management, the owner of Small Smiles Dental Centers, the largest US chain of dental clinics for children.[42]
Since 2007[edit]




David Rubenstein, the head of the Carlyle Group, the largest private equity firm (by investor commitments) during the 2006–07 buyout boom.[43]


On January 28, 2007, the Carlyle group purchased Synagro Technologies, a municipal sludge hauler and spreader, for $5.76 per share.[44]
Carlyle continued to make large investments into 2007 as the buyout market reached its peak. In June 2007, Carlyle agrees to acquire HD Supply for $10.3 billion, along with Bain Capital and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (with each agreeing to buy a one-third stake in the division). Home Depot sold their wholesale construction supply business to fund a stock repurchase estimated at $40 billion. Also in June 2007, Carlyle announced that it would partner with Onex Corporation to buy the Allison Transmission unit from General Motors for $5.6 billion.[45]
On December 18, 2007, David Rubenstein, representing the Carlyle Group, purchased the Magna Carta (one of seventeen copies) at Sotheby's Auction House in New York City. He paid the Perot Foundation $21.3 million. Mr. Rubenstein expressed his intent for it to be returned to the National Archives for display.
On May 16, 2008, Booz Allen Hamilton announced that it would sell a majority stake in the US government business to The Carlyle Group for $2.54 billion. The transaction was expected to be complete July 31, 2008.[46]
In November 2008, The Carlyle Group was named Private Equity firm of the year in the U.S. at the Financial Times-Mergermarket 2008 M&A Awards.[47]
In March 2009, New York State and federal authorities began an investigation into payments made by Carlyle's Riverstone Holdings subsidiary to placement agents allegedly made in exchange for investments from the New York State Common Retirement System, the state's pension fund. In 2000, Carlyle had entered into a joint venture with Riverstone Holdings, an energy and power focused private equity firm founded by Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr. and David M. Leuschen.[48] It was alleged that these payments were in fact bribes or kickbacks, made to pension officials who have been under investigation by New York State Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo.[49] In May 2009, Carlyle agreed to pay $20 million in a settlement with Cuomo and accepted changes to its fundraising practices.[50]
On October 16, 2009, Carlyle Group bought Metaldyne – a global automotive components supplier.[51]
On November 30, 2009, David Rosendall, a Synagro executive was sentenced for conspiring to commit bribery, in the corruption scandal which eventually brought down the mayor of the City of Detroit.[52] The executive for the Carlyle subsidiary was caught giving cash to Detroit city leadership.[53]
On September 30, 2010, Carlyle Group announced the completed acquisition of nutritional supplement manufacturer NBTY for $4 Billion.[54]
On September 4, 2011, the carpet manufacturer Brintons announced that it had been acquired by the Carlyle Group.[55]
On October 3, 2011, the pharmaceutical contract research organisation PPD announced that it had been acquired by the Carlyle Group.[56]
In August 2012, Carlyle Group announced that it would purchase DuPont Performance Coatings (DPC) for $4.9 billion in cash.[57] DPC is a global supplier of vehicle and industrial coating systems. The transaction closed in the first quarter of 2013 and the new company was named Axalta Coating Systems.[58]
In October 2012, Carlyle Group sold its remaining 3.7% stake in Housing Development Finance Corporation for around $841 million.[59]
In November 2012, the Carlyle Group unveiled the first investment of its new Sub-Saharan African Fund. Carlyle is part of a small group of investors that will inject $210 million into Export Trading Group, a Tanzania-based agricultural company that sources commodities from Africa's small farmers and sells those goods to China, India and elsewhere.[60]
January 2013, Carlyle Group began talks to sell Synagro after plowing over $500,000 in 2012 to keep the entity afloat.[61]

Ownership changes[edit]
For the first 25 years of its existence, Carlyle operated as a private partnership controlled by its investment partners. In 2001, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), which had been an investor in Carlyle managed funds since 1996, acquired a 5.5% holding in Carlyle's management company for $175 million.[91] The investment was valued at approximately $1 billion by 2007 at the height of the 2000s buyout boom.[92]
In September 2007, Mubadala Development Company, an investment vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates, purchased a 7.5% stake for $1.35 billion.[92][93]
In February 2008, California legislators targeted Carlyle and Mubdala, proposing a bill that would have barred CalPERS from investing money "with private-equity firms that are partly owned by countries with poor records on human rights." The bill, which was intended to draw attention to the connection between Carlyle and Mubadala Development was later withdrawn.[94]
In May 2012, Carlyle completed an initial public offering of the company, listing under the symbol CG on the NASDAQ. The firm, which at the time managed approximately $147 billion of assets, raised $671 million in the offering. Following the IPO, Carlyle's three remaining founding partners, Rubenstein, D'Aniello and Conway retained the position as the company's largest shareholders.[95]
In June 2017, Carlyle took its non-traded BDC, TCG BDC, Inc., public in the first business development company IPO since 2014.[96][97]
Subsidiaries and joint-ventures[edit]
Carlyle has been actively expanding its investment activities and assets under management through a series of acquisitions and joint-ventures.
Carlyle Capital Corporation[edit]
In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, established in August 2006[98] for the purpose of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its remaining assets.[99] Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans.[100] In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.[101]
On 12 March 2008, BBC News Online reported that "instead of underpinning the mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect, giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset" and that Carlyle Capital Corp. "will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets."[102] On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernsey[103] for a "compulsory winding up proceeding" to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court-appointed liquidator.[104]
The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital are reported to be "minimal from a financial standpoint".[105]
In documentaries[edit]
Carlyle has been profiled in two notable documentaries: Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and William Karel's The World According to Bush.
In Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group.[106] Moore focused on Carlyle's connections with George H. W. Bush and his Secretary of State James Baker, both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes author Dan Briody, who claimed that the Carlyle Group "gained" from the September 11 attacks because it owned United Defense, a military contractor, although the firm’s $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the United States Army is one of the few weapons systems cancelled by the Bush administration.[20] A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several other Private equity firms.[107] Carlyle also has provided detail on its links with the Bin Laden family, specifically the relatively minor investments by an estranged half brother.[citation needed]
In The World According to Bush, William Karel interviewed Frank Carlucci to discuss the presence of Shafiq bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's estranged brother, at Carlyle's annual investor conference while the September 11 attacks were occurring.[22][108]

Carlyle was founded in 1987 in Washington D.C. by William E. Conway Jr., Daniel A. D'Aniello, and David Rubenstein and currently operates with more than 1,700 employees across 35 offices in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia. Over the course of two decades, Carlyle has amassed a portfolio of $193 billion in assets under management across 130 funds and 156 fund of fund vehicles and has made investments in more than 200 companies and more than 250 real estate investments.

Founding and early history[edit]
Carlyle was founded in 1987 as an investment banking boutique by five original partners with backgrounds in finance and government: William E. Conway, Jr., Stephen L. Norris, David M. Rubenstein, Daniel A. D'Aniello and Greg Rosenbaum.[7] The founding partners named the firm after the Carlyle Hotel in New York City where Norris and Rubenstein had often met to discuss the formation of their new investment business.[8] Rubenstein, who was a Washington-based lawyer, had worked in the Carter Administration. Norris and D'Aneillo had previously worked together at Marriott Corporation while Conway was a finance executive at MCI Communications. Of the founding five partners Rubenstein, Conway and D'Aneillo remain active in the business while Rosenbaum left in the first year[9] and Norris departed in 1995.[8][10] Carlyle was founded with $5 million of financial backing from T. Rowe Price, Alex. Brown & Sons, First Interstate Equities, and the Richard King Mellon family.[11][12]
In the late 1980s, Carlyle raised capital on a deal-by-deal basis to pursue leveraged buyout investments including a failed takeover battle for Chi-Chi's.[9][12] The firm raised its first dedicated buyout fund with $100 million of investor commitments in 1990. In its early years, Carlyle also advised in transactions including a $500 million investment by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, in Citigroup in 1991.[12]




The Crusader weapon system, developed by United Defense, Carlyle's largest investment in the defense industry, was cancelled in May 2002[13]


Carlyle initially developed a reputation for acquiring businesses related to the defense industry. In 1992, Carlyle completed the acquisition of the Electronics division of General Dynamics Corporation, renamed GDE Systems, a producer of military electronics systems.[14] Carlyle would later sell the business to Tracor in October 1994.[15] Carlyle acquired Magnavox Electronic Systems, the military communications and electronic-warfare systems segment of Magnavox, from Philips Electronics in 1993.[16] Carlyle sold Magnavox for approximately $370 million to Hughes Aircraft Company in 1995. Carlyle also invested in Vought Aircraft through a partnership with Northrop Grumman.[17] Carlyle's most notable defense industry investment came in October 1997 with its acquisition of United Defense Industries. The $850 million acquisition of United Defense represented Carlyle's largest investment to that point.[13][18] Carlyle was able to complete an IPO of United Defense on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2001 selling a significant portion of its interest in the company. Carlyle completed a sale of its remaining United Defense stock and exited the investment in April 2004.[19] In more recent years, Carlyle has deemphasized its focus on defense industry investments.[20]
Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001. In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported that Shafiq bin Laden, a member of the Bin Laden family, had been the "guest of honor", and that they were investors in Carlyle managed funds.[21][22][23][24][25] Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle's $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time.[26] These connections would later be profiled in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911. The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11th attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group's name became impolitic.[27]
2002–2006[edit]




The Carlyle Group Logo


Following the collapse of the Dot-com bubble in 2000 and 2001, buyout activity declined significantly. Marked by the two-stage buyout of Dex Media at the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain significant high yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed. Carlyle, together with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, led a $7.5 billion buyout of QwestDex. The buyout was the third largest corporate buyout since 1989. QwestDex's purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East in November 2002 and a $4.30 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West in 2003. R. H. Donnelley Corporation acquired Dex Media in 2006. Shortly after Dex Media, other larger buyouts would be completed signaling the resurgence in private equity was underway.
Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO of IBM and Nabisco, was appointed chairman of Carlyle in January 2003, replacing Frank Carlucci. Gerstner would serve in that position through October 2008.[28][29] The hiring of Gerstner, was intended to reduce the perception of Carlyle as a politically dominated firm.[30] At the time, Carlyle, which had been founded 15 years earlier had accumulated $13.9 billion of assets under management and had generated annualized returns for investors of 36%.[29]
Carlyle also announced the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom from Verizon in May 2004.[31] Carlyle's investment was immediately challenged when Hawaii regulators delayed the closing of the buyout. The company also suffered billing and customer-service issues as it had to recreate its back-office systems. Hawaiian Telcom ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, costing Carlyle the $425 million it had invested in the company.[32]




Carlyle led the $15 billion buyout of Hertz in 2005


As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group, and TPG Capital. In 2005, Carlyle, together with Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Merrill Lynch completed the $15.0 billion leveraged buyout of The Hertz Corporation, the largest car rental agency from Ford.[33][34]
The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and its Riverstone Holdings affiliate partnered with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, the company's co-founder and a former president of Enron.[35]
In September 2006, Carlyle led a consortium, comprising Blackstone Group, Permira and TPG Capital, in the $17.6 billion takeover of Freescale Semiconductor. At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout of SunGard. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last-minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale's former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply. In addition, in the recession of 2008–2009, Freescale's chip sales to automakers fell off, and the company came under great financial strain.[36][37]
Earlier that year, in January 2006, Carlyle together with Blackstone Group, AlpInvest Partners, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Thomas H. Lee Partners acquired Nielsen Company, the global information and media company formerly known as VNU in an $8.9 billion buyout.[38][39][40] Also in 2006, Carlyle acquired Oriental Trading Company which ultimately declared bankruptcy in August 2010[41] as well as Forba Dental Management, the owner of Small Smiles Dental Centers, the largest US chain of dental clinics for children.[42]

In 2000, Carlyle had entered into a joint venture with Riverstone Holdings, an energy and power focused private equity firm founded by Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr. and David M. Leuschen.[48] It was alleged that these payments were in fact bribes or kickbacks, made to pension officials who have been under investigation by New York State Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo.[49] In May 2009, Carlyle agreed to pay $20 million in a settlement with Cuomo and accepted changes to its fundraising practices.[50]

April 23, 2013, Carlyle Groups subsidiary, Synagro Technologies, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and in lieu of sale, a reorganization and sale of the company to an affiliate of Swedish private-equity firm EQT. The offer price was set at $460 million, over $300 million less than what Carlyle group originally purchased the entity for in 2007.[62]
In September 2013, it was announced that Carlyle Group has purchased a minority stake in Beats Music for $500m.[63] This came as technology firm, HTC, liquidated their 24.84% stake in Beats for $265m.[64]
In February 2014, The Carlyle Group acquired Diversified Global Asset Management (DGAM),[65] a manager of hedge funds with more than USD6.7bn in managed and advised assets.

For the first 25 years of its existence, Carlyle operated as a private partnership controlled by its investment partners. In 2001, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), which had been an investor in Carlyle managed funds since 1996, acquired a 5.5% holding in Carlyle's management company for $175 million.[91] The investment was valued at approximately $1 billion by 2007 at the height of the 2000s buyout boom.[92]
In September 2007, Mubadala Development Company, an investment vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates, purchased a 7.5% stake for $1.35 billion.[92][93]
In February 2008, California legislators targeted Carlyle and Mubdala, proposing a bill that would have barred CalPERS from investing money "with private-equity firms that are partly owned by countries with poor records on human rights." The bill, which was intended to draw attention to the connection between Carlyle and Mubadala Development was later withdrawn.[94]
In May 2012, Carlyle completed an initial public offering of the company, listing under the symbol CG on the NASDAQ. The firm, which at the time managed approximately $147 billion of assets, raised $671 million in the offering. Following the IPO, Carlyle's three remaining founding partners, Rubenstein, D'Aniello and Conway retained the position as the company's largest shareholders.[95]
In June 2017, Carlyle took its non-traded BDC, TCG BDC, Inc., public in the first business development company IPO since 2014.[96][97]
Subsidiaries and joint-ventures[edit]
Carlyle has been actively expanding its investment activities and assets under management through a series of acquisitions and joint-ventures.
Carlyle Capital Corporation[edit]
In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, established in August 2006[98] for the purpose of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its remaining assets.[99] Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans.[100] In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.[101]
On 12 March 2008, BBC News Online reported that "instead of underpinning the mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect, giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset" and that Carlyle Capital Corp. "will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets."[102] On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernsey[103] for a "compulsory winding up proceeding" to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court-appointed liquidator.[104]
The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital are reported to be "minimal from a financial standpoint".[105]
In documentaries[edit]
Carlyle has been profiled in two notable documentaries: Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and William Karel's The World According to Bush.
In Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group.[106] Moore focused on Carlyle's connections with George H. W. Bush and his Secretary of State James Baker, both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes author Dan Briody, who claimed that the Carlyle Group "gained" from the September 11 attacks because it owned United Defense, a military contractor, although the firm’s $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the United States Army is one of the few weapons systems cancelled by the Bush administration.[20] A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several other Private equity firms.[107] Carlyle also has provided detail on its links with the Bin Laden family, specifically the relatively minor investments by an estranged half brother.[citation needed]
In The World According to Bush, William Karel interviewed Frank Carlucci to discuss the presence of Shafiq bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's estranged brother, at Carlyle's annual investor conference while the September 11 attacks were occurring.[22][108]

On September 11, 2001, the Group happened to be hosting a conference at a Washington hotel. Among the guest of honor: investor Shafig bin Laden, another brother to Osama.

Founding and early history[edit]
Carlyle was founded in 1987 as an investment banking boutique by five original partners with backgrounds in finance and government: William E. Conway, Jr., Stephen L. Norris, David M. Rubenstein, Daniel A. D'Aniello and Greg Rosenbaum.[7] The founding partners named the firm after the Carlyle Hotel in New York City where Norris and Rubenstein had often met to discuss the formation of their new investment business.[8] Rubenstein, who was a Washington-based lawyer, had worked in the Carter Administration. Norris and D'Aneillo had previously worked together at Marriott Corporation while Conway was a finance executive at MCI Communications. Of the founding five partners Rubenstein, Conway and D'Aneillo remain active in the business while Rosenbaum left in the first year[9] and Norris departed in 1995.[8][10] Carlyle was founded with $5 million of financial backing from T. Rowe Price, Alex. Brown & Sons, First Interstate Equities, and the Richard King Mellon family.[11][12]
In the late 1980s, Carlyle raised capital on a deal-by-deal basis to pursue leveraged buyout investments including a failed takeover battle for Chi-Chi's.[9][12] The firm raised its first dedicated buyout fund with $100 million of investor commitments in 1990. In its early years, Carlyle also advised in transactions including a $500 million investment by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, in Citigroup in 1991.[12]




The Crusader weapon system, developed by United Defense, Carlyle's largest investment in the defense industry, was cancelled in May 2002[13]


Carlyle initially developed a reputation for acquiring businesses related to the defense industry. In 1992, Carlyle completed the acquisition of the Electronics division of General Dynamics Corporation, renamed GDE Systems, a producer of military electronics systems.[14] Carlyle would later sell the business to Tracor in October 1994.[15] Carlyle acquired Magnavox Electronic Systems, the military communications and electronic-warfare systems segment of Magnavox, from Philips Electronics in 1993.[16] Carlyle sold Magnavox for approximately $370 million to Hughes Aircraft Company in 1995. Carlyle also invested in Vought Aircraft through a partnership with Northrop Grumman.[17] Carlyle's most notable defense industry investment came in October 1997 with its acquisition of United Defense Industries. The $850 million acquisition of United Defense represented Carlyle's largest investment to that point.[13][18] Carlyle was able to complete an IPO of United Defense on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2001 selling a significant portion of its interest in the company. Carlyle completed a sale of its remaining United Defense stock and exited the investment in April 2004.[19] In more recent years, Carlyle has deemphasized its focus on defense industry investments.[20]
Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001. In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported that Shafiq bin Laden, a member of the Bin Laden family, had been the "guest of honor", and that they were investors in Carlyle managed funds.[21][22][23][24][25] Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle's $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time.[26] These connections would later be profiled in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911. The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11th attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group's name became impolitic.[27]
2002–2006[edit]




The Carlyle Group Logo


Following the collapse of the Dot-com bubble in 2000 and 2001, buyout activity declined significantly. Marked by the two-stage buyout of Dex Media at the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain significant high yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed. Carlyle, together with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, led a $7.5 billion buyout of QwestDex. The buyout was the third largest corporate buyout since 1989. QwestDex's purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East in November 2002 and a $4.30 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West in 2003. R. H. Donnelley Corporation acquired Dex Media in 2006. Shortly after Dex Media, other larger buyouts would be completed signaling the resurgence in private equity was underway.
Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO of IBM and Nabisco, was appointed chairman of Carlyle in January 2003, replacing Frank Carlucci. Gerstner would serve in that position through October 2008.[28][29] The hiring of Gerstner, was intended to reduce the perception of Carlyle as a politically dominated firm.[30] At the time, Carlyle, which had been founded 15 years earlier had accumulated $13.9 billion of assets under management and had generated annualized returns for investors of 36%.[29]
Carlyle also announced the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom from Verizon in May 2004.[31] Carlyle's investment was immediately challenged when Hawaii regulators delayed the closing of the buyout. The company also suffered billing and customer-service issues as it had to recreate its back-office systems. Hawaiian Telcom ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, costing Carlyle the $425 million it had invested in the company.[32]




Carlyle led the $15 billion buyout of Hertz in 2005


As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group, and TPG Capital. In 2005, Carlyle, together with Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Merrill Lynch completed the $15.0 billion leveraged buyout of The Hertz Corporation, the largest car rental agency from Ford.[33][34]
The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and its Riverstone Holdings affiliate partnered with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, the company's co-founder and a former president of Enron.[35]
In September 2006, Carlyle led a consortium, comprising Blackstone Group, Permira and TPG Capital, in the $17.6 billion takeover of Freescale Semiconductor. At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout of SunGard. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last-minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale's former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply. In addition, in the recession of 2008–2009, Freescale's chip sales to automakers fell off, and the company came under great financial strain.[36][37]
Earlier that year, in January 2006, Carlyle together with Blackstone Group, AlpInvest Partners, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Thomas H. Lee Partners acquired Nielsen Company, the global information and media company formerly known as VNU in an $8.9 billion buyout.[38][39][40] Also in 2006, Carlyle acquired Oriental Trading Company which ultimately declared bankruptcy in August 2010[41] as well as Forba Dental Management, the owner of Small Smiles Dental Centers, the largest US chain of dental clinics for children.[42]

In 2000, Carlyle had entered into a joint venture with Riverstone Holdings, an energy and power focused private equity firm founded by Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr. and David M. Leuschen.[48] It was alleged that these payments were in fact bribes or kickbacks, made to pension officials who have been under investigation by New York State Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo.[49] In May 2009, Carlyle agreed to pay $20 million in a settlement with Cuomo and accepted changes to its fundraising practices.[50]

The offer price was set at $460 million, over $300 million less than what Carlyle group originally purchased the entity for in 2007.[62]
In September 2013, it was announced that Carlyle Group has purchased a minority stake in Beats Music for $500m.[63] This came as technology firm, HTC, liquidated their 24.84% stake in Beats for $265m.[64]

Ownership changes[edit]
For the first 25 years of its existence, Carlyle operated as a private partnership controlled by its investment partners. In 2001, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), which had been an investor in Carlyle managed funds since 1996, acquired a 5.5% holding in Carlyle's management company for $175 million.[91] The investment was valued at approximately $1 billion by 2007 at the height of the 2000s buyout boom.[92]
In September 2007, Mubadala Development Company, an investment vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates, purchased a 7.5% stake for $1.35 billion.[92][93]
In February 2008, California legislators targeted Carlyle and Mubdala, proposing a bill that would have barred CalPERS from investing money "with private-equity firms that are partly owned by countries with poor records on human rights." The bill, which was intended to draw attention to the connection between Carlyle and Mubadala Development was later withdrawn.[94]
In May 2012, Carlyle completed an initial public offering of the company, listing under the symbol CG on the NASDAQ. The firm, which at the time managed approximately $147 billion of assets, raised $671 million in the offering. Following the IPO, Carlyle's three remaining founding partners, Rubenstein, D'Aniello and Conway retained the position as the company's largest shareholders.[95]
In June 2017, Carlyle took its non-traded BDC, TCG BDC, Inc., public in the first business development company IPO since 2014.[96][97]
Subsidiaries and joint-ventures[edit]
Carlyle has been actively expanding its investment activities and assets under management through a series of acquisitions and joint-ventures.
Carlyle Capital Corporation[edit]
In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, established in August 2006[98] for the purpose of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its remaining assets.[99] Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans.[100] In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.[101]
On 12 March 2008, BBC News Online reported that "instead of underpinning the mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect, giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset" and that Carlyle Capital Corp. "will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets."[102] On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernsey[103] for a "compulsory winding up proceeding" to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court-appointed liquidator.[104]
The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital are reported to be "minimal from a financial standpoint".[105]
In documentaries[edit]
Carlyle has been profiled in two notable documentaries: Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and William Karel's The World According to Bush.
In Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group.[106] Moore focused on Carlyle's connections with George H. W. Bush and his Secretary of State James Baker, both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes author Dan Briody, who claimed that the Carlyle Group "gained" from the September 11 attacks because it owned United Defense, a military contractor, although the firm’s $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the United States Army is one of the few weapons systems cancelled by the Bush administration.[20] A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several other Private equity firms.[107] Carlyle also has provided detail on its links with the Bin Laden family, specifically the relatively minor investments by an estranged half brother.[citation needed]
In The World According to Bush, William Karel interviewed Frank Carlucci to discuss the presence of Shafiq bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's estranged brother, at Carlyle's annual investor conference while the September 11 attacks were occurring.[22][108]

On September 11, 2001, the Group happened to be hosting a conference at a Washington hotel. Among the guest of honor: investor Shafig bin Laden, another brother to Osama.

The Carlyle Group is an American multinational private equity, alternative asset management and financial services corporation. As one of the largest private equity and alternative investment firms in the world, Carlyle specializes in four key business areas: corporate private equity, real assets, global market strategies, and investment solutions.
Carlyle's corporate private equity business has been one of the largest investors in leveraged buyout transactions over the decade 2004–2014 (or perhaps 2000–2010),[citation needed] while its real estate business has actively acquired commercial real estate. Since its inception, Carlyle has at various times had investments in companies such as Booz Allen Hamilton, Dex Media, Dunkin' Brands, Freescale Semiconductor, Getty Images, HCR Manor Care, Hertz, Kinder Morgan, Nielsen, and United Defense.
Carlyle was founded in 1987 in Washington D.C. by William E. Conway Jr., Daniel A. D'Aniello, and David Rubenstein and currently operates with more than 1,700 employees across 35 offices in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia.

Founding and early history[edit]
Carlyle was founded in 1987 as an investment banking boutique by five original partners with backgrounds in finance and government: William E. Conway, Jr., Stephen L. Norris, David M. Rubenstein, Daniel A. D'Aniello and Greg Rosenbaum.[7] The founding partners named the firm after the Carlyle Hotel in New York City where Norris and Rubenstein had often met to discuss the formation of their new investment business.[8] Rubenstein, who was a Washington-based lawyer, had worked in the Carter Administration. Norris and D'Aneillo had previously worked together at Marriott Corporation while Conway was a finance executive at MCI Communications. Of the founding five partners Rubenstein, Conway and D'Aneillo remain active in the business while Rosenbaum left in the first year[9] and Norris departed in 1995.[8][10] Carlyle was founded with $5 million of financial backing from T. Rowe Price, Alex. Brown & Sons, First Interstate Equities, and the Richard King Mellon family.[11][12]
In the late 1980s, Carlyle raised capital on a deal-by-deal basis to pursue leveraged buyout investments including a failed takeover battle for Chi-Chi's.[9][12] The firm raised its first dedicated buyout fund with $100 million of investor commitments in 1990. In its early years, Carlyle also advised in transactions including a $500 million investment by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a member of the Saudi royal family, in Citigroup in 1991.[12]




The Crusader weapon system, developed by United Defense, Carlyle's largest investment in the defense industry, was cancelled in May 2002[13]


Carlyle initially developed a reputation for acquiring businesses related to the defense industry. In 1992, Carlyle completed the acquisition of the Electronics division of General Dynamics Corporation, renamed GDE Systems, a producer of military electronics systems.[14] Carlyle would later sell the business to Tracor in October 1994.[15] Carlyle acquired Magnavox Electronic Systems, the military communications and electronic-warfare systems segment of Magnavox, from Philips Electronics in 1993.[16] Carlyle sold Magnavox for approximately $370 million to Hughes Aircraft Company in 1995. Carlyle also invested in Vought Aircraft through a partnership with Northrop Grumman.[17] Carlyle's most notable defense industry investment came in October 1997 with its acquisition of United Defense Industries. The $850 million acquisition of United Defense represented Carlyle's largest investment to that point.[13][18] Carlyle was able to complete an IPO of United Defense on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2001 selling a significant portion of its interest in the company. Carlyle completed a sale of its remaining United Defense stock and exited the investment in April 2004.[19] In more recent years, Carlyle has deemphasized its focus on defense industry investments.[20]
Carlyle's 2001 investor conference took place on September 11, 2001. In the weeks following the meeting, it was reported that Shafiq bin Laden, a member of the Bin Laden family, had been the "guest of honor", and that they were investors in Carlyle managed funds.[21][22][23][24][25] Later reports confirmed that the Bin Laden family had invested $2 million into Carlyle's $1.3 billion Carlyle Partners II Fund in 1995, making the family relatively small investors with the firm. However, their overall investment might have been considerably larger, with the $2 million committed in 1995 only being an initial contribution that grew over time.[26] These connections would later be profiled in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911. The Bin Laden family liquidated its holdings in Carlyle's funds in October 2001, just after the September 11th attacks, when the connection of their family name to the Carlyle Group's name became impolitic.[27]
2002–2006[edit]




The Carlyle Group Logo


Following the collapse of the Dot-com bubble in 2000 and 2001, buyout activity declined significantly. Marked by the two-stage buyout of Dex Media at the end of 2002 and 2003, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain significant high yield debt financing and larger transactions could be completed. Carlyle, together with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, led a $7.5 billion buyout of QwestDex. The buyout was the third largest corporate buyout since 1989. QwestDex's purchase occurred in two stages: a $2.75 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media East in November 2002 and a $4.30 billion acquisition of assets known as Dex Media West in 2003. R. H. Donnelley Corporation acquired Dex Media in 2006. Shortly after Dex Media, other larger buyouts would be completed signaling the resurgence in private equity was underway.
Lou Gerstner, former chairman and CEO of IBM and Nabisco, was appointed chairman of Carlyle in January 2003, replacing Frank Carlucci. Gerstner would serve in that position through October 2008.[28][29] The hiring of Gerstner, was intended to reduce the perception of Carlyle as a politically dominated firm.[30] At the time, Carlyle, which had been founded 15 years earlier had accumulated $13.9 billion of assets under management and had generated annualized returns for investors of 36%.[29]
Carlyle also announced the $1.6 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom from Verizon in May 2004.[31] Carlyle's investment was immediately challenged when Hawaii regulators delayed the closing of the buyout. The company also suffered billing and customer-service issues as it had to recreate its back-office systems. Hawaiian Telcom ultimately filed for bankruptcy in December 2008, costing Carlyle the $425 million it had invested in the company.[32]




Carlyle led the $15 billion buyout of Hertz in 2005


As the activity of the large private equity firms increased in the mid-2000s, Carlyle kept pace with such competitors as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Blackstone Group, and TPG Capital. In 2005, Carlyle, together with Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Merrill Lynch completed the $15.0 billion leveraged buyout of The Hertz Corporation, the largest car rental agency from Ford.[33][34]
The following year, in August 2006, Carlyle and its Riverstone Holdings affiliate partnered with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in the $27.5 billion (including assumed debt) acquisition of Kinder Morgan, one of the largest pipeline operators in the US. The buyout was backed by Richard Kinder, the company's co-founder and a former president of Enron.[35]
In September 2006, Carlyle led a consortium, comprising Blackstone Group, Permira and TPG Capital, in the $17.6 billion takeover of Freescale Semiconductor. At the time of its announcement, Freescale would be the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company ever, surpassing the 2005 buyout of SunGard. The buyers were forced to pay an extra $800 million because KKR made a last-minute bid as the original deal was about to be signed. Shortly after the deal closed in late 2006, cell phone sales at Motorola Corp., Freescale's former corporate parent and a major customer, began dropping sharply. In addition, in the recession of 2008–2009, Freescale's chip sales to automakers fell off, and the company came under great financial strain.[36][37]
Earlier that year, in January 2006, Carlyle together with Blackstone Group, AlpInvest Partners, Hellman & Friedman, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Thomas H. Lee Partners acquired Nielsen Company, the global information and media company formerly known as VNU in an $8.9 billion buyout.[38][39][40] Also in 2006, Carlyle acquired Oriental Trading Company which ultimately declared bankruptcy in August 2010[41] as well as Forba Dental Management, the owner of Small Smiles Dental Centers, the largest US chain of dental clinics for children.[42]

In 2000, Carlyle had entered into a joint venture with Riverstone Holdings, an energy and power focused private equity firm founded by Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr. and David M. Leuschen.[48] It was alleged that these payments were in fact bribes or kickbacks, made to pension officials who have been under investigation by New York State Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo.[49] In May 2009, Carlyle agreed to pay $20 million in a settlement with Cuomo and accepted changes to its fundraising practices.[50]

Ownership changes[edit]
For the first 25 years of its existence, Carlyle operated as a private partnership controlled by its investment partners. In 2001, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), which had been an investor in Carlyle managed funds since 1996, acquired a 5.5% holding in Carlyle's management company for $175 million.[91] The investment was valued at approximately $1 billion by 2007 at the height of the 2000s buyout boom.[92]
In September 2007, Mubadala Development Company, an investment vehicle for the government of Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates, purchased a 7.5% stake for $1.35 billion.[92][93]
In February 2008, California legislators targeted Carlyle and Mubdala, proposing a bill that would have barred CalPERS from investing money "with private-equity firms that are partly owned by countries with poor records on human rights." The bill, which was intended to draw attention to the connection between Carlyle and Mubadala Development was later withdrawn.[94]
In May 2012, Carlyle completed an initial public offering of the company, listing under the symbol CG on the NASDAQ. The firm, which at the time managed approximately $147 billion of assets, raised $671 million in the offering. Following the IPO, Carlyle's three remaining founding partners, Rubenstein, D'Aniello and Conway retained the position as the company's largest shareholders.[95]
In June 2017, Carlyle took its non-traded BDC, TCG BDC, Inc., public in the first business development company IPO since 2014.[96][97]
Subsidiaries and joint-ventures[edit]
Carlyle has been actively expanding its investment activities and assets under management through a series of acquisitions and joint-ventures.
Carlyle Capital Corporation[edit]
In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, established in August 2006[98] for the purpose of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its remaining assets.[99] Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans.[100] In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.[101]
On 12 March 2008, BBC News Online reported that "instead of underpinning the mortgage-backed securities market, it seems to have had the opposite effect, giving lenders an opportunity to dump the risky asset" and that Carlyle Capital Corp. "will collapse if, as expected, its lenders seize its remaining assets."[102] On March 16, 2008, Carlyle Capital announced that its Class A Shareholders had voted unanimously in favor of the Corporation filing a petition under Part XVI, Sec. 96, of the Companies Law (1994) of Guernsey[103] for a "compulsory winding up proceeding" to permit all its remaining assets to be liquidated by a court-appointed liquidator.[104]
The losses to the Carlyle Group due to the collapse of Carlyle Capital are reported to be "minimal from a financial standpoint".[105]
In documentaries[edit]
Carlyle has been profiled in two notable documentaries: Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and William Karel's The World According to Bush.
In Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore makes nine allegations concerning the Carlyle Group.[106] Moore focused on Carlyle's connections with George H. W. Bush and his Secretary of State James Baker, both of whom had at times served as advisers to the firm. The movie quotes author Dan Briody, who claimed that the Carlyle Group "gained" from the September 11 attacks because it owned United Defense, a military contractor, although the firm’s $11 billion Crusader artillery rocket system developed for the United States Army is one of the few weapons systems cancelled by the Bush administration.[20] A Carlyle spokesman noted in 2003 that its 7% interest in defense industries was far less than several other Private equity firms.[107] Carlyle also has provided detail on its links with the Bin Laden family, specifically the relatively minor investments by an estranged half brother.[citation needed]
In The World According to Bush, William Karel interviewed Frank Carlucci to discuss the presence of Shafiq bin Laden, Osama bin Laden's estranged brother, at Carlyle's annual investor conference while the September 11 attacks were occurring.[22][108]

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of The Carlyle Group L.P. (the "Partnership"). Such analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Overview We conduct our operations through four reportable segments: Corporate Private Equity, Real Assets, Global Market Strategies, and Investment Solutions.   Corporate Private Equity - Our Corporate Private Equity segment advises our 20 buyout and 10 growth capital funds, which seek a wide variety of investments of different sizes and growth potentials. As of March 31, 2017, our Corporate Private Equity segment had approximately $53 billion in AUM and approximately $37 billion in Fee-earning AUM.   Real Assets - Our Real Assets segment advises our ten U.S. and internationally focused real estate funds, our two infrastructure funds, our two power funds, our international energy fund, as well as our four Legacy Energy funds (funds that we jointly advise with Riverstone). The segment also includes five NGP management fee funds and three carry funds advised by NGP. As of March 31, 2017, our Real Assets segment had approximately $36 billion in AUM and over $27 billion in Fee-earning AUM.   Global Market Strategies - Our Global Market Strategies segment advises a group of 57 funds that pursue investment opportunities across structured credit, distressed debt, corporate and energy mezzanine debt, and middle-market and senior debt. As of March 31, 2017, our Global Market Strategies segment had over $29 billion in AUM and over $24 billion in Fee-earning AUM.   Investment Solutions - Our Investment Solutions segment advises global private equity and real estate fund of funds programs and related co-investment and secondary activities across 173 fund vehicles. As of March 31, 2017, our Investment Solutions segment had approximately $44 billion in AUM and over $26 billion in Fee-earning AUM.  We earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements with the investment funds that we manage and fees for transaction advisory and oversight services provided to portfolio companies of these funds. We also typically receive a performance fee from an investment fund, which may be either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income, which we refer to as a carried interest, in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"), we are required to consolidate some of the investment funds that we advise. However, for segment reporting purposes, we present revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates these investment funds. Accordingly, our segment revenues primarily consist of fund management and related advisory fees, performance fees (consisting of incentive fees and carried interest allocations), investment income, including realized and unrealized gains on our investments in our funds and other trading securities, as well as interest and other income. Our segment expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits expenses, including salaries, bonuses, performance payment arrangements, and equity-based compensation excluding awards granted in our initial public offering or in connection with acquisitions and strategic investments, and general and administrative expenses. While our segment expenses include depreciation and interest expense, our segment expenses exclude acquisition-related charges and amortization of intangibles and impairment. Refer to Note 17 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on the differences between our financial results reported pursuant to U.S. GAAP and our financial results for segment reporting purposes.

Certain of our recent vintage funds are currently in fundraising and total capital commitments are subject to change. In addition, certain carry funds included herein may be disclosed which are not included in fund performance if they have not made an initial capital call.  (2) Includes NGP ETP I, NGP M&R, NGP ETP II, NGP VIII and NGP IX.  Trends Affecting our Business  During 2016 and into 2017, significant events in the global political landscape  Developments at the Federal Reserve during the first quarter appear to have eased concerns of market participants that larger fiscal deficits in the U.S. or accelerating inflation tied to rising commodity prices and tighter labor markets could force the Federal Reserve to raise rates at a faster pace than was expected by the futures markets. Instead, the Federal Reserve has signaled that it anticipates only three rate increases this year, which would not be expected to cause significant downward pressure on the valuations of private equity assets, real estate or the net asset values of fixed income products or markedly increase the cost of financing for acquisition transactions.  During the first quarter, transaction financing generally was readily available on favorable terms in both the U.S. and Europe and global leveraged loan issuance in the first quarter was stronger than in any quarter since 2007. During the first quarter, global private equity-backed acquisitions totaled $60 billion, which was nearly three-times larger than the volume observed in 2016 and well above the quarterly average over the prior five years. We anticipate that the combination of continued access to favorable financing and an abundance of capital available to invest by many private equity sponsors and strategic buyers will continue to boost M&A activity levels for the remainder of 2017. Asset prices remain high, but despite the competitive market for transactions, we have continued to identify and close on investments with strong underlying business fundamentals that meet our strategic objectives and investment criteria. In particular, we have sharpened our focus on transactions where our investment teams have a particular edge, such as having deep industry experience, the ability to handle complex corporate carve outs or relationships with strong management teams whose talents are aligned with a particular business challenge. During the first quarter, we invested $4.4 billion in capital through our carry funds and realized proceeds of $3.5 billion, just over half of which was from our Investment Solutions segment where realized proceeds do not yet generate significant realized performance fees for us. Realized proceeds are expected to be more variable on a quarterly basis this year as compared to prior periods because a smaller percentage of our carry fund portfolio is in liquid, public securities.  The positive economic climate and the strong underlying performance of many of the portfolio companies in our funds facilitated the appreciation of our carry funds during the first quarter following the significant appreciation achieved by our largest carry funds during 2016. During the first quarter, our overall carry fund portfolio valuation increased 6%, with a 9% increase in our Corporate Private Equity funds, a 5% increase in our Real Assets funds, a 7% increase in our Global Market Strategies funds and a 3% increase in our Investment Solutions funds. Our private portfolio appreciated by 8% and our public portfolio appreciated by 7% during the quarter, excluding Investment Solutions.  Although we achieved strong results for the quarter, driven by strong appreciation across our portfolio, we continue to view 2017 as a transition year for our business. We anticipate raising $100 billion in gross new capital over the four-year period that began in 2016 continuing through the end of 2019. During the first quarter of 2017, we raised $3 billion of new capital and we expect an accelerating level of fundraising for the remainder of 2017 and over the next two years. Future fund closings are likely to be weighted towards Real Assets in 2017, while we anticipate that fundraising in Corporate Private Equity will accelerate later in 2017 and more so into 2018. In addition, we have several credit and Investment Solutions funds that also will be raising capital in the next several years. Our high level of realizations over the past several quarters has lowered our Fee-Earning Assets Under Management, which has resulted in lower levels of Fee-Related Earnings. During the balance of 2017, Fee-Related Earnings will likely remain below 2016 levels in large part due to fundraising costs, but also as a result of further investment in growing our credit business. We expect that Fee-Earning Assets Under Management and Fee-Related Earnings will grow in 2018 after raising new capital and activating the related fees.  Recent Transactions  Transaction with Claren Road  Strategic Investment in NGP  Key Financial Measures  Revenues  Fund management fees exclude the reimbursement of any partnership expenses paid by the Partnership on behalf of the Carlyle funds pursuant to the limited partnership agreements, including amounts related to the pursuit of actual, proposed, or unconsummated investments, professional fees, expenses associated with the acquisition, holding and disposition of investments, and other fund administrative expenses.  funds." Carried interest revenue, which historically has comprised over 80% of all performance fees in our consolidated financial statements, is recognized by Carlyle upon appreciation of the valuation of our funds' investments above certain return hurdles as set forth in each respective partnership agreement and is based on the amount that would be due to us pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were liquidated at such date. Accordingly, the amount of carried interest recognized as performance fees reflects our share of the fair value gains and losses of the associated funds' underlying investments measured at their then-current fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period. As a result, the performance fees earned in an applicable reporting period are not indicative of any future period, as fair values are based on conditions prevalent as of the reporting date. Refer to "- Trends Affecting our Business" for further discussion. In addition to its performance fees from our Corporate Private Equity and Real Assets funds and closed-end carry funds in the Global Market Strategies segment, we are also entitled to receive performance fees from our Investment Solutions and NGP carry funds. The timing of performance fee realizations for these funds is typically later than in our other carry funds based on the terms of such arrangements.   $186.9 million from Carlyle Partners V, L.P. ("CP V") (with total AUM of approximately $6.0 billion), and $145.7 million from Carlyle Asia Partners IV, L.P. ("CAP IV") (with total AUM of approximately $4.7 billion).  Performance fees in excess of 10% of the total for the three months ended March 31, 2016 were generated primarily from the following funds:  As of March 31, 2017, accrued performance fees and accrued giveback obligations were approximately $3.0 billion and $161.2 million, respectively. Each balance assumes a hypothetical liquidation of the funds' investments at March 31, 2017 at their then current fair values. These assets and liabilities will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the fair values of the fund investments until they are realized. As of March 31, 2017, approximately $102.6 million of the accrued giveback obligation is the responsibility of various current and former senior Carlyle professionals and other limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships, and the net accrued giveback obligation attributable to Carlyle Holdings is $58.6 million. The Partnership uses "net accrued performance fees" to refer to the accrued performance fees net of accrued giveback obligations, accrued performance fee compensation, performance fee-related tax obligations, and accrued performance fees attributable to non-controlling interests and excludes any net accrued performance fees that have been realized but will be collected in subsequent periods. Net accrued performance fees as of March 31, 2017 are $1.4 billion.  May 03, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
