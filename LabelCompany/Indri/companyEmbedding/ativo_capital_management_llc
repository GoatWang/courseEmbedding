Our Story

Ativo’s 40-Year Legacy


Ativo began managing equity portfolios in 2001. However, our origins date back to 1971 with the formation of Callard, Madden & Associates(CMA), our predecessor firm.
Ricardo Bekin, our Chief Investment Officer, was a senior member of the CMA team. Driven by his competitive spirit, he decided to take the firm’s work a step further by using Discounted Cash Flow Return on Investment and other proprietary research to manage equity portfolios. Ativo Capital Management was created for this purpose, born out of sound financial theory and valuation techniques that have been proven over time.
Firm Overview
Ativo Capital Management is an investment advisor focused on delivering top quartile performance and exceptional service to institutional clients. We follow a rules-based process that combines quantitative methodologies with a fundamental overlay to build long-only equity portfolios. We invest globally, with an emphasis on international markets. Central to our approach is a proprietary model that scores stocks based on our assessment of their intrinsic value, price momentum and other important factors.
A History of Success
Ativo’s international investment strategies generally have very competitive track records and strong since inception returns. Testament to their success, our firm has experienced steady growth throughout the years. The challenging 2008 market had no effect on our financial viability, and we rebounded quickly from the downturn with substantial gains in assets under management in 2009. While aspiring to grow, we carefully manage our growth. By doing so, we have preserved the integrity of our investment approach and the high level of service we provide clients and consultants.

Oil, China and Prospects for the US Economy
Thursday, May 12, 2016
POSTED BY Robert Aliber

April 15, 2016 Global stock markets were off to a rocky start in 2016. Was the sharp decline in U.S. stock prices early in the year a signal that the economic expansion that began in 2009 is about to end, or is the canard “The stock market has predicted five of the last three recessions” again relevant? The dramatic decline in petroleum prices has contributed to the malaise of the residents of the ten U.S.states that produce 80 percent of domestic crude oil. The prices of oil company stocks are down sharply.  Real GDP and household incomes have declined…

Does the Stock Market Really Ruin the Economy?
Wednesday, February 10, 2016
POSTED BY D. N. Aust /   2 COMMENTS 

Last week’s Wall Street Journal (2/1/2016) featured an article (Does the Economy Ruin the Stock Market Or Does the Stock Market Ruin the Economy, gated) citing recent work by UCLA economist Roger Farmer questioning whether the recent market rout simply reflects the economy, or whether a weak stock market is crashing the economy. After summarizing the conventional perspective that discounted future earnings determine market pricing, the article conceded that maybe, just maybe, stock market patterns could be influencing the real economy. Our reaction? What took you so long?! We’ve been making that case for more than thirty-five years. Of…

Capital Gains and the Candidates
Friday, September 4, 2015
POSTED BY D. N. Aust

Alan Reynolds’ piece in the Wall Street Journal (September 2, 2015) reminded us of recent internal discussions regarding the link between Presidential campaigns, tax proposals and equity prices. These deliberations centered on the degree to which recent market turmoil could be attributed to talk of substantial increases in capital gains tax rates. Ativo has long believed that the interaction between inflation and taxes strongly influences the real cost of equity capital and therefore stock prices. Briefly, stock prices reflect investor expectations of a relatively stable real after-tax return. The cost of capital adjusts to offset the effect of inflation…

Ativo’s Summer Reading List
Tuesday, July 28, 2015
POSTED BY D. N. Aust

In recognition of a summer vacation tradition, we’re taking a break from serious commentary to share what the Ativo team has been reading.   As this reflects our personal summer reading, it is furnished “as is,” without warranty of any kind. Ram Gandikota, Senior Portfolio Manager & Associate Director of Research, is reading Steve Pinker’s “The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined” and “Business Adventures” by John Brooks, which he describes as “a collection of fascinating stories” that are “still relevant today in understanding how corporations function.” Senior Performance Analyst Amanda Dice is busy studying for her…

China’s Andy Warhol Moment
Wednesday, July 22, 2015
POSTED BY Robert Aliber

A brief visit to Beijing last month. The conference organizers had provided a plane ticket to Hong Kong and a stopover in Beijing added $100 to the plane ticket. Great weather in Beijing. No smog. Few traffic jams. And the boulevards were lined with billions of roses. Visits to Tsinghua and Peking Universities for presentations. The fit and finish of the academic buildings are superb. The quality of the autos in the parking spaces on both campuses was impressive. Faculty offices spacious. The lunch at the restaurant at faculty club at Peking University was superb. The Chicago center in…

Currency Wars

POSTED BY Robert Aliber

One of the most memorable phrases in the literature on international finance is “beggar-thy-neighbor”–a term used by a distinguished British economist in the mid-1930s to describe the declines in the prices of the British pound, the U.S. dollar and several other currencies in terms of gold from 1930 to 1937. Supposedly each country reduced the price of its currency in the effort to increase exports, and hence employment in its manufacturing sector at the expense of its trading partners. The declines in the prices of individual currencies occurred over a six year period, much like a slow motion version…

A Catechism on the Greek Tragedy
Friday, July 10, 2015
POSTED BY Robert Aliber

Q: What do Bernie Madoff and Alexis Tsipras have in common? A: Both have been involved in Ponzi finance. But there is a difference, the Government of Greece has been involved in Ponzi finance since Greece joined the Euro in 2002. A variant on the Willie Sutton line, “If the money is there, take it.” Q: What do you mean when you say “Greece has been involved in Ponzi finance?’ A: Sure, for most of the last thirteen years until 2014, the purchases of the IOUs of the Government of Greece by various banks and government agencies in Northern…

Continuing Evolution of the Greek Crisis – June 30, 2015
Wednesday, July 1, 2015
POSTED BY Robert Aliber

The next few developments in the unfolding of the tragedy in Athens are predictable. The Tsipras government is lefty and spastic; its response to a problem will be more controls. There are controls on cross border payments and apparently there are controls on withdrawals from ATMs. These controls will enable the banks to delay the dates when they can no longer run replenish the Euro notes in the ATMs. But the planes that have brought these notes from Frankfurt to Athens are no longer flying. Why will anyone accept the limits on their choices that the government proclaims? There…

The Resolution of the Crisis in Athens
Friday, June 26, 2015
POSTED BY Robert Aliber

Last week I visited Reykjavik to present the draft of a chapter on international monetary reform to the Department of Economics at the University. The city is booming, the cranes have returned and the restaurants are full. The country is more or less at full employment. Ironically, the crisis in Iceland and then the volcanic eruption has put the country as a mecca for tourists. The global financial crisis impacted Iceland in 2008 and 2009 at about the same time as it hit the United States, Britain, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece. The United States is at full employment….

What Sets Us Apart

Ativo capitalizes on a number of strengths and attributes as we work toward our goal of producing top quartile investment performance. These characteristics define who we are and distinguish us from other managers.




Focus on Real Economic Performance
We adjust companies’ financial statements to correct the cash flow measurement problems that result from adherence to accounting regulations. These adjustments give us visibility into the underlying economics of the companies in our research universe.

Proven, Proprietary Model
Our investment process is anchored in our multi-factor model, which has a long, successful history of identifying stocks poised to outperform and those that will lag. We (and our predecessor firm) have been refining and improving the model throughout the last 40 years.

Non-traditional Approach to Systematic Investing
Compared to other systematic managers, our portfolios are relatively concentrated. Our bottom-up process and high “active share” further distinguish us from our competitors.

“Right-sized” Organization
Ativo is large enough to bring considerable human and technological resources to bear on each client relationship. At the same time, we are small enough to respond quickly to new information and to be nimble when implementing our strategies.

Stability
Our strong leadership, ownership structure and cohesive culture have resulted in minimal professional turnover at Ativo. The stability of our team stands out in an industry that has experienced extraordinary change during the past several years.

What are analysts saying about Quanex Building Products Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Quanex Building Products Corporation stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "QUANEX BUILDING PRODUCTS CORPORATION is a leading manufacturer of engineered materials and components for the U.S. building products market. The Company operates two segments: Engineered Building Products designs proprietary window and door systems and produces fabricated metal, wood and vinyl window and door components, spacer/sealant systems and other products for major window and door manufacturers that primarily serve the residential construction and remodeling markets. Aluminum Sheet Building Products produces coated and mill finish aluminum sheet products for the building and construction market, as well as other capital goods and transportation markets.   " (3/10/2017)
2. Wedbush analysts commented, "Quanex Building Products (NX) results were slightly ahead of our expectations with FY17 guidance coming in mostly as expected with organic growth of 5-6% more than offset by the strategic changes well under way within the company's operations. In reducing North American Engineered Components (NAEC) and North American Cabinetry Components (NACC) footprint, NX is experiencing adjusted EBITDA (AEBITDA) margin expansion. Importantly, we believe further margin can be achieved when NX puts forth price increases for the new/revised portfolio. In the interim, NX is generating $1.60-1.80 of free cash flow per share and leverage remains on track to be ~2.2x by the end of FY17." (3/8/2017)
