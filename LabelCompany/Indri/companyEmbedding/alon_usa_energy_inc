Expansion[edit]
Alon U.S.A. announced it would buy Paramount Petroleum Corp. for $307 million cash, and assume $100 million in debt. The deal closed in August 2006.
Alon U.S.A. also plans to buy the assets of Edgington Oil Co. for $52 million cash, a deal delayed in closing due to an FTC request for further information.
Among Paramount's assets are a 54,000 barrels per day (8,600 m3/d) refinery in Paramount, California, and seven asphalt terminals. Edgington is a topping refinery located in Long Beach, California with a listed capacity of about 40,000 barrels per day (6,400 m3/d).
In July 2006 Alon USA closed on the transaction to purchase 40 convenience stores from Good Time Stores.
In March 2007 Alon USA announced that it would purchase Abilene Based Skinny's convenience stores for 70 million dollars.
In May 2008 Valero announced they had sold the 85,000 BPD Krotz Springs, Louisiana refinery to Alon USA for $433 million.
On June 2, 2010 Alon announced that it has completed the acquisition of the Bakersfield, California refinery from Big West of California, LLC, a subsidiary of Flying J Inc. The purchase price of the Bakersfield transaction, including substantially all of the assets of Big West, consists of $40 million in cash. The Company also acquired the Bakersfield refinery's existing inventory as of the closing date of the transaction. The Bakersfield refinery is located in California's Central Valley and has the capacity to refine up to 70,000 barrels per day of crude oil. The refinery is supplied by crude oil produced in the San Joaquin Valley with its products marketed in California, and is a major provider of motor fuels in central California.
Merger with Delek US[edit]
On July 1, 2017, Delek US Holdings Inc., Brentwood, Tenn., completed its purchase of Alon Israel Oil Co. Ltd.’s US-based refining and marketing subsidiary Alon USA Energy Inc.[3]As part of the all-stock transaction, Delek acquired the remaining 53% of Alon USA’s common stock not already owned by Delek. The combined company will be led primarily by Delek US’ existing management team.
Refinery explosion[edit]
On February 18, 2008, an explosion occurred at an oil refinery in Big Spring, Texas owned by Alon USA. The plant employs about 170 employees and has a capacity of 70,000 barrels (11,000 m3) of oil a day. This event has caused portions of Interstate 20 to be shut down. Initial reports state that four workers were injured.[4] In addition to the four workers, a passing motorist on Interstate 20 sustained an injury when debris struck her vehicle, according to local reports.[5] According to a press release by the company on February 19, the explosion occurred in the area around the propylene splitter unit, although the cause has not yet been determined.[6] Information on the company's website states that ALON USA acquired ownership of the Big Spring, Texas refinery in August 2000, when ALON Israel Oil Company Ltd. purchased the U.S. fuels marketing and refining assets of Atofina Petrochemicals, Inc. (FINA). The refinery has been in service for more than 75 years, and produces fuel products and asphalt for the southwestern United States. It was constructed in 1928 by the original owner, Joshua Cosden.

Expansion[edit]
Alon U.S.A. announced it would buy Paramount Petroleum Corp. for $307 million cash, and assume $100 million in debt. The deal closed in August 2006.
Alon U.S.A. also plans to buy the assets of Edgington Oil Co. for $52 million cash, a deal delayed in closing due to an FTC request for further information.
Among Paramount's assets are a 54,000 barrels per day (8,600 m3/d) refinery in Paramount, California, and seven asphalt terminals. Edgington is a topping refinery located in Long Beach, California with a listed capacity of about 40,000 barrels per day (6,400 m3/d).
In July 2006 Alon USA closed on the transaction to purchase 40 convenience stores from Good Time Stores.
In March 2007 Alon USA announced that it would purchase Abilene Based Skinny's convenience stores for 70 million dollars.
In May 2008 Valero announced they had sold the 85,000 BPD Krotz Springs, Louisiana refinery to Alon USA for $433 million.
On June 2, 2010 Alon announced that it has completed the acquisition of the Bakersfield, California refinery from Big West of California, LLC, a subsidiary of Flying J Inc. The purchase price of the Bakersfield transaction, including substantially all of the assets of Big West, consists of $40 million in cash. The Company also acquired the Bakersfield refinery's existing inventory as of the closing date of the transaction. The Bakersfield refinery is located in California's Central Valley and has the capacity to refine up to 70,000 barrels per day of crude oil. The refinery is supplied by crude oil produced in the San Joaquin Valley with its products marketed in California, and is a major provider of motor fuels in central California.
Merger with Delek US[edit]
On July 1, 2017, Delek US Holdings Inc., Brentwood, Tenn., completed its purchase of Alon Israel Oil Co. Ltd.’s US-based refining and marketing subsidiary Alon USA Energy Inc.[3]As part of the all-stock transaction, Delek acquired the remaining 53% of Alon USA’s common stock not already owned by Delek. The combined company will be led primarily by Delek US’ existing management team.
Refinery explosion[edit]
On February 18, 2008, an explosion occurred at an oil refinery in Big Spring, Texas owned by Alon USA. The plant employs about 170 employees and has a capacity of 70,000 barrels (11,000 m3) of oil a day. This event has caused portions of Interstate 20 to be shut down. Initial reports state that four workers were injured.[4] In addition to the four workers, a passing motorist on Interstate 20 sustained an injury when debris struck her vehicle, according to local reports.[5] According to a press release by the company on February 19, the explosion occurred in the area around the propylene splitter unit, although the cause has not yet been determined.[6] Information on the company's website states that ALON USA acquired ownership of the Big Spring, Texas refinery in August 2000, when ALON Israel Oil Company Ltd. purchased the U.S. fuels marketing and refining assets of Atofina Petrochemicals, Inc. (FINA). The refinery has been in service for more than 75 years, and produces fuel products and asphalt for the southwestern United States. It was constructed in 1928 by the original owner, Joshua Cosden.

DALLAS, May 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Alon USA Energy, Inc. (NYSE:    ALJ) ("Alon") today announced results for the first quarter of 2017. Net income available to stockholders for the first quarter of 2017 was $7.3 million, or $0.10 per share, compared to net loss available to stockholders of $(35.5) million, or $(0.51) per share, for the same period last year. Excluding special items, Alon recorded net income available to stockholders of $8.8 million, or $0.12 per share, for the first quarter of 2017, compared to net loss available to stockholders of $(29.2) million, or $(0.42) per share, for the same period last year.


Alan Moret, CEO, commented, "We are very pleased with our strong operational performance in the first quarter of 2017, with both of our refineries setting quarterly total throughput records. Our operations were complemented by an improvement in our benchmark Gulf Coast crack spreads relative to the fourth quarter of 2016 and the same quarter last year. Our first quarter results also benefited from the reduction to RINs expense that was booked during the quarter. We have been encouraged by the positive trends we have seen in refining into the second quarter of 2017, including improved discounts for Midland-priced crudes and improved crack spreads.
"The Big Spring refinery achieved record quarterly total throughput of almost 78,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2017. The refinery operating margin of $10.32 per barrel benefited from a strong wholesale marketing environment. Direct operating expense was only $3.54 per barrel as a result of efficient operations. We expect total throughput at the Big Spring refinery to average 73,000 barrels per day for the second quarter of 2017 and 75,000 barrels per day for the full year of 2017.
"The Krotz Springs refinery ran very well in the first quarter of 2017, with total throughput exceeding 77,000 barrels per day setting a new record under our ownership. The refinery operating margin of $5.31 per barrel does not include the $27.7 million benefit from the renewable fuel standard exemption. As was previously announced, in February 2017 the EPA approved a small refinery exemption for the Krotz Springs refinery from the requirements of the renewable fuel standard for the 2016 calendar year. On an after-tax basis, the impact of the exemption was $19.2 million or $0.27 per share. The Krotz Springs refinery's direct operating expense of $3.21 per barrel was very low and reflects continued efforts to control costs at the refinery. We expect total throughput at the Krotz Springs refinery to average 75,000 barrels per day for the second quarter of 2017 and 74,000 barrels per day for the full year of 2017.
"Turning to our retail segment, our fuel sales volumes increased by 6.2 percent in the first quarter of 2017 relative to the same quarter last year, despite a lower store count in the first quarter of 2017. Same-store fuel sales volumes were up 6.7 percent in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect this business to improve as activity in the Permian Basin accelerates and as summer driving season begins."
Shai Even, Senior Vice President and CFO, commented, "The profitability of our California renewable fuels facility in the first quarter of 2017 was negatively impacted by the expiration of the federal blender's tax credit on December 31, 2016. As a result, the facility generated a small operating loss in the first quarter of 2017. However, if the blender's tax credit is reinstated and becomes effective retroactively to the beginning of 2017, we will record additional pre-tax income of $8.8 million before the effect of non-controlling interest. Total throughput for the first quarter of 2017 averaged approximately 2,700 barrels per day."
FIRST QUARTER 2017
Special items reduced net income by $1.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of employee retention expenses of $2.0 million and expenses related to the Delek merger of $2.0 million, partially offset by gains of $1.7 million related to an asphalt inventory adjustment and $0.5 million associated with gains recognized on disposition of assets, before income tax and non-controlling interest impacts of $0.4 million. Special items increased net loss by $6.3 million for the first quarter of 2016 primarily as a result of employee retention expenses of $4.7 million, unrealized losses of $3.3 million associated with commodity swaps and $2.1 million associated with losses recognized on disposition of assets, before income tax and non-controlling interest impacts of $3.8 million.
The combined total refinery average throughput for the first quarter of 2017 was 155,081 barrels per day ("bpd"), consisting of 77,754 bpd at the Big Spring refinery and 77,327 bpd at the Krotz Springs refinery, compared to a combined total refinery average throughput of 138,998 bpd for the first quarter of 2016, consisting of 67,536 bpd at the Big Spring refinery and 71,462 bpd at the Krotz Springs refinery. During the first quarter of 2017, both of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries reported the highest total quarterly average throughput since their respective acquisitions. The reduced throughput at our Big Spring refinery during the first quarter of 2016 was the result of planned downtime to complete a reformer regeneration and catalyst replacement for our diesel hydrotreater unit. The reduced throughput at the Krotz Springs refinery during the first quarter of 2016 was the result of our election to reduce the crude rate in order to optimize the refinery yield.
Refinery operating margin at the Big Spring refinery was $10.32 per barrel for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $7.77 per barrel for the same period in 2016. This increase in operating margin was primarily due to a higher Gulf Coast 3/2/1 crack spread and a widening of the WTI Cushing to WTS spread, partially offset by the increased premium in WTI Midland compared to WTI Cushing, increased RINs costs and a reduced benefit from the contango market environment which increased the cost of crude.
Refinery operating margin at the Krotz Springs refinery was $5.31 per barrel for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $1.59 per barrel for the same period in 2016. This increase in operating margin was primarily due to a higher Gulf Coast 2/1/1 high sulfur diesel crack spread and reduced RINs costs, partially offset by the increased premium in WTI Midland compared to WTI Cushing and a reduced benefit from the contango market environment which increased the cost of crude.
In February 2017, the EPA approved a small refinery exemption for the Krotz Springs refinery from the requirements of the renewable fuel standard for the 2016 calendar year, resulting in a reduction to RINs expense of $27.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.
The average Gulf Coast 3/2/1 crack spread was $13.75 per barrel for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $11.24 per barrel for the same period in 2016. The average Gulf Coast 2/1/1 high sulfur diesel crack spread was $9.74 per barrel for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $6.74 per barrel for the same period in 2016.
The average WTI Cushing to WTI Midland spread for the first quarter of 2017 was $(0.64) per barrel compared to $(0.13) per barrel for the same period in 2016. The average WTI Cushing to WTS spread for the first quarter of 2017 was $1.27 per barrel compared to $(0.10) per barrel for the same period in 2016. The average LLS to WTI Cushing spread for the first quarter of 2017 was $1.58 per barrel compared to $1.60 per barrel for the same period in 2016. The average Brent to WTI Cushing spread for the first quarter of 2017 was $1.66 per barrel compared to $0.49 per barrel for the same period in 2016. The average Brent to LLS spread for the first quarter of 2017 was $(0.13) per barrel compared to $(0.89) per barrel for the same period in 2016.
The average RINs cost effect on the Big Spring refinery operating margin was $0.59 per barrel for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $0.13 per barrel for the same period in 2016. The average RINs cost effect on the Krotz Springs refinery operating margin, excluding the impact of the 2016 exemption, was $1.49 per barrel for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $1.60 per barrel for the same period in 2016.
The contango environment in the first quarter of 2017 created an average cost of crude benefit of $1.00 per barrel compared to an average cost of crude benefit of $1.83 per barrel for the same period in 2016.
Our California renewable fuels facility generated operating income (loss) of $(2.4) million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $7.2 million for the first quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the expiration of the blender's tax credit on December 31, 2016.
Asphalt margins for the first quarter of 2017 were $78.45 per ton compared to $84.16 per ton for the same period in 2016. On a cash basis (i.e., excluding inventory effects), asphalt margins in the first quarter of 2017 were $74.39 per ton compared to $91.12 per ton in the first quarter of 2016.
Retail fuel margins decreased to 19.5 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2017 from 19.9 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2016. Retail fuel sales volume increased to 53.1 million gallons in the first quarter of 2017 from 50.0 million gallons in the first quarter of 2016.
Alon also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared the regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share. The dividend is payable on June 8, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 22, 2017.

 The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) available to stockholders under United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") to adjusted net income (loss) available to stockholders utilized in determining adjusted earnings (loss) per share, excluding after-tax employee retention expense, after-tax expenses related to Delek merger, after-tax gains on asphalt inventory adjustment, after-tax unrealized losses on commodity swaps and after-tax (gain) loss on disposition of assets. Adjusted net income (loss) available to stockholders is not a recognized measurement under GAAP; however, the amounts included in adjusted net income (loss) available to stockholders are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements. Our management believes that the presentation of adjusted net income (loss) available to stockholders and adjusted earnings (loss) per share, excluding these items, is useful to investors because it provides a more meaningful measurement for evaluation of our Company's operating results.

 Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, depreciation and amortization, (gain) loss on disposition of assets and unrealized losses on commodity swaps. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP; however, the amounts included in Adjusted EBITDA are derived from amounts included in our consolidated financial statements. Our management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. In addition, our management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, (gain) loss on disposition of assets, unrealized losses on commodity swaps and the accounting effects of capital expenditures and acquisitions, items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. 







 Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 

















 • 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;  





 • 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;  





 • 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the prior claim that non-controlling interest have on the income generated by non-wholly-owned subsidiaries;  





 • 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs; and  





 • 
 Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from EBITDA calculations of other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 













 Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally. 







 The following table reconciles net income (loss) available to stockholders to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016:

 Adjusted EBITDA does not exclude gains of $1,713 and $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, resulting from a price adjustment related to asphalt inventory. 






 (6) 
 Includes corporate capital expenditures of $86 and $1,436 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are not allocated to our three operating segments. 






 (7) 
 During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we adopted the FASB's recently issued accounting guidance simplifying the presentation of deferred income taxes. As a result of adopting this guidance, our current deferred income tax asset that had previously been included as a current asset in our consolidated balance sheets has been reclassified as a reduction of our non-current deferred income tax liability. These changes have been applied retrospectively to all periods presented. 






 (8) 
 Net sales include intersegment sales to our asphalt and retail segments at prices which approximate wholesale market prices. These intersegment sales are eliminated through consolidation of our financial statements. 






 (9) 
 Refinery operating margin is a per barrel measurement calculated by dividing the margin between net sales and cost of sales (exclusive of certain adjustments) attributable to each refinery by the refinery's throughput volumes. Industry-wide refining results are driven and measured by the margins between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil, which are referred to as crack spreads. We compare our refinery operating margins to these crack spreads to assess our operating performance relative to other participants in our industry. 







 The refinery operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2017 excludes a benefit of $27,746 related to the EPA approval of a small refinery exemption for the Krotz Springs refinery from the requirements of the renewable fuel standard for the 2016 calendar year. The refinery operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2016 excludes realized and unrealized gains on commodity swaps of $366. 






 (10) 
 The California renewable fuels facility operating margin is a per barrel measurement calculated by dividing the facility's margin between net sales and cost of sales by the facility's throughput volumes. Included in net sales are environmental credits in the form of RINs, low-carbon fuel standards credits and blender's tax credits, when effective, generated by the facility. 







 During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we received no benefit from the federal blender's tax credit as this legislation expired on December 31, 2016. However, if the blender's tax credit is reinstated and becomes effective retroactive to the beginning of 2017, we will record additional pre-tax income of $8,778, or $37.00 per barrel of throughput, related to product sales during the first quarter of 2017 at the California renewable fuels facility. 






 (11) 
 Refinery direct operating expense is a per barrel measurement calculated by dividing direct operating expenses at our refineries by the applicable refinery's total throughput volumes. 






 (12) 
 We compare our Big Spring refinery's operating margin to the Gulf Coast 3/2/1 crack spread. A Gulf Coast 3/2/1 crack spread is calculated assuming that three barrels of WTI Cushing crude oil are converted, or cracked, into two barrels of Gulf Coast conventional gasoline and one barrel of Gulf Coast ultra-low sulfur diesel. 







 We compare our Krotz Springs refinery's operating margin to the Gulf Coast 2/1/1 high sulfur diesel crack spread. A Gulf Coast 2/1/1 high sulfur diesel crack spread is calculated assuming that two barrels of LLS crude oil are converted into one barrel of Gulf Coast conventional gasoline and one barrel of Gulf Coast high sulfur diesel. 






 (13) 
 The WTI Cushing less WTI Midland spread represents the differential between the average price per barrel of WTI Cushing crude oil and the average price per barrel of WTI Midland crude oil. The WTI Cushing less WTS, or sweet/sour, spread represents the differential between the average price per barrel of WTI Cushing crude oil and the average price per barrel of WTS crude oil. The LLS less WTI Cushing spread represents the differential between the average price per barrel of LLS crude oil and the average price per barrel of WTI Cushing crude oil. The Brent less WTI Cushing spread represents the differential between the average price per barrel of Brent crude oil and the average price per barrel of WTI Cushing crude oil. The Brent less LLS spread represents the differential between the average price per barrel of Brent crude oil and the average price per barrel of LLS crude oil. 






 (14) 
 Total refinery throughput represents the total barrels per day of crude oil and blendstock inputs in the refinery production process. Total throughput for the California renewable fuels facility represents the total barrels per day of tallow and vegetable oils used by the facility for the period following March 1, 2016. 






 (15) 
 Total refinery production represents the barrels per day of various products produced from processing crude and other refinery feedstocks through the crude units and other conversion units at the refineries. Total production for the California renewable fuels facility represents the total barrels per day produced from processing tallow and vegetable oils through the facility's units for the period following March 1, 2016. 






 (16) 
 Refinery utilization represents average daily crude oil throughput divided by crude oil capacity, excluding planned periods of downtime for maintenance and turnarounds. 






 (17) 
 Net sales and cost of sales include asphalt purchases sold as part of a supply and offtake arrangement of $13,397 and $14,118 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The volumes associated with these sales are excluded from the Key Operating Statistics. 






 (18) 
 Cost of sales includes intersegment purchases of asphalt blends and motor fuels from our refining and marketing segment at prices which approximate wholesale market prices. These intersegment purchases are eliminated through consolidation of our financial statements. 






 (19) 
 Blended asphalt represents base material asphalt that has been blended with other materials necessary to sell the asphalt as a finished product. 






 (20) 
 Non-blended asphalt represents base material asphalt and other components that require additional blending before being sold as a finished product. 






 (21) 
 Asphalt margin is a per ton measurement calculated by dividing the margin between net sales and cost of sales by the total sales volume. Asphalt margins are used in the asphalt industry to measure operating results related to asphalt sales. 







 Asphalt margin excludes gains of $1,713 and $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, resulting from a price adjustment related to asphalt inventory. These gains are included in operating loss of the asphalt segment. 






 (22) 
 At March 31, 2017, we had 304 retail convenience stores of which 294 sold fuel. At March 31, 2016, we had 309 retail convenience stores of which 298 sold fuel. 






 (23) 
 Retail fuel margin represents the difference between retail fuel sales revenue and the net cost of purchased retail fuel, including transportation costs and associated excise taxes, expressed on a cents-per-gallon basis. Retail fuel margins are frequently used in the retail industry to measure operating results related to retail fuel sales. 






 (24) 
 Retail fuel sales price per gallon represents the average sales price for retail fuels sold through our retail convenience stores. 






 (25) 
 Merchandise margin represents the difference between merchandise sales revenues and the delivered cost of merchandise purchases, net of rebates and commissions, expressed as a percentage of merchandise sales revenues. Merchandise margins, also referred to as in-store margins, are commonly used in the retail industry to measure in-store, or non-fuel, operating results.

Expansion[edit]
Alon U.S.A. announced it would buy Paramount Petroleum Corp. for $307 million cash, and assume $100 million in debt. The deal closed in August 2006.
Alon U.S.A. also plans to buy the assets of Edgington Oil Co. for $52 million cash, a deal delayed in closing due to an FTC request for further information.
Among Paramount's assets are a 54,000 barrels per day (8,600 m3/d) refinery in Paramount, California, and seven asphalt terminals. Edgington is a topping refinery located in Long Beach, California with a listed capacity of about 40,000 barrels per day (6,400 m3/d).
In July 2006 Alon USA closed on the transaction to purchase 40 convenience stores from Good Time Stores.
In March 2007 Alon USA announced that it would purchase Abilene Based Skinny's convenience stores for 70 million dollars.
In May 2008 Valero announced they had sold the 85,000 BPD Krotz Springs, Louisiana refinery to Alon USA for $433 million.
On June 2, 2010 Alon announced that it has completed the acquisition of the Bakersfield, California refinery from Big West of California, LLC, a subsidiary of Flying J Inc. The purchase price of the Bakersfield transaction, including substantially all of the assets of Big West, consists of $40 million in cash. The Company also acquired the Bakersfield refinery's existing inventory as of the closing date of the transaction. The Bakersfield refinery is located in California's Central Valley and has the capacity to refine up to 70,000 barrels per day of crude oil. The refinery is supplied by crude oil produced in the San Joaquin Valley with its products marketed in California, and is a major provider of motor fuels in central California.
Merger with Delek US[edit]
On July 1, 2017, Delek US Holdings Inc., Brentwood, Tenn., completed its purchase of Alon Israel Oil Co. Ltd.’s US-based refining and marketing subsidiary Alon USA Energy Inc.[3]As part of the all-stock transaction, Delek acquired the remaining 53% of Alon USA’s common stock not already owned by Delek. The combined company will be led primarily by Delek US’ existing management team.
Refinery explosion[edit]
On February 18, 2008, an explosion occurred at an oil refinery in Big Spring, Texas owned by Alon USA. The plant employs about 170 employees and has a capacity of 70,000 barrels (11,000 m3) of oil a day. This event has caused portions of Interstate 20 to be shut down. Initial reports state that four workers were injured.[4] In addition to the four workers, a passing motorist on Interstate 20 sustained an injury when debris struck her vehicle, according to local reports.[5] According to a press release by the company on February 19, the explosion occurred in the area around the propylene splitter unit, although the cause has not yet been determined.[6] Information on the company's website states that ALON USA acquired ownership of the Big Spring, Texas refinery in August 2000, when ALON Israel Oil Company Ltd. purchased the U.S. fuels marketing and refining assets of Atofina Petrochemicals, Inc. (FINA). The refinery has been in service for more than 75 years, and produces fuel products and asphalt for the southwestern United States. It was constructed in 1928 by the original owner, Joshua Cosden.

Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, ALON USA Energy, Inc. was an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products, operating primarily in the western and south-central regions of the United States.
With a refining capacity of nearly 217,000 barrels per day, Alon owned and operated heavy crude oil refineries in Big Spring, Texas, and Paramount, Long Beach and Bakersfield, California (collectively known as the California refineries), as well as a light crude oil refinery in Krotz Springs, Louisiana.
Alon was a leading marketer of asphalt, which it distributes primarily through asphalt terminals located predominately in the southwestern and western United States.
ALON Brands, Inc., the retail and branded marketing subsidiary of Alon USA, marketed and supplied ALON motor fuels to independent and company-owned retail locations. ALON Brands was the largest licensee of 7-Eleven in the U.S., operating more than 300 convenience stores in Texas and New Mexico.
In July 2017, Delek US Holdings purchased Alon USA in an all-stock transaction.

Expansion[edit]
Alon U.S.A. announced it would buy Paramount Petroleum Corp. for $307 million cash, and assume $100 million in debt. The deal closed in August 2006.
Alon U.S.A. also plans to buy the assets of Edgington Oil Co. for $52 million cash, a deal delayed in closing due to an FTC request for further information.
Among Paramount's assets are a 54,000 barrels per day (8,600 m3/d) refinery in Paramount, California, and seven asphalt terminals. Edgington is a topping refinery located in Long Beach, California with a listed capacity of about 40,000 barrels per day (6,400 m3/d).
In July 2006 Alon USA closed on the transaction to purchase 40 convenience stores from Good Time Stores.
In March 2007 Alon USA announced that it would purchase Abilene Based Skinny's convenience stores for 70 million dollars.
In May 2008 Valero announced they had sold the 85,000 BPD Krotz Springs, Louisiana refinery to Alon USA for $433 million.
On June 2, 2010 Alon announced that it has completed the acquisition of the Bakersfield, California refinery from Big West of California, LLC, a subsidiary of Flying J Inc. The purchase price of the Bakersfield transaction, including substantially all of the assets of Big West, consists of $40 million in cash. The Company also acquired the Bakersfield refinery's existing inventory as of the closing date of the transaction. The Bakersfield refinery is located in California's Central Valley and has the capacity to refine up to 70,000 barrels per day of crude oil. The refinery is supplied by crude oil produced in the San Joaquin Valley with its products marketed in California, and is a major provider of motor fuels in central California.
Merger with Delek US[edit]
On July 1, 2017, Delek US Holdings Inc., Brentwood, Tenn., completed its purchase of Alon Israel Oil Co. Ltd.’s US-based refining and marketing subsidiary Alon USA Energy Inc.[3]As part of the all-stock transaction, Delek acquired the remaining 53% of Alon USA’s common stock not already owned by Delek. The combined company will be led primarily by Delek US’ existing management team.
Refinery explosion[edit]
On February 18, 2008, an explosion occurred at an oil refinery in Big Spring, Texas owned by Alon USA. The plant employs about 170 employees and has a capacity of 70,000 barrels (11,000 m3) of oil a day. This event has caused portions of Interstate 20 to be shut down. Initial reports state that four workers were injured.[4] In addition to the four workers, a passing motorist on Interstate 20 sustained an injury when debris struck her vehicle, according to local reports.[5] According to a press release by the company on February 19, the explosion occurred in the area around the propylene splitter unit, although the cause has not yet been determined.[6] Information on the company's website states that ALON USA acquired ownership of the Big Spring, Texas refinery in August 2000, when ALON Israel Oil Company Ltd. purchased the U.S. fuels marketing and refining assets of Atofina Petrochemicals, Inc. (FINA). The refinery has been in service for more than 75 years, and produces fuel products and asphalt for the southwestern United States. It was constructed in 1928 by the original owner, Joshua Cosden.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
