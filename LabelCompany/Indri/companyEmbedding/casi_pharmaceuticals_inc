  ENMD-2076 is our proprietary orally-active, Aurora A/angiogenic kinase inhibitor with a unique kinase selectivity profile and multiple mechanisms of action. ENMD-2076 has been shown to inhibit a distinct profile of angiogenic tyrosine kinase targets in addition to the Aurora A kinase and currently in multiple Phase 2 trials.
  2ME2 (2-methoxyestradiol) is an orally active compound that has anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties.
  MARQIBO, already marketed in the U.S. by our partner, is indicated for the treatment of advanced Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
  EVOMELA (melphalan) for injection is intended to be used as a conditioning treatment prior to autologous stem cell transplant for patients with multiple myeloma. EVOMELA was granted approval by the FDA of its New Drug Application in March 2016.
  ZEVALIN, also already marketed in the U.S. by our partner, is indicated for patients with relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL).
  We intend to develop these drugs for import drug registration in our greater China region. For the most up-to-date safety information about these drugs, please refer to our partner’s website www.sppirx.com and to:

					Full Description



CASI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., incorporated on September 18, 1991, is a biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of therapeutics for cancer and other medical needs. The Company operates through the development of targeted therapeutics primarily for the treatment of cancer segment. The Company's product pipeline includes internal development of its lead drug candidate, ENMD-2076; MARQIBO, ZEVALIN and EVOMELA, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs in-licensed from Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and early-stage candidates in preclinical development. The Company's pipeline also includes 2ME2 (2-methoxyestradial). The Company's primary research and development focuses on oncology therapeutics.ENMD-2076The Company's ENMD-2076 is an orally active, Aurora A/angiogenic kinase inhibitor with a kinase selectivity profile and multiple mechanisms of action. It has shown anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative properties in multiple preclinical and clinical cancer studies. ENMD-2076 has shown to inhibit angiogenic tyrosine kinase targets in addition to the Aurora A kinase. Aurora kinases are key regulators of mitosis (cell division) and are over-expressed in human cancers. ENMD-2076 also targets the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt-3) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) kinases, which has shown to play important roles in the pathology of several cancers. ENMD-2076 has completed Phase I clinical trial in various different solid tumor cancers, including ovarian, breast, liver, renal and sarcoma, as well as in leukemia, and multiple myeloma, and has also completed a Phase II clinical trial in advanced ovarian cancer. It has initiated multiple Phase II studies of ENMD-2076 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), advanced/metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and in advanced ovarian clear cell carcinomas (OCCC) in North America. ENMD-2076 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).MARQIBOThe Company's Marqibo is a sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposome-encapsulated, formulation of vincristine sulfate, a microtubule inhibitor. Marqibo is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in second or greater relapse or having disease that has progressed following two or more anti-leukemia therapies.ZEVALINThe Company's ZEVALIN (ibritumomab tiuxetan) injection for intravenous use is a CD20-directed radiotherapeutic antibody. It is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). ZEVALIN is also indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated follicular NHL having achieved a partial or complete response to first-line chemotherapy. ZEVALIN therapeutic regimen consists of two components: rituximab and Yttrium-90 (Y-90) radiolabeled ZEVALIN for therapy. ZEVALIN builds on the combined effect of a targeted biologic monoclonal antibody augmented with the therapeutic effects of a beta-emitting radioisotope.EVOMELAThe Company's EVOMELA is a new intravenous formulation of melphalan being investigated by Spectrum in the multiple myeloma transplant setting. The formulation avoids the use of propylene glycol, which is used as a co-solvent in the current formulation of melphalan and has been reported to cause renal and cardiac side-effects that limit the ability to deliver higher quantities of intended therapeutic compounds. EVOMELA (melphalan) is indicated for Injection primarily for use as a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma.2ME2The Company's 2ME2 (2-methoxyestradiol) is an orally active compound that has anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. The inhibition of angiogenesis is an approach to the treatment of both cancer and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. 2ME2 is a single agent in rheumatoid arthritis based on its antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-osteoclastic (bone resorption) properties. 2ME2 has also demonstrated positive preclinical results for multiple sclerosis.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements














9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of  Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements
I'm sure you've heard of vitamins, herbs, and other nutritional products that flunked lab tests. Here at Advanced Bionutritionals, we strive to make sure that does not happen.
In fact, our manufacturing process assures purity, potency and quality 9 different ways:

"You Get An A+"
"Thank you. I did receive the credit back on my credit card. You often promote your "money back guarantee" with your literature. Well, you certainly deliver on your promise!!!.
I judge a company on Quality, Price and Service (you pass on all three) but the ultimate test comes when you have a "problem". Your company scored an "A+"!!!!!! You have earned my business forever. Thank you for your outstanding service and problem resolution!"
Patrick M., Colorado



We use suppliers and growers that we've known for years. 


We use ingredients that are shown to be effective in scientific studies.


We use no artificial colors, artificial binders, artificial fillers, or artificial preservatives, and non-GMO sources whenever available. 


Every supplier is qualified by testing multiple lots of material. The material is assayed for purity and screened for pathogens like mold, yeast, staph, and salmonella.


The batches of our ingredients are tested using FTIR spectrometers and compared to a purity index.


Our products are manufactured in a facility that is GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certified.


Batches of our product undergo rigorous disintegration tests in conformance with USP guidelines to ensure proper breakdown in the stomach and absorption in the intestines.


Our manufacturing process has multiple checks in place, and our batches are signed off by a quality control officer to ensure accuracy, purity, and potency.


Our bottles are safety sealed for lasting freshness and potency. And each bottle is marked with a manufactured date and/or an expiration date.





For you, that means the best quality possible. In fact, we promise it. If you are ever dissatisfied with one of our products for any reason whatsoever, simply return the unused portion within 90 days of purchase. We will refund every penny you paid, including shipping and handling. You only pay return shipping.

Frank Shallenberger, MD
Dr. Shallenberger has practiced medicine for more than 41 years, after earning his M.D. degree from the University of Maryland, School of Medicine, and receiving post-graduate training at Mt. Zion Hospital in San Francisco. Dr. Shallenberger is
also certified by the American Board of Anti-Aging Medicine (A.B.A.A.M.) as an anti-aging physician and has also been trained and certified in other areas of alternative medicine.
This makes Dr. Shallenberger one of a small minority of doctors in this country licensed in conventional as well as alternative medicine. But more importantly, it allows him to integrate the best of both approaches for optimal results at his wellness
