Oil & Gas Investment Fraud Scams & Lawsuits Attorneys
























































































Oil & Gas Investment Scams
With the drop in oil prices in 2014 and 2015, thousands of investors are realizing they have been taken advantage of in investments related to oil and gas. There are two types of investment losses in oil and gas securities that are potentially recoverable through the FIRNA arbitration process or via lawsuit.
Unsuitable Investment Recommendations In Oil and Gas Stocks, Bonds, Master Limited Partnerships and Mutual Funds: Negligence based unsuitable investment recommendations in oil, gas and energy related companies make up a majority of the cases we’ve handled for investors. For example, brokers at full service brokerage firms recommended oil and gas stocks, master limited partnerships and other related investments heavily to investors between 2010 and 2014. With the massive slide in oil prices in 2014 and 2015 caused by the jump in domestic oil stockpiles due to new, highly efficient drilling techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques, companies affiliated with the oil industries have lost substantial value resulting in devastating investment losses for many investors. Unfortunately, many small oil and gas producers have lost a majority of their value in 2014 and 2015. These companies have heavy debt loads that simply couldn’t be maintained with the oil price slide.
Dozens of master limited partnerships have declined in value in 2014 and 2015. The $500 billion master-limited-partnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world. Buyers love the yields — now averaging about 6% — but many know little about how the yields are generated. The bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the high-yielding way to participate in the booming U.S. energy infrastructure build-out. Unfortunately, the investments, while providing generous yields, masked the substantial high risks of these investments.
Many of these investments were pitched to elderly and conservative investors because of the relatively high dividends and yields that the investments paid out. These losses are potentially recoverable through either FINRA arbitration claims against the brokerage firms whose brokers recommended the investments or lawsuits against the promoters of the investments.
Fraud Based Claims: The second type of oil and gas actions deal with fraud based claims. Oil and gas investments take many forms, including limited partnership interests, master limited partnerships, ownership of fractional undivided interests in leases, and general partnerships. Risk level, tax consequences and investor liability vary according to the type of program. Drilling partnerships have always been a gamble, but unfortunately many oil and gas scams have been perpetrated by bad actors in the securities industry. Although some of the con artists moved on to more lucrative venues since the oil boom ended in the mid-1980s, many continued to linger on in the oil field and the results of their actions are being felt now. Fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership (or other legal entity) in one state, the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state, and the offerings made to prospective investors in states other than the initial two states. Thus there is less chance of an investor dropping by a well site or a nonexistent company headquarters. Such a structure also makes it difficult for law enforcement officials and victims to identify and expose the fraud.
Our Securities Law Firm Holds Financial Advisors Accountable
Brokers at major brokerage firms like Linsco LPL, UBS, Merrill Lynch, Raymond James, Citgroup and Stifel Nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away”. When a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the investment products offered by the brokerage firm and outside the client’s account, there may be a selling away issue. These investments, known as Private Securities, often involve investments in oil and gas related limited partnerships, privately held companies, private placements, promissory notes, and other similar investments. Sometimes they are real investments. Other times they are completely bogus and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds.
Unfortunately, unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the Internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned by salespeople with little or no background in energy exploration, but plenty of experience in high-pressure sales. Their techniques include repeated unsolicited phone calls to potential investors, hyping the profitability of the deal and promises of safe but secure returns. Some examples of these pitches include:
• You will have an interest in a well that cannot miss;
• The risks are minimal;
• A geologist has given the salesperson a tip;
• The broker or salesperson has personally invested in the venture;
• The promoter has “hit” on every well drilled so far;
• There has been a tremendous “discovery” in an adjacent field;
• A large, reputable oil company like Chevron is operating or planning to operate in the area;
• Only a few interests remain to be sold and you should immediately send in your money in order to assure the purchase of an interest;
• This is a special private deal open only to a lucky chosen few investors.

Investor Update: Those Who Lost Money in ForceField Energy

Andrew Stoltmann /
Chelsea Financial Services, forcefield energy, fraud, gerald cocuzzo, investment fraud, lawsuit, legend securities, maroof miyana, meyers associates, naveed khan, newbridge securities, pranav patel, richard brown, SEC, sunsi energies / 

Stoltmann Law Offices continues to investigate ForceField Energy, formerly known as SunSi Energies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently brought a complaint against many of its former operators and owners, as well as brokers from brokerage firms who recommended that their customers invest in ForceField. The financial advisors who recommended the investment and were named in the complaint were Gerald Cocuzzo, Naveed A. Khan, Maroof Miyana, Richard L. Brown and Pranav V. Patel. Allegedly, these advisors had an encryption on their phone that would delete texts after a certain period of time. The texts in question came from Jared Mitchell, who worked for ForceField, and would allegedly give the financial advisors brown bags of cash if they recommended his investment. The advisors would then receive kickbacks for their participation and sales. This is against securities laws. ForceField no longer trades on the NASDAQ.
Gerald Cocuzzo worked for Newbridge Securities Corp in Boca Raton, Florida from December 2014 until May 2016. Naveed Khan worked for Meyers Associates in Staten Island, New York from April 2013 until today. Khan was barred from the securities industry by the SEC and has pled guilty to securities fraud. Maroof Miyana worked for Legend Securities in Pompano Beach, Florida from December 2014 until today and Pranav Patel worked with Dawson James Securities in Boca Raton from January 2015 until December 2015. Richard Brown worked for Chelsea Financial Services in Huntington, New York from February 2012 until November 2015.
Because Newbridge Securities, Meyers Associates, Legend Securities, Dawson James Securities and Chelsea Financial Services did not reasonably supervise their brokers and allowed them to sell unsuitable investments such as ForceField Energy, each firm may be held liable for losses. If you invested money with Cocuzzo, Khan, Miyana, Patel or Brown or any of their firms, you may be able to bring legal action against their firms in the FINRA arbitration forum on a contingency fee basis. Call us today to find out how. 312-332-4200. The call is free with no obligation. We are based in Chicago, Illinois.

Update For Investors Who Lost Oil and Gas-Related Investments With Red River Securities

Andrew Stoltmann /
Brian Hardwick, oil and gas scams, Red River Securities / 

Stoltmann Law Offices continues to investigate River Securities and its CEO, Brian Hardwick, who were both recently expelled from the industry by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and jointly and severally ordered to pay $24.6 million in restitution to clients for fraudulent sales in five oil and gas joint ventures. FINRA found that Red River Securities and Hardwick allegedly intentionally and fraudulently misrepresented and omitted material facts in connection with the sales of interests in oil and gas joint ventures issued by Regal Energy, an affiliate of Red River Securities. The offerings were high-risk and illiquid, and were made more so by the alleged misrepresentations by Red River and its representatives. One client was 74 years old and a self-employed farmer. A Red River broker put more than half of her investment into three risky oil and gas ventures in a period of a year, which was not suitable for her, considering her age, net worth and risk tolerance. A broker must take into account these factors before recommending or selling a security, and if he does not, his firm can be liable for losses. The firm must reasonably supervise its representatives. Please call our law offices today at 312-332-4200 to speak to an attorney if you lost money in risky oil and gas ventures because of Red River Securities. We are securities attorneys who recover money for investors on a contingency fee basis.

Where can you find the most affordable metropolitan living in the U.S.?
Oklahoma City. Expect the unexpected.  There are more than a few reasons to move to OKC, but don't take our word for it. Forbes, Fortune, CNBC, Travel & Leisure and many others point to our city as one of the most attractive places in the nation to live, work and play. So don't wait. Oklahoma City beckons.




OKC’s Top Tens:
Best Cities for Jobs
Best Cities to Start a Career
Best Metros for Wage Growth
#1 in Oil and Gas Investment Worldwide
Best Large Cities to Start a Business
#1 in Quality of Life
#1 Place to Live After the Military
#1 Most Affordable Metros for Young Adults
Major Market Housing Affordability
Cheapest States for Day Care
 




Wide Open Spaces
With a diverse terrain from the panhandle to Green Country and back again, our state is a favorite destination for hikers, ATV enthusiasts, water skiers, canoers, kayakers and fishermen. Not to mention the surrounding countryside is dotted with parks and lakes — so many in fact that Oklahoma boasts more shoreline than the Atlantic Coast.
Not to mention Oklahoma City alone is home to more than 50 golf courses. With so many options everyone from beginners to seasoned professionals can find a course they love.




Hometown Sports
Our home team, the OKC Thunder, is one of the most entertaining and explosive teams in NBA. We’re home to the training ground for the U.S. Olympic rowing team, as well as the Oklahoma City Redhawks, Barons and newly founded Energy. We also boast two of the nation’s top college football programs at OU and OSU, and are consistently rated among the best markets for watching college football. Plus, we’re home to the Women’s College World Series each May and are often selected to host PGA events and Big XII and NCAA tournaments for almost every sport.




Mouth-watering Cuisine. Top Fashion.
You’ll find a diversity of top-rated cuisine in OKC, from our trademark steakhouse and barbeque joints to Latin American, Italian, authentic Vietnamese, world-famous burger shacks and much more. And if retail therapy is a favored pastime, we have you covered with our three metro-area malls and high-end boutiques at Classen Curve and The Plaza in Nichols Hills. The Outlet Shoppes also provide a wide variety of top-tier name brand stores that offer a tremendous bang for your buck. All in all, there’s a lot to take in here in OKC.




Entertainment for Everyone
With a wide variety of districts, Oklahoma City offers a remarkably unique culture and appeal. Visit our bustling Bricktown Entertainment District’s bar and lounge scene to check out the nightlife or the Deep Deuce District's jazz and rock clubs to hear your favorite local and not-so-local bands. The Paseo Art District, flush with trendy galleries and shops, is a must-see for those with an artistic flair.
Our family friendly Adventure District boasts the popular OKC Zoo, Oklahoma Science Museum, National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum, National Softball Hall of Fame, Frontier City and countless parks and gardens — in short, outings the whole family will enjoy.

Smart Plays.Strategic Development.
Driving results through continuous improvement is more than a goal at Chaparral. It is one of the values on which our company was built and something that is never more apparent than in the way we regard every dollar we spend. Through ongoing measurement and analysis Chaparral continues to identify methods to lower our cost structure, deliver results and improve the return on our capital investments.That is why we have focused our efforts on Oklahoma's fast-growing STACK Play, where we continue to see outstanding rates of return despite the current low-price environment. With more than 3,000 gross operated drilling locations on our approximate 110,000 net surface acres, Chaparral has decades of STACK inventory just waiting to be developed.

About Us




Chaparral Energy


 






At Chaparral we are never satisfied with the status quo. Like our namesake the fleet-footed roadrunner, our combination of speed, agility and adaptability means we are never happy standing still. Our story is one that embodies innovation, resourcefulness, creativity, financial responsibility and loyalty to the communities in which we operate.
Our operations stretch from the Texas Panhandle to the Tallgrass Prairie of northeastern Oklahoma, however, our primarily area of focus is the fast-growing, highly economical STACK Play in Oklahoma’s Blaine, Canadian, Garfield, Kingfisher and Major counties. Fueled by our approximately 350 talented employees, we have grown from our humble beginnings to a resource base with potential reserves of more than 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent (Boe). While energy companies are nothing new in Oklahoma, Chaparral continues to set ourselves apart through our entrepreneurial spirit and dedication to continuous improvement.

Focus on STACK
Chaparral’s approximately 110,000 net surface acres in central Oklahoma’s fast-growing STACK Play allows the company to realize tremendous gains in efficiency and cost reduction. With per well costs consistently averaging more than $500,000 less than our competitors, Chaparral is quickly setting ourselves apart as a best-in-class operator.


 

2017




A Pure Mid-Continent Story
Chaparral completes our transition to a pure Mid-Continent producer with the $300 million sale of our ARK-LA-TX properties. The sale marks our emergence as a true Mid-Continent leader, with significant positions in the Mississippi Lime and emerging STACK plays, coupled with our low-risk, stable EOR oil assets such as our North Burbank Unit.


 

2015




Injection Begins on World-class EOR Project
In June 2013, a CO2 pipeline is completed, running from a Coffeyville, Kansas, fertilizer plant to Chaparral’s North Burbank Unit. Thus CO2 injection begins on this world-class project. With a future net production potential of more than 14,000 Boe/d and a Burbank Gross Uplift EUR of 88 MMboe, the unit is the largest unitized field in Oklahoma with more than 1,100 MMboe of original oil in place. It offers the opportunity to become the largest EOR project in the state, potentially a true accelerator for the company and our EOR program.


 

2013




First Unconventional Resource Drilling Commences
Our acquisitions bless us with a material legacy acreage property base that offers significant upside potential. So Chaparral shifts our strategy to acquiring grass-roots leases to supplement our legacy acreage position, and begins exploring our first unconventional reservoirs using horizontal drilling and modern hydraulic fracturing technology. This allows us to access oil trapped in low-permeability rock formations to produce significant returns from plays that had been written off as non-viable.


 

2011




Strategy Shift Begins
Given an ongoing sluggish economy and a poor public equity market, Chaparral sells a 36 percent equity stake in the company to a private equity firm, CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC, generating $325 million in new capital allowing the company to continue to grow as we shift from acquisitions to drilling.This new strategy, supplemented with more than two decades of successful management, lays the groundwork for even greater success going forward. In fact, by bringing in additional equity and successfully implementing our ongoing capital investment programs, Chaparral receives the Excellence Award for the Turnaround Company of the Year in 2010 from Hart Publications’ Oil and Gas Investor.


 

2010




Economy Stalls, But Not Chaparral
Thanks to our 2006 oil-price hedge program, when the economy plunges near the end of 2008 and oil prices plummet to $40 a barrel, Chaparral survives intact, while many oil companies meet their demise.


 

2008




Growing in Stature
We make our single largest acquisition to date by acquiring Calumet Oil Company out of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Calumet, a pioneer in early Oklahoma oil, had acquired numerous large oilfields. Chaparral funds this acquisition by selling a 25 percent equity stake in the company and entering the public debt market for the first time, with $300 million in high-yield bonds. The acquisition also nearly doubles our employee base and unlocks a vast array of E&P and EOR opportunities. As a result, we become one of Osage County’s largest operators, generating 40 percent of the oil royalties for the Osage Nation.To control our debt/risk profile, we also hedge (forward-sell) much of our oil and gas for the next five years for more than $100 a barrel.


 

2006




Acquisition of Partnership
To support our increasing appetite for properties and growth, Chaparral reacquires our interest in the Bristol properties for $150 million from our 2000 Bristol Resources acquisition deal.Armed with a thorough knowledge of these properties after five years of operations, Chaparral recognizes a tremendous upside for the company with this purchase and still generates a $100 million profit for our partner.


 

2005




Growing CO2 EOR
To support our growing CO2 EOR business, Chaparral enters into the CO2 transportation business, acquiring 80 miles of pipeline running from North Texas to the Camrick CO2 Unit. This pipeline in turn delivers 12 million cubic feet per day (Mcf/d) of captured CO2 to facilitate production growth, tripling our Camrick Unit production to 550 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d).


 

2003




Building Our EOR Experience
Chaparral initiates our own CO2 EOR project from scratch in the Camrick Unit located in the Oklahoma Panhandle. This field once thought to be depleted and unfit for CO2 EOR operations performs exceptionally well, setting the stage for a successful new line of business.


 

2001




Well-timed Partnership Spurs Additional Growth
Chaparral makes our first major acquisition, acquiring Bristol Resources for approximately $90 million through a partnership with a leading financial entity. This acquisition greatly increases our presence in several different states and even includes some offshore operations.


 

2000




First Step Into CO2 EOR 
Continuing to grow, Chaparral seeks new opportunities to convert undervalued oilfields into moneymakers. By acquiring an existing CO2 EOR project from Henry Petroleum in southern Oklahoma we gain our first hands-on EOR experience. Using modern injection techniques, some wells see production more than double.


 

1999




Thriving, Despite the Market
Oil prices plummet 80 percent in just a few months, from $40 a barrel to $8 a barrel. Chaparral does more than merely weather the storm. Thanks to prudent financial management and well-timed oil-price hedging we continue to thrive.


 

1998




A Place to Call Home
Chaparral purchases an 18,000-square-foot building located on Britton Road for our corporate headquarters in Oklahoma City, providing a true home and base of operations.


 

1996




From Risk to Reward
Chaparral excels with a talent for identifying, acquiring and unlocking the value of plays that other companies have written off as having “no remaining potential.” We capitalize on these opportunities by working over wells thought to be depleted, revitalizing production by installing artificial lift techniques. With a strong belief in the upside of secondary water-flooding and tertiary recover processes — particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) enhanced oil recovery (EOR) — Chaparral begins acquiring large, older, depleted multi-well fields. It is an opportunity packed with risk and the chance for big rewards and it pays off.


 

1993




Early Growth
Through hard work, Chaparral enjoys early success and continues to grow our property base through acquisitions. With an objective to capture incremental profit margin through oil and gas operations, we establish our Field and Equipment Services Division and open our first field office in Weatherford, Oklahoma.


 

1991




Chaparral is Born
Pooling $50,000 apiece from Chairman, Chief Executive Office and Co-founder Mark Fischer and Kitscotty Oil Company (consisting of Fischer’s brother, co-founder and board member, Charles Fischer, and Charles’ partners, Ken McCourt, Ron Jakimchuk and Gary Klassen), Chaparral forms in April 1988 with the strategy of acquiring producing properties. A few months later the company acquires five oil-producing properties in Oklahoma’s Panhandle, which generates our first revenues.

Our Vision
Every acre we lease, location we select and well we drill is designed to deliver the best possible return for each dollar we invest in our operations. An investment we’re maximizing in the highly economical STACK Play of central Oklahoma, where multiple layers of oil-producing formations sit stacked one on top of another. This geological phenomenon, known as stacked plays, allows us to produce a tremendous amount of oil and gas from a single location. In fact, we can drill as many as 16 separate wells from a single location.
Fueled by efficiencies such as this, one of the industry’s lowest-cost operating structures and our employees' unwavering commitment to best-in-class performance, Chaparral is quickly emerging as a premier STACK player as we continue our mission of Energizing America’s Heartland™.

Chaparral Energy


 








Energizing America’s Heartland
Chaparral leverages our expertise and low-cost structure to unlock reservoirs deep beneath Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.

Focused primarily on our leasehold in Oklahoma’s fast-growing STACK Play, we are creating significant economic and shareholder value. Our more than 3,000 gross operated unrisked STACK locations provide access to the Oswego, Meramec, Osage and Woodford formations — a robust inventory that will fuel our company for decades to come.
Producing these resources, however, requires highly trained experts. Our talented, employees have the knowledge and expertise needed to decipher each formation’s unique geologic and productive characteristics as we continue to find innovative, cost-efficient ways to recover these previously untapped oil and gas deposits.





 



 



 






 








STACKed Plays That Pay Off

The highly economical STACK Play in central Oklahoma is home to several oil and gas formations that sit stacked atop one another. These formation layers are vertically stacked hundreds to even thousands of feet on top of each other, creating overlapping layers known as “stacked pays.” 
Stacked pays allow operators, such as Chaparral, access to drill multiple formations from a single location. With the ability to drill up to 16 separate horizontal wells from a single vertical wellbore, the STACK provides excellent cost efficiencies, improved oil and gas recoveries and an overall smaller surface footprint.
Chaparral has approximately 110,000 net surface acres with stacked-pay potential in the Oswego, Meramec, Osage, Woodford and Hunton formations.

Other Areas
 







The geographic area referred to as the STACK is located primarily below portions of Blaine, Canadian, Garfield, Kingfisher and Major counties in central Oklahoma. This area is home to multiple oil-rich reservoirs that are stacked vertically, including the Oswego, Meramec, Osage, Woodford and Hunton formations. 
This stacking of plays allows Chaparral to effectively recover oil and gas from multiple formations using pad drilling, well spacing techniques and other operational efficiencies, which result in significant cost savings, reduced environmental impacts and extremely profitable operations.  
 
Key Facts:
Average D&C Cost: $3.3mm per well
Net Acres: ~110,000
Gross Unrisked Operated Drilling Locations: More than 3,000
Potential Recovery: More than 900 MMBoe
Daily Production: 7,300 Boe/d
 






The Meramec and Osage intervals of the Mississippian are two of the deeper oil-saturated reservoirs found just above the Woodford formation.
To date, Meramec development has centered primarily in Oklahoma’s Kingfisher, Blaine and Canadian counties. Activity is, however, increasing in Garfield, Major and Dewey counties as STACK operators, such as Chaparral, continue to expand the boundaries of the lucrative STACK Play. 







Chaparral has a significant leasehold position in the Oswego. Historically a vertical target, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies are unlocking previously unrecovered reserves of this mid-Pennsylvania-age carbonate play.
Our first horizontal Oswego well was drilled in 2013 and is expected to produce more than 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent during its lifetime. We have since drilled or participated in 30 wells in the Oswego within the STACK region, with an initial 30-day production rate of almost 500 Boe/d, of which approximately 90 percent is oil. At vertical depths of only 6,000 to 7,000 feet, the Oswego yields extremely attractive economic results.







The Woodford Shale is the key hydrocarbon source for several productive regions across Oklahoma, including the STACK and is also an attractive drilling target itself.
The formation has been the source for multiple productive regions including the STACK, SCOOP and areas within the Arkoma Basin. The Woodford continues to be one of Oklahoma’s most active and historically prolific formations.







Chaparral has additional E&P operations in Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle in the Miss Lime and Marmaton plays. With almost 100,000 net acres, these historic operations continue to provide steady production and future development opportunities.

Net Acres: Almost 100,000
Potential Recovery: 145 MMBoe

Enhanced Oil Recovery
Select a Section

North Burbank
Other EOR Fields
What’s EOR?








Our North Burbank Unit is Oklahoma’s largest EOR project and a world-class oil resource. It has more than 824 MMBoe of estimated original oil in place (OOIP) and is the state’s single largest unitized field.
Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that would otherwise be vented into the atmosphere are captured and transported via a 68-mile pipeline that runs from Coffeyville, Kansas, to the Burbank Unit in northeastern Oklahoma. Injection began in June 2013, with the unit making 1,300 Bo/d gross production. CO2 is currently being injected into 38 separate patterns, with a 2016 gross production exit rate of approximately 3,400 Bo/d.
Key Facts:
Net Production: 3,000 Bo/d
OOIP: More than 824 MMBo
 






In addition to our world-class North Burbank field, Chaparral operates a CO2 EOR Unit in central Oklahoma and six, separate projects located in the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandle area — the Camrick, North Perryton, Booker and Farnsworth units. These units combine to produce more than 2,800 net Bo/d.






In traditional sandstone and carbonate plays, primary phase production relies on natural reservoir pressure, pumps and gravity, and only captures approximately 10 to 20 percent of the original oil in place (OOIP). Secondary phase production, where water or gas is injected immiscibly into the reservoir to increase pressure and push oil to production wells typically yields an additional 15 to 30 percent. This means approximately 50 to 75 percent of the field’s oil is being left behind after primary and secondary production phases.
Tertiary-phase recovery, also known as EOR, can capture an additional 8 to 20 percent of the OOIP by mixing it with an oil-miscible gas or liquid such as CO2. This swells the oil and effectively acts as a solvent, allowing the oil to move much more readily toward producing wells.


Chaparral is the only oil and gas operator to utilize 100-percent, man-made CO2 to fuel our EOR operations.

Oil & Gas Investment Fraud Scams & Lawsuits Attorneys
























































































Oil & Gas Investment Scams
With the drop in oil prices in 2014 and 2015, thousands of investors are realizing they have been taken advantage of in investments related to oil and gas. There are two types of investment losses in oil and gas securities that are potentially recoverable through the FIRNA arbitration process or via lawsuit.
Unsuitable Investment Recommendations In Oil and Gas Stocks, Bonds, Master Limited Partnerships and Mutual Funds: Negligence based unsuitable investment recommendations in oil, gas and energy related companies make up a majority of the cases we’ve handled for investors. For example, brokers at full service brokerage firms recommended oil and gas stocks, master limited partnerships and other related investments heavily to investors between 2010 and 2014. With the massive slide in oil prices in 2014 and 2015 caused by the jump in domestic oil stockpiles due to new, highly efficient drilling techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques, companies affiliated with the oil industries have lost substantial value resulting in devastating investment losses for many investors. Unfortunately, many small oil and gas producers have lost a majority of their value in 2014 and 2015. These companies have heavy debt loads that simply couldn’t be maintained with the oil price slide.
Dozens of master limited partnerships have declined in value in 2014 and 2015. The $500 billion master-limited-partnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world. Buyers love the yields — now averaging about 6% — but many know little about how the yields are generated. The bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the high-yielding way to participate in the booming U.S. energy infrastructure build-out. Unfortunately, the investments, while providing generous yields, masked the substantial high risks of these investments.
Many of these investments were pitched to elderly and conservative investors because of the relatively high dividends and yields that the investments paid out. These losses are potentially recoverable through either FINRA arbitration claims against the brokerage firms whose brokers recommended the investments or lawsuits against the promoters of the investments.
Fraud Based Claims: The second type of oil and gas actions deal with fraud based claims. Oil and gas investments take many forms, including limited partnership interests, master limited partnerships, ownership of fractional undivided interests in leases, and general partnerships. Risk level, tax consequences and investor liability vary according to the type of program. Drilling partnerships have always been a gamble, but unfortunately many oil and gas scams have been perpetrated by bad actors in the securities industry. Although some of the con artists moved on to more lucrative venues since the oil boom ended in the mid-1980s, many continued to linger on in the oil field and the results of their actions are being felt now. Fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership (or other legal entity) in one state, the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state, and the offerings made to prospective investors in states other than the initial two states. Thus there is less chance of an investor dropping by a well site or a nonexistent company headquarters. Such a structure also makes it difficult for law enforcement officials and victims to identify and expose the fraud.
Our Securities Law Firm Holds Financial Advisors Accountable
Brokers at major brokerage firms like Linsco LPL, UBS, Merrill Lynch, Raymond James, Citgroup and Stifel Nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away”. When a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the investment products offered by the brokerage firm and outside the client’s account, there may be a selling away issue. These investments, known as Private Securities, often involve investments in oil and gas related limited partnerships, privately held companies, private placements, promissory notes, and other similar investments. Sometimes they are real investments. Other times they are completely bogus and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds.
Unfortunately, unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the Internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned by salespeople with little or no background in energy exploration, but plenty of experience in high-pressure sales. Their techniques include repeated unsolicited phone calls to potential investors, hyping the profitability of the deal and promises of safe but secure returns. Some examples of these pitches include:
• You will have an interest in a well that cannot miss;
• The risks are minimal;
• A geologist has given the salesperson a tip;
• The broker or salesperson has personally invested in the venture;
• The promoter has “hit” on every well drilled so far;
• There has been a tremendous “discovery” in an adjacent field;
• A large, reputable oil company like Chevron is operating or planning to operate in the area;
• Only a few interests remain to be sold and you should immediately send in your money in order to assure the purchase of an interest;
• This is a special private deal open only to a lucky chosen few investors.

Stoltmann Law Offices continues to investigate ForceField Energy, formerly known as SunSi Energies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently brought a complaint against many of its former operators and owners, as well as brokers from brokerage firms who recommended that their customers invest in ForceField. The financial advisors who recommended the investment and were named in the complaint were Gerald Cocuzzo, Naveed A. Khan, Maroof Miyana, Richard L. Brown and Pranav V. Patel. Allegedly, these advisors had an encryption on their phone that would delete texts after a certain period of time. The texts in question came from Jared Mitchell, who worked for ForceField, and would allegedly give the financial advisors brown bags of cash if they recommended his investment. The advisors would then receive kickbacks for their participation and sales. This is against securities laws. ForceField no longer trades on the NASDAQ.
Gerald Cocuzzo worked for Newbridge Securities Corp in Boca Raton, Florida from December 2014 until May 2016. Naveed Khan worked for Meyers Associates in Staten Island, New York from April 2013 until today. Khan was barred from the securities industry by the SEC and has pled guilty to securities fraud. Maroof Miyana worked for Legend Securities in Pompano Beach, Florida from December 2014 until today and Pranav Patel worked with Dawson James Securities in Boca Raton from January 2015 until December 2015. Richard Brown worked for Chelsea Financial Services in Huntington, New York from February 2012 until November 2015.
Because Newbridge Securities, Meyers Associates, Legend Securities, Dawson James Securities and Chelsea Financial Services did not reasonably supervise their brokers and allowed them to sell unsuitable investments such as ForceField Energy, each firm may be held liable for losses. If you invested money with Cocuzzo, Khan, Miyana, Patel or Brown or any of their firms, you may be able to bring legal action against their firms in the FINRA arbitration forum on a contingency fee basis. Call us today to find out how. 312-332-4200. The call is free with no obligation. We are based in Chicago, Illinois.

Andrew Stoltmann /
Brian Hardwick, oil and gas scams, Red River Securities / 

Stoltmann Law Offices continues to investigate River Securities and its CEO, Brian Hardwick, who were both recently expelled from the industry by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and jointly and severally ordered to pay $24.6 million in restitution to clients for fraudulent sales in five oil and gas joint ventures. FINRA found that Red River Securities and Hardwick allegedly intentionally and fraudulently misrepresented and omitted material facts in connection with the sales of interests in oil and gas joint ventures issued by Regal Energy, an affiliate of Red River Securities. The offerings were high-risk and illiquid, and were made more so by the alleged misrepresentations by Red River and its representatives. One client was 74 years old and a self-employed farmer. A Red River broker put more than half of her investment into three risky oil and gas ventures in a period of a year, which was not suitable for her, considering her age, net worth and risk tolerance. A broker must take into account these factors before recommending or selling a security, and if he does not, his firm can be liable for losses. The firm must reasonably supervise its representatives. Please call our law offices today at 312-332-4200 to speak to an attorney if you lost money in risky oil and gas ventures because of Red River Securities. We are securities attorneys who recover money for investors on a contingency fee basis.
