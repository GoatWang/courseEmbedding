Refrigeration Innovation

Our commercial refrigeration products are built to precisely control climate conditions in facilities such as restaurants, warehouses and data centers. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. We offer everything from evaporators and air-cooled condensing units to off-site monitoring systems, walk-in coolers and customized climate-control equipment for all your commercial refrigeration needs. Though these products all have their own unique function and application, each has one thing in common—a commitment to customer satisfaction. Our focus on your needs is what makes us the best at what we do. 
Heatcraft Refrigeration manufactures refrigeration products for our family of four market-leading brands: Bohn, Larkin, Climate Control and Chandler. Also included in our product lineup is InterLink™ Parts, a one-source supplier of commercial refrigeration parts.
