Officials contended the company has underdelivered over the past two years and needs new leadership.    “A new leader will better position the company to deliver shareholder value,” company spokesman Ken Julian said.    The company’s board of directors named Henry W. Knueppel, a member of the board, as interim CEO until a permanent replacement is found.    Harsco, a company worth $3 billion, provides industrial services and engineered products primarily to steel, construction, railways and energy industries worldwide, employing 19,000 employees at 350 sites in 53 countries.    It’s a big company, and it’s footprint stretches across the world, as more than 85 percent of its employees work outside the United States.    Without a stake in company, you probably wouldn’t notice its global headquarters overlooking the Susquehanna River, where about 120 employees work.    The company sponsors the Harsco Science Center in the Whitaker Center for Science and the Arts in Harrisburg, but Doug Thomas, a research analyst, said most wouldn’t recognize the name.    “It’s not McDonald’s or Hershey,” said Thomas, president of Lancaster-based JET Research Investments. “No one knows what they do.”    And you wouldn’t know of its struggles.    Fazzolari’s exit followed the heels of $270 million loss in the company’s infrastructure branch — an almost $1 billion operation that includes the building of highways and buildings — since 2010.    Harsco’s stock dropped about 36 percent during that time, moving from a peak of about $34 in 2010 to $22.57 at the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. The decline comes as the rest of the market is enjoying a surge to heights not seen in years.    What happened?    The giant might have grown too big for its own good, some analysts say.    It’s a problem Fazzolari, who started at Harsco as an auditor 32 years ago, might have inherited when he took over as CEO in 2008, before the global economy soured, said Robert Norfleet III, a stock analyst with BB&T Capital Markets.    “They are way too spread out,” Norfleet said. “They had offices everywhere.”    Harsco had 350 offices in 2009 and bought new equipment for every construction project, Norfleet said. In both 2007 and 2008 Harsco spent about $220 million on equipment, about half of the branch’s operating costs.    Harsco spent a lot of money hoping to make even more, Norfleet said.    But during the process, the company notched several high-profile projects.    Harsco supplied the equipment used in the construction of Burj Khalifa, formerly known as Burj Dubai, the world’s tallest building, in the United Arab Emirates.    New York City’s Bank of America Tower, considered by some to be one of the world’s greenest office buildings, is equipped with Harsco hot-water systems.    The company also helped build the Marina Bay Sands, the largest resort in Singapore.    And then the bottom fell out.    Confidence crumbled with the collapse of the economy at the end of 2008, people stopped building, and Harsco was left with unused equipment, expensive offices and droves of employees with no work to do, industry analysts say.    In 2008, Harsco’s infrastructure branch made a $190 million profit and brought in less than half that in 2009, logging $68 million.    In 2010, Harsco decided to close offices and cut staff to balance their budget.    Over the next two years, the company closed 73 branch offices, 11 administration offices and axed about 800 people.    The cuts accounted for a 40 percent decline in Harsco’s infrastructure operations and cost the company $171 million in restructuring charges.    In total, the infrastructure branch lost $270 million in 2010 and <ze>¤’11.    This year, Harsco has already lost about $18 million, Norfleet said.    So how do you fix it?    More cuts, Norfleet said.    “There is a way out of this. Fazzolari did a lot,” he added. “Perhaps the company is looking for someone with fresh eyes with more aggressive restructuring initiatives.”    Derek Hathaway, who has been particularly quiet about the company’s progress since his departure as CEO in 2007, offered little comment Friday.    “It saddens me to see him go,” he said, “and I wish the company the best of luck in choosing its new leader.”

CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a report released on Monday. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
Several other equities analysts have also recently weighed in on CA. Citigroup Inc.  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $34.00 price objective (up previously from $33.00) on shares of CA in a research report on Sunday, May 14th. DA Davidson  reissued a “neutral” rating and set a $12.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Friday, May 19th. BidaskClub cut CA from a “hold” rating to a “sell” rating in a research report on Saturday, July 1st. Raymond James Financial, Inc.  reissued a “market perform” rating on shares of CA in a research report on Thursday, June 22nd. Finally, Sanford C. Bernstein  reissued an “underperform” rating and set a $28.00 price objective on shares of CA in a research report on Wednesday, June 28th. Four equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned  a hold rating and five have given a buy rating to the stock. CA currently has an average rating of “Hold” and an average price target of $35.10.
