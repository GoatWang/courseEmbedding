                                    Accelerate Pension Funding and De-risking Ahead of Tax Reform: A Less Taxing Exercise


                                    Corporate plan sponsors continue to grapple with the risks and rising costs associated with managing and maintaining their pension plans. With the possibility of corporate tax reform on the horizon, plan sponsors may have a unique opportunity now to reduce PBGC expenses by accelerating funding and to deduct contributions at the current higher tax rate, resulting in a low risk, positive net present value outcome.

                                    A resurgent economy, strong equity markets and modestly higher interest rates are providing a tailwind to pension plan sponsors. The change in economic sentiment is driven in large part by expectations that companies will get a boost to cash flow from lower corporate tax rates, infrastructure spending and reduced regulations under the new administration.

After briefly recapping the what and why, this insight series will focus on the “how,” outlining the steps involved in the most complete form of pension risk transfer: a buy-out transaction. Whether or not a buy-out is imminent, there are preparations a plan sponsor can undertake to make a future transaction easier and to shorten the timeline for execution.

                                This insight series demonstrates that the conventional wisdom about de-risking DB plans is often false. Invalidating the five myths discussed in this paper can help broaden the range of options that DB plan sponsors are willing to evaluate when formulating their long-term pension strategies. A wider range of options is essential to providing sponsors with the flexibility they need to achieve their long-term DB objectives.

  The 2012 Prudential Financial and General Motors $25.1B pension risk transfer transaction was the largest and most complex of its kind by an order of magnitude in the U.S. market and globally. A flawless execution on behalf of 110,000 former plan participants of the legacy GM Retirement Program for Salaried Employees required exceptional teamwork, sophisticated expertise in longevity risk, ALM, investments, pensions, a scalable plan administration infrastructure and relentless dedication to servicing excellence.

  Increasing life expectancy is a contributing factor to the vulnerability of pension systems worldwide, helping drive many countries toward an impending retirement crisis. This article, however, asserts that increasing longevity may actually be an opportunity for creating economic growth and stability—but only if retirement systems adapt. Appearing in the February 2013 edition of European Pensions, the paper argues that by allowing individuals to work longer, linking the retirement age of social security systems with changes in healthy life expectancy, ensuring that employer-sponsored pension plans achieve sustainable risk profiles, and supporting employees in retirement planning, longer life can, in fact, help create sustainable retirement systems.

  A recent article by Pension & Investments discusses the impact of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board’s new pension rules on government bond ratings - specifically, a requirement to recognize unfunded net pension liabilities on the balance sheet. The article suggests plan sponsors’ credit ratings won’t be seriously affected because, in most cases, the ratings agencies already understand the reality of these underfunded liabilities.

 Recent papers by Prudential and others have focused on the “what” and the “why” of pension risk transfer, describing the types of solutions that are available and the trends that are driving increased interest in de-risking. After briefly recapping the what and why, this paper will focus on the “how,” outlining the steps involved in the most complete form of pension risk transfer: a buy-out transaction. Whether or not a buy-out is imminent, there are preparations a plan sponsor can undertake to make a future transaction easier and to shorten the timeline for execution.

  The Australian population’s life expectancy is increasing by one year, every seven years. Each year of increased life expectancy adds around 5% to a DB liability which needs to be funded by the plan sponsor, or in the government’s case, the tax payer. At a time when many Australian plans are poised to adopt a risk transfer strategy, this paper provides clarity and appreciation for the global markets approach to pension risk transfer and the hedging solutions that will be available to the Australian market.

ABOUT PRUDENTIAL OUR TRACK RECORD

"Pension risk transfer transactions exemplify our capabilities, culture of multi-disciplinary collaboration, and financial strength. It’s not only about pricing. It’s about the confidence a client has in a high-quality close and execution, and doing it on a timely basis. We have very good marks for this in the industry. I doubt that any other insurer has started as early or invested as heavily as we have in this area. . . it involves risks that we know and manage well."
— John R. Strangfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Prudential Financial, Inc.
KEEPING PROMISES
You can be assured that Prudential’s foremost objective is to help individuals and institutions achieve financial security and peace of mind—it is at the very heart of our philosophy. We have a proven track record of ensuring that pension plan sponsors and their participants have an extraordinary experience every step of the way.   

In 1928, Prudential completed a pension buy-out transaction with the Cleveland Public Library. In 2013, we celebrated the 85th anniversary of that transaction, with six of the original retirees still receiving pension payments. Jeannette Eckert is one of them. This is her story.
Story of Jeannette Eckert  




 

In 2012, Prudential assumed benefit payments for approximately 110,000 participants in the General Motors Retirement Program for Salaried Employees. Martin Darvick is one of those participants, and this is his story.

ABOUT PRUDENTIAL WHY DE-RISK?

Your path to heightened pension certainty may involve multiple phases, and will require careful planning. Your firm and its defined benefit pension plan are as unique as the ultimate de-risking journey you may take.

You may associate de-risking with times of market volatility, but you should know that pension risk transfer strategies designed and executed during periods of relative market stability can offer a prime opportunity to implement strategies to mitigate the risks of defined benefit debt obligations.
It’s time to re-think pension risk, and the time to transfer your plan’s risk is now.
FIVE REASONS TO TRANSFER YOUR PENSION RISK

Ultimately creates greater certainty of corporate cash flows.
Avoids potential funding surplus trap.
Takes advantage of rising funded status window of opportunity.
Timing—it can take many months to execute a pension risk transfer transaction depending on complexity, populations, type of transfer, portfolio allocation, and other factors.
Taps early mover advantages: access to finite insurer capital, operational capacity, and current pricing.

 
YOU MAY BE CLOSER THAN YOU THINK
Funded status is chief among the many factors to consider when determining how and when to de-risk.
In a rising interest rate environment, a plan's funded status can be volatile and windows of opportunity to act can be fleeting. During the first six months of 2013, U.S. corporate DB plan funded status increased from 76 percent to 88 percent. Over the course of 2013, U.S. corporate Defined Benefit plan funded status increased from 76 percent to 88.3 percent. (Milliman 100 Monthly Pension Funding Index)
Your pension’s funded status may be closer to 100 percent than you think, risking the possibility of trapped assets once you cross the 100 percent funded status threshold. Companies with modest underfunding of, or adequately funded, material pension liabilities are therefore in the prime window of opportunity to focus on de-risking and creating additional financial flexibility. Shifting pension risk to a qualified annuity provider may be more viable than ever. The scenario below illustrates the combination of discount rates and equity returns—and the resulting funded status.

Psagot Provident Funds CEO mulls pension fund acquisition

Hagay Badash: Our goal is to continue to expand in the long-term savings world, and we'll seek ways to get stronger.



Psagot Investment House Ltd. unit Psagot Provident Funds Ltd. is different from the investment house's other activities; unlike the company's mutual funds and portfolio management businesses, which developed through organic grwoth, its provident funds were acquired almost entirely from the banks. Two years ago, Psagot was one of the smallest companies in the provident funds sector, with NIS 1 billion in assets under management.     Following the acquisition of Gadish Global Financial Services (2007) Ltd. and provident funds from Prisma Investment House Ltd., Psagot Provident Funds is now the largest company in the sector, with NIS 45 billion in assets under management and a 17% share of the market. It is almost as large as the next two largest provident funds managers combined, and its market share equals that of Bank Hapoalim (TASE: POLI) before the Bachar committee forced the banks to divest their provident funds.     Psagot Provident Funds CEO Hagay Badash says, "Psagot's growth was strong and fast, within a short time. We consider provident funds, especially advanced training funds with tax breaks, as the right and best pension products for customers. It is a transparent product, with simple and easy portability. The entire accumulation is really yours, and you understand the management fees."  "Globes": You're the largest provident funds management company, but there are other products in the long-term savings market. You're weak in the pensions market, and you have no life insurance. Badash: "Our distribution systems also market the Pisga Pension Fund, a joint fund with Ayalon Holding Ltd. (TASE: AYAL), and we're increasingly stressing pension funds. Our goal is to continue to expand in the long-term savings world, and we'll seek ways to get stronger. Just as we knew how to get strong in provident funds through acquisitions, we'll do the same in pensions."    
        




What about acquiring an insurance company? "We do not hold negotiations through the newspapers."  What is your consolidation plan? "We'll reduce parallel provident funds and plans. In the first stage (which was completed in August - E.P.), we consolidated provident funds acquired from Bank Leumi and advanced training funds acquired from Bank Hapoalim. In the second stage, which will be completed by the end of October, we'll consolidate provident funds acquired from Bank Hapoalim. This will reduce the number of provident funds from 89 to 60, and we'll further consolidate them during 2010 until we reach compliance with the Ministry of Finance guidelines to have one provident fund of each type. After 2011, we'll apply the Chilean model."  Since the Bachar committee forced the banks to divest their provident funds, management fees have soared. "There are processes that caused management fees to rise: cost of service, regulation, oversight, risk management, and advertising. We sell a product at a fair price. The maximum management fee permitted is 2% of assets management, and some management companies charge this. We don�t. Psagot's average management fee is 1.12%, and a small investor with NIS 20,000 pays 1.6%."

The New Mivtachim pension fund was the first large pension fund that introduced a range of investment tracks that enable its members to choose an investment track in accordance with market conditions.

In a report rating investment and savings entities, the Midroog company rated the management company and the pension fund. The purpose of the rating was to evaluate the quality of the company’s management, by examining its human capital and its financial strength, as well as its ability to manage the risks to which it is itself exposed and the risks to which the savers in Menora Mivtachim Pension and Provident are exposed.
 
Midroog gave the management company the highest investment manager quality rating – MQ1, based on weighted consideration of its management abilities, business stability and financial strength.
In addition, Midroog gave Menora Mivtachim Pension the highest pension fund rating - FR1, which reflects the fact that the fund relies on entities that are assessed as having a very high quality, and that the level of specific risks that it embodies is very low.

What are the differences between a provident and a pension fund?

Question:
I am working for a company that uses 2 options for retirement saving: 
Option 1: provident fund (7.5 % employer contribution and 7.5% employee contribution)
Option 2  pension fund and pension provident fund (7.5 % employer contribution and 7.5% employee contribution) 

What is the best option for the employee, and can one transfer funds from a provident fund to a pension fund when changing employment?

Answer:
Goodness,The two big differences between a pension and a provident fund relate to 1. the tax treatment of contributions and 2. the annuitisation requirement at retirement.Under current law, only the employer can claim a tax deduction for provident fund contributions. If employees contribute in their own name (ie not by way of a salary sacrifice), then this money is returned back to them tax-free at retirement (added to the tax-free cash lump sum). With a pension fund, both the employer (up to 20%) and the employee (up to 7.5%) can claim their contributions for tax. The provident fund arrangement is probably more suitable for lower income earners, who do not benefit from the tax deduction as their income is below the tax threshold. As an offset, a provident offers them more flexibility on retirement. Pension fund members must buy an annuity with at least two-thirds of their retirement benefit whereas provident fund members can take the full benefit as cash. Which is the preferred option depends on the employee's individual circumstances, and what they intend to do at retirement with their savings. To the extent that most people should not be entrusted with a cash lump sum at retirement (because they will likely then outlive their savings), the pension fund option is the more prudent one.In terms of the proposed retirement reform, which may come into effect by 2015, the tax treatment and annuitisation requirements of provident funds will align with that of pension funds. Although vested rights will be protected, for younger savers, the question "pension or provident fund?" will then become irrelevant.You can transfer your savings tax-free from a provident fund to a pension fund on changing jobs, but you cannot transfer from a pension to a provident fund.

10X calculator assumptions & disclaimers






Fees are the only difference between the “Industry” and 10X projections.
The fees used in the projections are inclusive of VAT. The investment referred to as “Industry” is assumed to charge total fees of 3% including VAT per annum. Morningstar’s Global Fund Investor Experience 2015 study shows that the average total expense ratio is 1.63% pa (which includes investment and performance fees), with the cost of advice and an administration platform adding an additional 1% to 1.5% pa. The investment with 10X assumes a total fee of 1% including VAT per annum and that the client comes directly to 10X (i.e. no advisor fee).  This is the maximum investment fee charged by 10X.
The calculator assumes the you save 10% of the salary you input and that this grows annually in line with inflation.
The investment term and savings period is assumed to be from your current age to age 65, unless you are over 55. If you are over 55 the investment term is assumed to be 20 years.
Your projected investment value is shown in real terms (today's money). This means we have shown what future values would be worth today, once we have stripped out inflation.
The projected average and poor investment returns are based on historic market returns after inflation from 1900 to 2015. Historically over your savings period, one in four outcomes have been worse than the outcome shown under poor returns and three in four have been better. The projections therefore account for historical market fluctuations.
The projections are based on the 10X High Equity portfolio, which is designed for investors with an investment term of 5 years and longer. The portfolio may be highly volatile over shorter periods.
The projections do not account for tax in any way.
The projections shown are based on information provided by you regarding your financial situation. 10X Investments does not in any way guarantee the projected benefits shown; we offer these projections merely to assist you in your financial planning. Although our projections take account of the historical returns earned in the South African and International markets, future market returns are uncertain.

10X calculator assumptions & disclaimers






Fees are the only difference between the “Industry” and 10X projections.
The fees used in the projections are inclusive of VAT. The investment referred to as “Industry” is assumed to charge total fees of 3% including VAT per annum. Morningstar’s Global Fund Investor Experience 2015 study shows that the average total expense ratio is 1.63% pa (which includes investment and performance fees), with the cost of advice and an administration platform adding an additional 1% to 1.5% pa. The investment with 10X is assumed to charge a fee according to the 10X Living Annuity scale. The maximum fee in this scale is 0.86% including VAT per annum.
Your projected income and investment value are shown in real terms (today's money). This means we have shown what future values would be worth today, once we have stripped out inflation.
The projected income in the first year will be equal to your desired income provided your annual income is between the regulatory limits of 2.5% and 17.5% of your investment value. Each year your projected income will keep pace with inflation, provided that it falls within these regulatory limits. The number of years that your projected income is able to keep pace with inflation without exceeding the regulatory cap of 17.5% is displayed on the outputs.
The projected average and poor investment returns are based on historic market returns after inflation from 1900 to 2015. These returns are based on the portfolio you selected (defaulted to 10X High Equity if your term exceeds 5 year). Historically over your savings period, one in four outcomes have been worse than the outcome shown under poor returns and three in four have been better. The projections therefore account for historical market fluctuations.
The projections shown are based on information provided by you regarding your financial situation. 10X Investments does not in any way guarantee the projected benefits shown; we offer these projections merely to assist you in your financial planning. Although our projections take account of the historical returns earned in the South African and International markets, future market returns are uncertain. Past performance does not guarantee nor indicate future results.
The calculations provided should not be construed as financial, legal or tax advice. In addition, such information should not be relied upon as the only source of information. This information is supplied from sources we believe to be reliable but we cannot guarantee its accuracy.

Morningstar’s Global Fund Investor Experience 2015 study shows that the average total expense ratio is 1.63% pa (which includes investment and performance fees), with the cost of advice and an administration platform adding an additional 1% to 1.5% pa. The investment with 10X is assumed to charge a fee according to the 10X Investment fee scale and that the client comes directly to 10X (i.e. no advisor fee). The maximum fee charged by 10X in these scales is 1.03% including VAT per annum.
Your projected benefits are shown in real terms (today's money). This means we have shown what future values would be worth today, once we have stripped out inflation.
The projected benefits are shown at age 65, unless you have changed the retirement age on the output page.
Where applicable, the projected monthly income assumes that you purchase an inflation-linked guaranteed annuity at retirement with your projected investment value. This estimate assumes that you use your entire projected investment value to purchase an annuity at retirement. Our estimate is based on the recent price of an inflation-linked guaranteed annuity without a spouse. An inflation-linked guaranteed annuity will provide you with an income that grows annually with inflation and pays you an income for the remainder of your life.
The projected average and poor investment returns are based on historic market returns after inflation from 1900 to 2015. Historically over your savings period, one in four outcomes have been worse than the outcome shown under poor returns and three in four have been better. The projections therefore account for historical market fluctuations.
The projections above are based on the default investment strategy called the 10X default glide path, unless you changed the investment portfolio on the output page . The 10X default glide path automatically matches the investment portfolio’s asset allocation to your assumed retirement age. This ensures that when you are more than five years from retirement that you mainly own assets that are expected to deliver high returns - with expected higher volatility of returns - and that the portfolio will gradually be switched into less volatile assets - with expected lower returns - in the last five years before you retire, with the aim of preserving capital.
The projections shown are based on information provided by you regarding your financial situation. 10X Investments does not in any way guarantee the projected benefits shown; we offer these projections merely to assist you in your financial planning.

                                    Accelerate Pension Funding and De-risking Ahead of Tax Reform: A Less Taxing Exercise


                                    Corporate plan sponsors continue to grapple with the risks and rising costs associated with managing and maintaining their pension plans. With the possibility of corporate tax reform on the horizon, plan sponsors may have a unique opportunity now to reduce PBGC expenses by accelerating funding and to deduct contributions at the current higher tax rate, resulting in a low risk, positive net present value outcome.

                                    A resurgent economy, strong equity markets and modestly higher interest rates are providing a tailwind to pension plan sponsors. The change in economic sentiment is driven in large part by expectations that companies will get a boost to cash flow from lower corporate tax rates, infrastructure spending and reduced regulations under the new administration.

                                Recent publications by Prudential and others have focused on the “what” and the “why” of pension risk transfer, describing the types of solutions that are available and the trends that are driving increased interest in de-risking. After briefly recapping the what and why, this insight series will focus on the “how,” outlining the steps involved in the most complete form of pension risk transfer: a buy-out transaction. Whether or not a buy-out is imminent, there are preparations a plan sponsor can undertake to make a future transaction easier and to shorten the timeline for execution.

                                The Five Myths Holding Back Plan Sponsors

                                This insight series demonstrates that the conventional wisdom about de-risking DB plans is often false. Invalidating the five myths discussed in this paper can help broaden the range of options that DB plan sponsors are willing to evaluate when formulating their long-term pension strategies. A wider range of options is essential to providing sponsors with the flexibility they need to achieve their long-term DB objectives.

  Corporate plan sponsors continue to grapple with the risks and rising costs associated with managing and maintaining their pension plans. With the possibility of corporate tax reform on the horizon, plan sponsors may have a unique opportunity now to reduce PBGC expenses by accelerating funding and to deduct contributions at the current higher tax rate, resulting in a low risk, positive net present value outcome.

  A resurgent economy, strong equity markets and modestly higher interest rates are providing a tailwind to pension plan sponsors. The change in economic sentiment is driven in large part by expectations that companies will get a boost to cash flow from lower corporate tax rates, infrastructure spending and reduced regulations under the new administration.

Recently, however, plan sponsors have come to understand that an insurer’s service delivery capabilities are just as important as its financial strength and capacity.

  Increasing life expectancy is a contributing factor to the vulnerability of pension systems worldwide, helping drive many countries toward an impending retirement crisis. This article, however, asserts that increasing longevity may actually be an opportunity for creating economic growth and stability—but only if retirement systems adapt. Appearing in the February 2013 edition of European Pensions, the paper argues that by allowing individuals to work longer, linking the retirement age of social security systems with changes in healthy life expectancy, ensuring that employer-sponsored pension plans achieve sustainable risk profiles, and supporting employees in retirement planning, longer life can, in fact, help create sustainable retirement systems.

  A recent article by Pension & Investments discusses the impact of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board’s new pension rules on government bond ratings - specifically, a requirement to recognize unfunded net pension liabilities on the balance sheet. The article suggests plan sponsors’ credit ratings won’t be seriously affected because, in most cases, the ratings agencies already understand the reality of these underfunded liabilities.

  The Australian population’s life expectancy is increasing by one year, every seven years. Each year of increased life expectancy adds around 5% to a DB liability which needs to be funded by the plan sponsor, or in the government’s case, the tax payer. At a time when many Australian plans are poised to adopt a risk transfer strategy, this paper provides clarity and appreciation for the global markets approach to pension risk transfer and the hedging solutions that will be available to the Australian market.

ABOUT PRUDENTIAL OUR TRACK RECORD

"Pension risk transfer transactions exemplify our capabilities, culture of multi-disciplinary collaboration, and financial strength. It’s not only about pricing. It’s about the confidence a client has in a high-quality close and execution, and doing it on a timely basis. We have very good marks for this in the industry. I doubt that any other insurer has started as early or invested as heavily as we have in this area. . . it involves risks that we know and manage well."
— John R. Strangfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Prudential Financial, Inc.
KEEPING PROMISES
You can be assured that Prudential’s foremost objective is to help individuals and institutions achieve financial security and peace of mind—it is at the very heart of our philosophy. We have a proven track record of ensuring that pension plan sponsors and their participants have an extraordinary experience every step of the way.   

In 1928, Prudential completed a pension buy-out transaction with the Cleveland Public Library. In 2013, we celebrated the 85th anniversary of that transaction, with six of the original retirees still receiving pension payments. Jeannette Eckert is one of them. This is her story.
Story of Jeannette Eckert  




 

In 2012, Prudential assumed benefit payments for approximately 110,000 participants in the General Motors Retirement Program for Salaried Employees. Martin Darvick is one of those participants, and this is his story.
