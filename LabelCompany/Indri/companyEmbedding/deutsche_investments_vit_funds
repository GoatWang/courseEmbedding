Fearless Girl

Why ESG Really Matters

ESG captures information that’s not readily available on the balance sheet or income statement, providing investors with a more complete picture.

Sustainability is clearly one of the world's most important goals. Chris McKnett argues that large institutional investors have a big role to play.

Amana Mutual Funds Trust
 





Amana Founders Video

 


Watch Amana Mutual Funds Trust founders, Nick Kaiser and Yaqub Mirza, discuss the creation and history of the Trust.

At Saturna Capital and the Amana Mutual Funds Trust, we endeavor to align our investments with our principles.
Our Funds favor companies with low price-to-earnings multiples, strong balance sheets, and proven businesses. They follow a value-oriented approach consistent with Islamic finance principles. Generally, these principles require that investors avoid interest and investments in businesses such as liquor, pornography, gambling, and banks. The Funds avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities.
Saturna Capital selects investments in companies that to its knowledge do not violate the requirements of the Islamic faith at the time of investment. To ensure that investments continue to meet the requirements of the Islamic faith, Saturna Capital engages Amanie Advisors Sdn Bhd, a leading consultant specializing in Islamic finance.
The Amana Funds limit the securities they purchase to those consistent with Islamic principles. This limits opportunities and may affect performance.
 
 





Saturna White Papers: Educational Series 

  
  
 Dancing with Correlation 
 We explore the correlation between Islamic investment certificates, including sukuk, and other investment asset classes as a means of better understanding the risk and return characteristics of this unique and distinct asset class.
 
   

  
 What Makes Sukuk Halal? 
 We explain what differentiates Islamic investment certificates, often called sukuk, from conventional bonds, and identifies the distinctive features that form the core of what makes sukuk Islamic-compliant, or halal.

Amana Mutual Funds Trust
 





Amana Founders Video

 


Watch Amana Mutual Funds Trust founders, Nick Kaiser and Yaqub Mirza, discuss the creation and history of the Trust.

At Saturna Capital and the Amana Mutual Funds Trust, we endeavor to align our investments with our principles.
Our Funds favor companies with low price-to-earnings multiples, strong balance sheets, and proven businesses. They follow a value-oriented approach consistent with Islamic finance principles. Generally, these principles require that investors avoid interest and investments in businesses such as liquor, pornography, gambling, and banks. The Funds avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities.
Saturna Capital selects investments in companies that to its knowledge do not violate the requirements of the Islamic faith at the time of investment. To ensure that investments continue to meet the requirements of the Islamic faith, Saturna Capital engages Amanie Advisors Sdn Bhd, a leading consultant specializing in Islamic finance.
The Amana Funds limit the securities they purchase to those consistent with Islamic principles. This limits opportunities and may affect performance.

 Dancing with Correlation 
 We explore the correlation between Islamic investment certificates, including sukuk, and other investment asset classes as a means of better understanding the risk and return characteristics of this unique and distinct asset class.
 
   

  
 What Makes Sukuk Halal? 
 We explain what differentiates Islamic investment certificates, often called sukuk, from conventional bonds, and identifies the distinctive features that form the core of what makes sukuk Islamic-compliant, or halal.

 The Green Century Funds
Approach
Green Century is a leader in environmentally and socially responsible investing. Through our three-pronged approach, we offer investors the opportunity to make an impact in a way no other mutual fund family can: through investing in sustainable companies; our leading shareholder advocacy program; and our unique ownership, where 100% of the profits earned managing the Green Century Funds can be used to support the environmental and public health work of our non-profit owners. 
Green Century believes that companies that seek to protect the environment by avoiding dangerous practices and policies may be more profitable in the long run since they may be likely to have less exposure to devalued or stranded carbon assets, they may avoid costly litigation, and may be better prepared for new regulatory restrictions. Green Century also believes that companies that pay attention to environmental, social and governance factors and take proactive actions around public health and environmental issues may enjoy a competitive advantage in appealing to consumers concerned about a company’s commitment to sustainability, and avoid damage to their brands.
Investment Strategy
All our Funds avoid these dangerous industries and corporations:
• Fossil fuel companies
• Fossil fuel fired utilities and companies with carbon reserves
• Producers of GMOs (genetically modified organisms)
• Civilian firearms and military weapons companies
• Nuclear power companies
• Companies that derive revenues from tobacco



And instead seek to invest in companies that:
• Have outstanding rankings on environmental factors, including performance on critical environmental impacts
• Apply extensive sustainability criteria throughout their supply chains
• Minimize risks to air, water and public health
• Act as socially responsible companies in the communities in which they operate
• Rank highly on governance factors
• Are environmental innovators such as energy efficiency and clean energy companies
• Are sustainable agriculture companies involved in natural and organic foods


The MSCI International Index Fund
The Green Century MSCI International Index Fund invests in the stocks of foreign companies in developed markets chosen for their outstanding environmental, social and governance factors.  This passively managed Fund invests in the stocks of companies included in the MSCI World ex USA SRI ex Fossil Fuels Index, customized to screen out fossil fuel companies.
Learn moreThe Equity Fund

Five Reasons to Consider Divesting from Fossil Fuels








October 16, 2013Share this page:Facebook89Twitter0LinkedIn5
Click to view PDF version
Since fall 2012, colleges, churches and cities have been leading robust discussions and moving to divest their holdings in the fossil fuel industry. Inspired by these actions, individual investors also have been moving their money out of coal, oil and gas companies.
Green Century has nearly a decade of experience with fossil fuel free investing and more than two decades of success with shareholder advocacy. This moment in history offers investors a unique opportunity to make a difference on climate change, while saving for their future.
Here are the top five reasons to consider divesting from fossil fuel companies:
1. Get Your Investments in Line with Your Values
Climate  change  is  a  serious  threat  to  our  society,  and  burning  fossil  fuels  is  a  main  cause  of worsening  floods,  droughts,  and  wildfires.  Many  investors  want  to  keep  their  investments  away from the industry that is principally responsible for causing a changing climate. Divesting allows you to align your beliefs with your investment decisions – an alignment that is being increasingly sought by young and old alike.
2. Reduce Corporate Influence on Energy Policy

Fossil fuel companies have tremendous influence over legislation and regulations, through lobbying in  state  capitols  and  Congress.  For  years,  this  power  has  helped  thwart  progress  on  the  policy solutions to climate change. The fossil fuel divestment campaign is inspired by the successful South African divestment campaign, and aims to exert similar pressure on the companies and institutions standing in the path of needed change.
3. Strengthen the Climate Movement
Climate change is so profound, and the solutions so wide-ranging, that it is often a challenge for people to find a way to make a powerful difference. The divestment strategy is successfully engaging the  public.  A  coordinated  and  organized  climate  change  network  –  that  includes  mayors,  church leaders and college students – is essential to passing needed energy policies.
4. May Reduce Exposure to Stranded Carbon Assets
The fossil fuel industry now controls reserves of coal, oil, and  gas  that  –  if  extracted  and  burned  –  will  release  five times more carbon dioxide than scientists agree is safe.* If governments restrict carbon emissions, companies owning those  fossil  fuel  reserves  may  not  be  able  to  extract  and sell them. The reserves may become stranded assets, and investors may then be left with devalued assets. Divesting now  could  allow  investors  to  reduce  their  exposure  to  a possible collapse of the so-called “carbon bubble.”
5. Reinvest in the Solutions
Once  divested  from  fossil  fuels,  investors  have  the opportunity to invest in forward-looking climate solutions, like companies specializing in energy efficiency, renewable energy, or other related climate mitigation strategies.

The Green Century Balanced Fund is already fully divested from fossil fuel companies and re-invested in green solutions.
The Green Century Equity Fund is divested from coal and major oil companies, and invests in the longest running socially responsible index.
Next Steps
Each investor must decide whether divesting from fossil fuels meets his or her objectives. But every day, more investors are deciding it is the right path forward.

 Why Choose Green Century
Our three-pronged approach offers investors the opportunity to make an impact through the power of their investments in a way no other socially responsible and sustainable mutual fund family can.
 




1. Investing in Sustainable Companies




2. Leading Shareholder Advocacy Program




3. Supporting Environmental and Public Health Non-Profits






1. Sustainable Investment Strategy
For 25 years, Green Century has helped individuals and institutions invest for their future without compromising their values. Green Century believes that environmentally responsible investing also offers potential financial benefits and there is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that investing with environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance may offer financial advantages. For example, we believe that when companies avoid harming the environment, communities in which they operate, and public health, they may not only enjoy a competitive advantage by appealing to consumers concerned about sustainability, but also may avoid damage to their brand reputations and costly litigation.
Green Century offers three mutual funds:

The Green Century MSCI International Index Fund invests in the stocks of foreign companies selected for their outstanding environmental, social and governance performance.
The Green Century Equity Fund  invests in the stocks of the companies included in the longest-running socially responsible index customized to exclude any fossil fuel companies in the index.
The Green Century Balanced Fund  invests in the stocks and bonds of environmentally responsible companies as well as green bonds, which finance climate mitigation projects worldwide.





SRI and Values-Based Exclusions


Fossil fuel companies – coal, oil and gas


Nuclear power companies


Military weapons and civilian firearm companies


Producers of genetically modified organisms (GMOs)


Tobacco companies





Examples of Sustainable Companies with Outstanding ESG Ratings


Energy efficiency; Renewables; Water treatment & conservation; Air pollution control


Sustainable infrastructure and transportation


Companies that disclose policies and performance on critical environmental impacts


Sustainable agriculture companies, including organic and natural food suppliers


Companies that apply sustainability criteria throughout the supply chain



Green Century uses values-based or socially, responsible, and impact (SRI) investing screens to avoid the most environmentally and socially dangerous industries. This aligns investments with the values of our investors and also offers potential financial benefits, such as avoiding stranded assets that may be associated with investing in coal, oil and gas companies.
Green Century also employs environmental, social, and governance ratings and performance to only select those companies that perform better across these categories as compared to companies in the same sector.
While some other investments may just use one or the other or the above methodologies, Green Century uses both to deliver high impact investments.

Fossil Fuel Free Investing:
Green Century is the first family of responsible and diversified fossil fuel free mutual funds in the U.S. Our fossil fuel free commitment exceeds the global divestment baseline of avoiding the largest 200 fossil fuel companies as ranked by potential carbon emissions content of their reported reserves. Green Century goes beyond this initial list since we have found that when investors decide to eliminate dirty energy from their portfolios for ethical and/or financial reasons, they more often want to eliminate them from their portfolios entirely.
Our definition of fossil fuel free investing excludes companies that explore for, extract, process and refine, and transmit coal, oil and gas, as well as companies that burn fossil fuels to make electricity or any companies with carbon reserves.
As more investments are described as environmental or fossil fuel free, we believe it is important to keep these distinctions in mind:
“Low carbon” is not the same as fossil fuel free. It might be, but it also might apply to carbon emissions and carbon reserves, or it might just apply to the overall carbon footprint of an investment.  Since there is no standardized characterization of the term, you should review the prospectus (see below) for exclusions and also look in the energy and utility sector holdings section of a fund. Note that “energy sector” may roughly translate to “fossil fuel companies” and holdings noted in the “utility sector” may be fossil fuel burning utilities or may be likely to be involved in fossil fuel extraction and consumption.
Review the prospectus. Marketing terms are not the same as investment strategies and binding exclusion, such as avoiding fossil fuel companies, and should be spelled out in the prospectus. The prospectus is a legal document that should always be available to a prospective investor that contains a fund’s objectives, investment strategies, risks, as well as other details. Without a clear statement addressing what fossil fuel free means in the prospectus, an investor cannot be sure what the fund may or may not invest in. Green Century details our definition of fossil fuel companies and avoidance of these companies in our prospectus. You can review the prospectus of the Green Century Funds by clicking here.
Our commitment to fossil fuel free investing is one way we help our investors avoid the very companies and industries at the heart of many environmental and social issues as well as potential financial risks associated with oil price volatility and stranded assets.

What about Performance?
There are growing concerns about investing in coal, oil and gas including the volatility of oil prices, capital expenditures on high-cost projects such as off-shore and Arctic drilling, and the potential of devalued or stranded carbon reserve assets. Fossil Fuel Divestment at Green Century.
These concerns are just some of the reasons Green Century has a long-standing investment strategy of avoiding the worst polluting companies and instead investing in companies that are helping build a sustainable economy. Read one of these recent studies on performance by leading industry analysts:

2. Leading Shareholder Advocacy Program
Even corporate sustainability leaders have room for improvement, which is why Green Century works with dozens of companies every year to adopt stronger environmental practices and policies throughout their supply chains.
 
Forest Protection Campaign
Deforestation is a leading cause of increased carbon emissions, which contribute to global climate change. Deforestation also poses a number of tangible business risks, which could include but are not limited to, current legal liabilities in emerging markets, pending legislation, reputational risk, and the ability to access raw materials to maintain revenue streams.
To help curb climate change, and limit our investors’ risks, Green Century has launched a five-year campaign to help stop deforestation caused by the production of soy, cattle, timber, rubber, and palm oil in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. In addition to other successes, the campaign has helped secure a zero-deforestation commitment from Wilmar,* the world’s largest palm oil trader, that will avoid 1.5 gigatons of carbon pollution between 2015 and 2020.
To learn more about our efforts and successes regarding our commitment to help stop deforestation, please download Green Century’s Forest Protection Campaign four-pager below or visit our Forest Protection page.
Sustainable Agriculture Program
Sustainable agriculture is the production of food, fiber, or other plant or animal products using farming practices that protect the environment, human health, and animal well-being. It is this form of agriculture that will provide an increasing global population the ability to produce plentiful, healthful food well into the future without destroying the environment or threatening human health.
At Green Century, we are currently working to decrease antibiotic misuse, the use of confinement cages and gestation crates, and promoting plant-based proteins.
To learn more about our specific efforts and successes, please download Green Century’s Sustainable Agriculture Program two-pager below.

3. Supporting Environmental and Public Health Non-Profits

One-hundred percent of the profits earned managing the Green Century Funds are used to support the environmental and public health work of non-profit organizations.
Currently, our non-profit owners are working toward ending the overuse of antibiotics on factory farms, banning fracking whenever possible, and securing carbon pollution regulations. And, to date, these organizations have accomplished incredible success, including:


Helping support a proposition that upheld a statewide ban on plastic bags in California
Gaining permanent protection of natural and archaeological wonders by creating three national monuments in California, Nevada and Texas
Securing protection for thousands of rivers and drinking supply sources across the country
Expanding solar energy through the Million Solar Roofs Initiative in California, influencing Massachusetts’ policy to power 50,000 homes with solar energy and securing pro-solar policies in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Minnesota, New Jersey and North Carolina

Risk Considerations
Investments in mutual funds involve risk. Stocks may decline in value. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. There are additional risks associated with investing in commodities, high-yield bonds, aggressive growth stocks, non-diversified/concentrated funds and small- and mid-cap stocks which are more fully explained in the prospectuses. Please read the prospectus for more information.

Read the Prospectus
To obtain a summary prospectus, if available, or prospectus, download for mutual funds or download for money funds, talk to your financial representative or contact us, We advise you to carefully consider the product's objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. The summary prospectus and prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment product. Please read the summary prospectus and prospectus carefully before you invest. 
Nothing contained herein is fiduciary or impartial investment advice that is individualized or directed to any plan, plan participant, or IRA owner regarding the advisability of any investment transaction, including any IRA distribution or rollover.

Risk Considerations
Investments in mutual funds involve risk. Stocks may decline in value. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. There are additional risks associated with investing in commodities, high-yield bonds, aggressive growth stocks, non-diversified/concentrated funds and small- and mid-cap stocks which are more fully explained in the prospectuses. Please read the prospectus for more information.

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS                                                          

We are pleased to present you with this annual report for Deutsche VIT Small Cap
Index Fund (the `Fund'), providing a detailed review of the market, the Fund,   
and our outlook. Included are complete financial summaries of the Fund's        
operations and listings of the Fund's holdings.                                 

MARKET ACTIVITY                                                                 
CONTINUING THE TREND FROM 1999 AND 2000, THE SMALL-CAP EQUITY MARKET            
OUTPERFORMED ITS LARGE-CAP BRETHREN FOR THE YEAR ENDED December 31, 2001. WITH A
ONE-YEAR RETURN OF 2.49%, THE RUSSELL 2000 INDEX 1 DRAMATICALLY OUTPACED THE S&P
500 Index 2 return of -11.87%. Investors continued to seek the lower valuations 
of small-cap stocks.                                                            
[BULLET]   Over the course of the year, the small-cap equity market, like the   
       broader equity markets, saw divergent performance from quarter to
quarter.                                                  
[BULLET]   Despite eleven interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve Board     
        during the year--the most concentrated effort to rejuvenate the US
           economy in the central bank's history--the sharp inventory correction
  in the Information Technology and Telecommunications sectors
      broadened to affect most industries and many companies' earnings
estimates.                                                
[BULLET]   September saw the terrorist attacks on the US, including the         
           destruction of the World Trade Center, a symbol of US and global free
     trade. The tragic human and economic devastation and disruption
         resulting from this event caused the US equity markets to close for
         four days. The Federal Reserve Board and other central banks, given
           the scope of the global economic disruption, quickly reduced interest
      rates to inject liquidity into the financial markets. The equity
          markets severely retrenched for the remainder of the month driven by
the adverse effects of uncertainty on investor sentiment. 
[BULLET]   Within the small-cap sector, value-oriented stocks significantly     
          outperformed growth-oriented stocks for the year, as measured by the
     Russell 2000 Growth Index 3 vs. the Russell 2000 Value Index. 4

MOST SMALL-CAP SECTORS PRODUCED NEGATIVE PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR.           
[BULLET]   The annual reconstitution of the Russell 2000 Index came at the end  
          of June 2001, with this year's changes almost the mirror opposite of
the 2000 reconstitution.                                  
[BULLET]   The Information Technology sector increased its Index weighting, as  
        many of the 'New Economy' stocks migrated back down to the Russell
        2000 Index from the Russell 1000 Index. 5 In contrast, many Health
           Care, Financial Services and Consumer Discretionary stocks previously
           in the Russell 2000 Index were moved up to the Russell 1000 Index, as
their capitalizations grew on a relative basis.           

MANAGER OUTLOOK                                                                 
As an index fund, seeking to replicate as closely as possible (before deduction 
of expenses) the broad diversification and returns of the Russell 2000 Index, we
neither evaluate short-term fluctuations in the Fund's performance nor manage   
according to a given outlook for the equity markets or the economy in general.  
Still, we will continue monitoring economic conditions and how they affect the  
financial markets, as we seek to closely track the performance of the small cap 
stock market.                                                                   

We anticipate an economic recovery in 2002 that would suggest an improved       
picture for small-cap equities, as well as the broader US equity markets. For   
the first time since 1999, US economic activity is expected to accelerate, which
should bolster corporate revenues. Further, it appears the supply of labor      
should be less strained in the coming year. This, in turn, may reduce the       
pressure unit labor costs have exerted on profit margins in 2000

the Russell 3000 Index.

and 2001. In short, we believe the economy is probably near the bottom of the   
profit cycle. We believe small-cap stocks' relative outperformance seen over the
last several years may continue into 2002, as there are a number of positive    
factors supporting smaller stocks. For example, while past performance is no    
guarantee of future results, in the 12-month periods following each of the past 
10 recessions, small-cap stocks have outperformed large-cap stocks by an average
of 7.5%. This outperformance was due primarily to better fundamentals, as the   
segment received the first boost of productivity from interest rate cuts. Also, 
despite their recent outperformance as a group, many small-cap stocks remain    
undervalued relative to large-cap stocks.

1   PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. MARKET VOLATILITY CAN 
  SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT SHORT-TERM PERFORMANCE. Results of an investment made
today may differ substantially from the Fund's historical performance.  
  Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's
  shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
All performance assumes the reinvestment of dividend and capital gain   
distributions. Performance would have been lower during the specified   
periods if certain of the Fund's fees and expenses had not been waived. 
   There is no guarantee that the Fund will be able to mirror the Russell 2000
Index closely enough to track its performance. Investments in small     
companies generally carry greater risk than is associated with large    
 companies, such as narrower markets, limited financial resources and less
liquid stock.                                                           
2   The Fund's inception date is August 22, 1997. Benchmark returns are for the 
   periods beginning August 22, 1997 for the Russell 2000 Index and August 31,
1997 for the Lipper Small Core Funds Average.                           
3   `Russell 2000(REGISTRATION MARK)' is a trademark of the Frank Russell       
   Company and has been licensed for use by the Fund's investment advisor. The
   Russell 2000(REGISTRATION MARK) Index is an unmanaged index that tracks the
  common stock price movement of the 2,000 smallest companies in the Russell
  3000(REGISTRATION MARK) Index, which measures the performance of the 3,000
    largest US companies based on total market capitalization. Benchmark returns
 do not reflect expenses that have been deducted from the Fund's return. A
direct investment in an index is not possible.                          
4   Lipper figures represent the average of the total returns reported by all of
the mutual funds designated by Lipper Inc. as falling into the category 
indicated. These figures do not reflect sales charges.

 distributions. Earnings from variable annuity investments compound tax free
until withdrawal, so no adjustments are made for income taxes. Performance
 would have been lower during the specified periods if certain of the Fund's
fees and expenses had not been waived.                                    
2  The Fund's inception date is August 22, 1997. Benchmark returns are for the  
 periods beginning August 22, 1997 for the Russell 2000 Index and August 31,
1997 for the Lipper Small Cap Core Funds Average.                         
3  The Russell 2000(REGISTRATION MARK) Index is an unmanaged index that tracks  
the common stock price movement of the 2,000 smallest companies in the    
  Russell 3000(REGISTRATION MARK) Index, which measures the performance of the
3,000 largest US companies based on total market capitalization. A direct 
investment in an index is not possible.                                   
4  Lipper figures represent the average of the total returns reported by all of 
the mutual funds designated by Lipper Inc. as falling into the category   
indicated.

Deutsche VIT Small Cap Index Fund                                               
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes to Financial Statements                                                   

NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                        
A. ORGANIZATION                                                                 
Deutsche Asset Management VIT Funds Trust (the `Trust') is registered under the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 (the `Act'), as amended, as a diversified,       
open-end management investment company. The Trust is organized as a business    
trust under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Deutsche VIT Small   
Cap Index Fund (the `Fund') is one of the Funds the Trust offers to investors.  

The investment objective of the Fund is to replicate, as closely as possible    
(before the deduction of expenses) the performance of the Russell 2000 Index,   
which emphasizes stocks of small US companies.                                  

B. VALUATION OF SECURITIES                                                      
The Fund values its investments at market value.                                

When valuing listed equity securities, the Fund uses the last sale price prior  
to the calculation of the Fund's net asset value. When valuing equity securities
that are not listed or that are listed but have not traded, the Fund uses the   
bid price in the over-the-counter market.                                       

When valuing short-term securities that mature within sixty days, the Fund uses 
amortized cost.                                                                 

When valuing securities for which market quotations are not readily available or
for which the market quotations that are available are considered unreliable,   
the Fund determines a fair value in good faith under procedures established by  
and under the general supervision of the Board of Trustees. The Fund may use    
these procedures to establish the fair value of securities when, for example, a 
significant event occurs between the time the market closes and the time the    
Fund values its investments. After consideration of various factors, the Fund   
may value the securities at their last reported price or at fair value. At      
December 31, 2001, there were no fair valued securities.                        

C. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME                                
Securities transactions are recorded on trade date. Realized gains and losses   
are determined by comparing the proceeds of a sale or the cost of a purchase    
with a specific offsetting transaction.                                         

Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Interest income, including 
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is accrued daily. Estimated
expenses are also accrued daily.                                                

D. DISTRIBUTIONS                                                                
The Fund pays annual dividends from its net investment income and makes annual  
distributions of any net realized capital gains to the extent they exceed       
capital loss carryforwards. The Fund records dividends and distributions on its 
books on the ex-dividend date.                                                  

E. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES                                                         
It is the Fund's policy to qualify as a regulated investment company under the  
Internal Revenue Code and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income 
to shareholders. Therefore, no federal income taxes have been accrued.          

F. FUTURES CONTRACTS 
The Fund may buy or sell financial futures contracts on established futures     
exchanges. Under the terms of a financial futures contract, the Fund agrees to  
receive or deliver a specific amount of a financial instrument at a specific    
price on a specific date.                                                       

The Fund's investments in financial futures contracts are designed to closely   
replicate the benchmark index used by the Fund.                                 

When the Fund enters into a futures contract, it is required to make a margin   
deposit equal to a percentage of the face value of the contract. While the      
contract is outstanding, the Fund may be required to make additional deposits or
may have part of its deposit returned as a result of changes in the relationship
between the face value of the contract and the value of the underlying security.
The Fund records these payments as unrealized gains or losses. When entering    
into a closing transaction, the Fund realizes a gain or loss.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes to Financial Statements                                                   

Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day by the
board of trade or exchange on which they are traded.                            

G. OTHER                                                                        
The Trust accounts separately for the assets, liabilities and operations of each
of the funds. Expenses directly attributable to a fund are charged to that fund,
while the expenses that are attributable to the Trust are allocated among the   
funds based upon the relative net assets of each fund.                          

H. ORGANIZATION COST                                                            
Costs incurred in connection with the Fund's organization are being amortized on
a straight-line basis over five years beginning on August 22, 1997. In the event
that any of the initial shares are redeemed during such amortization period, the
redemption proceeds will be reduced for any unamortized organization costs in

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS                                         
At December 31, 2001, capital contributions, accumulated undistributed net      
investment income, and accumulated net realized gain (loss) from investments    
have been adjusted for current period permanent book/tax differences which arose
principally from adjustments related to dividends and other non-taxable         
distributions received by the Fund, and reclassification of REIT dividends and  
REIT return of capital adjustments. These reclassifications resulted in the     
following increases/(decreases) in the components of net assets:

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   

For federal income tax purposes, the tax basis of investments held at December
31, 2001 was $157,961,482. The aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all  
investments at December 31, 2001 was $17,426,349 and the aggregate gross        
unrealized depreciation for all investments was $23,621,556. The difference     
between book basis and tax-basis unrealized appreciation/depreciation is        
attributable to the tax deferral of losses on wash sales.                       

Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with federal 
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted accounting     
principles.                                                                     

Distributions during the years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000    
were characterized as follows for tax purposes:

At December 31, 2001, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis   
were as follows:

The Fund participates with other affiliated entities in an unsecured revolving  
credit facility with a syndicate of banks in the amount of $200,000,000, which  
expires April 26, 2002. A commitment fee is apportioned among the participants  
based on their relative net assets. The Fund did not borrow during the period.  

NOTE 7--FUTURES CONTRACTS 
The Fund had the following open contracts at December 31, 2001:                 

Type of                                         Market      Unrealized

Index Future      3/02        20     Long $4,893,000        $(6,308)        

The use of futures contracts involves elements of market risk and risks in      
excess of the amount recognized in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The 
`market value' presented above represents the Fund's total exposure in such     
contracts whereas only the net unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) is        
reflected in the Fund's net assets. Risks inherent in the use of futures        
contracts include 1) adverse changes in the value of such instruments, 2) an    
imperfect correlation between the price of the contracts and the underlying     
index and 3) the possibility of an illiquid secondary market.                   

At December 31, 2001, the Fund pledged securities with a value of $519,595 to   
cover margin requirements on open futures contracts.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS                                                  

To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees                                       
Deutsche Asset Management VIT Funds Trust--                                     
Small Cap Index Fund                                                            

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Small   
Cap Index Fund, including the schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2001, 
and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements 
of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and
the financial highlights for each of the four years in the period then ended and
for the period August 22, 1997 (commencement of operations) through December 31,
1997. These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility
of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these  
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.              

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and       
financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes       
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included      
confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2001, by correspondence with
the custodian and brokers. An audit also includes assessing the accounting      
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as        
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our    
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                              

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to   
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Small 
Cap Index Fund at December 31, 2001, the results of its operations for the year 
then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the      
period then ended, and its financial highlights for each of the four years in   
the period then ended and for the period August 22, 1997 (commencement of       
operations) through December 31, 1997, in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States.                                        

                                                                  /S/ SIGNATUTRE

ESG Research

Deputy Global Chief Investment Officer Lori Heinel highlights the key findings of our global institutional investor survey, Performing for the Future.









 

Ambition to Action

From an extensive asset stewardship program to sophisticated screening and integration strategies, we’re helping clients harness the potential of ESG investing and transform their ESG ambitions into action.






Featured Topics






ESG Investing


Aligning Factor and ESG Views

Aligning investment portfolios with views on ESG issues  without compromising effectiveness of factor exposures.






Asset Stewardship


Engagement for Sustainable Value

Why active engagement with companies is vital for guiding activities and behaviors that help promote sustainable results.






Asset Stewardship


Fearless Girl

SSGA takes action to celebrate the power of women in leadership and to urge greater gender diversity on corporate boards. 









 


Why ESG Really Matters

ESG captures information that’s not readily available on the balance sheet or income statement, providing investors with a more complete picture.


 


The Investment Logic For Sustainability

Sustainability is clearly one of the world's most important goals. Chris McKnett argues that large institutional investors have a big role to play.


 


Asset Stewardship

We actively engage with companies on a range of important governance and sustainability issues to ensure our portfolios are appropriately focused on long-term value creation.

Amana Mutual Funds Trust
 





Amana Founders Video

 


Watch Amana Mutual Funds Trust founders, Nick Kaiser and Yaqub Mirza, discuss the creation and history of the Trust.

At Saturna Capital and the Amana Mutual Funds Trust, we endeavor to align our investments with our principles.
Our Funds favor companies with low price-to-earnings multiples, strong balance sheets, and proven businesses. They follow a value-oriented approach consistent with Islamic finance principles. Generally, these principles require that investors avoid interest and investments in businesses such as liquor, pornography, gambling, and banks. The Funds avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities.
Saturna Capital selects investments in companies that to its knowledge do not violate the requirements of the Islamic faith at the time of investment. To ensure that investments continue to meet the requirements of the Islamic faith, Saturna Capital engages Amanie Advisors Sdn Bhd, a leading consultant specializing in Islamic finance.
The Amana Funds limit the securities they purchase to those consistent with Islamic principles. This limits opportunities and may affect performance.
 
 





Saturna White Papers: Educational Series 

  
  
 Dancing with Correlation 
 We explore the correlation between Islamic investment certificates, including sukuk, and other investment asset classes as a means of better understanding the risk and return characteristics of this unique and distinct asset class.
 
   

  
 What Makes Sukuk Halal? 
 We explain what differentiates Islamic investment certificates, often called sukuk, from conventional bonds, and identifies the distinctive features that form the core of what makes sukuk Islamic-compliant, or halal.
