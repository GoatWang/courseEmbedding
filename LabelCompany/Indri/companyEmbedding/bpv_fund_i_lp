HSBC
– HSBC Total Return Fund (HTRIX):
The Fund seeks to maximize total return by investing in a combination of US dollar-denominated emerging market sovereign, quasi-sovereign* and corporate bonds as well as emerging market local bonds and currencies. The Fund is actively managed and is not benchmark-constrained, allowing the Fund’s portfolio management team flexibility to actively allocate among what they believe is the optimal combination of emerging market assets which may also include equity, equity-linked securities and derivative instruments. The team follows a top-down and fundamentally-driven approach and the portfolio is built without an inherent bias to any particular emerging market asset class.
* The HSBC Total Return Fund defines Quasi-Sovereign companies as those: implicitly or explicitly backed by their country of domicile’s government, or with greater than 50% held by their country of domicile’s government.
– HSBC Global High Income Bond Fund (HBIIX):
This actively managed fund seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns with steady income as the largest component. The fund invests in a well-diversified portfolio consisting of three core regional sleeves: US credit, Euro credit and emerging markets (EM). Invests primarily in BBB and BB rated corporate bonds and may invest in securitized debt. We use a customized benchmark to expand and diversify the global opportunity set, improving the fund’s risk return profile.
Federated Investors
Leveraged Company Stock: 
Federated’s Leveraged Company Stock Strategy applies a private equity approach to public stocks by targeting the stocks of leveraged companies. Using a bottom-up, value approach, this concentrated portfolio invests in micro- to mid-cap stocks with strong and stable free-cash-flow characteristics. The strategy is managed within Federated’s high-yield group, as credit and capital structure analysis are key components to its strategy of identifying mispriced stocks and risk management.
Trade Finance Fixed Income: 
Trade Finance offers investors the potential for a source of uncorrelated return, with low volatility and returns that adjust with inflation. It is an asset class that requires specialized expertise including intensive legal and operational due diligence, a deep understanding of risk and how to mitigate it, and relationships with the largest global banks. We believe that as the worldwide demand for trade continues to grow, a diversified pool of trade transactions will consistently deliver the “pure alpha” that investors seek.
Guardian Capital
– Guardian Global Fundamental Equity: 
The investment process is a fundamental, bottom-up stock selection approach which is designed to give exposure to a concentrated portfolio of stocks each of which have significantly better growth and quality characteristics than the market average, but which are not overvalued at the time of purchase. Portfolio construction is index agnostic and aims to provide high active share at all times. Country and sector weightings are driven by stock selection decisions rather than “top down” asset allocation activities.
Guardian Global Dividend Equity: 
Guardian’s global equity investment process employs a systematic approach to finding best-of-breed companies within global sectors. Our proprietary alpha system, called GEMX, compares the rates of change in fundamental factors to detect pockets of strength in global markets. To be rated as a BUY in GEMX, a company must not only exhibit superior fundamentals, but those fundamentals must also be recognized by the market in terms of relative share price performance. In cases where there is a breakdown in the correlation between fundamentals and share price performance, then conviction is low and the company is penalized in our analysis.
Our Global Dividend Equity strategy emphasizes dividend paying securities, yet instead of selecting dividend payers on the basis of yield alone, empirical evidence suggests that focusing on dividend payers that exhibit strong dividend Growth, Payout and Sustainability (GPS) characteristics leads to strong risk adjusted returns, coupled with reduced volatility. Guardian’s unique approach to stock selection is thus focused on selecting names that exhibit strong GPS characteristics, rather than seeking yield for yield’s sake.  Aside from providing yield which acts as a dampening effect on volatility, our dividend strategy has provided strong downside protection during negative market cycles.  Preservation of capital is therefore an important attribute of our strategy which proves beneficial to any endowment/foundation who seeks capital preservation.
The investment style is a combination of yield and growth at a reasonable price. The overall emphasis combines a focus on yield as well as dividend growth.  
Chase Investment Counsel Corporation
Our  Large-Cap Growth Equity product seeks high quality large-cap growth companies that are prudently priced. Starting with a broad universe of stocks, fundamental screens first focus on companies with earnings growth of 10% or more for the past five years and increasing earnings in seven of the past 10 years. A further analysis, using fundamental and technical measures, refines and ranks the universe to a smaller number of stocks. The portfolio holds 30-45 stocks diversified by both sector and industry group. The long-term goal for the large cap portfolio is to provide superior risk adjusted returns over full market cycles.
Our  Mid-Cap Growth Equity product seeks high quality midcap growth companies that are prudently priced in an often overlooked segment of the market. Mid-Cap equities historically have provided small-cap like returns with lower volatility. As with our large cap portfolio we start with a broad universe of stocks. A fundamental screen is used to focus on names with a history of earnings growth of 10% or more for the past five years and increasing earnings in seven of the past 10 years. A further analysis refines the universe to a smaller number of stocks using additional fundamental and technical factors such as positive earnings revision/surprises, strong relative price performance, and improving profitability. The portfolio holds 35-55 stocks diversified by both sector and industry group. The goal for the mid-cap portfolio is also to deliver superior risk adjusted returns over a full market cycle.
Ardsley Partners
– Ardsley Partners Renewable Energy Fund, L.P., launched in July 2006. The primary objective of the Fund is to generate strong returns through a portfolio of long and short public equity investments, regardless of economic conditions within the renewable energy sector and related areas. The fund seeks to identify solutions to the global energy and natural resource problems and invest in companies whose technologies offer alternatives of more efficient use of natural resources. The process combines company specific research, sector analysis and a top-down macroeconomic outlook to identify the best opportunities within each subsector and isolate individual alpha generating shorts across all market capitalization and geographies within the renewable energy sector and related areas. Hands-on, active portfolio management included balancing and shifting sub-sector exposures within the renewable energy universe are at the core of risk management. The Portfolio Manager, Spencer Hempleman, has worked at Ardsley for more than 13 years. Spencer earned his BA at Tufts and MBA at NYU Stern.
– Ardsley Healthcare Fund, L.P., launched in February 2012, is a long/short equity Fund focused on investing in asymmetric risk/reward opportunities across all healthcare sub-sectors and related areas. The fund seeks to identify the regulatory, global macroeconomic and sub-sector specific cycles impacting the healthcare industry and combine it with rigorous bottom-up analysis to generate alpha. The primary objective is to produce strong returns while maintaining low volatility through a long-short portfolio of healthcare equity investments. The team maintains a value/GARP orientation and combines it with fundamental and catalytic-driven short investments. The process combines company specific research, sector analysis and a top-down macroeconomic outlook to identify the best opportunities and isolate individual company alpha shorts with deteriorating fundamentals. Portfolio Managers, Kirk D., Balzer and Jeffrey P. Knightly have worked together at Ardsley for more than 15 years.
– Ardsley Partners Fund II, L.P. was founded in March 1987. The investment universe of the Fund is global with an emphasis on technology, telecom, life sciences, energy and alternative energy companies. The fund uses a concentrated book approach with the top ten core holdings representing Ardsley’s best ideas and typically 40-50% of the portfolio. We seek to enhance returns and dampen downside volatility through the short portfolio and by the opportunistic trading of stocks and options. Sector specialist analysts use a fundamental, bottom-up research approach to identify rapidly growing companies for core portfolio investments. The portfolio manager, Philip Hempleman, is the Founder and Managing Partner of Ardsley and is responsible for the portfolio construction and risk management.
Forefront Income Trust
– Forefront Income Trust:
The fund’s objective is to generate current income, primarily by originating and investing in high yielding “Structured Finance” opportunities including: asset backed and preferred securities, senior secured loans and factoring. The Trust is focused on securities with maturities of less than two years, often structured with more frequent interest payments than other available investments in order to enhance the liquidity and reduce rate sensitivity of the portfolio. All investments are structured to mitigate the risk typically associated with high yielding opportunities, and are also designed to be non-correlated to major markets.
Forefront Income Trust is a Delaware statutory trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a closed-end, non-diversified, “interval” investment company. It provides partial liquidity quarterly and dividends 90% of its profits annually.
BPV Capital Management
– BPV Large Cap Value CIT:
The BPV Large Cap Value CIT is sub-advised by AJO in Philadelphia, PA. AJO has managed a similar strategy in SMA form for over two decades. The CIT seeks to outperform the Russell 1000 Value Index by evaluating each company relative to its peers using multiple measures within the categories of value, management, momentum, and sentiment. As disciplined investors, AJO’s portfolio managers attempt to maintain their style, philosophy, and process through all market conditions. The CIT focuses on seasoned liquid companies and evaluates them within industry peer groups, using a proprietary multifactor valuation model. Securities are selected by combining the notion of expected return and assessment of risk for each company, using both commonsense and sophisticated risk controls. AJO focuses on minimizing transaction costs to maximize return for investors. AJO measures and monitors cost to trade and are open-minded about using most any platform or broker to conduct trades.
– BPV Short Duration Government MBS:
The BPV Short Duration Government MBS strategy is designed to seek a stable income stream and low volatility total return by attempting to minimize credit and interest rate exposure. The strategy invests in short duration US Treasury and US Agency securities seeking to provide a stable income stream. More specifically, the strategy focuses on opportunities in the US Agency Mortgage Backed Securities and Collateralized Mortgage Obligations, which have historically shown less sensitivity to changes in interest rates and represent a relatively liquid fixed income market. The strategy also seeks to enhance returns by actively managing the portfolio, identifying and purchasing securities with undervalued cash flow potential to purchase, and liquidating securities in the portfolio that have overvalued cash flows.
GW&K Investment Management
The GW&K Small Cap Growth Strategy focuses on companies with a market cap at purchase between $250 million and $4 billion or within the range of the Russell 2000 Growth Index. Through a disciplined research process, we seek out companies that have a dominant or strengthening position within a niche market, exhibit sustainable and above-average growth, and whose shares trade at reasonable valuations. We are insistent about the sustainability of earnings growth as well believe it is often overlooked and not properly recognized by the market. We invest for the long term and aim to provide clients with a fully diversified portfolio that participates in rising markets and protects returns when markets decline.
The GW&K Small/Mid Cap Core Strategy focuses on small and medium companies with a market cap at purchase between $250 million and $10 billion or within the range of the Russell 2500 Index. Through a disciplined research process, we seek out companies that exhibit sustainable growth, and whose shares trade at reasonable valuations. We are insistent about the sustainability of earnings growth as we believe it is often overlooked and not properly recognized by the market. We invest for the long term and aim to provide clients with a fully diversified portfolio that participates in rising markets and protects returns when markets decline.
HighMark Capital
The  HighMark Microcap Core Strategy seeks to outperform the Russell Microcap Index by constructing a diversified portfolio using an investment process that combines analysis of economics and market forces; individual stock analysis and risk management; and efficient strategy implementation and trading.  the core of our process is knowledge-based investing which uses signals from the activity of unique market participants to assess potential company appreciation.
Martin Currie
International Long-Term Unconstrained
The strategy invests with an absolute return mindset – building a concentrated equity portfolio we believe can sustain high returns on equity and where the market is underestimating the value of their future cashflows. Specifically, we target a return of CPI +6% per annum over the long-term,* and would expect to outperform the MSCI AC World ex US index on a rolling five year basis with lower volatility. Uniquely – forensic accounting and a thorough examination of corporate governance are at the heart of the investment process.
Japan Long/Short
The strategy is a directional Japan long/short product that employs a combination of top-down and bottom-up analysis. The strategy aims to achieve capital appreciation by efficiently capturing uncorrelated Japanese equity returns with controlled volatility and downside protection. It aims to capture alpha on the long and short book through fundamental stock selection. Balance sheet positioning is influenced by the top-down macro overlay which seeks to create long-term positive contributions from beta.
L&B Realty Advisors, LLP
L&B Core Income Partners is an open end commingled core real estate investment partnership that invests in traditional property types located in the United States, including multifamily, retail, office and industrial properties. The fund is designed to target real estate investments between $35MM and $65MM, which are smaller in size than larger core funds pursue to deploy capital. For each property type, the fund targets well located older properties (second or third generation tenants) that can be acquired at less than replacement cost. The fund is not competing with other core funds for the same investments, providing the fund diversification in asset size and the opportunity to acquire well located core real property assets at higher cap rates and total return profiles
RNC Genter Capital Management
Taxable Quality Intermediate – (US Gov/Credit Intermediate) – The strategy seeks to provide maximum current income and strong total return potential in all market cycles by investing primarily in investment-grade bonds with an average intermediate-term maturity.
Municipal Quality Intermediate – The strategy seeks to provide capital preservation, high levels of tax-free income, and strong total return in all market cycles by investing in investment-grade municipal securities of short and intermediate-term maturity.
Dividend Income Equity – The strategy seeks to provide stable, tax-efficient cash-flow for the income-oriented investor as well as long-term capital appreciation by investing in the Dividend Income paying stocks of large-cap companies. As a secondary consideration, investments exposing clients to less volatility to overall market movements are favored.
Basso Capital Management, L.P.
Basso Investors Ltd.
Basso is a private investment fund manager based in Stamford, CT. that has been managing money for qualified individuals and institutions since 1994. Basso’s investment team focuses on credit research, structural analysis and underlying company fundamentals in order to identify opportunities across a company’s entire capital structure. The team seeks capital preservation and the avoidance of losses through conservative risk management processes. The fund seeks capital appreciation by investing in global convertible securities. Typically the fund offsets a long position in a convertible security with the short sale of the issuer’s underlying common stock in an attempt to limit total downside risk. Credit default swaps and asset swaps may also be employed as hedging vehicles. The fund typically maintains a large number of positions and will use leverage to enhance returns. The fund also attempts to minimize its exposure to interest rate, equity and credit risk.
Sit Investment Associates
Sit Short Duration
The objective is to outperform the Barclays 1-3 Year Government Bond Index over an interest
rate cycle with less volatility, a high level of current income and liquidity. This entails an emphasis on seasoned high coupon agency pass-through securities with a highly diversified portfolio by geography and issue type.
Sit Intermediate Total Return
The objective is to maximize total return and provide a high level of current income by investing in an array of domestic, investment grade fixed income securities. The strategy seeks to be defensive and
outperform the benchmark over an interest rate cycle with higher income and more diversification. The portfolio has an attractive yield and is broadly diversified across domestic investment-grade
securities. Higher yield and lower duration than the benchmark position the portfolio to outperform
in stable and higher interest rate environments.
Sit Taxable Return Plus
This fund aims to maximize total return and provide a high level of current income by investing primarily in investment-grade closed-end bond funds. The portfolio’s duration and credit quality are managed versus the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. This portfolio has an attractive yield (6.1%), and the Closed-end funds/securities are priced below Net Asset Value (NAV). Sit Return Plus has higher income and shorter duration than the benchmark. The portfolio is positioned to outperform in stable and higher interest rate environments

Opus Capital
Small Cap Value Plus
Leveraging our experience as Small Cap equity specialists, Opus Capital’s Small Cap Value Plus strategy provides total return and income for investors by focusing on the attractive universe of small cap dividend payers. Historically, these companies have outperformed the broad small cap universe and provided superior downside protection.
Recognizing that simply buying securities with the highest yield is inherently risky, Opus’ philosophy focuses on three key elements:
– Higher dividend yield and growth: We buy only companies with an above-average yield relative to the R2K, which provides meaningful income. We also favor companies that are well-positioned to grow their dividends
– Higher Quality: Simply buying the highest-yielding companies is risky. We buy high-quality companies with sustainable dividends, higher returns on equity and lower debt.
– Lower Valuation: Buying inexpensive companies improves downside protections. Stocks with lower valuations have historically outperformed.
Harbor Funds
Diversified International All Cap Product
The Fund invests primarily in common and preferred stocks of foreign companies, including those in emerging market countries. The portfolio manager focuses on identifying long-term investment opportunities that can arise as a result of certain capital cycle, or supply-side, conditions. Capital cycle investing is based on the concept that the prospect of high returns will attract excessive capital and competition, and vice versa. The portfolio manager uses fundamental, bottom-up qualitative analysis. Research meetings with company management represent the majority of analytical effort conducted. The Fund typically invests in between 250 to 350 companies across Europe, Japan, the Pacific Basin and emerging markets, and North America. While inherently diversified, a bias towards smaller and mid cap businesses in niche industries, coupled with a particularly long holding period, result in a portfolio that is significantly differentiated from the Fund’s benchmark index.
International Small Cap Product
The Fund invests primarily in equity securities, principally common and preferred stocks, of small cap foreign companies. The portfolio manager’s investment strategy focuses on identifying companies that have unrecognized earnings growth, such as where earnings growth prospects are better than market expectations or where current earnings growth is not fully reflected in the stock price. The Fund typically expects to maintain investments in a diversified portfolio of between approximately 80 and 110 stocks under normal market conditions, with no one individual holding normally representing more than 3% of the Fund’s total assets.
Small Cap Growth Opportunities Product
The Fund invests primarily in equity securities, principally common and preferred stocks, of small cap companies. We define small cap companies as those with market capitalizations that fall within the range of the Russell 2000®Growth Index (up to $2.5 billion). The investment strategy focuses on identifying rapidly growing small cap companies that are in an early or transitional stage of their development, before their full potential is discovered by the market. The Subadviser utilizes bottom-up, fundamental research involving both quantitative and qualitative aspects to identify companies for investment.
Armstrong Investment Managers LLP
AIM Multi-Asset Fund
The fundamental theme is that the interaction of model driven trades with discretionary insight is the key to long-term out-performance. Multi-Asset means that the fund invests across asset classes – equities, commodities, foreign exchange, interest rates etc., as determined by AIM’s models of the investment universe and the team’s deep expertise of market opportunities.  
The goal of the investment process is to generate non-correlated (to SPX Index), risk-adjusted returns combining two portfolio elements: 67% of the risk is a systematic, 33% is a discretionary. 
Systematic goal: to provide a very diversified set of additional uncorrelated alpha strategies.
Discretionary goal: to be positioned through applying a comprehensive assessment of market opportunities covering – Thematic, Qualitative, Short-term market shifts, Sanity checks of strategies vs market allocation.  Inputs are combined based on the level of conviction considering the marginal contribution to risk, as assessed within strict VaR parameters.
Downside risk is strictly controlled and has delivered strong returns for seven years with the result that AIM has won many awards along the way.
