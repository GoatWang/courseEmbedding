AUTHOR BIOS









About the Author
Francis Carey
Francis A. Carey is a native of Pennsylvania, educated in the public schools of Philadelphia, at Drexel University (B.S. in chemistry, 1959), and at Penn State (Ph.D. 1963). Following postdoctoral work at Harvard and military service, he was appointed to the chemistry faculty of the University of Virginia in 1966. Prior to retiring in 2000, he regularly taught the two-semester lecture courses in general chemistry and organic chemistry. With his students, Professor Carey has published over forty research papers in synthetic and mechanistic organic chemistry. In addition to this text, he is coauthor (with Robert C. Atkins) of Organic Chemistry: A Brief Course and (with Richard J. Sundberg) of Advanced Organic Chemistry, a two-volume treatment designed for graduate students and advanced undergraduates. He was a member of the Committee of Examiners of The Graduate Record Examination in Chemistry from 1993-2000. Frank and his wife Jill, who is a teacher/director of a preschool and a church organist, are the parents of Andy, Bob, and Bill and the grandparents of Riyad and Ava.

Organic Chemistry, 8e
Francis Carey; Robert Guiliano
Year: ©2012


                    This book is designed to meet the needs of the "mainstream," two-semeter undergraduate organic chemistry course. It's goal, as it has been through seven previous editions, is to provide students with the conceptual tools to understand and apply the relationship between the structures. of organic compounds and their properities.  Carey/Guiliano's text is organized according to functional groups and emphasizes mechanisms, which encourages students to see similarities in mechanisms among different functional groups.  … Show MoreShow Less

Key Features

LearnSmart
LearnSmart is an adaptive study tool proven to strengthen memory recall, increase class retention, and boost grades. Students are able to study more efficiently because they are made aware of what they know and don’t know. Real-time reports quickly identify the concepts that require more attention from individual students—or the entire class.


ChemDraw
McGraw-Hill has teamed up with PerkinElmer, the makers of ChemDraw, to bring the power and intuition of the ChemDraw software into the learning space. Our digital content libraries boast thousands of question templates that utilize a ChemDraw palette where students can input their responses by drawing molecular or ionic structures directly into their answers. The ChemDraw palette contains nearly all of the tools and functionality of the desktop version and is included, at no cost, to the Connect user.


Retrosynthesis Question Bank
Our retrosynthesis questions were developed to expose organic chemistry studentsto the type of thought processes used by professional organic chemists who use this technique to better craft experimental schemes. This question bank contains assignable content that will expose and test students on their ability to think through synthetic schemes in reverse, which will show them that there are often more ways than one to make any given desired product. These questions also help to underpin the logic that synthetic schemes can best be rationalized by structural simplification.
More FeaturesInteractive Conceptual ProblemsConceptual question banks contain assignable content that is authored with a heavy emphasis on utilization of pure concepts to solve problems. A notable hallmark of our conceptual question bank is that the content is more visually dynamic. Students directly interact with screen objects.
Lecture Capture with TegrityStudents are able to learn more effectively when engaged with the material. Tegrity offers new ways for students to focus on their coursework. This technology records and distributes class lectues with a click of a button. Access to these lectures is available anytime and anyplace by computer, or mobile device.
Chemistry End of Chapter ProblemsEnd-of-chapter problems from the textbook-in-use or any of the McGraw-Hill chemistry titles can be delivered in an auto-gradable format and tied to the textbooks learning objectives. Students will receive comprehensive, customized feedback that provides help when they need it most.
Integrated eBookWhen learning tools are interactive, content is more approachable and engagement is deeper. Connect Plus includes an Integrated eBook that builds student comprehension through animation, audio and video. As part of its rich media format, students can insert and review notes, highlight text, conduct searches for specific content and interact with high-impact images.

Case StudyWith the level of hints, feedback, and guided solutions, there is more than enough information for students to get the right answer, understand the material, and get help when they need it, often during the middle of the night when I am not around to help. Connect has a simplistic design, ease-of-use, a broad range of content, and valuable hints, feedback, and guided solutions. With the added benefit of LearnSmart, the adaptive assessment tool within Connect, the integration of Tegrity for lecture capture, and the advanced reporting system as opposed to a static gradebook, Connect and LearnSmart represent the true evolution of online homework!— Professor Jason Overby, College of Charleston

Key Features

LearnSmart
LearnSmart is an adaptive study tool proven to strengthen memory recall, increase class retention, and boost grades. Students are able to study more efficiently because they are made aware of what they know and don’t know. Real-time reports quickly identify the concepts that require more attention from individual students—or the entire class.


ChemDraw
McGraw-Hill has teamed up with PerkinElmer, the makers of ChemDraw, to bring the power and intuition of the ChemDraw software into the learning space. Our digital content libraries boast thousands of question templates that utilize a ChemDraw palette where students can input their responses by drawing molecular or ionic structures directly into their answers. The ChemDraw palette contains nearly all of the tools and functionality of the desktop version and is included, at no cost, to the Connect user.


Retrosynthesis Question Bank
Our retrosynthesis questions were developed to expose organic chemistry studentsto the type of thought processes used by professional organic chemists who use this technique to better craft experimental schemes. This question bank contains assignable content that will expose and test students on their ability to think through synthetic schemes in reverse, which will show them that there are often more ways than one to make any given desired product. These questions also help to underpin the logic that synthetic schemes can best be rationalized by structural simplification.
More FeaturesInteractive Conceptual ProblemsConceptual question banks contain assignable content that is authored with a heavy emphasis on utilization of pure concepts to solve problems. A notable hallmark of our conceptual question bank is that the content is more visually dynamic. Students directly interact with screen objects.
Lecture Capture with TegrityOvercome time constraints and busy student schedules 
With simple, one-click recording students can access your class lectures at anytime from anywhere an internet connection is accessible. A powerful keyword search function quickly pinpoints needed information. Easy access outside of class combined with a rich user experience translates into more learning opportunities and better prepared students.
Chemistry End of Chapter ProblemsEnd-of-chapter problems from the textbook-in-use or any of the McGraw-Hill chemistry titles can be delivered in an auto-gradable format and tied to the textbooks learning objectives. Students will receive comprehensive, customized feedback that provides help when they need it most.
Integrated eBookWhen learning tools are interactive, content is more approachable and engagement is deeper. Connect Plus includes an Integrated eBook that builds student comprehension through animation, audio and video. As part of its rich media format, students can insert and review notes, highlight text, conduct searches for specific content and interact with high-impact images.

Effectiveness StudyConnect Makes a DifferenceAnalysis of data aggregated from 34 Connect case studies featuring  diverse colleges and universities in the United States showed consistent improvement in four areas:
