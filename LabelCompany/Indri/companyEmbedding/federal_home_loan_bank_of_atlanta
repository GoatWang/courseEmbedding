“We are delighted to welcome the FHLBank Atlanta as a member of the MPF Program,” stated John Stocchetti, Executive Vice President & Group Head, Mortgage Partnership Finance Program at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, which provides the operational and administrative support for the MPF Program. “It speaks to the significant benefits of this program for members of the FHLBank System.” FHLBank Atlanta joins nine other FHLBanks that offer the MPF Program: Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Des Moines, New York, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Seattle, and Topeka.
