Building California's  Finest Retirement Communities









What is a continuing care retirement community?
Continuing care retirement communities are not just retirement communities — 
they offer a comprehensive retirement plan to each resident.  Think of them as master-planned neighborhoods for people 60 and over that provide beautiful homes, convenient services and access to long-term 
care, if needed — the combination that allows for comfort, freedom and peace of mind.













 
 
 

jQuery Slideshow



Beautiful Homes:
The communities offer a large collection of floor plans, ranging from comfortable one-bedroom designs to spacious single-story homes. All homes come complete with high ceilings, beautiful kitchens and baths, and modern appliances.






 
 
 

jQuery Slideshow



Convenient Services:
Along with their new homes, residents enjoy a package of services and amenities designed to make life easy (housekeeping, landscaping, home maintenance, etc.) and enjoyable (fine dining, theaters, health day spa, etc.).






 
 

jQuery Slideshow



Long-Term Care:
If they ever require a higher level of assistance or care, each resident at the communities receives unlimited access to long-term nursing care, assisted living and memory support, with essentially no cost increase.  Having this comprehensive plan in place means no worrying about future care burdens for themselves or their families.

* The Care Questionnaire results are not a physician's diagnosis, nor is it an assessment by a licensed professional. To validate your Care Questionnaire results, you will need to speak with a Sunrise senior living counselor to schedule a full assessment and determine if Sunrise can provide the care that you need. Certain states also require a physician assessment prior to moving into a community. Read our confidentiality promise.

† During the Sunrise assessment, you will meet with members of the Sunrise team to determine if you or your loved one’s needs may be met in one of our communities, and if so, what care level may be appropriate. The assessment is not a healthcare evaluation, and the results are the property of Sunrise.
