					Personal Loyalty Gift				




Welcome to your “Personal Loyalty Gift” from Mr. Raymond. C. Dabney
This is a very special time and I want to extend my personal “Thanks” to everyone who has supported me throughout the years. I have been blessed with “Very Loyal People” who have supported me for years on end.  I will recognize your names, and I look forward to reconnecting with many of you via phone.  I have lost contact with some of you and you know who you are, I will be reaching out to you as well. Each of you are included in this “Personal Thank You Gift”, whether you own CBIS Shares or not. Again Thank YOU All, for your confidence, your support, and your Loyalty throughout the years. For this Loyalty I will be “Giving you some of my personal shares” of Cannabis Science Inc. This is my personal confirmation of my Appreciation of you and your Loyalty. To the CBIS shareholders that I will “Gift some of my Shares”, I want and expect nothing in return, as a matter of fact, in the future everyone can look forward to “more Loyalty Gifts” as we progress forward with our High-Growth Business Models in our group of Companies.
Loyalty is a SPECIAL word, and I value it as such. Finding Loyal people for “your/any team” is a very difficult task and I value Greatly the ones I have. Unfortunately, sometimes people are not loyal and have their own deceitful strategies to unhinge you from your path of success. It is ironic how things do work out, when faced with such adversaries. Our Loyal people in our lives seem to rise up and shine in these moments “to fight the deceptions” they seem to fight with the Wrath of God to protect our Companies and all the Loyal individuals in our lives.
So with this in mind, I definitely want to be able to reward the “Loyal people in our Lives” the ones who stand beside you, who support you, protect you, and lift you up by any means they can, in anyway they can.

IRVINE, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 07/17/17 --
 Cannabis Science, Inc. (OTC PINK:CBIS), a U.S. company specializing in the development of cannabinoid-based medicines, has found a California facility ideal for its large-scale manufacturing and product distribution center as it ramps up its efforts to supply cannabinoid medications in high-demand by self-medicating patients. As Nevada's Governor issues a Statement of Emergency due to the potential of limited cannabis availability, CBIS is actively looking for a similar facility in Nevada. 
"We have found a perfect space for our initial, large-scale manufacturing and product distribution in California," stated Mr. Raymond C. Dabney, CBIS' President, CEO, and Co-founder. "We also have impeccable partners to assist in our rapidly moving, high-growth schedule. We now have access to the required machinery and expertise to begin the in-house manufacturing process." CBIS' experts will oversee operations to ensure that the Company's established protocols are flawlessly replicated. This type of manufacturing and distribution facility allows CBIS to distribute its products to patients faster, in much larger volumes, and in a very cost-effective manner. Being its own manufacturer and producer of the raw materials required for its manufacturing processes, CBIS will ensure that cost-effective standards are applied to the production of its current products, including pills, extracts, creams, tinctures, and sprays. CBIS' quality assurance program will also be applied to the development and distribution of new and exciting products that can be developed and released on demand for self-medicating patients.
A new opportunity has appeared and CBIS believes that this augers well for the future. Nevada's governor has endorsed a Statement of Emergency declared for marijuana regulations, after the state's tax authority declared that many stores are running out of marijuana and cannabinoid products. The Nevada Tax Commission said in a statement that it will consider emergency regulations to provide a structure for marijuana distribution to retailers. Based on reports of adult-use, marijuana sales have already far exceeded the industry's expectations at the state's 47 licensed retail marijuana dispensaries. Given that many stores are running out of inventory, the Department must address the lack of distributors immediately.
"We have considerable land holdings in Nevada through our partnerships and we see this as an outstanding opportunity for us to speed up our cultivation efforts in Nevada. This huge demand will help us achieve our goals of becoming a large-scale producer in Nevada. This supply concern should help accelerate our approvals for licensing and help us begin new product sales in Nevada in the very near future," concluded Mr. Dabney.
About Cannabis Science, Inc.Cannabis Science, Inc. takes advantage of its unique understanding of metabolic processes to provide novel treatment approaches to a number of illnesses for which current treatments and understanding remain unsatisfactory. Cannabinoids have an extensive history dating back thousands of years, and currently, there are a growing number of peer-reviewed scientific publications that document the underlying biochemical pathways that cannabinoids modulate. The Company works with leading experts in drug development, medicinal characterization, and clinical research to develop, produce, and commercialize novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment for illnesses caused by infections as well as for age-related illness. Our initial focus is on skin cancers, HIV/AIDS, and neurological conditions. The Company is proceeding with the research and development of its proprietary drugs as a part of this initial focus: CS-S/BCC-1, CS-TATI-1, and CS-NEURO-1, respectively.

A brand new prospect has appeared and Cannabis considers that this goes properly for the longer term. Nevada’s governor has sanctioned a Statement of Emergency introduced for marijuana tips, after the state’s tax authority introduced that many retailers are operating out of cannabinoid and marijuana merchandise.
The Nevada Tax Commission reported that it’s going to search for emergency laws to supply a construction for pot distribution to retailers. Depending on stories of adult-use, pot gross sales have already far surpassed the trade’s projections on the state’s 47 authorized retail marijuana dispensaries.

IRVINE, CA--(Marketwired - Jul 17, 2017) -  Cannabis Science, Inc. (OTC PINK: CBIS), a U.S. company specializing in the development of cannabinoid-based medicines, has found a California facility ideal for its large-scale manufacturing and product distribution center as it ramps up its efforts to supply cannabinoid medications in high-demand by self-medicating patients. As Nevada's Governor issues a Statement of Emergency due to the potential of limited cannabis availability, CBIS is actively looking for a similar facility in Nevada. 
"We have found a perfect space for our initial, large-scale manufacturing and product distribution in California," stated Mr. Raymond C. Dabney, CBIS' President, CEO, and Co-founder. "We also have impeccable partners to assist in our rapidly moving, high-growth schedule. We now have access to the required machinery and expertise to begin the in-house manufacturing process." CBIS' experts will oversee operations to ensure that the Company's established protocols are flawlessly replicated. This type of manufacturing and distribution facility allows CBIS to distribute its products to patients faster, in much larger volumes, and in a very cost-effective manner. Being its own manufacturer and producer of the raw materials required for its manufacturing processes, CBIS will ensure that cost-effective standards are applied to the production of its current products, including pills, extracts, creams, tinctures, and sprays. CBIS' quality assurance program will also be applied to the development and distribution of new and exciting products that can be developed and released on demand for self-medicating patients.
A new opportunity has appeared and CBIS believes that this augers well for the future. Nevada's governor has endorsed a Statement of Emergency declared for marijuana regulations, after the state's tax authority declared that many stores are running out of marijuana and cannabinoid products. The Nevada Tax Commission said in a statement that it will consider emergency regulations to provide a structure for marijuana distribution to retailers. Based on reports of adult-use, marijuana sales have already far exceeded the industry's expectations at the state's 47 licensed retail marijuana dispensaries. Given that many stores are running out of inventory, the Department must address the lack of distributors immediately.
"We have considerable land holdings in Nevada through our partnerships and we see this as an outstanding opportunity for us to speed up our cultivation efforts in Nevada. This huge demand will help us achieve our goals of becoming a large-scale producer in Nevada. This supply concern should help accelerate our approvals for licensing and help us begin new product sales in Nevada in the very near future," concluded Mr. Dabney.
About Cannabis Science, Inc. 
        Cannabis Science, Inc. takes advantage of its unique understanding of metabolic processes to provide novel treatment approaches to a number of illnesses for which current treatments and understanding remain unsatisfactory. Cannabinoids have an extensive history dating back thousands of years, and currently, there are a growing number of peer-reviewed scientific publications that document the underlying biochemical pathways that cannabinoids modulate. The Company works with leading experts in drug development, medicinal characterization, and clinical research to develop, produce, and commercialize novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment for illnesses caused by infections as well as for age-related illness. Our initial focus is on skin cancers, HIV/AIDS, and neurological conditions. The Company is proceeding with the research and development of its proprietary drugs as a part of this initial focus: CS-S/BCC-1, CS-TATI-1, and CS-NEURO-1, respectively.
