The Merger is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2017, subject to various conditions and terms, including regulatory approvals. The portfolio management team for the Fund is not expected to change as a result of the Merger. In addition, the agreements that the Fund has with Aberdeen PLC's subsidiary companies, the services provided by such companies, and the fees charged for those services are not expected to change as a result of the Merger.

The Fund's investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value (NAV) of the fund's portfolio. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. 
Total return figures with distributions reinvested at the dividend reinvestment price are stated net-of-fees and represents past performance. Past performance is not indicative of future results, current performance may be higher or lower. Holdings are subject to change and are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities shown.  Inception date October 29, 1992.

		                                    Aberdeen Israel Fund, Inc.(NYSE MKT: ISL)
The only U.S. closed-end fund dedicated
to investing in securities listed in Israel.





















								Investment Objective




The Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in equity securities of Israeli companies.
Investment Policies
The Fund has adopted a policy to invest under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its assets in investments, which are tied economically to Israel. 
The information contained above provides only a brief summary description of the Fund's investment objective and investment policies.
For more detailed information on the specific risks associated with this Fund, please view the Fund’s Important Risk Considerations.

Factsheet
Commentary

Risk Considerations
International investing entails special risk considerations, including currency ﬂuctuations, lower liquidity, economic and political risks, and differences in accounting methods; these risks are generally heightened for emerging market investments.
There are also risks associated with investing in Israel, including the risk of investing in a single-country fund. Concentrating investments in the Israel region subjects the Fund to more volatility and greater risk of loss than geographically diverse funds.
Equity stocks of small and mid-cap companies carry greater risk, and more volatility than equity stocks of larger, more established companies.

Field Report
Investment idea: Aberdeen Israel Fund, Inc. (ISL)



 
Israel is a nation that’s often misrepresented by the media. Despite its reputation for geopolitical instability, we believe its conflicts don’t diminish the investment potential in this region. However, as neither an emerging market nor a developed nation, it can offer investors the best of both worlds.
The Aberdeen Israel Fund, Inc. (ISL) takes the confusion out of Israel’s seemingly complex socio-economic issues by focusing on its inherent strengths and thriving industries.
Israel’s military is leading a technology battle.
Israel is a startup nation. The same military it relies on for national security is also driving growth in its technology sector. The Israeli government spends more than twice as much of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on Research and Development (R&D) compared to the nations of the European Union1, and that often trickles down to the private sector. For this reason, Israel is a hotbed for technology startups and talent. It’s no secret that Israel is the world’s leading provider of firewall technology, an essential part of every corporation’s IT infrastructure.
Another overlooked truth is that Israel is a developed nation with controlled growth, which investors may wrongly perceive as “slow.” But with an International Monetary Fund (IMF) projection of 3% GDP through 2019,2 Israel is on track to exceed the growth of the U.S. and far surpass most European countries. Because of the nation’s strong central bank and conservative spending, its public debt is low compared to its peers.3
In our view, the outlook for Israel over the medium-to-long term is positive. As a center of research and development excellence, foreign investment in Israel continues to be strong. And the country’s young population and wage growth are expected to help increase consumption for years to come. Outside of technology, the nation also continues to see growth in pharmaceuticals, telecoms, banking and retail. These industries comprise the bulk of equity holdings in the Aberdeen Israel Fund, Inc.

Important information
Indexes are unmanaged and have been provided for comparison purposes only. No fees or expenses are reflected. You cannot invest directly in an index.
Closed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges. The Fund’s investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value (NAV) of the fund’s portfolio. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Foreign securities are more volatile, harder to price and less liquid than U.S. securities. They are subject to different accounting and regulatory standards, and political and economic risks. These risks are enhanced in emerging market countries. Concentrating investments in the Israel region subjects the Fund to more volatility and greater risk of loss than geographically diverse funds.
Equity stocks of small and mid-cap companies carry greater risk, and more volatility than equity stocks of larger, more established companies.

Business Continuity Management & Disaster Recovery Programs
There can be no assurance that the Board will maintain the Fund's distribution rate at a particular level, or that the Board will continue a managed distribution policy. Additionally, distributions may include return of capital as well as net investment income and capital gains. If the Fund's investments do not generate sufficient income, the Fund may be required to liquidate a portion of its portfolio to fund these distributions. If the Fund's distributions consist of a large amount of return of capital, it may result in a deterioration of the Fund's assets.
