One Day PaySM †
With Aflac, qualified claims are paid in just a day.







Here's how it works.2
Medical expenses don’t always come from an accident or critical illness; sometimes it starts with a visit to an urgent care clinic because of a sharp pain in your side. While health insurance typically covers some of the expense, you will likely be responsible for a portion of the bill. Aflac Choice helps with those unexpected hospital expenses that may not be covered by health insurance. That way, you may not have to sacrifice your vacation budget for those unexpected medical costs.







Trouble strikes.






You suddenly experience a sharp pain in your side and go to an urgent care clinic, where you’re diagnosed with appendicitis.





You find yourself in the emergency room.






You’re taken by ambulance to the emergency room, where lab tests and diagnostic exams report back that you need surgery right away.





Aflac helps take the sting out.






After a 3-day stay in the hospital you’re feeling much better, but hospital bills add up quickly. Cash benefits are paid directly to you (unless otherwise assigned), which can help ease the financial stress of your illness.





You get your money fast.






Claims made on your Aflac Choice policy are eligible for One Day Pay℠.† Now that's fast.

Results were weighted to match U.S. demographics. No theoretical sampling error can be calculated; a full methodology is available.

General




Do you sell major medical insurance?




No.  Major medical insurance pays for doctors and hospitals. Aflac coverage is designed to provide you with cash benefits, unless otherwise assigned, to help with daily expenses when you’re sick or hurt—cash to be used as you wish to help you and your family with unexpected expenses.


Was this information helpful?
Yes
No






Do you sell auto and home (property and casualty) insurance?




No, we sell supplemental health insurance. If you get sick or hurt, Aflac provides a financial safety net to help with expenses. Differing from major medical insurance, Aflac coverage is designed to provide you with cash benefits, unless otherwise assigned, to use how you see fit.

Aflac Inc. /ˈæflæk/ (American Family Life Assurance Company) is an American insurance company and is the largest provider of supplemental insurance in the United States.[4] The company was founded in 1955 and is based in Columbus, Georgia. In the U.S., Aflac underwrites a wide range of insurance policies, but is perhaps more known for its payroll deduction insurance coverage, which pays cash benefits when a policyholder has a covered accident or illness. The company states it "provides financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide."[5]
In 2009, Aflac acquired Continental American Insurance Company for $100 million;[6] this enabled Aflac to sell supplemental insurance on both the individual and group platform.[7] As of June 30, 2012, Aflac was represented by approximately 19,300 sales agencies in Japan, and 76,900 licensed sales associates in the U.S.[8]

History[edit]
The company was founded by brothers John, Paul (died 2014), and William Amos in Columbus, Georgia, in 1955, as American Family Life Insurance Company of Columbus. In 1964, the company name was changed to American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. The company, in 1990, adopted the Aflac initials, although the official name of the underwriting subsidiary remains American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. Aflac announced the appointment of Frederick J. Crawford as Chief Financial Officer, as well as Executive Vice President in June 2015.[9]
The company signed 6,426 policyholders in its first year.[10] Aflac pioneered cancer insurance in 1958. Beginning in 1964, the company decided to focus sales on worksite settings, eventually through policies sponsored by employers and funded through payroll deductions. By 2003, more than 98% of Aflac policies in the United States were issued on a payroll deduction basis, making the company a leader in that approach to policy distribution.
Business[edit]
Aflac operates in the United States and Japan, and has its worldwide headquarters and corporate offices in an eighteen story tower just east of Downtown Columbus, Georgia in an area known as MidTown. The Aflac tower is the tallest building in the city. As of June 30, 2015, the corporation's total assets were more than $103 billion, and the company insured more than 50 million people worldwide.[11]
Aflac is the largest provider of guaranteed-renewable insurance in the United States and the largest insurance company overall in Japan, when measured by individual insurance policies in force.[12]
The company now offers several types of insurance policies in the United States, including the following:

Accident
Cancer/Specified Disease
Dental
Hospital Confinement Indemnity
Hospital Confinement Sickness Indemnity
Hospital Intensive Care
Life
Lump Sum Cancer
Lump Sum Cancer Critical Illness
Specified Health Event
Short Term Disability
Vision

Aflac also offers un-reimbursed medical, dependent day-care, and transportation flexible spending accounts. The company also offers human resources services for HIPAA and COBRA. From 1979 to 1997, the company owned several television stations, most of them in small and medium markets. It sold the broadcasting division (including flagship station WTVM) to what became Raycom Media in 1997.[13]
Critics of cancer policies[edit]
Consumer groups and some government officials say that cancer insurance returns fewer premium dollars to policyholders than standard insurance. A United States General Accounting Office study found that the policies paid back as little as 35% of premiums (Aflac said its cancer insurance paid back 62.4%). In comparison, New York State requires most major-medical policies to pay back 82% and group policies to pay back 75%. New York State does not allow stand-alone cancer policies. In 1997, AFLAC spent $175,000 on lobbyists and campaign contributions to change the law.[14] New York State lifted its ban in 1998, for purchasers who already have basic coverage. Consumer Reports recommended that policyholders use the money instead to buy lower-deductible insurance.[15] Insurance claims by line appear on the Annual Statement filed with each state. Loss claims are a percent of total premium before commissions.
The Aflac Duck[edit]
Since December 1999, the company's identity and brand has become more widely recognized in the United States as the result of TV commercials featuring the Aflac Duck, who frustratedly quacks the company's name to unsuspecting prospective policy holders. The duck concept and all of the commercials to date have been created by Kaplan Thaler Group, an advertising agency based in New York City. Metzer Farms, a Gonzales, California goose, duck, and gamebird hatchery, supplied them with the initial ducklings that each grew into the famous duck. Struggling to come up with a concept to make the big but relatively obscure insurance company's name memorable, one of the agency's art directors stumbled upon the duck idea while walking around Central Park at lunchtime uttering, "Aflac, Aflac." He soon realized how much the company's name sounded like a duck's quack. The Aflac Duck character has now starred in more than 30 commercials. In many of these commercials, character actor Earl Billings also appears. The Aflac Duck is enshrined on Madison Avenue's Walk of Fame as one of America's Favorite Advertising Icons.[16]
In April 2009, Aflac introduced a new marketing campaign called "Get the Aflacts", designed to educate consumers about the specific benefits of the insurance products the company sells. The Aflacts campaign gave the Aflac Duck "a more prominent role", designed to "help potential customers learn the Aflacts, er, facts about policies and other products", according to The New York Times.[17]
Celebrities have starred in the Aflac ads, including Chevy Chase (2003); Yogi Berra; Yao Ming; Donald Trump's wife, Melania Trump; NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Carl Edwards (2008–2014); the United States Olympic synchronized swimming team (2004); and Wayne Newton playing at Stardust Hotel and Casino for the 2003 commercial. The duck also appeared with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.[18] In 2005, the company logo was changed to incorporate the duck. The first commercial using the new logo featured Gilbert Gottfried at a pet store because the duck kept saying, "Aflac!" and he had to trade in the duck for a parrot, saying, "If you're hurt and can't work".[19]
The duck was voiced by comedian Gilbert Gottfried, who also voices Digit on the PBS Kids series Cyberchase, and Iago in the Disney film Aladdin.[20] After 11 years as the voice of the Aflac duck, Gottfried was dismissed on March 14, 2011 due to jokes on Gottfried's Twitter account referencing the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The company's chief marketing officer stated that "Gilbert's recent comments about the crisis in Japan were lacking in humor, and certainly do not represent the thoughts and feelings of anyone at Aflac."[21]
On March 23, 2011, Aflac announced that the company was taking applications for the new voice of the Aflac Duck through QuackAflac.com until April 1. Commercials requesting the submissions, first aired in 2006 but updated, resemble a silent movie.[22][23] On April 26, 2011, it was announced that Daniel McKeague, a television advertising sales manager from Hugo, Minnesota, would be the new voice of the Aflac duck.[24] The first Aflac commercial featuring the duck's new voice aired on May 1, 2011.
Corporate philanthropy and social responsibility[edit]
The company states that through a partnership with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Aflac has contributed more than $100 million to childhood cancer research and treatment.[25]
Aflac employees are formally involved in an array of charitable organizations such as Habitat for Humanity International, the Easter Seals, and the United Way.[26]
Aflac's stated objectives include the decrease of its environmental impact, for which the company is into a partnership with the Clean Air Campaign to encourage employees to engage with greater frequency in alternate commuting methods.[27]
Aflac and Macy's Partnership[edit]
Aflac and Macy’s have partnered since 2001 to sell the annual Aflac holiday plush duck in select Macy’s stores nationwide.[28] Net proceeds from each duck sold are donated to the participating children’s cancer facility nearest to where it is purchased. Since 2001, more than $3 million has been raised from the sale of the ducks.[29]
Aflac has participated in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade for the past six years. A new balloonicle was unveiled in 2014, featuring the Aflac Duck wearing ice skates.[30]
Award programs[edit]

The Jackie Robinson Award is given to the high-school player who is entering his senior year and who best displays character, leadership, and the values of being a student athlete in academics and community affairs.[31] The award is presented at an annual All-American Awards banquet, which was first held in 2003.[33] The banquet follows the annual All-American Baseball Classic, an East-West all-star game featuring the 38 best players from around the nation who are entering their senior year of high school.[31][33] First held in 2003, the game is played at Petco Park, San Diego, California.[31][34] Proceeds from the game and banquet are donated to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and its fight against childhood cancer.[34]
In 2011, the name of the all-star game was changed to the Perfect Game All-American Classic.[34]

History[edit]
The company was founded by brothers John, Paul (died 2014), and William Amos in Columbus, Georgia, in 1955, as American Family Life Insurance Company of Columbus. In 1964, the company name was changed to American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. The company, in 1990, adopted the Aflac initials, although the official name of the underwriting subsidiary remains American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. Aflac announced the appointment of Frederick J. Crawford as Chief Financial Officer, as well as Executive Vice President in June 2015.[9]
The company signed 6,426 policyholders in its first year.[10] Aflac pioneered cancer insurance in 1958. Beginning in 1964, the company decided to focus sales on worksite settings, eventually through policies sponsored by employers and funded through payroll deductions. By 2003, more than 98% of Aflac policies in the United States were issued on a payroll deduction basis, making the company a leader in that approach to policy distribution.
Business[edit]
Aflac operates in the United States and Japan, and has its worldwide headquarters and corporate offices in an eighteen story tower just east of Downtown Columbus, Georgia in an area known as MidTown. The Aflac tower is the tallest building in the city. As of June 30, 2015, the corporation's total assets were more than $103 billion, and the company insured more than 50 million people worldwide.[11]
Aflac is the largest provider of guaranteed-renewable insurance in the United States and the largest insurance company overall in Japan, when measured by individual insurance policies in force.[12]
The company now offers several types of insurance policies in the United States, including the following:

Accident
Cancer/Specified Disease
Dental
Hospital Confinement Indemnity
Hospital Confinement Sickness Indemnity
Hospital Intensive Care
Life
Lump Sum Cancer
Lump Sum Cancer Critical Illness
Specified Health Event
Short Term Disability
Vision

Aflac also offers un-reimbursed medical, dependent day-care, and transportation flexible spending accounts. The company also offers human resources services for HIPAA and COBRA. From 1979 to 1997, the company owned several television stations, most of them in small and medium markets. It sold the broadcasting division (including flagship station WTVM) to what became Raycom Media in 1997.[13]
Critics of cancer policies[edit]
Consumer groups and some government officials say that cancer insurance returns fewer premium dollars to policyholders than standard insurance. A United States General Accounting Office study found that the policies paid back as little as 35% of premiums (Aflac said its cancer insurance paid back 62.4%). In comparison, New York State requires most major-medical policies to pay back 82% and group policies to pay back 75%. New York State does not allow stand-alone cancer policies. In 1997, AFLAC spent $175,000 on lobbyists and campaign contributions to change the law.[14] New York State lifted its ban in 1998, for purchasers who already have basic coverage. Consumer Reports recommended that policyholders use the money instead to buy lower-deductible insurance.[15] Insurance claims by line appear on the Annual Statement filed with each state. Loss claims are a percent of total premium before commissions.
The Aflac Duck[edit]
Since December 1999, the company's identity and brand has become more widely recognized in the United States as the result of TV commercials featuring the Aflac Duck, who frustratedly quacks the company's name to unsuspecting prospective policy holders. The duck concept and all of the commercials to date have been created by Kaplan Thaler Group, an advertising agency based in New York City. Metzer Farms, a Gonzales, California goose, duck, and gamebird hatchery, supplied them with the initial ducklings that each grew into the famous duck. Struggling to come up with a concept to make the big but relatively obscure insurance company's name memorable, one of the agency's art directors stumbled upon the duck idea while walking around Central Park at lunchtime uttering, "Aflac, Aflac." He soon realized how much the company's name sounded like a duck's quack. The Aflac Duck character has now starred in more than 30 commercials. In many of these commercials, character actor Earl Billings also appears. The Aflac Duck is enshrined on Madison Avenue's Walk of Fame as one of America's Favorite Advertising Icons.[16]
In April 2009, Aflac introduced a new marketing campaign called "Get the Aflacts", designed to educate consumers about the specific benefits of the insurance products the company sells. The Aflacts campaign gave the Aflac Duck "a more prominent role", designed to "help potential customers learn the Aflacts, er, facts about policies and other products", according to The New York Times.[17]
Celebrities have starred in the Aflac ads, including Chevy Chase (2003); Yogi Berra; Yao Ming; Donald Trump's wife, Melania Trump; NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Carl Edwards (2008–2014); the United States Olympic synchronized swimming team (2004); and Wayne Newton playing at Stardust Hotel and Casino for the 2003 commercial. The duck also appeared with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.[18] In 2005, the company logo was changed to incorporate the duck. The first commercial using the new logo featured Gilbert Gottfried at a pet store because the duck kept saying, "Aflac!" and he had to trade in the duck for a parrot, saying, "If you're hurt and can't work".[19]
The duck was voiced by comedian Gilbert Gottfried, who also voices Digit on the PBS Kids series Cyberchase, and Iago in the Disney film Aladdin.[20] After 11 years as the voice of the Aflac duck, Gottfried was dismissed on March 14, 2011 due to jokes on Gottfried's Twitter account referencing the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The company's chief marketing officer stated that "Gilbert's recent comments about the crisis in Japan were lacking in humor, and certainly do not represent the thoughts and feelings of anyone at Aflac."[21]
On March 23, 2011, Aflac announced that the company was taking applications for the new voice of the Aflac Duck through QuackAflac.com until April 1. Commercials requesting the submissions, first aired in 2006 but updated, resemble a silent movie.[22][23] On April 26, 2011, it was announced that Daniel McKeague, a television advertising sales manager from Hugo, Minnesota, would be the new voice of the Aflac duck.[24] The first Aflac commercial featuring the duck's new voice aired on May 1, 2011.
Corporate philanthropy and social responsibility[edit]
The company states that through a partnership with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Aflac has contributed more than $100 million to childhood cancer research and treatment.[25]
Aflac employees are formally involved in an array of charitable organizations such as Habitat for Humanity International, the Easter Seals, and the United Way.[26]
Aflac's stated objectives include the decrease of its environmental impact, for which the company is into a partnership with the Clean Air Campaign to encourage employees to engage with greater frequency in alternate commuting methods.[27]
Aflac and Macy's Partnership[edit]
Aflac and Macy’s have partnered since 2001 to sell the annual Aflac holiday plush duck in select Macy’s stores nationwide.[28] Net proceeds from each duck sold are donated to the participating children’s cancer facility nearest to where it is purchased. Since 2001, more than $3 million has been raised from the sale of the ducks.[29]
Aflac has participated in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade for the past six years. A new balloonicle was unveiled in 2014, featuring the Aflac Duck wearing ice skates.[30]

Aflac Inc. /ˈæflæk/ (American Family Life Assurance Company) is an American insurance company and is the largest provider of supplemental insurance in the United States.[4] The company was founded in 1955 and is based in Columbus, Georgia. In the U.S., Aflac underwrites a wide range of insurance policies, but is perhaps more known for its payroll deduction insurance coverage, which pays cash benefits when a policyholder has a covered accident or illness. The company states it "provides financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide."[5]
In 2009, Aflac acquired Continental American Insurance Company for $100 million;[6] this enabled Aflac to sell supplemental insurance on both the individual and group platform.[7] As of June 30, 2012, Aflac was represented by approximately 19,300 sales agencies in Japan, and 76,900 licensed sales associates in the U.S.[8]

History[edit]
The company was founded by brothers John, Paul (died 2014), and William Amos in Columbus, Georgia, in 1955, as American Family Life Insurance Company of Columbus. In 1964, the company name was changed to American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. The company, in 1990, adopted the Aflac initials, although the official name of the underwriting subsidiary remains American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. Aflac announced the appointment of Frederick J. Crawford as Chief Financial Officer, as well as Executive Vice President in June 2015.[9]
The company signed 6,426 policyholders in its first year.[10] Aflac pioneered cancer insurance in 1958. Beginning in 1964, the company decided to focus sales on worksite settings, eventually through policies sponsored by employers and funded through payroll deductions. By 2003, more than 98% of Aflac policies in the United States were issued on a payroll deduction basis, making the company a leader in that approach to policy distribution.
Business[edit]
Aflac operates in the United States and Japan, and has its worldwide headquarters and corporate offices in an eighteen story tower just east of Downtown Columbus, Georgia in an area known as MidTown. The Aflac tower is the tallest building in the city. As of June 30, 2015, the corporation's total assets were more than $103 billion, and the company insured more than 50 million people worldwide.[11]
Aflac is the largest provider of guaranteed-renewable insurance in the United States and the largest insurance company overall in Japan, when measured by individual insurance policies in force.[12]
The company now offers several types of insurance policies in the United States, including the following:

Accident
Cancer/Specified Disease
Dental
Hospital Confinement Indemnity
Hospital Confinement Sickness Indemnity
Hospital Intensive Care
Life
Lump Sum Cancer
Lump Sum Cancer Critical Illness
Specified Health Event
Short Term Disability
Vision

Aflac also offers un-reimbursed medical, dependent day-care, and transportation flexible spending accounts. The company also offers human resources services for HIPAA and COBRA. From 1979 to 1997, the company owned several television stations, most of them in small and medium markets. It sold the broadcasting division (including flagship station WTVM) to what became Raycom Media in 1997.[13]
Critics of cancer policies[edit]
Consumer groups and some government officials say that cancer insurance returns fewer premium dollars to policyholders than standard insurance. A United States General Accounting Office study found that the policies paid back as little as 35% of premiums (Aflac said its cancer insurance paid back 62.4%). In comparison, New York State requires most major-medical policies to pay back 82% and group policies to pay back 75%. New York State does not allow stand-alone cancer policies. In 1997, AFLAC spent $175,000 on lobbyists and campaign contributions to change the law.[14] New York State lifted its ban in 1998, for purchasers who already have basic coverage. Consumer Reports recommended that policyholders use the money instead to buy lower-deductible insurance.[15] Insurance claims by line appear on the Annual Statement filed with each state. Loss claims are a percent of total premium before commissions.
The Aflac Duck[edit]
Since December 1999, the company's identity and brand has become more widely recognized in the United States as the result of TV commercials featuring the Aflac Duck, who frustratedly quacks the company's name to unsuspecting prospective policy holders. The duck concept and all of the commercials to date have been created by Kaplan Thaler Group, an advertising agency based in New York City. Metzer Farms, a Gonzales, California goose, duck, and gamebird hatchery, supplied them with the initial ducklings that each grew into the famous duck. Struggling to come up with a concept to make the big but relatively obscure insurance company's name memorable, one of the agency's art directors stumbled upon the duck idea while walking around Central Park at lunchtime uttering, "Aflac, Aflac." He soon realized how much the company's name sounded like a duck's quack. The Aflac Duck character has now starred in more than 30 commercials. In many of these commercials, character actor Earl Billings also appears. The Aflac Duck is enshrined on Madison Avenue's Walk of Fame as one of America's Favorite Advertising Icons.[16]
In April 2009, Aflac introduced a new marketing campaign called "Get the Aflacts", designed to educate consumers about the specific benefits of the insurance products the company sells. The Aflacts campaign gave the Aflac Duck "a more prominent role", designed to "help potential customers learn the Aflacts, er, facts about policies and other products", according to The New York Times.[17]
Celebrities have starred in the Aflac ads, including Chevy Chase (2003); Yogi Berra; Yao Ming; Donald Trump's wife, Melania Trump; NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Carl Edwards (2008–2014); the United States Olympic synchronized swimming team (2004); and Wayne Newton playing at Stardust Hotel and Casino for the 2003 commercial. The duck also appeared with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.[18] In 2005, the company logo was changed to incorporate the duck. The first commercial using the new logo featured Gilbert Gottfried at a pet store because the duck kept saying, "Aflac!" and he had to trade in the duck for a parrot, saying, "If you're hurt and can't work".[19]
The duck was voiced by comedian Gilbert Gottfried, who also voices Digit on the PBS Kids series Cyberchase, and Iago in the Disney film Aladdin.[20] After 11 years as the voice of the Aflac duck, Gottfried was dismissed on March 14, 2011 due to jokes on Gottfried's Twitter account referencing the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The company's chief marketing officer stated that "Gilbert's recent comments about the crisis in Japan were lacking in humor, and certainly do not represent the thoughts and feelings of anyone at Aflac."[21]
On March 23, 2011, Aflac announced that the company was taking applications for the new voice of the Aflac Duck through QuackAflac.com until April 1. Commercials requesting the submissions, first aired in 2006 but updated, resemble a silent movie.[22][23] On April 26, 2011, it was announced that Daniel McKeague, a television advertising sales manager from Hugo, Minnesota, would be the new voice of the Aflac duck.[24] The first Aflac commercial featuring the duck's new voice aired on May 1, 2011.
Corporate philanthropy and social responsibility[edit]
The company states that through a partnership with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Aflac has contributed more than $100 million to childhood cancer research and treatment.[25]
Aflac employees are formally involved in an array of charitable organizations such as Habitat for Humanity International, the Easter Seals, and the United Way.[26]
Aflac's stated objectives include the decrease of its environmental impact, for which the company is into a partnership with the Clean Air Campaign to encourage employees to engage with greater frequency in alternate commuting methods.[27]
Aflac and Macy's Partnership[edit]
Aflac and Macy’s have partnered since 2001 to sell the annual Aflac holiday plush duck in select Macy’s stores nationwide.[28] Net proceeds from each duck sold are donated to the participating children’s cancer facility nearest to where it is purchased. Since 2001, more than $3 million has been raised from the sale of the ducks.[29]
Aflac has participated in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade for the past six years. A new balloonicle was unveiled in 2014, featuring the Aflac Duck wearing ice skates.[30]
Award programs[edit]

History[edit]
The company was founded by brothers John, Paul (died 2014), and William Amos in Columbus, Georgia, in 1955, as American Family Life Insurance Company of Columbus. In 1964, the company name was changed to American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. The company, in 1990, adopted the Aflac initials, although the official name of the underwriting subsidiary remains American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. Aflac announced the appointment of Frederick J. Crawford as Chief Financial Officer, as well as Executive Vice President in June 2015.[9]
The company signed 6,426 policyholders in its first year.[10] Aflac pioneered cancer insurance in 1958. Beginning in 1964, the company decided to focus sales on worksite settings, eventually through policies sponsored by employers and funded through payroll deductions. By 2003, more than 98% of Aflac policies in the United States were issued on a payroll deduction basis, making the company a leader in that approach to policy distribution.
Business[edit]
Aflac operates in the United States and Japan, and has its worldwide headquarters and corporate offices in an eighteen story tower just east of Downtown Columbus, Georgia in an area known as MidTown. The Aflac tower is the tallest building in the city. As of June 30, 2015, the corporation's total assets were more than $103 billion, and the company insured more than 50 million people worldwide.[11]
Aflac is the largest provider of guaranteed-renewable insurance in the United States and the largest insurance company overall in Japan, when measured by individual insurance policies in force.[12]
The company now offers several types of insurance policies in the United States, including the following:

Accident
Cancer/Specified Disease
Dental
Hospital Confinement Indemnity
Hospital Confinement Sickness Indemnity
Hospital Intensive Care
Life
Lump Sum Cancer
Lump Sum Cancer Critical Illness
Specified Health Event
Short Term Disability
Vision

Aflac also offers un-reimbursed medical, dependent day-care, and transportation flexible spending accounts. The company also offers human resources services for HIPAA and COBRA. From 1979 to 1997, the company owned several television stations, most of them in small and medium markets. It sold the broadcasting division (including flagship station WTVM) to what became Raycom Media in 1997.[13]
Critics of cancer policies[edit]
Consumer groups and some government officials say that cancer insurance returns fewer premium dollars to policyholders than standard insurance. A United States General Accounting Office study found that the policies paid back as little as 35% of premiums (Aflac said its cancer insurance paid back 62.4%). In comparison, New York State requires most major-medical policies to pay back 82% and group policies to pay back 75%. New York State does not allow stand-alone cancer policies. In 1997, AFLAC spent $175,000 on lobbyists and campaign contributions to change the law.[14] New York State lifted its ban in 1998, for purchasers who already have basic coverage. Consumer Reports recommended that policyholders use the money instead to buy lower-deductible insurance.[15] Insurance claims by line appear on the Annual Statement filed with each state. Loss claims are a percent of total premium before commissions.
The Aflac Duck[edit]
Since December 1999, the company's identity and brand has become more widely recognized in the United States as the result of TV commercials featuring the Aflac Duck, who frustratedly quacks the company's name to unsuspecting prospective policy holders. The duck concept and all of the commercials to date have been created by Kaplan Thaler Group, an advertising agency based in New York City. Metzer Farms, a Gonzales, California goose, duck, and gamebird hatchery, supplied them with the initial ducklings that each grew into the famous duck. Struggling to come up with a concept to make the big but relatively obscure insurance company's name memorable, one of the agency's art directors stumbled upon the duck idea while walking around Central Park at lunchtime uttering, "Aflac, Aflac." He soon realized how much the company's name sounded like a duck's quack. The Aflac Duck character has now starred in more than 30 commercials. In many of these commercials, character actor Earl Billings also appears. The Aflac Duck is enshrined on Madison Avenue's Walk of Fame as one of America's Favorite Advertising Icons.[16]
In April 2009, Aflac introduced a new marketing campaign called "Get the Aflacts", designed to educate consumers about the specific benefits of the insurance products the company sells. The Aflacts campaign gave the Aflac Duck "a more prominent role", designed to "help potential customers learn the Aflacts, er, facts about policies and other products", according to The New York Times.[17]
Celebrities have starred in the Aflac ads, including Chevy Chase (2003); Yogi Berra; Yao Ming; Donald Trump's wife, Melania Trump; NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Carl Edwards (2008–2014); the United States Olympic synchronized swimming team (2004); and Wayne Newton playing at Stardust Hotel and Casino for the 2003 commercial. The duck also appeared with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.[18] In 2005, the company logo was changed to incorporate the duck. The first commercial using the new logo featured Gilbert Gottfried at a pet store because the duck kept saying, "Aflac!" and he had to trade in the duck for a parrot, saying, "If you're hurt and can't work".[19]
The duck was voiced by comedian Gilbert Gottfried, who also voices Digit on the PBS Kids series Cyberchase, and Iago in the Disney film Aladdin.[20] After 11 years as the voice of the Aflac duck, Gottfried was dismissed on March 14, 2011 due to jokes on Gottfried's Twitter account referencing the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The company's chief marketing officer stated that "Gilbert's recent comments about the crisis in Japan were lacking in humor, and certainly do not represent the thoughts and feelings of anyone at Aflac."[21]
On March 23, 2011, Aflac announced that the company was taking applications for the new voice of the Aflac Duck through QuackAflac.com until April 1. Commercials requesting the submissions, first aired in 2006 but updated, resemble a silent movie.[22][23] On April 26, 2011, it was announced that Daniel McKeague, a television advertising sales manager from Hugo, Minnesota, would be the new voice of the Aflac duck.[24] The first Aflac commercial featuring the duck's new voice aired on May 1, 2011.
Corporate philanthropy and social responsibility[edit]
The company states that through a partnership with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Aflac has contributed more than $100 million to childhood cancer research and treatment.[25]
Aflac employees are formally involved in an array of charitable organizations such as Habitat for Humanity International, the Easter Seals, and the United Way.[26]
Aflac's stated objectives include the decrease of its environmental impact, for which the company is into a partnership with the Clean Air Campaign to encourage employees to engage with greater frequency in alternate commuting methods.[27]
Aflac and Macy's Partnership[edit]
Aflac and Macy’s have partnered since 2001 to sell the annual Aflac holiday plush duck in select Macy’s stores nationwide.[28] Net proceeds from each duck sold are donated to the participating children’s cancer facility nearest to where it is purchased. Since 2001, more than $3 million has been raised from the sale of the ducks.[29]
Aflac has participated in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade for the past six years. A new balloonicle was unveiled in 2014, featuring the Aflac Duck wearing ice skates.[30]

Aflac Inc. /ˈæflæk/ (American Family Life Assurance Company) is an American insurance company and is the largest provider of supplemental insurance in the United States.[4] The company was founded in 1955 and is based in Columbus, Georgia. In the U.S., Aflac underwrites a wide range of insurance policies, but is perhaps more known for its payroll deduction insurance coverage, which pays cash benefits when a policyholder has a covered accident or illness. The company states it "provides financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide."[5]
In 2009, Aflac acquired Continental American Insurance Company for $100 million;[6] this enabled Aflac to sell supplemental insurance on both the individual and group platform.[7] As of June 30, 2012, Aflac was represented by approximately 19,300 sales agencies in Japan, and 76,900 licensed sales associates in the U.S.[8]

History[edit]
The company was founded by brothers John, Paul (died 2014), and William Amos in Columbus, Georgia, in 1955, as American Family Life Insurance Company of Columbus. In 1964, the company name was changed to American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. The company, in 1990, adopted the Aflac initials, although the official name of the underwriting subsidiary remains American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. Aflac announced the appointment of Frederick J. Crawford as Chief Financial Officer, as well as Executive Vice President in June 2015.[9]
The company signed 6,426 policyholders in its first year.[10] Aflac pioneered cancer insurance in 1958. Beginning in 1964, the company decided to focus sales on worksite settings, eventually through policies sponsored by employers and funded through payroll deductions. By 2003, more than 98% of Aflac policies in the United States were issued on a payroll deduction basis, making the company a leader in that approach to policy distribution.
Business[edit]
Aflac operates in the United States and Japan, and has its worldwide headquarters and corporate offices in an eighteen story tower just east of Downtown Columbus, Georgia in an area known as MidTown. The Aflac tower is the tallest building in the city. As of June 30, 2015, the corporation's total assets were more than $103 billion, and the company insured more than 50 million people worldwide.[11]
Aflac is the largest provider of guaranteed-renewable insurance in the United States and the largest insurance company overall in Japan, when measured by individual insurance policies in force.[12]
The company now offers several types of insurance policies in the United States, including the following:

Accident
Cancer/Specified Disease
Dental
Hospital Confinement Indemnity
Hospital Confinement Sickness Indemnity
Hospital Intensive Care
Life
Lump Sum Cancer
Lump Sum Cancer Critical Illness
Specified Health Event
Short Term Disability
Vision

Aflac also offers un-reimbursed medical, dependent day-care, and transportation flexible spending accounts. The company also offers human resources services for HIPAA and COBRA. From 1979 to 1997, the company owned several television stations, most of them in small and medium markets. It sold the broadcasting division (including flagship station WTVM) to what became Raycom Media in 1997.[13]
Critics of cancer policies[edit]
Consumer groups and some government officials say that cancer insurance returns fewer premium dollars to policyholders than standard insurance. A United States General Accounting Office study found that the policies paid back as little as 35% of premiums (Aflac said its cancer insurance paid back 62.4%). In comparison, New York State requires most major-medical policies to pay back 82% and group policies to pay back 75%. New York State does not allow stand-alone cancer policies. In 1997, AFLAC spent $175,000 on lobbyists and campaign contributions to change the law.[14] New York State lifted its ban in 1998, for purchasers who already have basic coverage. Consumer Reports recommended that policyholders use the money instead to buy lower-deductible insurance.[15] Insurance claims by line appear on the Annual Statement filed with each state. Loss claims are a percent of total premium before commissions.
The Aflac Duck[edit]
Since December 1999, the company's identity and brand has become more widely recognized in the United States as the result of TV commercials featuring the Aflac Duck, who frustratedly quacks the company's name to unsuspecting prospective policy holders. The duck concept and all of the commercials to date have been created by Kaplan Thaler Group, an advertising agency based in New York City. Metzer Farms, a Gonzales, California goose, duck, and gamebird hatchery, supplied them with the initial ducklings that each grew into the famous duck. Struggling to come up with a concept to make the big but relatively obscure insurance company's name memorable, one of the agency's art directors stumbled upon the duck idea while walking around Central Park at lunchtime uttering, "Aflac, Aflac." He soon realized how much the company's name sounded like a duck's quack. The Aflac Duck character has now starred in more than 30 commercials. In many of these commercials, character actor Earl Billings also appears. The Aflac Duck is enshrined on Madison Avenue's Walk of Fame as one of America's Favorite Advertising Icons.[16]
In April 2009, Aflac introduced a new marketing campaign called "Get the Aflacts", designed to educate consumers about the specific benefits of the insurance products the company sells. The Aflacts campaign gave the Aflac Duck "a more prominent role", designed to "help potential customers learn the Aflacts, er, facts about policies and other products", according to The New York Times.[17]
Celebrities have starred in the Aflac ads, including Chevy Chase (2003); Yogi Berra; Yao Ming; Donald Trump's wife, Melania Trump; NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Carl Edwards (2008–2014); the United States Olympic synchronized swimming team (2004); and Wayne Newton playing at Stardust Hotel and Casino for the 2003 commercial. The duck also appeared with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.[18] In 2005, the company logo was changed to incorporate the duck. The first commercial using the new logo featured Gilbert Gottfried at a pet store because the duck kept saying, "Aflac!" and he had to trade in the duck for a parrot, saying, "If you're hurt and can't work".[19]
The duck was voiced by comedian Gilbert Gottfried, who also voices Digit on the PBS Kids series Cyberchase, and Iago in the Disney film Aladdin.[20] After 11 years as the voice of the Aflac duck, Gottfried was dismissed on March 14, 2011 due to jokes on Gottfried's Twitter account referencing the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The company's chief marketing officer stated that "Gilbert's recent comments about the crisis in Japan were lacking in humor, and certainly do not represent the thoughts and feelings of anyone at Aflac."[21]
On March 23, 2011, Aflac announced that the company was taking applications for the new voice of the Aflac Duck through QuackAflac.com until April 1. Commercials requesting the submissions, first aired in 2006 but updated, resemble a silent movie.[22][23] On April 26, 2011, it was announced that Daniel McKeague, a television advertising sales manager from Hugo, Minnesota, would be the new voice of the Aflac duck.[24] The first Aflac commercial featuring the duck's new voice aired on May 1, 2011.
Corporate philanthropy and social responsibility[edit]
The company states that through a partnership with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Aflac has contributed more than $100 million to childhood cancer research and treatment.[25]
Aflac employees are formally involved in an array of charitable organizations such as Habitat for Humanity International, the Easter Seals, and the United Way.[26]
Aflac's stated objectives include the decrease of its environmental impact, for which the company is into a partnership with the Clean Air Campaign to encourage employees to engage with greater frequency in alternate commuting methods.[27]
Aflac and Macy's Partnership[edit]
Aflac and Macy’s have partnered since 2001 to sell the annual Aflac holiday plush duck in select Macy’s stores nationwide.[28] Net proceeds from each duck sold are donated to the participating children’s cancer facility nearest to where it is purchased. Since 2001, more than $3 million has been raised from the sale of the ducks.[29]
Aflac has participated in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade for the past six years. A new balloonicle was unveiled in 2014, featuring the Aflac Duck wearing ice skates.[30]

Aflac Inc. /ˈæflæk/ (American Family Life Assurance Company) is an American insurance company and is the largest provider of supplemental insurance in the United States.[4] The company was founded in 1955 and is based in Columbus, Georgia. In the U.S., Aflac underwrites a wide range of insurance policies, but is perhaps more known for its payroll deduction insurance coverage, which pays cash benefits when a policyholder has a covered accident or illness. The company states it "provides financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide."[5]
In 2009, Aflac acquired Continental American Insurance Company for $100 million;[6] this enabled Aflac to sell supplemental insurance on both the individual and group platform.[7] As of June 30, 2012, Aflac was represented by approximately 19,300 sales agencies in Japan, and 76,900 licensed sales associates in the U.S.[8]

History[edit]
The company was founded by brothers John, Paul (died 2014), and William Amos in Columbus, Georgia, in 1955, as American Family Life Insurance Company of Columbus. In 1964, the company name was changed to American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. The company, in 1990, adopted the Aflac initials, although the official name of the underwriting subsidiary remains American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. Aflac announced the appointment of Frederick J. Crawford as Chief Financial Officer, as well as Executive Vice President in June 2015.[9]
The company signed 6,426 policyholders in its first year.[10] Aflac pioneered cancer insurance in 1958. Beginning in 1964, the company decided to focus sales on worksite settings, eventually through policies sponsored by employers and funded through payroll deductions. By 2003, more than 98% of Aflac policies in the United States were issued on a payroll deduction basis, making the company a leader in that approach to policy distribution.
Business[edit]
Aflac operates in the United States and Japan, and has its worldwide headquarters and corporate offices in an eighteen story tower just east of Downtown Columbus, Georgia in an area known as MidTown. The Aflac tower is the tallest building in the city. As of June 30, 2015, the corporation's total assets were more than $103 billion, and the company insured more than 50 million people worldwide.[11]
Aflac is the largest provider of guaranteed-renewable insurance in the United States and the largest insurance company overall in Japan, when measured by individual insurance policies in force.[12]
The company now offers several types of insurance policies in the United States, including the following:

Accident
Cancer/Specified Disease
Dental
Hospital Confinement Indemnity
Hospital Confinement Sickness Indemnity
Hospital Intensive Care
Life
Lump Sum Cancer
Lump Sum Cancer Critical Illness
Specified Health Event
Short Term Disability
Vision

Aflac also offers un-reimbursed medical, dependent day-care, and transportation flexible spending accounts. The company also offers human resources services for HIPAA and COBRA. From 1979 to 1997, the company owned several television stations, most of them in small and medium markets. It sold the broadcasting division (including flagship station WTVM) to what became Raycom Media in 1997.[13]
Critics of cancer policies[edit]
Consumer groups and some government officials say that cancer insurance returns fewer premium dollars to policyholders than standard insurance. A United States General Accounting Office study found that the policies paid back as little as 35% of premiums (Aflac said its cancer insurance paid back 62.4%). In comparison, New York State requires most major-medical policies to pay back 82% and group policies to pay back 75%. New York State does not allow stand-alone cancer policies. In 1997, AFLAC spent $175,000 on lobbyists and campaign contributions to change the law.[14] New York State lifted its ban in 1998, for purchasers who already have basic coverage. Consumer Reports recommended that policyholders use the money instead to buy lower-deductible insurance.[15] Insurance claims by line appear on the Annual Statement filed with each state. Loss claims are a percent of total premium before commissions.
The Aflac Duck[edit]
Since December 1999, the company's identity and brand has become more widely recognized in the United States as the result of TV commercials featuring the Aflac Duck, who frustratedly quacks the company's name to unsuspecting prospective policy holders. The duck concept and all of the commercials to date have been created by Kaplan Thaler Group, an advertising agency based in New York City. Metzer Farms, a Gonzales, California goose, duck, and gamebird hatchery, supplied them with the initial ducklings that each grew into the famous duck. Struggling to come up with a concept to make the big but relatively obscure insurance company's name memorable, one of the agency's art directors stumbled upon the duck idea while walking around Central Park at lunchtime uttering, "Aflac, Aflac." He soon realized how much the company's name sounded like a duck's quack. The Aflac Duck character has now starred in more than 30 commercials. In many of these commercials, character actor Earl Billings also appears. The Aflac Duck is enshrined on Madison Avenue's Walk of Fame as one of America's Favorite Advertising Icons.[16]
In April 2009, Aflac introduced a new marketing campaign called "Get the Aflacts", designed to educate consumers about the specific benefits of the insurance products the company sells. The Aflacts campaign gave the Aflac Duck "a more prominent role", designed to "help potential customers learn the Aflacts, er, facts about policies and other products", according to The New York Times.[17]
Celebrities have starred in the Aflac ads, including Chevy Chase (2003); Yogi Berra; Yao Ming; Donald Trump's wife, Melania Trump; NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Carl Edwards (2008–2014); the United States Olympic synchronized swimming team (2004); and Wayne Newton playing at Stardust Hotel and Casino for the 2003 commercial. The duck also appeared with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.[18] In 2005, the company logo was changed to incorporate the duck. The first commercial using the new logo featured Gilbert Gottfried at a pet store because the duck kept saying, "Aflac!" and he had to trade in the duck for a parrot, saying, "If you're hurt and can't work".[19]
The duck was voiced by comedian Gilbert Gottfried, who also voices Digit on the PBS Kids series Cyberchase, and Iago in the Disney film Aladdin.[20] After 11 years as the voice of the Aflac duck, Gottfried was dismissed on March 14, 2011 due to jokes on Gottfried's Twitter account referencing the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The company's chief marketing officer stated that "Gilbert's recent comments about the crisis in Japan were lacking in humor, and certainly do not represent the thoughts and feelings of anyone at Aflac."[21]
On March 23, 2011, Aflac announced that the company was taking applications for the new voice of the Aflac Duck through QuackAflac.com until April 1. Commercials requesting the submissions, first aired in 2006 but updated, resemble a silent movie.[22][23] On April 26, 2011, it was announced that Daniel McKeague, a television advertising sales manager from Hugo, Minnesota, would be the new voice of the Aflac duck.[24] The first Aflac commercial featuring the duck's new voice aired on May 1, 2011.
Corporate philanthropy and social responsibility[edit]
The company states that through a partnership with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Aflac has contributed more than $100 million to childhood cancer research and treatment.[25]
Aflac employees are formally involved in an array of charitable organizations such as Habitat for Humanity International, the Easter Seals, and the United Way.[26]
Aflac's stated objectives include the decrease of its environmental impact, for which the company is into a partnership with the Clean Air Campaign to encourage employees to engage with greater frequency in alternate commuting methods.[27]
Aflac and Macy's Partnership[edit]
Aflac and Macy’s have partnered since 2001 to sell the annual Aflac holiday plush duck in select Macy’s stores nationwide.[28] Net proceeds from each duck sold are donated to the participating children’s cancer facility nearest to where it is purchased. Since 2001, more than $3 million has been raised from the sale of the ducks.[29]
Aflac has participated in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade for the past six years. A new balloonicle was unveiled in 2014, featuring the Aflac Duck wearing ice skates.[30]
Award programs[edit]
See also: Baseball awards § U.S. high-school baseball
Aflac National High School Baseball Player of the Year (first presented in 2004).[31][32]
The Jackie Robinson Award is given to the high-school player who is entering his senior year and who best displays character, leadership, and the values of being a student athlete in academics and community affairs.[31] The award is presented at an annual All-American Awards banquet, which was first held in 2003.[33] The banquet follows the annual All-American Baseball Classic, an East-West all-star game featuring the 38 best players from around the nation who are entering their senior year of high school.[31][33] First held in 2003, the game is played at Petco Park, San Diego, California.[31][34] Proceeds from the game and banquet are donated to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and its fight against childhood cancer.[34]
In 2011, the name of the all-star game was changed to the Perfect Game All-American Classic.[34]

Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report)	 is scheduled to report first-quarter 2017 results on Apr 25, after the closing bell.Last quarter, Aflac missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.10%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q1 FlashbackAflac’s business in Japan has been suffering from a persistent low interest rate and the same must have impacted earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. Nevertheless, sales from this segment will benefit from an increase in third-sector sales given the company’s emphasis on promoting these products which are less interest rate sensitive. Also, the introduction of a cancer insurance product early last year has been well received in the market place and will contribute to top-line growth.  The company, however, said during the fourth-quarter conference call that its strategic partners were successful in selling Aflac products in 2016. Given the company’s intense focus on moving its own products to meet Japan’s fiscal year-end goals, sales of third-sector products in the first quarter will be impacted.On the other hand, the company’s efforts in pulling out first-sector products and repricing other products in this category to fight the prolonged low interest rate environment will result in a decline in the sale of these products.  However, the company’s continuous efforts to return capital to its shareholders via share buyback will cushion its bottom line.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Aflac is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Aflac has an Earning ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a $1.62 per share, which is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteZacks Rank: Aflac carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which decreases the predictive power of ESP. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report)	, which will will report first-quarter earnings results on Apr 26, has an Earnings ESP of +7.79% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Selective Insurance Group, Inc. (SIGI  -  Free Report)	 has an Earnings ESP of +9.59% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company will report first-quarter earnings results on Apr 26.Fiserv, Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report)	 has an Earnings ESP of +0.85% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is expected to report first-quarter earnings results on Apr 26.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate morethan 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emergingphenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

 Source: Internal For most of the dividend seekers, retirees, or passive investors, Cincinnati Financial Corp. and Aflac Inc. are the best-in-class listed insurers which increase their dividends gradually, rewarding the long-term investors. I am not a dividend seeker nor a retiree nor a passive investor. In the future, I would be classified at least in one of this category (especially becoming an early retiree if I have the chance to have the capital to live with the received dividends). But for the moment, the Ohio-based P&C insurer or the US's largest provider of supplemental insurance are not on my wish list. However, I am still interested in the insurance companies and their ability to generate an extraordinary amount of cash, either thanks to a strong operating performance or an excellent capital management. And sometimes the insurers have a strong track record at the operating level and at an investing level. But at least being Warren B. or one if his spiritual heirs, insurers' top management should choose between operating performance and investment performance.
 Regarding the profile of the two companies, both insurers seem to have a good operating performance, but let's have a look more deeply to see if one of them is performing better. Competitive Position: The Growing Dwarf And The Would-Be Declining Giant 

 Source: Internal Cincinnati Financial Corp. is a P&C multiline insurer which provides products for various business lines and operates mainly in the United States. On the contrary, Aflac Inc. is a leading niche insurer, only focused on one type of health insurance product, in the U.S. and Japan, which is its primary market. Regarding net earned premiums, Aflac is bigger than Cincinnati. The US's largest provider of supplemental insurance collects four times more premiums than Cincinnati Financial Corp. 

 Source: Internal However, the trend is more positive for the Ohio-based P&C insurer than for Aflac. In 5 years, the earned premiums grew by $1,188 million, while Aflac earned in 2016 $3.2 billion less than in 2012. Is Aflac a declining giant? Not exactly. As the central part of its business comes from Japan, the insurer is exposed to the fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate. At a constant rate, Aflac's earned premiums increased over the 5 years, but the fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate completely hid the growth of the turnover. Hence, both the insurers are growing companies, but foreign currency rate fluctuations harshly impact one of them.
 Operating Performance: The Domination Of The US-based Mikado 

 Source: Internal At operating performance level, there is no match. Aflac wins undoubtedly. With a 5-year average combined ratio of 93.6%, the health insurer has a strong track record. Does Cincinnati Financial lose money when it writes new policies? No, it does not. With a 94.3% combined on the average, the P&C insurer monitors its business extremely well. Cincinnati's net loss ratio is even lower than Aflac's, thanks to an extensive diversification regarding lines of business (Aflac is mainly concentrated on cancer insurance policies and health voluntary supplemental insurance policies), a strong loss control practices and good standards regarding pricing methodology. 

 Source: Internal However, the expense ratio is around 30%, due to the commissions paid to distribution channel and other administrative costs. 

 Source: Internal By comparing only Aflac's U.S. subsidiary, we arrive at the same conclusion; with a 38% net expense ratio, Aflac's cost efficiency is lower in the U.S. than Cincinnati's. Hopefully, for Aflac, the central part of the business is written in Japan, where the company is the market leader, is very well implemented, and distributes its products through multiple distribution channels (e.g. banks, brokers, tied-agents). In the end, Aflac's Japanese subsidiary is very well cost efficient and impacts the total net expense ratio of the U.S. insurer positively.
 Another thing should be pointed out: the technical result of Aflac is less volatile than Cincinnati's. Every year, Aflac delivers a combined ratio of around 94%. For the Ohio-based P&C insurer, it is not as stable as for Aflac. The main reason is that the P&C multiliner is more exposed to the catastrophes (flood, hail, wind, etc.), as it sells traditional non-life insurance products. Hence, one year could be harshly impacted by one big natural catastrophe in spite of a well-designed reinsurance program. Regarding earnings per share, Aflac overwhelms Cincinnati Financial Corp. 

 Source: Internal The reasons are the following:  Aflac is bigger than the Ohio-based P&C insurance company and delivers a better combined ratio Aflac repurchases a good portion of its shares every year, causing the earnings per share to increase accordingly The investment income is higher for Aflac than for Cincinnati Financial Corp.  However, it is also important to moderate two of the above remarks. The 5-year EPS growth of Cincinnati Financial Corp. is 38.1%, while the earnings per share increased only by 5.1% for Aflac, mainly impacted by the foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Aflac Inc. remains in my view a stronger company regarding operating performance than Cincinnati Financial Corp. Share Repurchase Program: The No-Match 

 Source: Internal By looking at the figures, it is evident that one company repurchases its shares every year, while the other one does not, and even issues new shares. From 2012 to 2016, the number of outstanding shares of the multiliner increased by 1.7%, while the niche insurer repurchased 11.8% of its share in the same period. Hence, there is no match. Aflac wins.
 Dividend Policy: The No-Match, Again? 

 Source: Internal Both companies are well known for increasing the annualized paid dividend almost every year. A lot of retirees, dividend seekers, and passive investors are willing to purchase shares of Aflac or Cincinnati Financial Corp., even if both stocks are overvalued because they know the capital allocation of these companies is focused on rewarding the long-term shareholders. But is one of the companies more generous? Definitely yes. On an absolute basis, Cincinnati pays a higher dividend than Aflac does. However, Aflac has two advantages compared to the Ohio-based insurer:  Aflac's payout ratio is lower than Cincinnati's. In other words, Aflac has more leeway either to increase its dividend or to smoothen a decrease of its results due to a deterioration of the claims situation. With a 5-year average payout ratio of 57.0%, Cincinnati should deliver better results year after year to avoid drawing down cash reserves.  

 Source: Internal Another thing which should be pointed out is related to the dividend growth. With 23.9% 5-year growth, Aflac is more regular than Cincinnati is. 


 Source: Internal An investor could expect Aflac to increase its annual dividend by 5%, while the dividend increase is slightly more volatile from Cincinnati. However, in both the cases, we could see that the dividend growth is lower year after year. From Aflac's perspective, we could expect to maintain a 5% increase, either thanks to better results arising from fluctuation effects in the yen exchange rate or due to the growth of payout. From Cincinnati Financial Corporation, we could expect its dividend to increase by 4% annually. Hence Aflac wins, but at long term, both companies could be less attractive if the dividend growth slows. Debt & Financial Condition: A Draw With an A+ rating delivered by Fitch, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and S&P (NYSE:SPGI), Aflac is considered as a reliable insurance company and issued notes accordingly. With a net debt position of around $500 million ($5.3 billion debt - $4.9 billion cash), Aflac is not too highly leveraged. With 10 million net debt position, Cincinnati is less leveraged than the US-based health insurer. With an A+ rating, Cincinnati Financial Corp. is also assessed by the credit rating agencies as an insurer with a strong financial situation. However, the interest paid by Cincinnati Financial Corp is relatively higher than those paid by Aflac. The long-term debt notes of the P&C multiliner were issued at around 6.2%-6.9%, while Aflac issued extinguished high-yield notes in the past to issue new bonds with a lower yield (2%-4% depending on the maturity date) or high-yield notes (around 6%) with a longer maturity (2039 and after). A better net debt position vs. a lower debt burden: it is a draw. Financial Performance: Let's Take A Pragmatic Approach As value investors, we are always interested in the stock valuation. As retirees or dividend seekers, we are not focused on the stock price. We are only interested in knowing if we will receive more money than the year before, if the dividend payment will remain sustainable, and if we don't lose money in case we should purchase our stocks.
 If an investor had invested $100 in Aflac in 2011 and reinvested the dividends, he would have more than $200 at the end of 2016. 

 Source: Aflac's 2016 annual report In the same period, he would have $300 if he would have invested $100 in Cincinnati Financial Corporation. 

 Source: Cincinnati Financial Corporation's 2016 annual report To make a long story short, an investor will be richer by having invested in Cincinnati Financial Corporation than in Aflac Inc. Conclusion: Cincinnati Financial Corporation or Aflac Inc.? On a pure stock performance perspective, I would choose Cincinnati Financial Corporation. It seems that the market considered in the past the multiliner as more resilient and more profitable than the US-based niche insurer. However, if I would only have a look at the metrics, I would pick up Aflac Inc. More efficient operationally speaking, completely focused on increasing the value delivered to its shareholders through its stock repurchase program and its dividend policy, and more pragmatic and smarter on the debt management, Aflac Inc. seems to be a must-have stock. Considering the above statements, I would invest in both stocks. But it would be considered by many as a non-committal choice. Hence, if I had to choose only one, I would pick Aflac Inc. up, as I appreciate a lot the niche insurers.

One Day PaySM †
With Aflac, qualified claims are paid in just a day.







Here's how it works.2
Medical expenses don’t always come from an accident or critical illness; sometimes it starts with a visit to an urgent care clinic because of a sharp pain in your side. While health insurance typically covers some of the expense, you will likely be responsible for a portion of the bill. Aflac Choice helps with those unexpected hospital expenses that may not be covered by health insurance. That way, you may not have to sacrifice your vacation budget for those unexpected medical costs.







Trouble strikes.






You suddenly experience a sharp pain in your side and go to an urgent care clinic, where you’re diagnosed with appendicitis.





You find yourself in the emergency room.






You’re taken by ambulance to the emergency room, where lab tests and diagnostic exams report back that you need surgery right away.





Aflac helps take the sting out.






After a 3-day stay in the hospital you’re feeling much better, but hospital bills add up quickly. Cash benefits are paid directly to you (unless otherwise assigned), which can help ease the financial stress of your illness.





You get your money fast.






Claims made on your Aflac Choice policy are eligible for One Day Pay℠.† Now that's fast.

Aflac Inc. /ˈæflæk/ (American Family Life Assurance Company) is an American insurance company and is the largest provider of supplemental insurance in the United States.[4] The company was founded in 1955 and is based in Columbus, Georgia. In the U.S., Aflac underwrites a wide range of insurance policies, but is perhaps more known for its payroll deduction insurance coverage, which pays cash benefits when a policyholder has a covered accident or illness. The company states it "provides financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide."[5]
In 2009, Aflac acquired Continental American Insurance Company for $100 million;[6] this enabled Aflac to sell supplemental insurance on both the individual and group platform.[7] As of June 30, 2012, Aflac was represented by approximately 19,300 sales agencies in Japan, and 76,900 licensed sales associates in the U.S.[8]

History[edit]
The company was founded by brothers John, Paul (died 2014), and William Amos in Columbus, Georgia, in 1955, as American Family Life Insurance Company of Columbus. In 1964, the company name was changed to American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. The company, in 1990, adopted the Aflac initials, although the official name of the underwriting subsidiary remains American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. Aflac announced the appointment of Frederick J. Crawford as Chief Financial Officer, as well as Executive Vice President in June 2015.[9]
The company signed 6,426 policyholders in its first year.[10] Aflac pioneered cancer insurance in 1958. Beginning in 1964, the company decided to focus sales on worksite settings, eventually through policies sponsored by employers and funded through payroll deductions. By 2003, more than 98% of Aflac policies in the United States were issued on a payroll deduction basis, making the company a leader in that approach to policy distribution.
Business[edit]
Aflac operates in the United States and Japan, and has its worldwide headquarters and corporate offices in an eighteen story tower just east of Downtown Columbus, Georgia in an area known as MidTown. The Aflac tower is the tallest building in the city. As of June 30, 2015, the corporation's total assets were more than $103 billion, and the company insured more than 50 million people worldwide.[11]
Aflac is the largest provider of guaranteed-renewable insurance in the United States and the largest insurance company overall in Japan, when measured by individual insurance policies in force.[12]
The company now offers several types of insurance policies in the United States, including the following:

Accident
Cancer/Specified Disease
Dental
Hospital Confinement Indemnity
Hospital Confinement Sickness Indemnity
Hospital Intensive Care
Life
Lump Sum Cancer
Lump Sum Cancer Critical Illness
Specified Health Event
Short Term Disability
Vision

Aflac also offers un-reimbursed medical, dependent day-care, and transportation flexible spending accounts. The company also offers human resources services for HIPAA and COBRA. From 1979 to 1997, the company owned several television stations, most of them in small and medium markets. It sold the broadcasting division (including flagship station WTVM) to what became Raycom Media in 1997.[13]
Critics of cancer policies[edit]
Consumer groups and some government officials say that cancer insurance returns fewer premium dollars to policyholders than standard insurance. A United States General Accounting Office study found that the policies paid back as little as 35% of premiums (Aflac said its cancer insurance paid back 62.4%). In comparison, New York State requires most major-medical policies to pay back 82% and group policies to pay back 75%. New York State does not allow stand-alone cancer policies. In 1997, AFLAC spent $175,000 on lobbyists and campaign contributions to change the law.[14] New York State lifted its ban in 1998, for purchasers who already have basic coverage. Consumer Reports recommended that policyholders use the money instead to buy lower-deductible insurance.[15] Insurance claims by line appear on the Annual Statement filed with each state. Loss claims are a percent of total premium before commissions.
The Aflac Duck[edit]
Since December 1999, the company's identity and brand has become more widely recognized in the United States as the result of TV commercials featuring the Aflac Duck, who frustratedly quacks the company's name to unsuspecting prospective policy holders. The duck concept and all of the commercials to date have been created by Kaplan Thaler Group, an advertising agency based in New York City. Metzer Farms, a Gonzales, California goose, duck, and gamebird hatchery, supplied them with the initial ducklings that each grew into the famous duck. Struggling to come up with a concept to make the big but relatively obscure insurance company's name memorable, one of the agency's art directors stumbled upon the duck idea while walking around Central Park at lunchtime uttering, "Aflac, Aflac." He soon realized how much the company's name sounded like a duck's quack. The Aflac Duck character has now starred in more than 30 commercials. In many of these commercials, character actor Earl Billings also appears. The Aflac Duck is enshrined on Madison Avenue's Walk of Fame as one of America's Favorite Advertising Icons.[16]
In April 2009, Aflac introduced a new marketing campaign called "Get the Aflacts", designed to educate consumers about the specific benefits of the insurance products the company sells. The Aflacts campaign gave the Aflac Duck "a more prominent role", designed to "help potential customers learn the Aflacts, er, facts about policies and other products", according to The New York Times.[17]
Celebrities have starred in the Aflac ads, including Chevy Chase (2003); Yogi Berra; Yao Ming; Donald Trump's wife, Melania Trump; NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Carl Edwards (2008–2014); the United States Olympic synchronized swimming team (2004); and Wayne Newton playing at Stardust Hotel and Casino for the 2003 commercial. The duck also appeared with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.[18] In 2005, the company logo was changed to incorporate the duck. The first commercial using the new logo featured Gilbert Gottfried at a pet store because the duck kept saying, "Aflac!" and he had to trade in the duck for a parrot, saying, "If you're hurt and can't work".[19]
The duck was voiced by comedian Gilbert Gottfried, who also voices Digit on the PBS Kids series Cyberchase, and Iago in the Disney film Aladdin.[20] After 11 years as the voice of the Aflac duck, Gottfried was dismissed on March 14, 2011 due to jokes on Gottfried's Twitter account referencing the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The company's chief marketing officer stated that "Gilbert's recent comments about the crisis in Japan were lacking in humor, and certainly do not represent the thoughts and feelings of anyone at Aflac."[21]
On March 23, 2011, Aflac announced that the company was taking applications for the new voice of the Aflac Duck through QuackAflac.com until April 1. Commercials requesting the submissions, first aired in 2006 but updated, resemble a silent movie.[22][23] On April 26, 2011, it was announced that Daniel McKeague, a television advertising sales manager from Hugo, Minnesota, would be the new voice of the Aflac duck.[24] The first Aflac commercial featuring the duck's new voice aired on May 1, 2011.
Corporate philanthropy and social responsibility[edit]
The company states that through a partnership with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Aflac has contributed more than $100 million to childhood cancer research and treatment.[25]
Aflac employees are formally involved in an array of charitable organizations such as Habitat for Humanity International, the Easter Seals, and the United Way.[26]
Aflac's stated objectives include the decrease of its environmental impact, for which the company is into a partnership with the Clean Air Campaign to encourage employees to engage with greater frequency in alternate commuting methods.[27]
Aflac and Macy's Partnership[edit]
Aflac and Macy’s have partnered since 2001 to sell the annual Aflac holiday plush duck in select Macy’s stores nationwide.[28] Net proceeds from each duck sold are donated to the participating children’s cancer facility nearest to where it is purchased. Since 2001, more than $3 million has been raised from the sale of the ducks.[29]
Aflac has participated in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade for the past six years. A new balloonicle was unveiled in 2014, featuring the Aflac Duck wearing ice skates.[30]
Award programs[edit]

Aflac National High School Baseball Player of the Year (first presented in 2004).[31][32]
The Jackie Robinson Award is given to the high-school player who is entering his senior year and who best displays character, leadership, and the values of being a student athlete in academics and community affairs.[31] The award is presented at an annual All-American Awards banquet, which was first held in 2003.[33] The banquet follows the annual All-American Baseball Classic, an East-West all-star game featuring the 38 best players from around the nation who are entering their senior year of high school.[31][33] First held in 2003, the game is played at Petco Park, San Diego, California.[31][34] Proceeds from the game and banquet are donated to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and its fight against childhood cancer.[34]
In 2011, the name of the all-star game was changed to the Perfect Game All-American Classic.[34]

Aflac Inc. /ˈæflæk/ (American Family Life Assurance Company) is an American insurance company and is the largest provider of supplemental insurance in the United States.[4] The company was founded in 1955 and is based in Columbus, Georgia. In the U.S., Aflac underwrites a wide range of insurance policies, but is perhaps more known for its payroll deduction insurance coverage, which pays cash benefits when a policyholder has a covered accident or illness. The company states it "provides financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide."[5]
In 2009, Aflac acquired Continental American Insurance Company for $100 million;[6] this enabled Aflac to sell supplemental insurance on both the individual and group platform.[7] As of June 30, 2012, Aflac was represented by approximately 19,300 sales agencies in Japan, and 76,900 licensed sales associates in the U.S.[8]

History[edit]
The company was founded by brothers John, Paul (died 2014), and William Amos in Columbus, Georgia, in 1955, as American Family Life Insurance Company of Columbus. In 1964, the company name was changed to American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. The company, in 1990, adopted the Aflac initials, although the official name of the underwriting subsidiary remains American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. Aflac announced the appointment of Frederick J. Crawford as Chief Financial Officer, as well as Executive Vice President in June 2015.[9]
The company signed 6,426 policyholders in its first year.[10] Aflac pioneered cancer insurance in 1958. Beginning in 1964, the company decided to focus sales on worksite settings, eventually through policies sponsored by employers and funded through payroll deductions. By 2003, more than 98% of Aflac policies in the United States were issued on a payroll deduction basis, making the company a leader in that approach to policy distribution.
Business[edit]
Aflac operates in the United States and Japan, and has its worldwide headquarters and corporate offices in an eighteen story tower just east of Downtown Columbus, Georgia in an area known as MidTown. The Aflac tower is the tallest building in the city. As of June 30, 2015, the corporation's total assets were more than $103 billion, and the company insured more than 50 million people worldwide.[11]
Aflac is the largest provider of guaranteed-renewable insurance in the United States and the largest insurance company overall in Japan, when measured by individual insurance policies in force.[12]
The company now offers several types of insurance policies in the United States, including the following:

Accident
Cancer/Specified Disease
Dental
Hospital Confinement Indemnity
Hospital Confinement Sickness Indemnity
Hospital Intensive Care
Life
Lump Sum Cancer
Lump Sum Cancer Critical Illness
Specified Health Event
Short Term Disability
Vision

Aflac also offers un-reimbursed medical, dependent day-care, and transportation flexible spending accounts. The company also offers human resources services for HIPAA and COBRA. From 1979 to 1997, the company owned several television stations, most of them in small and medium markets. It sold the broadcasting division (including flagship station WTVM) to what became Raycom Media in 1997.[13]
Critics of cancer policies[edit]
Consumer groups and some government officials say that cancer insurance returns fewer premium dollars to policyholders than standard insurance. A United States General Accounting Office study found that the policies paid back as little as 35% of premiums (Aflac said its cancer insurance paid back 62.4%). In comparison, New York State requires most major-medical policies to pay back 82% and group policies to pay back 75%. New York State does not allow stand-alone cancer policies. In 1997, AFLAC spent $175,000 on lobbyists and campaign contributions to change the law.[14] New York State lifted its ban in 1998, for purchasers who already have basic coverage. Consumer Reports recommended that policyholders use the money instead to buy lower-deductible insurance.[15] Insurance claims by line appear on the Annual Statement filed with each state. Loss claims are a percent of total premium before commissions.
The Aflac Duck[edit]
Since December 1999, the company's identity and brand has become more widely recognized in the United States as the result of TV commercials featuring the Aflac Duck, who frustratedly quacks the company's name to unsuspecting prospective policy holders. The duck concept and all of the commercials to date have been created by Kaplan Thaler Group, an advertising agency based in New York City. Metzer Farms, a Gonzales, California goose, duck, and gamebird hatchery, supplied them with the initial ducklings that each grew into the famous duck. Struggling to come up with a concept to make the big but relatively obscure insurance company's name memorable, one of the agency's art directors stumbled upon the duck idea while walking around Central Park at lunchtime uttering, "Aflac, Aflac." He soon realized how much the company's name sounded like a duck's quack. The Aflac Duck character has now starred in more than 30 commercials. In many of these commercials, character actor Earl Billings also appears. The Aflac Duck is enshrined on Madison Avenue's Walk of Fame as one of America's Favorite Advertising Icons.[16]
In April 2009, Aflac introduced a new marketing campaign called "Get the Aflacts", designed to educate consumers about the specific benefits of the insurance products the company sells. The Aflacts campaign gave the Aflac Duck "a more prominent role", designed to "help potential customers learn the Aflacts, er, facts about policies and other products", according to The New York Times.[17]
Celebrities have starred in the Aflac ads, including Chevy Chase (2003); Yogi Berra; Yao Ming; Donald Trump's wife, Melania Trump; NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Carl Edwards (2008–2014); the United States Olympic synchronized swimming team (2004); and Wayne Newton playing at Stardust Hotel and Casino for the 2003 commercial. The duck also appeared with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.[18] In 2005, the company logo was changed to incorporate the duck. The first commercial using the new logo featured Gilbert Gottfried at a pet store because the duck kept saying, "Aflac!" and he had to trade in the duck for a parrot, saying, "If you're hurt and can't work".[19]
The duck was voiced by comedian Gilbert Gottfried, who also voices Digit on the PBS Kids series Cyberchase, and Iago in the Disney film Aladdin.[20] After 11 years as the voice of the Aflac duck, Gottfried was dismissed on March 14, 2011 due to jokes on Gottfried's Twitter account referencing the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The company's chief marketing officer stated that "Gilbert's recent comments about the crisis in Japan were lacking in humor, and certainly do not represent the thoughts and feelings of anyone at Aflac."[21]
On March 23, 2011, Aflac announced that the company was taking applications for the new voice of the Aflac Duck through QuackAflac.com until April 1. Commercials requesting the submissions, first aired in 2006 but updated, resemble a silent movie.[22][23] On April 26, 2011, it was announced that Daniel McKeague, a television advertising sales manager from Hugo, Minnesota, would be the new voice of the Aflac duck.[24] The first Aflac commercial featuring the duck's new voice aired on May 1, 2011.
Corporate philanthropy and social responsibility[edit]
The company states that through a partnership with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Aflac has contributed more than $100 million to childhood cancer research and treatment.[25]
Aflac employees are formally involved in an array of charitable organizations such as Habitat for Humanity International, the Easter Seals, and the United Way.[26]
Aflac's stated objectives include the decrease of its environmental impact, for which the company is into a partnership with the Clean Air Campaign to encourage employees to engage with greater frequency in alternate commuting methods.[27]
Aflac and Macy's Partnership[edit]
Aflac and Macy’s have partnered since 2001 to sell the annual Aflac holiday plush duck in select Macy’s stores nationwide.[28] Net proceeds from each duck sold are donated to the participating children’s cancer facility nearest to where it is purchased. Since 2001, more than $3 million has been raised from the sale of the ducks.[29]
Aflac has participated in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade for the past six years. A new balloonicle was unveiled in 2014, featuring the Aflac Duck wearing ice skates.[30]
Award programs[edit]
See also: Baseball awards § U.S. high-school baseball
Aflac National High School Baseball Player of the Year (first presented in 2004).[31][32]
The Jackie Robinson Award is given to the high-school player who is entering his senior year and who best displays character, leadership, and the values of being a student athlete in academics and community affairs.[31] The award is presented at an annual All-American Awards banquet, which was first held in 2003.[33] The banquet follows the annual All-American Baseball Classic, an East-West all-star game featuring the 38 best players from around the nation who are entering their senior year of high school.[31][33] First held in 2003, the game is played at Petco Park, San Diego, California.[31][34] Proceeds from the game and banquet are donated to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and its fight against childhood cancer.[34]
In 2011, the name of the all-star game was changed to the Perfect Game All-American Classic.[34]

Aflac Inc. /ˈæflæk/ (American Family Life Assurance Company) is an American insurance company and is the largest provider of supplemental insurance in the United States.[4] The company was founded in 1955 and is based in Columbus, Georgia. In the U.S., Aflac underwrites a wide range of insurance policies, but is perhaps more known for its payroll deduction insurance coverage, which pays cash benefits when a policyholder has a covered accident or illness. The company states it "provides financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide."[5]
In 2009, Aflac acquired Continental American Insurance Company for $100 million;[6] this enabled Aflac to sell supplemental insurance on both the individual and group platform.[7] As of June 30, 2012, Aflac was represented by approximately 19,300 sales agencies in Japan, and 76,900 licensed sales associates in the U.S.[8]

History[edit]
The company was founded by brothers John, Paul (died 2014), and William Amos in Columbus, Georgia, in 1955, as American Family Life Insurance Company of Columbus. In 1964, the company name was changed to American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. The company, in 1990, adopted the Aflac initials, although the official name of the underwriting subsidiary remains American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. Aflac announced the appointment of Frederick J. Crawford as Chief Financial Officer, as well as Executive Vice President in June 2015.[9]
The company signed 6,426 policyholders in its first year.[10] Aflac pioneered cancer insurance in 1958. Beginning in 1964, the company decided to focus sales on worksite settings, eventually through policies sponsored by employers and funded through payroll deductions. By 2003, more than 98% of Aflac policies in the United States were issued on a payroll deduction basis, making the company a leader in that approach to policy distribution.
Business[edit]
Aflac operates in the United States and Japan, and has its worldwide headquarters and corporate offices in an eighteen story tower just east of Downtown Columbus, Georgia in an area known as MidTown. The Aflac tower is the tallest building in the city. As of June 30, 2015, the corporation's total assets were more than $103 billion, and the company insured more than 50 million people worldwide.[11]
Aflac is the largest provider of guaranteed-renewable insurance in the United States and the largest insurance company overall in Japan, when measured by individual insurance policies in force.[12]
The company now offers several types of insurance policies in the United States, including the following:

Accident
Cancer/Specified Disease
Dental
Hospital Confinement Indemnity
Hospital Confinement Sickness Indemnity
Hospital Intensive Care
Life
Lump Sum Cancer
Lump Sum Cancer Critical Illness
Specified Health Event
Short Term Disability
Vision

Aflac also offers un-reimbursed medical, dependent day-care, and transportation flexible spending accounts. The company also offers human resources services for HIPAA and COBRA. From 1979 to 1997, the company owned several television stations, most of them in small and medium markets. It sold the broadcasting division (including flagship station WTVM) to what became Raycom Media in 1997.[13]
Critics of cancer policies[edit]
Consumer groups and some government officials say that cancer insurance returns fewer premium dollars to policyholders than standard insurance. A United States General Accounting Office study found that the policies paid back as little as 35% of premiums (Aflac said its cancer insurance paid back 62.4%). In comparison, New York State requires most major-medical policies to pay back 82% and group policies to pay back 75%. New York State does not allow stand-alone cancer policies. In 1997, AFLAC spent $175,000 on lobbyists and campaign contributions to change the law.[14] New York State lifted its ban in 1998, for purchasers who already have basic coverage. Consumer Reports recommended that policyholders use the money instead to buy lower-deductible insurance.[15] Insurance claims by line appear on the Annual Statement filed with each state. Loss claims are a percent of total premium before commissions.
The Aflac Duck[edit]
Since December 1999, the company's identity and brand has become more widely recognized in the United States as the result of TV commercials featuring the Aflac Duck, who frustratedly quacks the company's name to unsuspecting prospective policy holders. The duck concept and all of the commercials to date have been created by Kaplan Thaler Group, an advertising agency based in New York City. Metzer Farms, a Gonzales, California goose, duck, and gamebird hatchery, supplied them with the initial ducklings that each grew into the famous duck. Struggling to come up with a concept to make the big but relatively obscure insurance company's name memorable, one of the agency's art directors stumbled upon the duck idea while walking around Central Park at lunchtime uttering, "Aflac, Aflac." He soon realized how much the company's name sounded like a duck's quack. The Aflac Duck character has now starred in more than 30 commercials. In many of these commercials, character actor Earl Billings also appears. The Aflac Duck is enshrined on Madison Avenue's Walk of Fame as one of America's Favorite Advertising Icons.[16]
In April 2009, Aflac introduced a new marketing campaign called "Get the Aflacts", designed to educate consumers about the specific benefits of the insurance products the company sells. The Aflacts campaign gave the Aflac Duck "a more prominent role", designed to "help potential customers learn the Aflacts, er, facts about policies and other products", according to The New York Times.[17]
Celebrities have starred in the Aflac ads, including Chevy Chase (2003); Yogi Berra; Yao Ming; Donald Trump's wife, Melania Trump; NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Carl Edwards (2008–2014); the United States Olympic synchronized swimming team (2004); and Wayne Newton playing at Stardust Hotel and Casino for the 2003 commercial. The duck also appeared with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.[18] In 2005, the company logo was changed to incorporate the duck. The first commercial using the new logo featured Gilbert Gottfried at a pet store because the duck kept saying, "Aflac!" and he had to trade in the duck for a parrot, saying, "If you're hurt and can't work".[19]
The duck was voiced by comedian Gilbert Gottfried, who also voices Digit on the PBS Kids series Cyberchase, and Iago in the Disney film Aladdin.[20] After 11 years as the voice of the Aflac duck, Gottfried was dismissed on March 14, 2011 due to jokes on Gottfried's Twitter account referencing the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The company's chief marketing officer stated that "Gilbert's recent comments about the crisis in Japan were lacking in humor, and certainly do not represent the thoughts and feelings of anyone at Aflac."[21]
On March 23, 2011, Aflac announced that the company was taking applications for the new voice of the Aflac Duck through QuackAflac.com until April 1. Commercials requesting the submissions, first aired in 2006 but updated, resemble a silent movie.[22][23] On April 26, 2011, it was announced that Daniel McKeague, a television advertising sales manager from Hugo, Minnesota, would be the new voice of the Aflac duck.[24] The first Aflac commercial featuring the duck's new voice aired on May 1, 2011.
Corporate philanthropy and social responsibility[edit]
The company states that through a partnership with Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Aflac has contributed more than $100 million to childhood cancer research and treatment.[25]
Aflac employees are formally involved in an array of charitable organizations such as Habitat for Humanity International, the Easter Seals, and the United Way.[26]
Aflac's stated objectives include the decrease of its environmental impact, for which the company is into a partnership with the Clean Air Campaign to encourage employees to engage with greater frequency in alternate commuting methods.[27]
Aflac and Macy's Partnership[edit]
Aflac and Macy’s have partnered since 2001 to sell the annual Aflac holiday plush duck in select Macy’s stores nationwide.[28] Net proceeds from each duck sold are donated to the participating children’s cancer facility nearest to where it is purchased. Since 2001, more than $3 million has been raised from the sale of the ducks.[29]
Aflac has participated in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade for the past six years. A new balloonicle was unveiled in 2014, featuring the Aflac Duck wearing ice skates.[30]
Award programs[edit]

Aflac National High School Baseball Player of the Year (first presented in 2004).[31][32]
The Jackie Robinson Award is given to the high-school player who is entering his senior year and who best displays character, leadership, and the values of being a student athlete in academics and community affairs.[31] The award is presented at an annual All-American Awards banquet, which was first held in 2003.[33] The banquet follows the annual All-American Baseball Classic, an East-West all-star game featuring the 38 best players from around the nation who are entering their senior year of high school.[31][33] First held in 2003, the game is played at Petco Park, San Diego, California.[31][34] Proceeds from the game and banquet are donated to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and its fight against childhood cancer.[34]
In 2011, the name of the all-star game was changed to the Perfect Game All-American Classic.[34]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
