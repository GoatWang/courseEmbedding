Fidelity® Blue Chip Growth Fund: Portfolio Manager Q&A

JANUARY 31, 2017
View as PDF


Fund Managers
Sonu Kalra
Q&A


An interview with Portfolio Manager Sonu Kalra

Sonu, how did the fund perform for the semiannual reporting period ending January 31, 2017?
The fund's share classes advanced about 6% the past six months, outpacing the 4.28% return of the benchmark and also topping our peer group average.
Looking out a bit longer term, the fund gained roughly 16% for the trailing 12 months, lagging the benchmark but outperforming the peer average.

What factors helped the fund outperform its benchmark the past six months?
Investors continued to exhibit "risk on" behavior amid U.S. job growth, global economic stimulus and stabilizing oil prices. However, the big news was the November election of Donald Trump. The new administration's prospective pro-business policies – including plans to cut the corporate tax rate and influence global trade – and a rising U.S. dollar supported traditionally cyclical names, which I favor.
While I try to cast a wide net in terms of opportunities, experience has taught me certain areas of the market tend to display a greater predisposition toward innovation than others. This includes information technology, by far the fund's largest sector allocation the past six months, representing about 42% of fund assets, on average. Innovation has led to growth, so I find myself spending more of my time looking for ideas within this group. Here, investors were drawn to some of the more-economically sensitive areas in which we invest – particularly the semiconductors & semiconductor equipment industry, where positioning was by far the fund's biggest contributor.

Tell us about your strategy, including your approach to tech stocks.
In tech and in all areas of the market, I focus on owning companies that I think can sustain above-average earnings over the long term. I aim to achieve this by looking for firms with some combination of competitive advantage, high barriers to entry, pricing power and strong management. I also seek firms that demonstrate above-average growth versus peers, and those with good return on equity and improving return on capital.
This period, I found several software & services names that fit this description. As a result, the fund's top-three relative contributors came from the segment: Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors and Broadcom.
Nvidia was the fund's biggest individual contributor this period. The company has done well in the field of visual computing – PC gaming, for example – and shown leadership in machine learning, including the technology supporting driverless cars. Shares of the graphics card designer gained 82% for the fund, including a jump in November after the company reported impressive quarterly financial results, driven by sales of chips for computer gaming and infotainment systems in autos.
A non-benchmark stake in Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors was a plus. Shares of the firm rose sharply on late-September news reports that industry giant Qualcomm is interested in acquiring NXP as part of its effort to expand its product lines beyond those used in mobile devices. I should note that Qualcomm was a fund holding and a material detractor this period. The deal was formally announced in late October but not completed by period end. I tend to avoid deal risks when a firm gets acquired, so I closed our position in NXP.
Meanwhile, Broadcom shares advanced 24%, partly due to better-than-expected fourth-quarter and full-year financial results reported in December. The firm credited the strong results to positive synergies following its acquisition of the legacy Broadcom company, which Avago had purchased in January 2016 before assuming Broadcom's name. Broadcom, one of the fund's largest holdings this period, is a leading producer of radio-frequency (RF) chips used in smartphones. I remained bullish on the firm's potential, as consumers continue to demand more bandwidth, requiring more RF content in smartphones.

Which other investments and decisions influenced performance versus the benchmark?
An underweighting in drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb boosted relative results. Our holdings in the stock returned -25% the past six months, dragged down along with the pharmaceuticals industry amid growing concern surrounding potential drug-pricing regulation, especially in the lead-up to the November U.S. presidential election. I sold our stake here by period end as I continued to find better opportunities elsewhere. 

What disappointed the past six months?
The fund's largest relative detractor was underexposure to tech giant and large index constituent Microsoft. I added to the fund's position in Microsoft as the firm continued to demonstrate success in its cloud business, but it remained a sizable underweighting as of January 31. Unfortunately for the fund, we missed out on the stock's gain in the second half of the period. Continued optimism regarding the growth of Microsoft's cloud-computing business, in which it rents software to customers on a subscription basis, helped boost the share price 16% the past six months. 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals was another fund laggard, as the stock returned roughly -15% this period. In addition to industrywide drug-pricing pressure, Regeneron was hurt in October when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) halted a clinical study of the firm's potential treatment for osteoarthritis pain and chronic low back pain. In addition, the FDA rejected Regeneron's submission for its rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Despite the stock's performance this period, I remained positive about Regeneron, in part because it is planning to launch a new treatment for dermatitis, a serious form of eczema, which I'm optimistic will do well serving a large, unmet market.

Sonu, what is your outlook at period end?The market climbed a "wall of worry" following the U.S. presidential election. Investors seem hopeful that recent stock-price gains will be accompanied by faster earnings growth amid a decreased regulatory burden on corporate America and potential tax reform. I am cautiously optimistic that we could see improvement in the U.S. economy.
Energy prices have recovered nicely from the trough we saw last year, while interest rates have risen, though are still low by historical standards. I've been paying particular attention to the potential impact this may have on the U.S. housing market, as well as to early signs of increasing inflation as higher wages and energy prices filter through the economy. Historically, valuations have remained high, but I remain positive that earnings growth should follow, helping to bring prices back to more-neutral levels.
At period end, the fund's largest overweightings remained information technology and consumer discretionary – two sectors I still see as ripe with growth opportunities, even amid the current slow-growth environment. ■ 





Sonu Kalra on opportunities in machine learning:


"Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that provides computers with the ability to adapt and change without being explicitly programmed. This technology is in the relatively early stages of adoption, but is already being used in a number of ways.
"As societies become more digital, increasing amounts of personal, business and other forms of data are being collected. Companies have begun using computers to harness this data, and are creating machine learning predictive software to help consumers make better decisions.
"Google parent Alphabet is a preeminent player in the machine-learning space and the fund's largest holding (combining its Class A and Class C shares). In May, the firm unveiled Google Assistant – a computerized personal assistant that will be available on Google smartphones and Google Now, the firm's smart wireless speaker. The technology stands out from competition in that it can engage in two-way conversations, using Google's natural-language processing algorithm.
"Similarly, Amazon's Alexa and IBM's Watson offer a number of assistant-like features, including the ability to provide directions, request a ride-sharing pickup, play music or order a pizza. Alexa also now has the ability to unlock home doors. Amazon was a large fund holding and a contributor this period.
"Another popular use of machine learning is in self-driving cars. One way I've invested here is through our stake in electric carmaker Tesla Motors, a contributor this period. As of October, all Tesla models have self-driving capabilities, including cameras that provide 360-degree visibility, sensors that can detect objects around the car, and radar able to see through various weather conditions and even the car ahead."



Key Takeaways



The fund's share classes advanced about 6% for the semiannual reporting period ending January 31, 2017, outpacing the 4.28% gain of the benchmark Russell 1000® Growth Index.

Investors were drawn to some of the more-economically sensitive areas favored by Portfolio Manager Sonu Kalra, particularly the semiconductors & semiconductor equipment industry, where positioning was by far the fund's biggest contributor versus the benchmark the past six months.

The fund's top-three relative contributors came from this segment: Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors and Broadcom, each of which outperformed the index. 

Conversely, the fund's largest relative detractor was an underweighting in tech giant and sizable benchmark constituent Microsoft.

Even amid a slow-growth economic environment, Sonu is bullish on select names in the information technology and consumer discretionary sectors, particularly among opportunities tied to machine learning technology.





MARKET RECAP


The U.S. equity bellwether S&P 500® index gained 5.96% for the six months ending January 31, 2017, rising sharply in the period's second half on renewed optimism for economic growth. Investors continued to exhibit "risk on" behavior amid U.S. job gains, global economic stimulus and stabilizing oil prices. The market meandered in a narrow range from August to the November 8 U.S. presidential election. Stocks then broke out in response to Donald Trump's surprise victory, surging to a series of new all-time highs on expectations for reflation and fiscal stimulus under his administration's pro-growth agenda. For the full six months, small-cap and value-oriented stocks topped their large-cap and growth counterparts, respectively. Financials (+25%) easily led the way, riding an uptick in bond yields and a strong rally in banks (+35%), especially post-election. Information technology rose about 11%, despite cooling off in the fourth quarter of 2016. Industrials (+9%), energy (+8%) and materials (+8%) also did well, the latter two driven by a cyclical rebound in commodity prices. Conversely, real estate (-9%) wilted on the prospect for rising interest rates. An improved backdrop for riskier assets curbed the dividend-rich telecom services (-5%), utilities (-4%) and consumer staples (-2%) sectors. Health care (-6%) suffered amid an uncertain political and regulatory outlook.
