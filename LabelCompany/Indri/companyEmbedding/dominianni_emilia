She took over marketing for our HBA chapter in 2011.  At the time, it was really communications vs. marketing and had only a couple volunteers.  She leveraged her professional experience and expertise in marketing to set a vision and quickly build a true strategic & tactical marketing plan.   At the same time, she formed a robust committee of volunteers to execute the plan through digital and print media, always careful to maintain focus on priorities vs. activities.  As importantly, she provided a much-needed surge of leadership into the marketing function and our board at large.  She has created the voice of our chapter that both informs and inspires our members and volunteers.  I believe her efforts have played an instrumental role in helping us retain members and corporate partners during this challenging time in the healthcare industry.See moreSee lessDeb has made a tremendous positive impact on the MidAtlantic Chapter of the Healthcare Business Woman’s Association as our volunteer Director of Marketing beginning in January 2011 and continuing through 2012. She established a vision, built a volunteer team and has never looked back! She created and continues to execute marketing plans that are building positive growth in membership and revenue for our Chapter. Deb has worked well with our Board and with corporate staff at the national level of our global association of more than 6,000 members.  She has initiated key strategic alliances and pioneered social media for our Chapter.  Recently, we posted volunteer openings for our newly formed Social Media committee and had more than 20 volunteers reach out to participate!  Deb has taken our Chapter into new channels of marketing activities and visibility including, advertising, eNewsletters, video showcases and an exhibit at our association’s national conference. She has supervised content as well as media strategically and with a drive that is generating significant results.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended DebGroupsInbound Marketers - For Marketing ProfessionalsEmployee Benefit News | Discussion GroupMobile Health AssociationMedical Marketing & Communications GroupNetwork After Work Baltimore - Business/Professional Networking EventsHarvard Business ReviewManaged Care Executives - Join 1,000s of your peersSee 7 moremHealth Journal - Mobile Health and Medical APPs, devices, software & technologyPinnacleCare: Healthcare Challenges SolvedUltra and HNW , C-Suite and Family Office Thought LeadersNetwork After Work - Business/Professional Networking Events - 1Navigating Our World NetworkMedical Device NetworkersePatient ConnectionsSee lessView Deb’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Deb directlyView Deb’s Full ProfileNot the Deb you’re looking for?
