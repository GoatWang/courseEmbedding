Personal Banking
Personal Banking Is about More than Offering Banking Products. It's about Offering Personal Service.
There's a reason we've been fulfilling the personal banking needs of the Northern Virginia area for 164 years. Well, actually, a few reasons. From the time we opened our doors back in 1852 until now, we’ve always maintained our core value of treating customers like family – with dignity, respect and warmth. Of course, service alone doesn’t keep the doors open. That's why we offer a full range of products to suit your banking needs – from everyday personal checking accounts to children’s savings accounts and retirement accounts – while offering highly competitive features, rates and rewards.

Burke & Herbert Bank
Customer Service

Most businesses that have been around as long as we have – and there are not many – tend to have a secret to their success. The way we see it, it's no secret at all. Our success is built on the pillars of customer service established by John Woolfolk Burke and Arthur Herbert: treating all of our customers with dignity, integrity and courtesy.
While times and technologies have changed, the one thing that hasn't is the way we conduct our business. While we've expanded with the region over the last 164 years, we've never rested on our laurels. Our commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Virginia has never wavered. This is why, when you call a Burke & Herbert Bank branch, you'll speak with a local, knowledgeable branch representative here in Virginia.
We believe that true customer service is something that just can’t be outsourced.

This is a great place to bank!
Some of the most wonderful staff members in this chain are at Seminary Road.
This is how a branch is run in a neighborhood setting.  Safe, Friendly, and Fun to drop by.  Keep it up!







By far the best bank I've ever banked with! Staff is super friendly, bank is right next to my house and also no atm fees! I would definitely recommend this bank to anyone that's looking to open a bank accounting.

This is a great place to bank!
Some of the most wonderful staff members in this chain are at Seminary Road.
This is how a branch is run in a neighborhood setting.  Safe, Friendly, and Fun to drop by.  Keep it up!







By far the best bank I've ever banked with! Staff is super friendly, bank is right next to my house and also no atm fees! I would definitely recommend this bank to anyone that's looking to open a bank accounting.

By far the best bank I've ever banked with! Staff is super friendly, bank is right next to my house and also no atm fees! I would definitely recommend this bank to anyone that's looking to open a bank accounting.

This is a great place to bank!
Some of the most wonderful staff members in this chain are at Seminary Road.
This is how a branch is run in a neighborhood setting.  Safe, Friendly, and Fun to drop by.  Keep it up!







By far the best bank I've ever banked with! Staff is super friendly, bank is right next to my house and also no atm fees! I would definitely recommend this bank to anyone that's looking to open a bank accounting.

By far the best bank I've ever banked with! Staff is super friendly, bank is right next to my house and also no atm fees! I would definitely recommend this bank to anyone that's looking to open a bank accounting.







This is a great place to bank!
Some of the most wonderful staff members in this chain are at Seminary Road.
This is how a branch is run in a neighborhood setting.  Safe, Friendly, and Fun to drop by.  Keep it up!

By far the best bank I've ever banked with! Staff is super friendly, bank is right next to my house and also no atm fees! I would definitely recommend this bank to anyone that's looking to open a bank accounting.







This is a great place to bank!
Some of the most wonderful staff members in this chain are at Seminary Road.
This is how a branch is run in a neighborhood setting.  Safe, Friendly, and Fun to drop by.  Keep it up!

This is a great place to bank!
Some of the most wonderful staff members in this chain are at Seminary Road.
This is how a branch is run in a neighborhood setting.  Safe, Friendly, and Fun to drop by.  Keep it up!







By far the best bank I've ever banked with! Staff is super friendly, bank is right next to my house and also no atm fees! I would definitely recommend this bank to anyone that's looking to open a bank accounting.

This is a great place to bank!

This is how a branch is run in a neighborhood setting.  Safe, Friendly, and Fun to drop by.  Keep it up!

By far the best bank I've ever banked with! Staff is super friendly, bank is right next to my house and also no atm fees! I would definitely recommend this bank to anyone that's looking to open a bank accounting.

This is a great place to bank!
Some of the most wonderful staff members in this chain are at Seminary Road.
This is how a branch is run in a neighborhood setting.  Safe, Friendly, and Fun to drop by.  Keep it up!







By far the best bank I've ever banked with! Staff is super friendly, bank is right next to my house and also no atm fees! I would definitely recommend this bank to anyone that's looking to open a bank accounting.

This is a great place to bank!
Some of the most wonderful staff members in this chain are at Seminary Road.
This is how a branch is run in a neighborhood setting.  Safe, Friendly, and Fun to drop by.  Keep it up!







By far the best bank I've ever banked with! Staff is super friendly, bank is right next to my house and also no atm fees! I would definitely recommend this bank to anyone that's looking to open a bank accounting.

                        Burke & Herbert has been my bank for going on 12 years now.  They are, simply, the best bank in the Washington DC metro area. 

Burke & Herbert is a small bank and that is its secret.  They treat their customers like human beings, not like numbers.  When you call them you don't deal with a machine, you get a real live person.  The Skyline Branch, where I opened my account originally, goes so far as to call me if there is a possibility of an overdraft, to give me the opportunity to make a deposit and prevent the overdraft.  They don't have any hidden fees and are upfront and honest about all their policies.  

One thing though -- a lot of their employees are not native English-speakers so you need to be patient with them.  Just take a little bit of time to explain everything thoroughly -- they do want to work *with* you and not against you.

I would recommend Burke & Herbert to friends, family, and anyone who wants first-rate customer service.  Burke & Herbert has been one of the highest-rated banks in Washington Consumers Checkbook for a long time and it is an honor well-deserved.  I've banked at credit unions and major financial institutions (Bank of America and Merrill Lynch) and NOTHING beats Burke & Herbert for customer service, no, make that customer care.  They really do care about their customers and it shows!
