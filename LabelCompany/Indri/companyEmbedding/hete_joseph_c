ATSG is a leading provider of air cargo transportation and related services.



			  Air Transport Services Group, Inc. is a leading provider of aircraft leasing and air cargo transportation and related services to domestic and foreign air carriers and other companies that outsource their air cargo lift requirements. ATSG, through its leasing and airline subsidiaries, is the world's largest owner and operator of converted Boeing 767 freighter aircraft. 
              Through its principal subsidiaries, including two airlines with separate and distinct U.S. FAA Part 121 Air Carrier certificates, ATSG provides aircraft leasing, air cargo lift, aircraft maintenance services and airport ground services. ATSG's subsidiaries include ABX Air, Inc.; Airborne Global Solutions, Inc.; Air Transport International, Inc.; Cargo Aircraft Management, Inc.; and Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services, Inc., including its division, PEMCO World Air Services, Inc.




MESSAGE FROM THE CEO


In 2016, ATSG achieved its best revenue growth under the  business model we adopted in 2010, and one of the best growth years in our  history. Revenues rose 24 percent, or $150 million, to $769 million as we  substantially expanded our 767 fleet and placed more of them with key global  companies. Revenue growth excluding fuel and other reimbursed expenses  increased 18 percent.            
            That growth was spread across our principal business units.  It stemmed largely from groundbreaking agreements we signed in March with our  newest customer, Amazon Fulfillment Services. Our positive outlook for 2017 and  2018 is for more growth and an even more diversified revenue base. DHL and  Amazon, our two largest customers, accounted for 34 and 29 percent, respectively,  of our revenues in 2016.
Because of our unique positioning and key investments, we  were ready when Amazon asked us to help create its own dedicated U.S. air  express network in March 2016, which called for twenty Boeing 767 freighters we  would lease to and operate for them. We supplied them with fourteen of the  twenty leases by the end of 2016 and another in early January this year; we  will complete deliveries for the remaining five by July.
In 2017, we expect to add a record eleven 767 converted  freighters to our in-service fleet. Together with two Boeing 737s we will  acquire, convert and lease to our joint-venture partner in China, we expect to  have seventythree owned aircraft in service by year-end, of which fifty-four  will be dry leased under multi-year terms.
Our Amazon agreements also included our commitment to issue  them warrants for up to 19.9 percent of our common shares by September 2020 at  an exercise price of $9.73 per share. We issued warrants for nearly 9 million  shares in 2016, and will issue warrants for another 3.8 million shares this  year. None have been exercised to date. But over time, Generally Accepted  Accounting Principles (GAAP) require us to reflect their value in our financial  statements and their potential issuance in our diluted share counts.
These warrant effects, which are non-cash, mask a significant  portion of our operating earnings and cash generating strength. Consolidated  net earnings from continuing operations in 2016 were $21.1 million, or 33 cents  per share diluted, which were lower than in 2015. Those 2016 earnings, however,  included a combined $16.5 million, or 25 cents per share in non-cash after-tax reductions  for revaluations and lease incentive amortization related to the Amazon  warrants. We expect those effects to have a significant but unpredictable impact  on our GAAP earnings until the warrants expire or are exercised, because  changes in our stock price account for a large portion of the warrant value  variance. In our earnings releases and investor presentations, available on our  website, atsginc.com, we will continue to provide adjusted non-GAAP results  that exclude the warrant effects and other non-cash or non-recurring items,  following our GAAP financials.
Other one-time or limited-term items affected 2016 results.  They included $7 million, or seven cents per share in forfeited revenue related  to a two-day walkout last November by pilots at our ABX Air subsidiary. Premium  pay for our pilot workforce was significant in the second half, as it took  longer than planned to hire, train and place the additional pilots that ABX Air  added for the Amazon agreements.
Nearly all of that additional 2016 expense and lost revenue  was captured in our ACMI Services segment results, which includes our airlines.  That segment loss was $32 million pretax. Most of that loss was for items we do  not expect to recur or will be substantially lower in 2017. For example, we  expect normalized crew costs after the first quarter as we reach our pilot  staffing targets. Also, pension and other post-retirement expenses will be  lower this year. As a result, we are cautiously optimistic about a profitable  2017 in ACMI Services.
The outlook is very bright for CAM, our aircraft leasing subsidiary,  as revenues rose $22 million to nearly $200 million, and pretax earnings rose  $11 million to $69 million. CAM completed eighteen new 767 dry leases in all  last year, including aircraft returned from other lessees. Forty-one of CAM’s  fifty-two 767s were externally dry-leased for multi-year terms at the end of  2016. Ten 767s were in ACMI service with long-time customers at year-end,  including some awaiting delivery of a 767-300 when more become available later  this year.
CAM also received orders for 767s from customers besides  Amazon last year. That meant they were very active scouting out good freighter  feedstock prospects and booking conversion slots before prices adjusted to additional  market demand. The freighter feedstock CAM has purchased and is converting is  already spoken for. We will buy more in 2017 and expect to end the year with fifty-two  of the 767s CAM has in service under external dry leases and six others  undergoing cargo modification for anticipated 2018 deployments.
As we expand our fleet, however, we remain prudent investors  of your capital. We will invest only in response to specific demand from  companies with strong track records of their own. Some of this demand is from customers  that would have already leased a converted 767-300 from us if we had one  available today. Amazon’s huge appetite for 767s has filled the available  conversion slots into 2018 and made them hard to find from any source. Due to  our experience and relationships in the midsize aircraft conversion market,  however, we can still secure high quality feedstock and conversion slots  without compromising our returns on invested capital.
The businesses we collectively refer to as Other  Activities contributed a large portion of our 2016 revenue gain. Their revenues  were up more than $100 million from 2015 to $263 million. Pretax earnings from  Other Activities increased by $8 million to $17 million for the year.



Our aircraft maintenance business, AMES, is now substantially  larger with the addition of PEMCO World Air Services as a division. PEMCO’s  conversion resources are focused on the 737 freighter market in China, where narrow-body  freighters are still the preferred option for domestic air cargo networks.
PEMCO-converted aircraft make up more than 70 percent of  China-based Boeing 737-300 and -400 fleets in service. The company has  redelivered over fifty converted 737s to operators there since 2006, and  received orders for three more in February. PEMCO will also convert two more  737s that CAM will acquire and lease to Okay Airways, CAM’s first of that type.  China-based Okay will put them in its own fleet under customer contract pending  transfer to a new cargo airline that we and other partners will own.
PEMCO’s heavy maintenance capabilities and hangar space in  Tampa are good complements for those at AMES in Wilmington. They hold  certificates for maintenance of both Boeing and Airbus types, and we expect to  use their facilities to handle a sizeable share of our own expanding heavy  maintenance requirements. We expect a significant positive contribution to our  earnings from PEMCO this year.
LGSTX Services, our materials handling, sorting and ground  support business, expanded in 2016 as it added cargo handling and refueling for  Amazon in Wilmington. In 2017, Amazon will shift its main hub to new facilities  at the Cincinnati regional airport in Kentucky, with some corresponding impact  on LGSTX. A portion of that reduction at LGSTX will be replaced by results from  PEMCO on our Other Activities line.
Taken together, these strong businesses and initiatives indicate  a company with excellent growth potential backed by long-term agreements with  customers. Maintaining that growth will require significant added capital  investment this year, which we currently estimate will be about $355 million in  total, and $285 million for growth. In addition to our strong cash flow, we  will draw more from our revolving credit facility, which was expanded in 2016  and will expand again in 2017. It will add credit capacity and some additional  flexibility, but we expect no change in our rate structure.
Even with additional borrowings, we expect our financial  position to remain conservatively levered, with a debt ratio below three times  EBITDA throughout 2017. Assuming a smaller fleet growth program in 2018, we anticipate  more flexibility for allocating our increasing cash flow.



In addition to our capital spending and PEMCO purchase, we  also spent $64 million last year to repurchase 4.8 million ATSG shares,  including the 3.8 million shares purchased from an affiliate of Red Mountain  Capital, our largest shareholder, in July. The Board of Directors increased our  share repurchase authorization last May from $50 million to $100 million, and  $25 million of that authorization remains. Our demand-driven fleet expansion  will still permit us to allocate cash at our disposal prudently among  investments, share buybacks and debt repayment.
Our growth phase is in its early stages, and potential lease  customers are still calling us about their long-range needs. Keep in mind that  in 2016, many of the leases CAM added were for our 767-200s. In 2017, all of  the 767s we lease will be for larger 767-300s, with longer terms and higher  monthly rates. Assuming interim extensions or replacements of expiring leases,  it’s not hard to envision continued growth with solid margins into the next  decade.
Our growth also speaks volumes about the talent and efforts  of the employees of our ATSG businesses, and the commitment of your management  team and Board of Directors to translate their efforts into stronger returns for  you, the shareholders. Those of you who have supported our efforts over time  have been well rewarded. Over the last one-, three- and five-year periods  through 2016, our stock price increased at more than twice the rate of the  major stock-market indexes and most of our peers, and remains on track so far  in 2017.
Our task is to keep the momentum going, and  execute our plans with the highest regard for the interests of all who invest  with us.

MESSAGE FROM THE CEO


In 2016, ATSG achieved its best revenue growth under the  business model we adopted in 2010, and one of the best growth years in our  history. Revenues rose 24 percent, or $150 million, to $769 million as we  substantially expanded our 767 fleet and placed more of them with key global  companies. Revenue growth excluding fuel and other reimbursed expenses  increased 18 percent.            
            That growth was spread across our principal business units.  It stemmed largely from groundbreaking agreements we signed in March with our  newest customer, Amazon Fulfillment Services. Our positive outlook for 2017 and  2018 is for more growth and an even more diversified revenue base. DHL and  Amazon, our two largest customers, accounted for 34 and 29 percent, respectively,  of our revenues in 2016.
Because of our unique positioning and key investments, we  were ready when Amazon asked us to help create its own dedicated U.S. air  express network in March 2016, which called for twenty Boeing 767 freighters we  would lease to and operate for them. We supplied them with fourteen of the  twenty leases by the end of 2016 and another in early January this year; we  will complete deliveries for the remaining five by July.
In 2017, we expect to add a record eleven 767 converted  freighters to our in-service fleet. Together with two Boeing 737s we will  acquire, convert and lease to our joint-venture partner in China, we expect to  have seventythree owned aircraft in service by year-end, of which fifty-four  will be dry leased under multi-year terms.
Our Amazon agreements also included our commitment to issue  them warrants for up to 19.9 percent of our common shares by September 2020 at  an exercise price of $9.73 per share. We issued warrants for nearly 9 million  shares in 2016, and will issue warrants for another 3.8 million shares this  year. None have been exercised to date. But over time, Generally Accepted  Accounting Principles (GAAP) require us to reflect their value in our financial  statements and their potential issuance in our diluted share counts.
These warrant effects, which are non-cash, mask a significant  portion of our operating earnings and cash generating strength. Consolidated  net earnings from continuing operations in 2016 were $21.1 million, or 33 cents  per share diluted, which were lower than in 2015. Those 2016 earnings, however,  included a combined $16.5 million, or 25 cents per share in non-cash after-tax reductions  for revaluations and lease incentive amortization related to the Amazon  warrants. We expect those effects to have a significant but unpredictable impact  on our GAAP earnings until the warrants expire or are exercised, because  changes in our stock price account for a large portion of the warrant value  variance. In our earnings releases and investor presentations, available on our  website, atsginc.com, we will continue to provide adjusted non-GAAP results  that exclude the warrant effects and other non-cash or non-recurring items,  following our GAAP financials.
Other one-time or limited-term items affected 2016 results.  They included $7 million, or seven cents per share in forfeited revenue related  to a two-day walkout last November by pilots at our ABX Air subsidiary. Premium  pay for our pilot workforce was significant in the second half, as it took  longer than planned to hire, train and place the additional pilots that ABX Air  added for the Amazon agreements.
Nearly all of that additional 2016 expense and lost revenue  was captured in our ACMI Services segment results, which includes our airlines.  That segment loss was $32 million pretax. Most of that loss was for items we do  not expect to recur or will be substantially lower in 2017. For example, we  expect normalized crew costs after the first quarter as we reach our pilot  staffing targets. Also, pension and other post-retirement expenses will be  lower this year. As a result, we are cautiously optimistic about a profitable  2017 in ACMI Services.
The outlook is very bright for CAM, our aircraft leasing subsidiary,  as revenues rose $22 million to nearly $200 million, and pretax earnings rose  $11 million to $69 million. CAM completed eighteen new 767 dry leases in all  last year, including aircraft returned from other lessees. Forty-one of CAM’s  fifty-two 767s were externally dry-leased for multi-year terms at the end of  2016. Ten 767s were in ACMI service with long-time customers at year-end,  including some awaiting delivery of a 767-300 when more become available later  this year.
CAM also received orders for 767s from customers besides  Amazon last year. That meant they were very active scouting out good freighter  feedstock prospects and booking conversion slots before prices adjusted to additional  market demand. The freighter feedstock CAM has purchased and is converting is  already spoken for. We will buy more in 2017 and expect to end the year with fifty-two  of the 767s CAM has in service under external dry leases and six others  undergoing cargo modification for anticipated 2018 deployments.
As we expand our fleet, however, we remain prudent investors  of your capital. We will invest only in response to specific demand from  companies with strong track records of their own. Some of this demand is from customers  that would have already leased a converted 767-300 from us if we had one  available today. Amazon’s huge appetite for 767s has filled the available  conversion slots into 2018 and made them hard to find from any source. Due to  our experience and relationships in the midsize aircraft conversion market,  however, we can still secure high quality feedstock and conversion slots  without compromising our returns on invested capital.
The businesses we collectively refer to as Other  Activities contributed a large portion of our 2016 revenue gain. Their revenues  were up more than $100 million from 2015 to $263 million. Pretax earnings from  Other Activities increased by $8 million to $17 million for the year.



Our aircraft maintenance business, AMES, is now substantially  larger with the addition of PEMCO World Air Services as a division. PEMCO’s  conversion resources are focused on the 737 freighter market in China, where narrow-body  freighters are still the preferred option for domestic air cargo networks.
PEMCO-converted aircraft make up more than 70 percent of  China-based Boeing 737-300 and -400 fleets in service. The company has  redelivered over fifty converted 737s to operators there since 2006, and  received orders for three more in February. PEMCO will also convert two more  737s that CAM will acquire and lease to Okay Airways, CAM’s first of that type.  China-based Okay will put them in its own fleet under customer contract pending  transfer to a new cargo airline that we and other partners will own.
PEMCO’s heavy maintenance capabilities and hangar space in  Tampa are good complements for those at AMES in Wilmington. They hold  certificates for maintenance of both Boeing and Airbus types, and we expect to  use their facilities to handle a sizeable share of our own expanding heavy  maintenance requirements. We expect a significant positive contribution to our  earnings from PEMCO this year.
LGSTX Services, our materials handling, sorting and ground  support business, expanded in 2016 as it added cargo handling and refueling for  Amazon in Wilmington. In 2017, Amazon will shift its main hub to new facilities  at the Cincinnati regional airport in Kentucky, with some corresponding impact  on LGSTX. A portion of that reduction at LGSTX will be replaced by results from  PEMCO on our Other Activities line.
Taken together, these strong businesses and initiatives indicate  a company with excellent growth potential backed by long-term agreements with  customers. Maintaining that growth will require significant added capital  investment this year, which we currently estimate will be about $355 million in  total, and $285 million for growth. In addition to our strong cash flow, we  will draw more from our revolving credit facility, which was expanded in 2016  and will expand again in 2017. It will add credit capacity and some additional  flexibility, but we expect no change in our rate structure.
Even with additional borrowings, we expect our financial  position to remain conservatively levered, with a debt ratio below three times  EBITDA throughout 2017. Assuming a smaller fleet growth program in 2018, we anticipate  more flexibility for allocating our increasing cash flow.



In addition to our capital spending and PEMCO purchase, we  also spent $64 million last year to repurchase 4.8 million ATSG shares,  including the 3.8 million shares purchased from an affiliate of Red Mountain  Capital, our largest shareholder, in July. The Board of Directors increased our  share repurchase authorization last May from $50 million to $100 million, and  $25 million of that authorization remains. Our demand-driven fleet expansion  will still permit us to allocate cash at our disposal prudently among  investments, share buybacks and debt repayment.
Our growth phase is in its early stages, and potential lease  customers are still calling us about their long-range needs. Keep in mind that  in 2016, many of the leases CAM added were for our 767-200s. In 2017, all of  the 767s we lease will be for larger 767-300s, with longer terms and higher  monthly rates. Assuming interim extensions or replacements of expiring leases,  it’s not hard to envision continued growth with solid margins into the next  decade.
Our growth also speaks volumes about the talent and efforts  of the employees of our ATSG businesses, and the commitment of your management  team and Board of Directors to translate their efforts into stronger returns for  you, the shareholders. Those of you who have supported our efforts over time  have been well rewarded. Over the last one-, three- and five-year periods  through 2016, our stock price increased at more than twice the rate of the  major stock-market indexes and most of our peers, and remains on track so far  in 2017.
Our task is to keep the momentum going, and  execute our plans with the highest regard for the interests of all who invest  with us.

Title: Managing Director
               Company: ABX Air, Inc.
Job Details
               Formed in 1980, ABX Air grew rapidly to become part of the third largest air express company in the U. S. A subsidiary of Airborne Express, the airline flew all the freight for them as well as managed the process of sorting millions of pieces of freight each day. Because it operated out of the only privately owned air cargo airport in the world, ABX Air also maintained the airport and developed a state-of-the-art aircraft maintenance operation. Diversifying and taking advantage of skills developed over the decades, ABX Air now provides contract service for many customers in several capacities. Sticking to its core skill, ABX Air flies express cargo routes for DHL USA. Aircraft not deployed in the service of DHL are working for a myriad of customers throughout the world. ABX Air flies charter routes for customers out of bases in Cincinnati, Ohio and Miami, Florida. Keeping an airline flying and the airport open and operational in any weather is a tall task. ABX Air has an experienced and dedicated workforce that allows it to excel at keeping it commitments to customers.
