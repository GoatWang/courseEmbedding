We are an ophthalmic medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of breakthrough products and procedures designed to transform the treatment of glaucoma, one of the world’s leading causes of blindness. We have pioneered Micro-Invasive Glaucoma Surgery, or MIGS, to revolutionize the traditional glaucoma treatment and management paradigm. We launched the iStent®, our first MIGS device, in the United States in July 2012 and we are leveraging our platform technology to build a comprehensive and proprietary portfolio of micro-scale injectable therapies designed to address the complete range of glaucoma disease states and progression. We believe the iStent® is the smallest medical device ever approved by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, measuring 1.0 mm long and 0.33 mm wide.

MRI Safety Information
Non-clinical testing has demonstrated that the iStent Trabecular Micro-Bypass Stent (Models GTS100R and GTS100L) is MR Conditional. A patient with this device can be safely scanned in an MR system meeting the following conditions:

Static magnetic field of 3T or less
Maximum spatial gradient magnetic field of 4,000 gauss/cm (40 T/m)
Maximum MR system reported, whole body averaged specific absorption rate (SAR) of 4 W/kg (First Level Controlled Operating Mode)

Under the scan conditions defined above, the iStent Trabecular Micro-Bypass Stent (Models GTS100R and GTS100L) is not expected to produce a clinically significant temperature rise after 15 minutes of continuous scanning.
In non-clinical testing, the image artifact caused by the device extends less than 15 mm from the device when imaged with a gradient echo pulse sequence and a 3.0 T MRI system.

Clinical Data on iStent Surgery | Glaukos






































































Toggle navigation





Glaukos






















 




Clinical Data



iStent® Clinical Data
Recent randomized controlled trials and case studies have shown that iStent® is a procedure with limited complications and an excellent safety profile. A recent independent international clinical study, published by the Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery, shows that iStent® provided a 36% reduction in IOP and an 86% reduction in the number of glaucoma medications three years following surgery.
Reduced Intraocular Pressure (IOP)
The U.S. IDE pivotal study for iStent® conducted by Glaukos and reviewed by the FDA was the first prospective, randomized U.S. IDE trial for a glaucoma device. This groundbreaking study showed that 68% of subjects in the iStent® treatment group (combined cataract and iStent® implantation) met the primary endpoint of IOP ≤ 21 mm Hg with no medications at 12 months, compared to only 50% of subjects in the cataract surgery group only. This difference is statistically (p = .004) and clinically significant.


In a second, independent, 36-month study, 79% of patients who received iStent® during a cataract procedure sustained target IOPs of ≤ 21 mm Hg.


 
Important Safety Information »
Reduction in Glaucoma Medication
The IDE pivotal trial additionally showed 64% of patients who received iStent® remained medication free while sustaining a mean IOP reduction of 20% versus only 47% who underwent cataract surgery alone (p = .010).


In the independent, 36-month study noted previously, 74% of patients who received iStent® during a cataract procedure were able to stop taking their glaucoma medication after surgery.


 
Important Safety Information »
Safety
For patients with combined cataract and open-angle glaucoma, iStent® can reduce IOP, while maintaining an excellent safety profile. The U.S. IDE pivotal study showed:



Adverse Events
Cataract Surgery with iStent®
N=116 n (%)
Cataract Surgery Only
N=117 n (%)


Early postop corneal edema
9 (8%)
11 (9%)


Any BCVA loss of at least 1 line at or after the 3 month visit
8 (7%)
12 (10%)


Posterior capsular opacification
7 (6%)
12 (10%)


Stent obstruction
5 (4%)
0 (0%)


Blurry vision or visual disturbance
4 (3%)
8 (7%)


Elevated IOP
4 (3%)
5 (4%)



The iStent® procedure spares conjunctival tissue and preserves the potential for future treatment options. Additionally, there is minimal risk of hypotony with implantation of iStent® because the trabecular meshwork is preserved, ensuring a natural episcleral back-pressure of 8 to 11 mm Hg.

About Us



Mission Statement
Our mission is to pioneer and lead the global glaucoma market with micro-scale injectable therapies that advance the existing glaucoma standard-of-care and enrich the lives and treatment alternatives for glaucoma patients worldwide.
Corporate Overview
Glaukos Corporation is an ophthalmic medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of breakthrough products and procedures designed to transform the treatment of glaucoma, one of the world’s leading causes of blindness. We have pioneered Micro-Invasive Glaucoma Surgery, or MIGS, in order to revolutionize the traditional glaucoma treatment and management paradigm.
We launched the iStent®, our first MIGS device, in the United States in 2012. We are leveraging our platform technology to build a comprehensive and proprietary portfolio of injectable micro-scale therapies designed to address the complete range of glaucoma disease states and progression. We believe the iStent® is the smallest medical device ever approved by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, measuring 1.0 mm long and 0.33 mm wide.
In June 2015, we completed an initial public offering and our shares are now traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “GKOS”. The company was founded in 1998 and is based in San Clemente, California.
