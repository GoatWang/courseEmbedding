Q1: How can I use my cellular phone in North America?


A1: Chunghwa Telecom provides two service solutions for roaming in North America:1. Handset Exchange: All CHT mobile customers are eligible to trade their handset for an AMPS system phone, allowing roaming in over 7,000 cities across North America.2. GSM1900 Automatic Roaming: All CHT mobile customers who have a tri-band or GSM1900 mobile phone can automatically use their phone in over 4,000 cities across North America via the GSM system.



Q2: How do you charge for the Handset Exchange service?


A2: In addition to standard cellular connection charges (US$0.79/minute, minimum 1 minute), domestic and international long-distance charges will accrue based on distance, plus US taxes and a 10% service charge from CHT.



Q3: What is the Japan Handset Exchange service?


A3: For CHT customers traveling to Japan, CHT has established a special partnership with Japan’s largest mobile operator. Using the same phone number, you can exchange your handset for a PDC handset from CHT and enjoy international roaming from nearly everywhere in Japan (98% of the country).



Q4: Prepaid Cards


A4: 1. Ideal CardComes with a mobile phone number. Face value NT$1,000 includes NT$300 connection credit. Valid for 180 days.

Q5: What is International Roaming Service?


A5: International Roaming is a service whereby mobile phone customers can use their CHT mobile phone when traveling overseas. International Roaming can be divided into automatic roaming and non-automatic roaming. Customers who apply for automatic international roaming can connect from overseas using their own mobile phone and their own phone number. Non-automatic roaming means that you have to either change to a new number or switch to another handset to connect from abroad.



Q6: Can foreigners in Taiwan apply for mobile phones?


A6: Foreigners in Taiwan need to have either an Alien Residence Certificate (ARC) or proof of employment from a domestic company to apply for a mobile phone. Foreigners in Taiwan for a short-term stay may not apply for a mobile phone.



Q7: What is mobile short messaging service?


A7: Short messaging service is used to transmit and receive short text messages using CHT’s digital cellular network.



Q8: How do I make or receive calls from abroad using international roaming?


A8: To make calls: use the local calling method. To receive calls: If using your original mobile phone, callers from Taiwan simply call the same number they would call if you were in Taiwan. If using a different number, callers in Taiwan must dial the international access code + country code + the new roaming number to reach you.



Q9: What happens if I lose my phone when using international roaming hand-set exchange services in the US or Japan?


A9: Please call the CHT international roaming hotline to cancel your account. Because US and Japanese authorities will have been notified that your account has been cancelled, you will not be able to have your phone service reactivated after it has been cancelled.



Q10: What is mobile party line?


A10: GSM mobile phone users can automatically connect with multiple parties at once. This service requires no application and no additional charges are added.



Q11: What is mobile call waiting?

Q12: What is mobile call forwarding?


A12: Mobile customers with numbers beginning with 090 and 091 can set up a number for unanswered calls (rings for more than 20 seconds) to be forwarded to another cell phone or home phone number. This service is free of monthly charges.



Q13: What is mobile voice mail?


A13: When the phone is busy, unanswered or the phone is turned off, voice mail service can forward incoming calls to a voice mailbox system so that you do not miss important calls.

History[edit]
Chunghwa Telecom was founded as a company on June 15, 1996 as part of the Taiwan government's privatisation efforts. Prior to this, it operated as a business unit of the Directorate General of Telecommunications (zh:交通部電信總局) for over 100 years. The company’s common shares have been listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange under the number “2412” since October 2000, and its ADSs have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CHT” since July 2003. In August 2005, Chunghwa Telecom became a privatised company, as the Taiwan government’s ownership was reduced to less than 50%.
The Directorate General of Telecommunications once exercised a monopoly on the telecommunications market in Taiwan. To make the telecommunications industry more competitive and improve service quality, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications began to promote "telecommunications liberalisation" policy from the late 1980s, in which the telecom industry will gradually be opened to private industry operations. The liberalisation of telecommunications as well as the management and operation of telecommunications business as mentioned in the plan aimed to achieve "separation between government and enterprises".
On July 1, 1996, the "Chunghwa Telecom Ordinance" was enacted under an amendment of the "Telecommunications Act", which formally established Chunghwa Telecom Co. Ltd. with a capital of NT$ 96.477 billion yuan, operating first class and second class telecom services, under the "Taiwan Northern Telecom Branch", "Central Taiwan telecommunications branch", "Southern Taiwan telecommunications branch"," long-distance and mobile communications branch", "International Telecommunication Branch", "Data Communications Branch", "Telecommunications Research Institute" and "Telecommunications Training Institute".
In 1997, Chunghwa Telecom was awarded the license to operate a second-generation mobile communications (2G) network (GSM 900MHz and 1800MHz).
In October 2000, Chunghwa Telecom was listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "2412." In July 2003, Chunghwa Telecom was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "CHT." August 12, 2005, the Government of China Telecom's stake to 50%, and officially became a private company.
In February 2002, Chunghwa Telecom was awarded the license to operate a third-generation mobile communications (3G) network (WCDMA 2100MHz).
In 2007, Chunghwa Telecom acquired Senao International, and Senao becomes the exclusive sales agent of Chunghwa Telecom mobile phones.
On May 1, 2007, Chunghwa Telecom set up a division for enterprise customers, incorporated in the Southern Taiwan telecommunications branch.
On October 30, 2013, Chunghwa Telecom acquired in an auction for NT$ 39.075 billion a spectrum of LTE bands (900MHz B2 / 1800MHz C2 / C5), with a bandwidth limit of 2x35MHz, as well as C5-band (1800MHz).
On May 29, 2014, Chunghwa Telecom held a press conference to announce the start of LTE services on May 30, 2014, and this made Chunghwa Telecom the first telco in Taiwan to provide LTE services.
Services[edit]
Chunghwa Telecom is the largest telecommunication service provider in Taiwan and one of the largest in Asia in terms of revenue. In terms of both revenue and customers, Chunghwa is Taiwan’s largest provider of fixed line services, mobile services, broadband access service, and Internet service. The company also provides information and communication technology services to corporate customers.
HiNet has been heavily criticised for being a haven for senders of email spam, which has resulted in many Internet service providers routinely blocking e-mails originating from the service.[3][4][5]
Subsidiaries[edit]
Senao International, a cellular phone distributor from which Senao Networks, manufacturer of data networking products and wireless telephones under the EnGenius and Senao brands was spun off.[6]

History[edit]
Chunghwa Telecom was founded as a company on June 15, 1996 as part of the Taiwan government's privatisation efforts. Prior to this, it operated as a business unit of the Directorate General of Telecommunications (zh:交通部電信總局) for over 100 years. The company’s common shares have been listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange under the number “2412” since October 2000, and its ADSs have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CHT” since July 2003. In August 2005, Chunghwa Telecom became a privatised company, as the Taiwan government’s ownership was reduced to less than 50%.
The Directorate General of Telecommunications once exercised a monopoly on the telecommunications market in Taiwan. To make the telecommunications industry more competitive and improve service quality, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications began to promote "telecommunications liberalisation" policy from the late 1980s, in which the telecom industry will gradually be opened to private industry operations. The liberalisation of telecommunications as well as the management and operation of telecommunications business as mentioned in the plan aimed to achieve "separation between government and enterprises".
On July 1, 1996, the "Chunghwa Telecom Ordinance" was enacted under an amendment of the "Telecommunications Act", which formally established Chunghwa Telecom Co. Ltd. with a capital of NT$ 96.477 billion yuan, operating first class and second class telecom services, under the "Taiwan Northern Telecom Branch", "Central Taiwan telecommunications branch", "Southern Taiwan telecommunications branch"," long-distance and mobile communications branch", "International Telecommunication Branch", "Data Communications Branch", "Telecommunications Research Institute" and "Telecommunications Training Institute".
In 1997, Chunghwa Telecom was awarded the license to operate a second-generation mobile communications (2G) network (GSM 900MHz and 1800MHz).
In October 2000, Chunghwa Telecom was listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "2412." In July 2003, Chunghwa Telecom was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "CHT." August 12, 2005, the Government of China Telecom's stake to 50%, and officially became a private company.
In February 2002, Chunghwa Telecom was awarded the license to operate a third-generation mobile communications (3G) network (WCDMA 2100MHz).
In 2007, Chunghwa Telecom acquired Senao International, and Senao becomes the exclusive sales agent of Chunghwa Telecom mobile phones.
On May 1, 2007, Chunghwa Telecom set up a division for enterprise customers, incorporated in the Southern Taiwan telecommunications branch.
On October 30, 2013, Chunghwa Telecom acquired in an auction for NT$ 39.075 billion a spectrum of LTE bands (900MHz B2 / 1800MHz C2 / C5), with a bandwidth limit of 2x35MHz, as well as C5-band (1800MHz).
On May 29, 2014, Chunghwa Telecom held a press conference to announce the start of LTE services on May 30, 2014, and this made Chunghwa Telecom the first telco in Taiwan to provide LTE services.
Services[edit]
Chunghwa Telecom is the largest telecommunication service provider in Taiwan and one of the largest in Asia in terms of revenue. In terms of both revenue and customers, Chunghwa is Taiwan’s largest provider of fixed line services, mobile services, broadband access service, and Internet service. The company also provides information and communication technology services to corporate customers.
HiNet has been heavily criticised for being a haven for senders of email spam, which has resulted in many Internet service providers routinely blocking e-mails originating from the service.[3][4][5]
Subsidiaries[edit]
Senao International, a cellular phone distributor from which Senao Networks, manufacturer of data networking products and wireless telephones under the EnGenius and Senao brands was spun off.[6]

History[edit]
Chunghwa Telecom was founded as a company on June 15, 1996 as part of the Taiwan government's privatisation efforts. Prior to this, it operated as a business unit of the Directorate General of Telecommunications (zh:交通部電信總局) for over 100 years. The company’s common shares have been listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange under the number “2412” since October 2000, and its ADSs have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CHT” since July 2003. In August 2005, Chunghwa Telecom became a privatised company, as the Taiwan government’s ownership was reduced to less than 50%.
The Directorate General of Telecommunications once exercised a monopoly on the telecommunications market in Taiwan. To make the telecommunications industry more competitive and improve service quality, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications began to promote "telecommunications liberalisation" policy from the late 1980s, in which the telecom industry will gradually be opened to private industry operations. The liberalisation of telecommunications as well as the management and operation of telecommunications business as mentioned in the plan aimed to achieve "separation between government and enterprises".
On July 1, 1996, the "Chunghwa Telecom Ordinance" was enacted under an amendment of the "Telecommunications Act", which formally established Chunghwa Telecom Co. Ltd. with a capital of NT$ 96.477 billion yuan, operating first class and second class telecom services, under the "Taiwan Northern Telecom Branch", "Central Taiwan telecommunications branch", "Southern Taiwan telecommunications branch"," long-distance and mobile communications branch", "International Telecommunication Branch", "Data Communications Branch", "Telecommunications Research Institute" and "Telecommunications Training Institute".
In 1997, Chunghwa Telecom was awarded the license to operate a second-generation mobile communications (2G) network (GSM 900MHz and 1800MHz).
In October 2000, Chunghwa Telecom was listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "2412." In July 2003, Chunghwa Telecom was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "CHT." August 12, 2005, the Government of China Telecom's stake to 50%, and officially became a private company.
In February 2002, Chunghwa Telecom was awarded the license to operate a third-generation mobile communications (3G) network (WCDMA 2100MHz).
In 2007, Chunghwa Telecom acquired Senao International, and Senao becomes the exclusive sales agent of Chunghwa Telecom mobile phones.
On May 1, 2007, Chunghwa Telecom set up a division for enterprise customers, incorporated in the Southern Taiwan telecommunications branch.
On October 30, 2013, Chunghwa Telecom acquired in an auction for NT$ 39.075 billion a spectrum of LTE bands (900MHz B2 / 1800MHz C2 / C5), with a bandwidth limit of 2x35MHz, as well as C5-band (1800MHz).
On May 29, 2014, Chunghwa Telecom held a press conference to announce the start of LTE services on May 30, 2014, and this made Chunghwa Telecom the first telco in Taiwan to provide LTE services.
Services[edit]
Chunghwa Telecom is the largest telecommunication service provider in Taiwan and one of the largest in Asia in terms of revenue. In terms of both revenue and customers, Chunghwa is Taiwan’s largest provider of fixed line services, mobile services, broadband access service, and Internet service. The company also provides information and communication technology services to corporate customers.
HiNet has been heavily criticised for being a haven for senders of email spam, which has resulted in many Internet service providers routinely blocking e-mails originating from the service.[3][4][5]
Subsidiaries[edit]
Senao International, a cellular phone distributor from which Senao Networks, manufacturer of data networking products and wireless telephones under the EnGenius and Senao brands was spun off.[6]

Taiwanese mobile network operator (MNO) Chunghwa Telecom has unveiled plans to increase the number of 4G base stations it has in operation by 40% this year, while it is also aiming to increase downlink speeds, according to the Taipei Times.
The announcement of its plans comes as Chunghwa has boosted the amount of spectrum it has for 4G use; following last month’s switch-off of 2G services offered over the 1800MHz band, it will now use those frequencies to provide LTE-based connectivity. Armed with the additional spectrum, and in order to enhance the speeds available to consumers, Chunghwa is said to be planning the deployment of four-band carrier aggregation (4C) at the end of this month, boosting downlink speeds to up to 500Mbps, with coverage initially of urban and commercial areas of Greater Taipei, as well as some of the northern Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp (HSRC) stations. Looking ahead, the MNO hopes to have extended 4C to all metropolitan areas and 20 more commercial areas throughout the nation, as well as all twelve HSRC stations across the country.(c)  2002-2017 PriMetrica, Inc.

 In late November 2000, Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd., the once-monopolized telecom operator owned by the Taiwanese government, was on its way to privatization. Mr. C.K. Mao, Chairman of the company, who headed the job only three months earlier, after its prior chairman resigned unexpectedly in the midst of chaos brought by the resistance of its staff who feared losing their civil servant status after privatization. Also facing Mao was the forthcoming deregulation of the telecommunication industry on the island which would bring about new competitors on fixed line services, in addition to the already competitive mobile communication segment where the company's once dominant market share was heavily eroded. Mao had to decide on the pricing strategies for the company's various product lines, including fixed line, mobile services, as well as data communication. He also needed to ponder on how to revise the company's compensation system to better motivate its staff in a deregulated market and communicate all these changes to the unionized labor force.

History[edit]
Chunghwa Telecom was founded as a company on June 15, 1996 as part of the Taiwan government's privatisation efforts. Prior to this, it operated as a business unit of the Directorate General of Telecommunications (zh:交通部電信總局) for over 100 years. The company’s common shares have been listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange under the number “2412” since October 2000, and its ADSs have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CHT” since July 2003. In August 2005, Chunghwa Telecom became a privatised company, as the Taiwan government’s ownership was reduced to less than 50%.
The Directorate General of Telecommunications once exercised a monopoly on the telecommunications market in Taiwan. To make the telecommunications industry more competitive and improve service quality, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications began to promote "telecommunications liberalisation" policy from the late 1980s, in which the telecom industry will gradually be opened to private industry operations. The liberalisation of telecommunications as well as the management and operation of telecommunications business as mentioned in the plan aimed to achieve "separation between government and enterprises".
On July 1, 1996, the "Chunghwa Telecom Ordinance" was enacted under an amendment of the "Telecommunications Act", which formally established Chunghwa Telecom Co. Ltd. with a capital of NT$ 96.477 billion yuan, operating first class and second class telecom services, under the "Taiwan Northern Telecom Branch", "Central Taiwan telecommunications branch", "Southern Taiwan telecommunications branch"," long-distance and mobile communications branch", "International Telecommunication Branch", "Data Communications Branch", "Telecommunications Research Institute" and "Telecommunications Training Institute".
In 1997, Chunghwa Telecom was awarded the license to operate a second-generation mobile communications (2G) network (GSM 900MHz and 1800MHz).
In October 2000, Chunghwa Telecom was listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "2412." In July 2003, Chunghwa Telecom was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "CHT." August 12, 2005, the Government of China Telecom's stake to 50%, and officially became a private company.
In February 2002, Chunghwa Telecom was awarded the license to operate a third-generation mobile communications (3G) network (WCDMA 2100MHz).
In 2007, Chunghwa Telecom acquired Senao International, and Senao becomes the exclusive sales agent of Chunghwa Telecom mobile phones.
On May 1, 2007, Chunghwa Telecom set up a division for enterprise customers, incorporated in the Southern Taiwan telecommunications branch.
On October 30, 2013, Chunghwa Telecom acquired in an auction for NT$ 39.075 billion a spectrum of LTE bands (900MHz B2 / 1800MHz C2 / C5), with a bandwidth limit of 2x35MHz, as well as C5-band (1800MHz).
On May 29, 2014, Chunghwa Telecom held a press conference to announce the start of LTE services on May 30, 2014, and this made Chunghwa Telecom the first telco in Taiwan to provide LTE services.
Services[edit]
Chunghwa Telecom is the largest telecommunication service provider in Taiwan and one of the largest in Asia in terms of revenue. In terms of both revenue and customers, Chunghwa is Taiwan’s largest provider of fixed line services, mobile services, broadband access service, and Internet service. The company also provides information and communication technology services to corporate customers.
HiNet has been heavily criticised for being a haven for senders of email spam, which has resulted in many Internet service providers routinely blocking e-mails originating from the service.[3][4][5]
Subsidiaries[edit]
Senao International, a cellular phone distributor from which Senao Networks, manufacturer of data networking products and wireless telephones under the EnGenius and Senao brands was spun off.[6]

History[edit]
Chunghwa Telecom was founded as a company on June 15, 1996 as part of the Taiwan government's privatisation efforts. Prior to this, it operated as a business unit of the Directorate General of Telecommunications (zh:交通部電信總局) for over 100 years. The company’s common shares have been listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange under the number “2412” since October 2000, and its ADSs have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CHT” since July 2003. In August 2005, Chunghwa Telecom became a privatised company, as the Taiwan government’s ownership was reduced to less than 50%.
The Directorate General of Telecommunications once exercised a monopoly on the telecommunications market in Taiwan. To make the telecommunications industry more competitive and improve service quality, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications began to promote "telecommunications liberalisation" policy from the late 1980s, in which the telecom industry will gradually be opened to private industry operations. The liberalisation of telecommunications as well as the management and operation of telecommunications business as mentioned in the plan aimed to achieve "separation between government and enterprises".
On July 1, 1996, the "Chunghwa Telecom Ordinance" was enacted under an amendment of the "Telecommunications Act", which formally established Chunghwa Telecom Co. Ltd. with a capital of NT$ 96.477 billion yuan, operating first class and second class telecom services, under the "Taiwan Northern Telecom Branch", "Central Taiwan telecommunications branch", "Southern Taiwan telecommunications branch"," long-distance and mobile communications branch", "International Telecommunication Branch", "Data Communications Branch", "Telecommunications Research Institute" and "Telecommunications Training Institute".
In 1997, Chunghwa Telecom was awarded the license to operate a second-generation mobile communications (2G) network (GSM 900MHz and 1800MHz).
In October 2000, Chunghwa Telecom was listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "2412." In July 2003, Chunghwa Telecom was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "CHT." August 12, 2005, the Government of China Telecom's stake to 50%, and officially became a private company.
In February 2002, Chunghwa Telecom was awarded the license to operate a third-generation mobile communications (3G) network (WCDMA 2100MHz).
In 2007, Chunghwa Telecom acquired Senao International, and Senao becomes the exclusive sales agent of Chunghwa Telecom mobile phones.
On May 1, 2007, Chunghwa Telecom set up a division for enterprise customers, incorporated in the Southern Taiwan telecommunications branch.
On October 30, 2013, Chunghwa Telecom acquired in an auction for NT$ 39.075 billion a spectrum of LTE bands (900MHz B2 / 1800MHz C2 / C5), with a bandwidth limit of 2x35MHz, as well as C5-band (1800MHz).
On May 29, 2014, Chunghwa Telecom held a press conference to announce the start of LTE services on May 30, 2014, and this made Chunghwa Telecom the first telco in Taiwan to provide LTE services.
Services[edit]
Chunghwa Telecom is the largest telecommunication service provider in Taiwan and one of the largest in Asia in terms of revenue. In terms of both revenue and customers, Chunghwa is Taiwan’s largest provider of fixed line services, mobile services, broadband access service, and Internet service. The company also provides information and communication technology services to corporate customers.
HiNet has been heavily criticised for being a haven for senders of email spam, which has resulted in many Internet service providers routinely blocking e-mails originating from the service.[3][4][5]
Subsidiaries[edit]
Senao International, a cellular phone distributor from which Senao Networks, manufacturer of data networking products and wireless telephones under the EnGenius and Senao brands was spun off.[6]
