We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of common shares in this
offering, excluding the concurrent private placement, will be approximately
$48.3 million based on the initial public offering price of $14.00 per share,
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, we estimate that the net proceeds will be
approximately $56.1 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

Bayer Global Investments B.V. has agreed to purchase from us concurrently with
this offering in a private placement $35 million of our common shares at a price
per share of $14.00, which is the initial public offering price. 

We are undertaking this offering in order to access the public capital markets,
to increase our liquidity and to support continued development of our research
programs. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent
private placement, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as
follows:

• approximately $20.0 million to advance the development of our hemoglobinopathy
  programs;                                                 

• approximately $40.0 million to progress additional pipeline candidates;

• approximately $10.0 million to further optimize our CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing
  platform and develop delivery technologies; and                    

• the remainder, if any, for manufacturing, working capital and general 
  corporate purposes.                                                        

However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the product development process,
it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds
from this offering and the concurrent private placement that may be used for the
above purposes. The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend
upon numerous factors, including the results of our research and development
efforts, the timing and success of our ongoing preclinical studies or
preclinical studies we may commence in the future and the timing of regulatory
submissions. As a result, our management will have broad discretion over the use
of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement, and
investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net
proceeds. In addition, we might decide to postpone or not pursue certain
preclinical activities if the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement and our other sources of cash are less than expected.

Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe
that the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placement,
along with our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with interest
thereon, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 24
months.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through acquisitions or in-licenses of complementary companies or
technologies. While we have no current agreements, commitments or understandings
for any specific acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may use a portion
of the net proceeds for these purposes.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private
placement, we intend to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. and Swiss governments.


The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the gene therapy
and gene editing fields, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies,
intense competition, and a strong emphasis on intellectual property and
proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development
experience, and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we
currently face, and will continue to face, competition from many different
sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and
biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and
public and private research institutions. For any products that we may
ultimately commercialize, not only will we compete with any existing therapies
and those therapies currently in development, we will have to compete with new
therapies that may become available in the future.

We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other
related markets that utilize technologies encompassing genomic medicines to
create therapies, including gene editing and gene therapy. There are additional
companies that are working to develop therapies in areas related to our research
programs.

Our platform and product focus is on the development of therapies using
CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Other companies developing CRISPR/Cas9 technology
include Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. and Editas Medicine, Inc.

There are additional companies developing therapies using additional
gene-editing technologies, including TALENs, meganucleases, and zinc finger
nucleases. The companies developing these additional gene-editing technologies
include bluebird bio, Cellectis, Poseida Therapeutics, Precision Biosciences,
and Sangamo Biosciences. Additional companies developing gene therapy products
include Abeona Therapeutics, Avalanche Biotechnologies, Dimension Therapeutics,
REGENXBIO, Spark Therapeutics and uniQure. In addition to competition from other
gene-editing therapies or gene therapies, any products that we develop may also
face competition from other types of therapies, such as small molecule,
antibody, or protein therapies.

We may also face future competition from newly discovered gene editing
technologies or new CRISPR-associated nucleases. While we believe that
CRISPR/Cas9 will be highly effective for many therapeutic applications and are
actively working to further enhance the technology, more efficient gene editing
technologies may emerge. For example, recent publications by Feng Zhang, Ph.D.,
one of the founders of Editas Medicine, Inc. and others have elucidated a
different CRISPR-associated nuclease, Cpf1, which can also edit human DNA. Some
have argued that Cpf1 is superior to Cas9 for certain applications. Gene editing
is a highly active field of research and new technologies, related or unrelated
to CRISPR, may be discovered and create new competition.

In addition, many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with
their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and
expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing,
conducting clinical trials, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers
and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and gene therapy
industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller
number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be
significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with
large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in
recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and
establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials,
as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our
programs. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our
competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective,
have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less
expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain
FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may
obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a
strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key
competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to
be their efficacy, safety, convenience, and availability of reimbursement.

If our current programs are approved for the indications for which we are
currently planning clinical trials, they may compete with other products
currently under development, including gene editing and gene therapy products.
Competition with other related products currently under development may include
competition for clinical trial sites, patient recruitment, and product sales.

In addition, due to the intense research and development that is taking place by
several companies, including us and our competitors, in the gene editing field,
the intellectual property landscape is in flux and highly competitive. There may
be significant intellectual property related litigation and proceedings, in
addition to the ongoing interference proceedings, relating to our owned and
in-licensed, and other third party, intellectual property and proprietary rights
in the future. For example, in January 2016, at our request, the USPTO declared
an interference between one of the pending U.S. patent applications we licensed
from Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier and twelve issued U.S. patents, and subsequently
added one U.S. patent application, owned jointly by Broad. Because our
application was filed first, the USPTO designated Dr. Charpentier, California
and Vienna, or Vienna, collectively as “Senior Party” and designated Broad as
“Junior Party.” Following motions by the parties and, potentially, a
determination regarding which of the two parties was the first to invent, the
PTAB might conclude that the contested subject matter is not patentable to the
Senior Party and is patentable to the Junior Party, which in this case could
preclude our U.S. patent applications from issuing as patents, in which case the
proceedings would result in our losing the right to protect core innovations and
our freedom to practice our core gene editing technology.

Similarly, ToolGen Inc., or ToolGen, filed Suggestions of Interference in the
USPTO on April 13, 2015 and December 3, 2015, suggesting that they believe some
of the claims in pending U.S. applications owned by ToolGen (U.S. Serial No.
14/685,568 and U.S. Serial No. 14/685,510, respectively) interfere with certain
claims in five of the Broad patents currently involved in the interference with
Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier, California and Vienna. We are also aware of
additional third parties that have pending patent applications relating to
CRISPR technologies, which similarly may lead to further interference
proceedings. For example, Rockefeller University has filed a continuation
application (U.S. Serial No. 14/324,960) of an application filed by the Broad
that Rockefeller’s employee Luciano Marraffini as co-inventor of CRISPR/Cas9
technology; Vilnius University has filed applications in the United States and
abroad (published internationally as WO2013/141680 and WO2013/142578), Harvard
University has filed applications in the United States and abroad (published 
internationally as WO2014/099744), and Sigma- Aldrich has filed applications in
the United States and abroad (published internationally as WO2014/089290), each
claiming aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 technology based on applications claiming
priority to provisional filings in 2012. Numerous other filings are based on 
provisional applications filed after 2012.

Both Broad and Toolgen have filed international counterparts of their U.S.
applications, some of which were granted in Europe and/or other foreign
jurisdictions. We and third parties have initiated opposition proceedings
against some of these grants, and we may in the future oppose other grants to
these or other applicants.


Company Description
We are a leading gene editing company focused on the development of
CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutics. CRISPR/Cas9 is a revolutionary technology for
gene editing, the process of precisely altering specific sequences of genomic
DNA. The application of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene editing was co-invented by one


 of
our scientific founders, Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier who, along with her
collaborators, published work elucidating how CRISPR/Cas9, a naturally occurring
viral defense mechanism found in bacteria, can be adapted for use in gene
editing. We are applying this technology to treat a broad set of rare and common
diseases by disrupting, correcting or regulating the disease related genes. We
believe that our scientific expertise, together with our approach, may enable an
entirely new class of highly active and potentially curative treatments for
patients for whom current biopharmaceutical approaches have had limited success.

We are pursuing a two-pronged product development strategy using both ex vivo
and in vivo approaches. Our most advanced programs in hemoglobinopathies use an
ex vivo approach, whereby cells are harvested from a patient, treated with a
CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutic and reintroduced into the patient. Beyond these
lead programs, we are pursuing a number of additional ex vivo applications, as
well as select in vivo applications whereby the CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutic is
delivered directly to target cells within the human body. Our initial in vivo
applications will leverage well-established delivery technologies for gene-based
therapeutics.

Given the numerous potential therapeutic applications for CRISPR/Cas9, we have
partnered strategically to broaden the indications we can pursue and accelerate
development of programs by accessing specific disease-area expertise. We have
established a joint venture with Bayer AG and its subsidiaries in which we hold
a 50% interest, and a collaboration agreement with Vertex Pharmaceuticals
Incorporated, which together will provide over $400 million, subject to certain
conditions, inclusive of estimated spending on funded programs, as well as
access to distinctive capabilities, for the development of CRISPR/Cas9 gene
editing product candidates. We have assembled a team with extensive experience
in drug discovery and clinical development to successfully bring
CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutics to patients. We believe our highly experienced
team, product development strategy, partnerships and intellectual property
position us as a leader in the development of CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutics.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM)  $-6.01      Market Cap $714.18 M     Shares Outstanding 40.26 M     Public Float 8.32 M     Yield CRSP has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.     Latest Dividend N/A     Ex-Dividend Date N/A       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month.

Short Interest (07/14/17)    Shares Sold Short 662,305     Change from Last  9.28%      Percent of Float 7.96%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.33      Net Money Flow ($)  287,747    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.
