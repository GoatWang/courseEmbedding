					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Timothy E. Hoeksema (born January 25, 1947)[1] was the chairman of Midwest Air Group who transformed the air fleet of the Kimberly Clark paper mill company into Midwest Airlines. He retired in July 2009 after the company was sold to Republic Airways Holdings after running into financial trouble.[2]
Hoeksema was a flight instructor at the University of Illinois at Champaign in 1968. Hoeksema joined Kimberly-Clark in 1969 serving as first officer of the company's air fleet -- the same year that Kimberly-Clark started its K-C Aviation subsidiary. He graduated summa cum laude from Western Michigan University in 1972 with a bachelor of science in aviation engineering technology.[3]
In 1974, he became chief pilot for Kimberly-Clark. In 1977 after receiving a master’s degree in business administration while on a Kimberly-Clark scholarship to the University of Chicago Executive Program. he was named director of air transportation for the company and president of K-C Aviation.[3]
In 1984 he was responsible for transforming K-C Aviation into a commercial company Midwest Express which started out with two DC-9 planes.
In 1988 he was named head of Kimberly Clark's transportation sector.
In 1995 the airline's parent Midwest Airgroup was listed on the American Stock Exchange.
In 2007-2008 he fought a takeover attempt by AirTran Airlines in the "Save the Cookie" campaign (a take off on the company's signature service of providing on board baked chocolate chip cookies to its passengers) before ultimately agreeing to a private takeover from a consortium led by TPG Capital with a minority investment by Northwest Airlines. He remained the chief executive of the airline under its new owners. TPG bought the company for $452 million in 2008. In July 2009 it sold it for $31 million.[4]
He is also a director at the Marcus Corporation[5][5] and is on the Board of Trustees of the Medical College of Wisconsin.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
