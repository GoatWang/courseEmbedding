Cheryl Bachelder

Cheryl A. Bachelder is a passionate restaurant industry executive and former CEO of Popeyes® Louisiana Kitchen, Inc. Cheryl is known for her crisp strategic thinking, franchisee-focused approach, superior financial performance and the development of outstanding leaders and teams.
Cheryl joined Popeyes, Louisiana Kitchen, Inc., in November 2007, after serving as an active member of the Board for a year. She brought more than 35 years of experience in brand building, operations, and public-company management at companies like Yum Brands, Domino’s Pizza, RJR Nabisco, The Gillette Company, and The Procter & Gamble Company.  
At Popeyes, Cheryl promptly established a Road Map for Results. This strategic framework led to market share gains of eight points, improved guest ratings, and increased restaurant margins (400 basis points in seven years). The improvement in restaurant performance led franchisees to remodel the system and accelerate new unit growth both in the U.S. and abroad. In eight years, the enterprise market cap grew from less than $300 million to over $1.3 billion. At fiscal year-end 2015, Popeyes’ system-wide revenues were $3.1 billion. These revenues were generated by over 2,539 restaurants operated by 360 franchisees and more than 60,000 restaurant employees in the United States, three territories, and 27 foreign countries.  
Ms. Bachelder created a culture based on the Popeyes Purpose: to inspire servant leaders to achieve superior results. This purpose was expressed in the six principles of how they worked together. The Popeyes team focus was to serve the franchise owners well; together they pursued a bold ambition for the enterprise. This produced exceptional performance results. In March 2015, Ms. Bachelder published a book chronicling the tenets of the Popeyes turnaround, entitled Dare to Serve – How to drive superior results by serving others.
Ms. Bachelder has served on the board of directors for Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc., since 2006; board of directors for Pier 1 Imports, Inc., since 2012; the advisory board of Agile Pursuits Franchising, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Procter & Gamble, since 2009; and the International Franchise Association since February 2015. She also served on the board of directors for True Value Company from 2007 – 2012 and on the board of the National Restaurant Association May 2009 – 2012. In November 2014, Cheryl was certified as an NACD Board Leadership Fellow.
Prior to serving as Popeyes CEO, Ms. Bachelder revitalized brand performance in both retail and consumer goods companies. She was president and chief concept officer for KFC Corporate (2001-2003), creating growth plans for the U.S. business in collaboration with the franchise owners. From 1995 – 2000, Ms. Bachelder served as vice president of marketing and product development for Domino’s Pizza, Inc. She was the brand architect responsible for contemporizing the restaurant chain’s image and launching the innovative Heatwave bag which improved product quality and drove strong same-store sales growth for five consecutive years across 5,400 units. Prior to her restaurant experience, Ms. Bachelder served as general manager of the LifeSavers Division of RJR Nabisco. Her early career years included brand management roles at The Gillette Company and The Procter & Gamble Company.
In September 2015, Cheryl was awarded The Norman Brinker Award from Nation’s Restaurant News. She has been profiled in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, and was named by CNBC’s Jim Cramer as one of his “21 Bankable CEOs” for 2014. In 2012, she was recognized as “Leader of the Year” by the Women’s Foodservice Forum, and received the Silver Plate Award from the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association.
Ms. Bachelder holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration, and a Masters of Business Administration in Finance and Marketing, from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. She has been married for over 35 years to Chris Bachelder and they have three grown daughters.

          Dare to Serve: How to Drive Superior Results by Serving Others
        

    By 
      Cheryl A Bachelder



                Cheryl Bachelder joined an ailing restaurant chain and turned it into the darling of the industry by daring to serve the people in her organization well. When Bachelder was named CEO of Popeyes in the fall of 2007, guest visits had been declining for years, restaurant sales and profit trends were negative, and the company stock price had dropped from $34 in 2002 to $13. The brand was stagnant, and relations between the company and its franchise owners were strained. By 2014, average restaurant sales were up 25 percent, and profits were up 40 percent. Popeyes' market share had grown from 14 percent to 21 percent, and the stock price was over $40. The franchisees were so pleased with the turnaround that they began reinvesting in the brand, rapidly remodeling restaurants, and building new units around the world. The difference maker, Bachelder says, was a conscious decision to lead in a new way. She and her team created a workplace where people were treated with respect and dignity yet challenged to perform at the highest level. Silos and self were set aside in favor of collaboration and team play. And the results were measured with rigor and discipline. Servant leadership is sometimes derided as soft or ineffective, but this book shows that it's actually challenging and tough minded a daring path. Bachelder takes you firsthand through the transformation of Popeyes and shows how a leader at any level can become a Dare-to-Serve leader. 
            




                  REVIEW QUOTES
            

"Extraordinary! Dare to Serve describes the kind of leadership so desperately needed in the 21st century. A powerful blend of courage and humility, Cheryl Bachelder's engaging story offers a clear path for leaders to follow, and what makes her message so compelling is the tremendous results she's produced. I highly recommend this book."--Stephen M. R. Covey, #1 bestselling author of The Speed of Trust and coauthor of Smart Trust "Dare to Serve is a crisp narrative of Cheryl's profound leadership journey as a corporate executive. Through balancing people, purpose, and principles, Cheryl produces outstanding results. Don't miss this opportunity to learn how it's done!"--Denise Ramos, CEO and President, ITT Corporation "When I speak with leaders, it is hard for them to grasp that servant leadership drives both great performance and great human satisfaction. Cheryl Bachelder provides an inspiring manual on how to be a Dare-to-Serve leader who drives superior results."--Ken Blanchard, coauthor of The One Minute Manager(R) and Leading at a Higher Level "It has been a long time since I have read a book from beginning to end in one sitting, but that is exactly what I did with Dare to Serve, and I had to force myself not to read it again right then and there! It is truly a masterpiece and I will be sharing it with many friends, including those whom I am mentoring, just as soon as it is on the bookstands."--Colleen Barrett, President Emeritus, Southwest Airlines, and coauthor of Lead with LUV "Anyone who leads anything will learn from the crisp and engaging stories in Dare to Serve. It is one of the best leadership books I have read and is a must-read for any leader who cares."--Joel Manby, CEO, Herschend Family Entertainment, and author of Love Works "Dare to Serve stands out as one of the most practical, useful books on leadership that I have ever read. Full of real-world examples and grounded in the dramatic turnaround of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen restaurants, Cheryl shares with us how to serve others with intention, competence, character, courage, and humility. Her practical experience, proven results, and contagious passion to serve others well is an inspiration to all of us who want to make a real difference in the world."--Bonnie Wurzbacher, Chief Resource Development Officer, World Vision International, and former Senior Vice President, Global Customer Leadership, The Coca-Cola Company "Dare to Serve chronicles both the remarkable turnaround story of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc., and Cheryl's inspiring personal journey of discovery, which galvanized her commitment to an unconventional approach to corporate leadership that has yielded remarkable results."--Andy Stanley, founder, North Point Ministries, Inc. "Dare to Serve offers a candid, behind-the-scenes look at how a struggling restaurant chain was transformed into a soaring brand success through a simple but revolutionary model of leadership based on serving others. This book is a must-read for leaders of all kinds!"--Phil Cordell, Global Head, Focused Service and Hampton Brand Management, Hilton Worldwide "Compelling and inspiring! Bachelder makes the case for her people-focused approach to leadership through her real-life experience at Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. Developed and honed in an industry where service to others is at the very core of what we do, these lessons are sure to translate not only across industries but to our personal lives as well."--Dawn Sweeney, President and CEO, National Restaurant Association "Cheryl Bachelder's brave and unconventional approach to the turnaround of Popeyes challenges all of us to step up our game. Cheryl stands in the gap for us, calling us to a purpose that will drive better results for our organizations, while putting the needs of our people and customers ahead of our own."--Scott MacLellan, CEO, TouchPoint Support Services, a Compass Group company "By focusing on the purpose-driven success of those she leads, paradoxically, Cheryl Bachelder gets the results we all want from our organizations. Dare to Serve is about the gutsy principles she applied to a business desperately in need of a turnaround and the spectacular results she achieved."--Tim Irwin, PhD, bestselling author of Impact "This book turned my thinking upside-down. Cheryl shares her road-tested wisdom and shows how and why Dare-to-Serve leadership works so brilliantly. This is a game-changing book and should be required reading for all leaders."--Art Barter, President and CEO, Datron Holdings, Inc., and founder and CEO, Servant Leadership Institute "Dare to Serve is a game changer! The principles outlined create exponential results far beyond what the individual ego will allow. Boards today are looking for Dare-to-Serve type leaders to ignite possibilities in their organizations. This is a must-read for leaders everywhere!"--Jane Edison Stevenson, Vice Chairman, Board & CEO Services, Korn Ferry, and coauthor of Breaking Away

Cheryl Bachelder

Cheryl A. Bachelder is a passionate restaurant industry executive serving as the CEO Popeyes® Louisiana Kitchen, Inc. Cheryl is known for her crisp strategic thinking, franchisee-focused approach, superior financial performance and the development of outstanding leaders and teams.
Cheryl joined Popeyes, Louisiana Kitchen, Inc. in November 2007 after serving as an active member of the Board for a year. She brings more than 35 years of experience in brand building, operations and public-company management at companies like Yum Brands, Domino's Pizza, RJR Nabisco, The Gillette Company and The Procter & Gamble Company.
At Popeyes, Cheryl promptly established a Road Map for Results that focused on four key tenets of growing a restaurant chain: build a distinctive brand, run great restaurants, grow restaurant profits and ramp up new unit growth. This strategic framework led to market share gains of six points, improved guest ratings and increased restaurant margins (400 basis points in five years). The improvement in restaurant performance has led franchisees to remodel the system and accelerate new unit growth both in the U.S. and abroad. In the last six years the enterprise market cap has grown from $300 million to over $1 billion.  At fiscal year-end 2013 Popeyes system-wide revenues were $2.4 billion. These revenues are generated by over 2,248 restaurants operated by 338 franchisees and more than 60,000 restaurant employees in the United States, three territories and 27 foreign countries.
Ms. Bachelder has created a culture based on the Popeyes Purpose: to inspire servant leaders to achieve superior results.  This purpose is expressed in the six principles of how we work together. The Popeyes team focus is to serve the franchise owners well; together we pursuing a bold ambition for the enterprise. This has produced exceptional performance results. In March 2015, Ms. Bachelder will publish a book chronicling the tenets of the Popeyes turnaround, entitled Dare to Serve: How to drive superior results by serving others.
Ms. Bachelder has served as a member of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc.'s Board of Directors since November 2006 and also serves on the Board of Directors for Pier 1 Imports, Inc. since 2012, and the advisory board of Agile Pursuits Franchising, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Procter & Gamble, since 2009. She served on the Board of Directors for True Value Company from 2007–2012 and on the Board of the National Restaurant Association May 2009–2012. She has over eight years of board experience and serves as Compensation Committee Chair at Pier 1 Imports, Inc.
Prior to serving as Popeyes CEO, Ms. Bachelder has revitalized brand performance in both retail and consumer goods companies.  She was president and chief concept officer for KFC Corporate (2001-2003) creating growth plans for the U.S. business in collaboration with the franchise owners.
From 1995 to 2000, Ms. Bachelder served as vice president of marketing and product development for Domino's Pizza, Inc.  She was the brand architect responsible for contemporizing the restaurant chain's image, and launching the innovative Heatwave bag which improved product quality and drove strong same-store sales growth for five consecutive years across 5,400 units.
Prior to her restaurant experience, Ms. Bachelder served as general manager of the LifeSavers Division of RJR Nabisco.  Her early career years included brand management roles at The Gillette Company and The Procter & Gamble Company.
In 2012, Cheryl was recognized as Leader of the Year by the Women's Foodservice Forum and received the highest industry award, the Silver Plate, for the quick service restaurant sector, presented by the International Food Manufacturer's Association. Cheryl was also recognized as a 2012 Nation's Restaurant News' Golden Chain Award recipient. The Wall Street Journal recently featured a full page story on the Popeyes turnaround (March 10, 2014).
Ms. Bachelder holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration and a Masters of Business Administration in Finance and Marketing from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. She is married thirty three years to Chris Bachelder and they have three grown daughters.
