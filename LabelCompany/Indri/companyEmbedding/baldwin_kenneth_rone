Surname meaning for "Baldwin"
English: from a Germanic personal name composed of the elements
bald ‘bold’, ‘brave’ + wine ‘friend’, which was
extremely popular among the Normans and in Flanders in the early
Middle Ages. It was the personal name of the Crusader who in 1100
became the first Christian king of Jerusalem, and of four more
Crusader kings of Jerusalem. It was also borne by Baldwin, Count of
Flanders (1172–1205), leader of the Fourth Crusade, who became first
Latin Emperor of Constantinople (1204). As an American surname it has
absorbed Dutch spellings such as Boudewijn.
