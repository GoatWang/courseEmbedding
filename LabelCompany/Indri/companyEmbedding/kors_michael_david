Personal life[edit]
Kors was born Karl Anderson, Jr.[5] on Long Island, New York, the son of Joan Hamburger, a former model, and her first husband, Karl Anderson, Sr, a college student.[6][7][8] His mother remarried Bill Kors when he was five, and his surname was changed to Kors. His mother told him that he could choose a new first name as well; subsequently he renamed himself Michael David Kors.[8] grew up in Merrick, New York and graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore, New York. Kors' mother is Jewish and his father was of Swedish descent.[5][9][10][11] Kors married his partner, Lance Le Pere, on August 16, 2011, in Southampton, New York.[2][12]
Career[edit]
Kors' affinity for fashion started when he was very young. His mother thought his affinity might have been caused in part by his exposure to the apparel industry through her modeling career.[13] Michael, at the age of five, even redesigned his mother's wedding dress for her second marriage.[14] As a teen, Kors began designing clothes and selling them out of his parents' basement, which he renamed the Iron Butterfly.[13] Kors also took acting lessons when he was young, but stopped when he was 14 when he decided to focus on becoming a fashion designer.[15]
In 1977, he enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City.[16] However, he dropped out after only nine months and took a job at a boutique called Lothar's across from Bergdorf Goodman on 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan, where he started as a salesperson and went on to become both the designer and visual display head for the store. Shortly after, Dawn Mello, the fashion director at Bergdorf's, discovered Kors. She asked if he would show his collection to Bergdorf Goodman's buyers and that was just the beginning.[17]
In 1981, Kors launched his Michael Kors women's label at Bergdorf Goodman. In 1990, the company launched KORS Michael Kors as a licensee. A Chapter 11 filing in 1993, caused by the closure of the licensing partner for KORS Michael Kors, forced him to put the KORS line on hold. He managed to get back on his feet by 1997 and launched a lower priced line and at the same time was named the first women’s ready-to-wear designer for French house Celine.[18] In his tenure at Celine, Kors turned the fashion house around with successful accessories and a critically acclaimed ready-to-wear line. Kors left Celine in October 2003 to concentrate on his own brand. Kors launched his menswear line in 2002.

The MICHAEL Michael Kors line was launched in 2004, joining the original Michael Kors Collection label. The MICHAEL Michael Kors line includes women's handbags and shoes as well as women's ready-to-wear apparel. As of the end of the first fiscal quarter in 2016, Kors has over 770 Lifestyle stores around the world. Currently, Kors has Collection boutiques in New York, Beverly Hills, Palm Beach, Chicago, Miami and Southampton. In the U.S, his women's runway collection, labeled Michael Kors Collection, is sold at Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and numerous specialty stores. Michael Kors Collection is also carried at the brand's stores in London, Paris, Cannes, Milan, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Seoul. The year 2016 marked the 35th anniversary of Kors' business.




A dress by Michael Kors, 2010


Among the celebrities who have worn Kors' designs are Olivia Wilde, Dakota Johnson, Blake Lively, Kate Hudson, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Kate Middleton, Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lopez, Hillary Clinton, Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, Heidi Klum, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michelle Obama wore a black sleeveless dress from the designer for her first term official portrait as First Lady and later sported Kors again at the 2015 State of the Union address.[19] Viola Davis wore a custom Michael Kors Collection gown when accepting a Golden Globe for best supporting actress in a motion picture for her role in Fences. Kate Hudson and Olivia Wilde both wore gowns by the designer to the 2016 Golden Globes, and Emily Blunt, nominated for her role in Into The Woods, wore a white custom gown by the designer in 2015. Joan Allen wore his gown when she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in The Contender. As creative director of Celine, Kors designed many outfits for actresses to wear on screen, including Gwyneth Paltrow in Possession;[20] and Rene Russo in The Thomas Crown Affair.[21] One of his gowns was worn by Alicia Keys for her performance at Barack Obama's inaugural ball on January 21, 2013.[22]
The ad campaigns for Kors, shot by Mario Testino, often reflect the jet-set sportswear that his fans like. Previous campaigns include the model Carmen Kass on a safari in Africa and relaxing on a yacht. More recent campaigns feature models Joan Smalls and Freja Beha-Erichsen living the jet set lifestyle.
Kors was a judge on the Emmy-nominated reality television program Project Runway, which aired on Bravo for five seasons; subsequent seasons aired on Lifetime. On December 18, 2012, it was announced that Kors would be leaving Project Runway, to be replaced by fellow designer Zac Posen.[23]
In January 2014, Forbes reported that Kors now has a personal fortune in excess of $1billion, making him the latest fashion industry billionaire. Michael Kors Holdings had already “minted two billionaires”: Silas Chou and Lawrence Stroll.[24]
Other honors[edit]

2016: The World Food Programme honored Kors with the McGovern-Dole Leadership award, presented by former vice president Joe Biden.
2015: Named a Global Ambassador Against Hunger for the United Nations World Food Programme.

Legal issues[edit]
In January 2009, the estate of the artist-designer Tony Duquette sued Kors for trademark infringement after Kors allegedly used Duquette's name and images in promoting Kors' 2009 resortwear collection.[25]
In July 2013, he became the second luxury brand, after Tiffany & Co, to sue Costco for falsely claiming in advertisements that they sold his product.[26][27]
In popular culture[edit]
Kors was referenced in the film The Devil Wears Prada by Meryl Streep's character, Miranda Priestly. In the scene, Priestly sweeps into her office and gives a list of instructions to her personal assistant (Emily Blunt). Priestly says, "RSVP 'yes' to Michael Kors' party and I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30 and pick me up at 9:45 sharp".[28]
Kors is also mentioned in Big Sean's song "Dance" by Nicki Minaj. Drake also mentions Michael Kors in his song "From Time", and rapper Pusha T in his song "Numbers on the Boards". Additionally, Kors guest starred as himself in a Fashion Week themed episode of the hit teen show Gossip Girl; the same show that repeatedly showcases several pieces from his collections.

The ad campaigns for Kors, shot by Mario Testino, often reflect the jet-set sportswear that his fans like. Previous campaigns include the model Carmen Kass on a safari in Africa and relaxing on a yacht. More recent campaigns feature models Joan Smalls and Freja Beha-Erichsen living the jet set lifestyle.
Kors was a judge on the Emmy-nominated reality television program Project Runway, which aired on Bravo for five seasons; subsequent seasons aired on Lifetime. On December 18, 2012, it was announced that Kors would be leaving Project Runway, to be replaced by fellow designer Zac Posen.[23]
In January 2014, Forbes reported that Kors now has a personal fortune in excess of $1billion, making him the latest fashion industry billionaire. Michael Kors Holdings had already “minted two billionaires”: Silas Chou and Lawrence Stroll.[24]

Legal issues[edit]
In January 2009, the estate of the artist-designer Tony Duquette sued Kors for trademark infringement after Kors allegedly used Duquette's name and images in promoting Kors' 2009 resortwear collection.[25]
In July 2013, he became the second luxury brand, after Tiffany & Co, to sue Costco for falsely claiming in advertisements that they sold his product.[26][27]
In popular culture[edit]
Kors was referenced in the film The Devil Wears Prada by Meryl Streep's character, Miranda Priestly. In the scene, Priestly sweeps into her office and gives a list of instructions to her personal assistant (Emily Blunt). Priestly says, "RSVP 'yes' to Michael Kors' party and I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30 and pick me up at 9:45 sharp".[28]
Kors is also mentioned in Big Sean's song "Dance" by Nicki Minaj. Drake also mentions Michael Kors in his song "From Time", and rapper Pusha T in his song "Numbers on the Boards". Additionally, Kors guest starred as himself in a Fashion Week themed episode of the hit teen show Gossip Girl; the same show that repeatedly showcases several pieces from his collections.

Personal life[edit]
Kors was born Karl Anderson, Jr.[5] on Long Island, New York, the son of Joan Hamburger, a former model, and her first husband, Karl Anderson, Sr, a college student.[6][7][8] His mother remarried Bill Kors when he was five, and his surname was changed to Kors. His mother told him that he could choose a new first name as well; subsequently he renamed himself Michael David Kors.[8] grew up in Merrick, New York and graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore, New York. Kors' mother is Jewish and his father was of Swedish descent.[5][9][10][11] Kors married his partner, Lance Le Pere, on August 16, 2011, in Southampton, New York.[2][12]
Career[edit]
Kors' affinity for fashion started when he was very young. His mother thought his affinity might have been caused in part by his exposure to the apparel industry through her modeling career.[13] Michael, at the age of five, even redesigned his mother's wedding dress for her second marriage.[14] As a teen, Kors began designing clothes and selling them out of his parents' basement, which he renamed the Iron Butterfly.[13] Kors also took acting lessons when he was young, but stopped when he was 14 when he decided to focus on becoming a fashion designer.[15]
In 1977, he enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City.[16] However, he dropped out after only nine months and took a job at a boutique called Lothar's across from Bergdorf Goodman on 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan, where he started as a salesperson and went on to become both the designer and visual display head for the store. Shortly after, Dawn Mello, the fashion director at Bergdorf's, discovered Kors. She asked if he would show his collection to Bergdorf Goodman's buyers and that was just the beginning.[17]
In 1981, Kors launched his Michael Kors women's label at Bergdorf Goodman. In 1990, the company launched KORS Michael Kors as a licensee. A Chapter 11 filing in 1993, caused by the closure of the licensing partner for KORS Michael Kors, forced him to put the KORS line on hold. He managed to get back on his feet by 1997 and launched a lower priced line and at the same time was named the first women’s ready-to-wear designer for French house Celine.[18] In his tenure at Celine, Kors turned the fashion house around with successful accessories and a critically acclaimed ready-to-wear line. Kors left Celine in October 2003 to concentrate on his own brand. Kors launched his menswear line in 2002.

The MICHAEL Michael Kors line was launched in 2004, joining the original Michael Kors Collection label. The MICHAEL Michael Kors line includes women's handbags and shoes as well as women's ready-to-wear apparel. As of the end of the first fiscal quarter in 2016, Kors has over 770 Lifestyle stores around the world. Currently, Kors has Collection boutiques in New York, Beverly Hills, Palm Beach, Chicago, Miami and Southampton. In the U.S, his women's runway collection, labeled Michael Kors Collection, is sold at Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and numerous specialty stores. Michael Kors Collection is also carried at the brand's stores in London, Paris, Cannes, Milan, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Seoul. The year 2016 marked the 35th anniversary of Kors' business.

Among the celebrities who have worn Kors' designs are Olivia Wilde, Dakota Johnson, Blake Lively, Kate Hudson, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Kate Middleton, Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lopez, Hillary Clinton, Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, Heidi Klum, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michelle Obama wore a black sleeveless dress from the designer for her first term official portrait as First Lady and later sported Kors again at the 2015 State of the Union address.[19] Viola Davis wore a custom Michael Kors Collection gown when accepting a Golden Globe for best supporting actress in a motion picture for her role in Fences. Kate Hudson and Olivia Wilde both wore gowns by the designer to the 2016 Golden Globes, and Emily Blunt, nominated for her role in Into The Woods, wore a white custom gown by the designer in 2015. Joan Allen wore his gown when she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in The Contender. As creative director of Celine, Kors designed many outfits for actresses to wear on screen, including Gwyneth Paltrow in Possession;[20] and Rene Russo in The Thomas Crown Affair.[21] One of his gowns was worn by Alicia Keys for her performance at Barack Obama's inaugural ball on January 21, 2013.[22]

Personal life[edit]
Kors was born Karl Anderson, Jr.[5] on Long Island, New York, the son of Joan Hamburger, a former model, and her first husband, Karl Anderson, Sr, a college student.[6][7][8] His mother remarried Bill Kors when he was five, and his surname was changed to Kors. His mother told him that he could choose a new first name as well; subsequently he renamed himself Michael David Kors.[8] grew up in Merrick, New York and graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore, New York. Kors' mother is Jewish and his father was of Swedish descent.[5][9][10][11] Kors married his partner, Lance Le Pere, on August 16, 2011, in Southampton, New York.[2][12]
Career[edit]
Kors' affinity for fashion started when he was very young. His mother thought his affinity might have been caused in part by his exposure to the apparel industry through her modeling career.[13] Michael, at the age of five, even redesigned his mother's wedding dress for her second marriage.[14] As a teen, Kors began designing clothes and selling them out of his parents' basement, which he renamed the Iron Butterfly.[13] Kors also took acting lessons when he was young, but stopped when he was 14 when he decided to focus on becoming a fashion designer.[15]
In 1977, he enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City.[16] However, he dropped out after only nine months and took a job at a boutique called Lothar's across from Bergdorf Goodman on 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan, where he started as a salesperson and went on to become both the designer and visual display head for the store. Shortly after, Dawn Mello, the fashion director at Bergdorf's, discovered Kors. She asked if he would show his collection to Bergdorf Goodman's buyers and that was just the beginning.[17]
In 1981, Kors launched his Michael Kors women's label at Bergdorf Goodman. In 1990, the company launched KORS Michael Kors as a licensee. A Chapter 11 filing in 1993, caused by the closure of the licensing partner for KORS Michael Kors, forced him to put the KORS line on hold. He managed to get back on his feet by 1997 and launched a lower priced line and at the same time was named the first women’s ready-to-wear designer for French house Celine.[18] In his tenure at Celine, Kors turned the fashion house around with successful accessories and a critically acclaimed ready-to-wear line. Kors left Celine in October 2003 to concentrate on his own brand. Kors launched his menswear line in 2002.

The MICHAEL Michael Kors line was launched in 2004, joining the original Michael Kors Collection label. The MICHAEL Michael Kors line includes women's handbags and shoes as well as women's ready-to-wear apparel. As of the end of the first fiscal quarter in 2016, Kors has over 770 Lifestyle stores around the world. Currently, Kors has Collection boutiques in New York, Beverly Hills, Palm Beach, Chicago, Miami and Southampton. In the U.S, his women's runway collection, labeled Michael Kors Collection, is sold at Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and numerous specialty stores. Michael Kors Collection is also carried at the brand's stores in London, Paris, Cannes, Milan, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Seoul. The year 2016 marked the 35th anniversary of Kors' business.




A dress by Michael Kors, 2010


Among the celebrities who have worn Kors' designs are Olivia Wilde, Dakota Johnson, Blake Lively, Kate Hudson, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Kate Middleton, Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lopez, Hillary Clinton, Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, Heidi Klum, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michelle Obama wore a black sleeveless dress from the designer for her first term official portrait as First Lady and later sported Kors again at the 2015 State of the Union address.[19] Viola Davis wore a custom Michael Kors Collection gown when accepting a Golden Globe for best supporting actress in a motion picture for her role in Fences. Kate Hudson and Olivia Wilde both wore gowns by the designer to the 2016 Golden Globes, and Emily Blunt, nominated for her role in Into The Woods, wore a white custom gown by the designer in 2015. Joan Allen wore his gown when she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in The Contender. As creative director of Celine, Kors designed many outfits for actresses to wear on screen, including Gwyneth Paltrow in Possession;[20] and Rene Russo in The Thomas Crown Affair.[21] One of his gowns was worn by Alicia Keys for her performance at Barack Obama's inaugural ball on January 21, 2013.[22]
The ad campaigns for Kors, shot by Mario Testino, often reflect the jet-set sportswear that his fans like. Previous campaigns include the model Carmen Kass on a safari in Africa and relaxing on a yacht. More recent campaigns feature models Joan Smalls and Freja Beha-Erichsen living the jet set lifestyle.
Kors was a judge on the Emmy-nominated reality television program Project Runway, which aired on Bravo for five seasons; subsequent seasons aired on Lifetime. On December 18, 2012, it was announced that Kors would be leaving Project Runway, to be replaced by fellow designer Zac Posen.[23]
In January 2014, Forbes reported that Kors now has a personal fortune in excess of $1billion, making him the latest fashion industry billionaire. Michael Kors Holdings had already “minted two billionaires”: Silas Chou and Lawrence Stroll.[24]
Other honors[edit]

2016: The World Food Programme honored Kors with the McGovern-Dole Leadership award, presented by former vice president Joe Biden.
2015: Named a Global Ambassador Against Hunger for the United Nations World Food Programme.
2015: God’s Love We Deliver dedicated the Michael Kors Building at the non-profit’s new SoHo headquarters in honor of Kors’ ongoing support.

Legal issues[edit]
In January 2009, the estate of the artist-designer Tony Duquette sued Kors for trademark infringement after Kors allegedly used Duquette's name and images in promoting Kors' 2009 resortwear collection.[25]
In July 2013, he became the second luxury brand, after Tiffany & Co, to sue Costco for falsely claiming in advertisements that they sold his product.[26][27]
In popular culture[edit]
Kors was referenced in the film The Devil Wears Prada by Meryl Streep's character, Miranda Priestly. In the scene, Priestly sweeps into her office and gives a list of instructions to her personal assistant (Emily Blunt). Priestly says, "RSVP 'yes' to Michael Kors' party and I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30 and pick me up at 9:45 sharp".[28]
Kors is also mentioned in Big Sean's song "Dance" by Nicki Minaj. Drake also mentions Michael Kors in his song "From Time", and rapper Pusha T in his song "Numbers on the Boards". Additionally, Kors guest starred as himself in a Fashion Week themed episode of the hit teen show Gossip Girl; the same show that repeatedly showcases several pieces from his collections.

Kors is also mentioned in Big Sean's song "Dance" by Nicki Minaj. Drake also mentions Michael Kors in his song "From Time", and rapper Pusha T in his song "Numbers on the Boards". Additionally, Kors guest starred as himself in a Fashion Week themed episode of the hit teen show Gossip Girl; the same show that repeatedly showcases several pieces from his collections.

He is the honorary chairman and chief creative officer for his company, Michael Kors Holdings Limited (NYSE: KORS), which sells men's and women's and ready-to-wear, accessories, watches, jewelry, footwear and fragrance. Kors was the first women’s ready-to-wear designer for the French house Celine, from 1997 to 2003.[4]

Personal life[edit]
Kors was born Karl Anderson, Jr.[5] on Long Island, New York, the son of Joan Hamburger, a former model, and her first husband, Karl Anderson, Sr, a college student.[6][7][8] His mother remarried Bill Kors when he was five, and his surname was changed to Kors. His mother told him that he could choose a new first name as well; subsequently he renamed himself Michael David Kors.[8] grew up in Merrick, New York and graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore, New York. Kors' mother is Jewish and his father was of Swedish descent.[5][9][10][11] Kors married his partner, Lance Le Pere, on August 16, 2011, in Southampton, New York.[2][12]
Career[edit]
Kors' affinity for fashion started when he was very young. His mother thought his affinity might have been caused in part by his exposure to the apparel industry through her modeling career.[13] Michael, at the age of five, even redesigned his mother's wedding dress for her second marriage.[14] As a teen, Kors began designing clothes and selling them out of his parents' basement, which he renamed the Iron Butterfly.[13] Kors also took acting lessons when he was young, but stopped when he was 14 when he decided to focus on becoming a fashion designer.[15]
In 1977, he enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City.[16] However, he dropped out after only nine months and took a job at a boutique called Lothar's across from Bergdorf Goodman on 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan, where he started as a salesperson and went on to become both the designer and visual display head for the store. Shortly after, Dawn Mello, the fashion director at Bergdorf's, discovered Kors. She asked if he would show his collection to Bergdorf Goodman's buyers and that was just the beginning.[17]
In 1981, Kors launched his Michael Kors women's label at Bergdorf Goodman. In 1990, the company launched KORS Michael Kors as a licensee. A Chapter 11 filing in 1993, caused by the closure of the licensing partner for KORS Michael Kors, forced him to put the KORS line on hold. He managed to get back on his feet by 1997 and launched a lower priced line and at the same time was named the first women’s ready-to-wear designer for French house Celine.[18] In his tenure at Celine, Kors turned the fashion house around with successful accessories and a critically acclaimed ready-to-wear line. Kors left Celine in October 2003 to concentrate on his own brand. Kors launched his menswear line in 2002.

The MICHAEL Michael Kors line was launched in 2004, joining the original Michael Kors Collection label. The MICHAEL Michael Kors line includes women's handbags and shoes as well as women's ready-to-wear apparel. As of the end of the first fiscal quarter in 2016, Kors has over 770 Lifestyle stores around the world. Currently, Kors has Collection boutiques in New York, Beverly Hills, Palm Beach, Chicago, Miami and Southampton. In the U.S, his women's runway collection, labeled Michael Kors Collection, is sold at Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and numerous specialty stores. Michael Kors Collection is also carried at the brand's stores in London, Paris, Cannes, Milan, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Seoul. The year 2016 marked the 35th anniversary of Kors' business.




A dress by Michael Kors, 2010


Among the celebrities who have worn Kors' designs are Olivia Wilde, Dakota Johnson, Blake Lively, Kate Hudson, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Kate Middleton, Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lopez, Hillary Clinton, Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, Heidi Klum, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michelle Obama wore a black sleeveless dress from the designer for her first term official portrait as First Lady and later sported Kors again at the 2015 State of the Union address.[19] Viola Davis wore a custom Michael Kors Collection gown when accepting a Golden Globe for best supporting actress in a motion picture for her role in Fences. Kate Hudson and Olivia Wilde both wore gowns by the designer to the 2016 Golden Globes, and Emily Blunt, nominated for her role in Into The Woods, wore a white custom gown by the designer in 2015. Joan Allen wore his gown when she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in The Contender. As creative director of Celine, Kors designed many outfits for actresses to wear on screen, including Gwyneth Paltrow in Possession;[20] and Rene Russo in The Thomas Crown Affair.[21] One of his gowns was worn by Alicia Keys for her performance at Barack Obama's inaugural ball on January 21, 2013.[22]
The ad campaigns for Kors, shot by Mario Testino, often reflect the jet-set sportswear that his fans like. Previous campaigns include the model Carmen Kass on a safari in Africa and relaxing on a yacht. More recent campaigns feature models Joan Smalls and Freja Beha-Erichsen living the jet set lifestyle.
Kors was a judge on the Emmy-nominated reality television program Project Runway, which aired on Bravo for five seasons; subsequent seasons aired on Lifetime. On December 18, 2012, it was announced that Kors would be leaving Project Runway, to be replaced by fellow designer Zac Posen.[23]
In January 2014, Forbes reported that Kors now has a personal fortune in excess of $1billion, making him the latest fashion industry billionaire. Michael Kors Holdings had already “minted two billionaires”: Silas Chou and Lawrence Stroll.[24]
Other honors[edit]

2016: The World Food Programme honored Kors with the McGovern-Dole Leadership award, presented by former vice president Joe Biden.
2015: Named a Global Ambassador Against Hunger for the United Nations World Food Programme.
2015: God’s Love We Deliver dedicated the Michael Kors Building at the non-profit’s new SoHo headquarters in honor of Kors’ ongoing support.


2013: Selected for The Time 100, the magazine's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world. He also made the New York Observer's list of the 100 Most Influential New Yorkers, under the fashion category, and was named to Out magazine’s 2014 Power 50 List.
2013: Honored with the 2013 Couture Council Award for Artistry of Fashion by The Couture Council of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology.
2013: Kors presented Hillary Rodham Clinton with the first-ever Michael Kors Award for Outstanding Community service.
2012: Honored with the Golden Heart Lifetime Achievement Award by God's Love We Deliver, a non-profit organization that distributes fresh meals to people living with HIV/AIDS and other diagnoses, which he has been involved with for over 20 years.
2010: Received the Oliver R. Grace Award for Distinguished Service in Advancing Cancer Research, an annual honor bestowed by the Cancer Research Institute, a U.S. nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing immune system-based treatments for cancer.
2010: Kors was the youngest recipient ever of the Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and received the Fragrance Foundation’s FiFi Award for Lifetime Achievement.








Legal issues[edit]
In January 2009, the estate of the artist-designer Tony Duquette sued Kors for trademark infringement after Kors allegedly used Duquette's name and images in promoting Kors' 2009 resortwear collection.[25]
In July 2013, he became the second luxury brand, after Tiffany & Co, to sue Costco for falsely claiming in advertisements that they sold his product.[26][27]
In popular culture[edit]
Kors was referenced in the film The Devil Wears Prada by Meryl Streep's character, Miranda Priestly. In the scene, Priestly sweeps into her office and gives a list of instructions to her personal assistant (Emily Blunt). Priestly says, "RSVP 'yes' to Michael Kors' party and I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30 and pick me up at 9:45 sharp".[28]
Kors is also mentioned in Big Sean's song "Dance" by Nicki Minaj. Drake also mentions Michael Kors in his song "From Time", and rapper Pusha T in his song "Numbers on the Boards". Additionally, Kors guest starred as himself in a Fashion Week themed episode of the hit teen show Gossip Girl; the same show that repeatedly showcases several pieces from his collections.

He moved to New York City to attend the Fashion Institute of Technology, but dropped out after two semesters. Kors launched his women's collection in 1981 and became a judge on Project Runway in 2004. First Lady Michelle Obama posed in a Michael Kors dress for her first official portrait. Kors lives in New York City.Early LifeBorn Karl Anderson Jr. on Long Island, New York, on August 9, 1959, famed fashion designer Michael David Kors was raised on New York's Long Island. As a toddler, Kors worked as a model, appearing in national campaigns for products such as toilet paper and Lucky Charms cereal. Kors's biological parents split when he was quite young, and he got his new name at the age of 5, when his mother married businessman Bill Kors. "My mother said, 'You're getting a new last name, so why don't you pick a new first name?'" Kors recalled. He chose Michael as his first name and his second-favorite, David, as his middle name. His mother also allowed him to design her wedding dress. Kors, already a fashion addict, was thrilled with the prospect. "The marriage didn't last, [but] the pictures are timeless," Kors quipped later.From their suburban home in Merrick, New York, Kors scavenged every bit of fashion intelligence he could gather. "I practically hyperventilated every month when Vogue arrived, and I loved shopping," he said. Kors moved to New York City in the 1970s to attend the Fashion Institute of Technology. He loved the city more than the school, however, and dropped out after two semesters. In 1978, Kors went to work at the French boutique Lothar's, which allowed him to design and merchandise his first fashion collection. The well-received collection generated enough interest that Kors was able to start his own fashion line. Michael Kors Women's Collection launched in May 1981, and was sold in the high-end department stores Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue.Fashion Design SuccessKors's simple, elegantly tailored clothing and his charmingly persuasive sales techniques proved to be a winning combination. Kors traveled across the United States for small fashion shows at private homes, known as "trunk shows." When he was 23, he convinced the formidable fashion editor Anna Wintour—then of New York magazine, now the editor of Vogue—to view his collection. The glitzy Madison Avenue showrooms he'd later have were still a long way off; Kors displayed the collection laid out on his bed in his apartment. From these humble beginnings, he soon picked up celebrity fans like Barbara Walters and earned awards for his designs.In 1990, however, Kors; company was forced to reorganize under Chapter 11 bankruptcy. After getting back on his feet, Kors launched KORS Michael Kors, a lower-priced line. He also became the creative director of Celine, a French fashion house, in 1997. In the six years he held that position, he continued to expand his own brand, launching menswear, accessory and perfume lines. In 2003, he won the coveted Menswear Designer of the Year award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, the most prestigious prize in American fashion.Project RunwayIn 2004, Kors was asked to be a judge on a new reality television show called Project Runway. He almost turned it down. "Reality show? Fashion on television?" Kors recalled thinking. "I thought that only fashionista freaks, gays and men wanting to see Heidi Klum in a short dress would watch it." He was wrong. The show premiered on December 1, 2004, and became an immediate hit with fans and critics. Kors's quips and blunt criticisms were fan favorites, and he continued as a judge in subsequent seasons. Viewers of Project Runway often commented on his perennial tan, a  source of pride for the beach-loving Kors. "Now that Valentino has  retired, I believe someone must wave the too-tanned flag," the designer  joked. In 2012, Kors announced that he would be retiring from Project Runway. By that time, the series had garnered several Emmy Award nominations, among other honors.Personal LifeJust a few weeks after gay marriage became legal in New York, Kors married his longtime partner Lance La Pere, vice president of Michael Kors Women's Design in August 2011. The pair had first met in 1990 when La Pere was an intern at the company.Countless celebrities wear his garments, and U.S. first lady Michelle Obama posed in a Michael Kors dress for her first official portrait. With new lines constantly in production and more customers drawn in by his Project Runway appearances, Kors's fashion empire continues to grow.Fact CheckWe strive for accuracy and fairness.

    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Michael Kors is an American fashion designer that is looking to continue on the growth
path that has been set through the company’s past and recent success. In the beginning,
that path was rough and full of setbacks, but currently the Michael Kors brand is receiving
recognition for its stability and accomplishments within the apparel industry.

After research and analysis of the company and its competitors was performed, a list
of strategies and actions were developed. The strategic goals that have been set for the
company are:
• Increase revenue by 30% in 2014
• Increase market share to 13% in 5 years
• Introduce new products via a men’s accessories line, a children’s line and a sports line
• Keep prices stable or increase to grow profits
• Increase Facebook and Twitter followings by 5% each month

In order to achieve these goals, there are several strategies that need to be implemented.
Prices of products must be increased or remain the same; no discounting should be
used. Awareness needs to be increased, new channels should be found and new products
should be developed. Product differentiation and innovation are of the utmost importance
to set the brand apart from its competitors. Strategic alliances will allow the company to
grow into avenues that it has not previously experimented with. Limiting availability is also
another tactic to increase demand. Finally, maintaining brand integrity allows Michael
Kors to continue on the path to success.

The steps that are proposed are in line with the goals of the company and facilitate
growth. Michael Kors must implement these strategies in a timely manner, continue to
create innovation within the apparel industry and continually measure/reevaluate the
strategies and actions to see if changes or adjustments should be made to benefit the
brand.

    OVERVIEW
Michael Kors is a global luxury lifestyle brand with a jet-set aesthetic that combines
elements of style, elegance and sport. The company was established in 1981 and is led by
Michael Kors, a prominent fashion designer based in New York City. The business operates in
three different segments: retail, wholesale and licensing. Their goods are sold in companyoperated retail stores, leading department stores, specialty stores and through carefully
selected licensing partners.

MICHAEL KORS

THE AMERICAN FASHION ICON

Michael Kors is the founder, designer and Honorary Chairman and Chief Creative Officer
for Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS). He is a fashion icon who not only designs
clothing and accessories, but is also known for his appearances as a judge on the Emmynominated Project Runway. He was born Karl Anderson, Jr. on Long Island, New York in
1959. He is half Scandinavian and half Jewish. His mother was a former Revlon model and
his father was a college student. His mother was remarried when he was five and he took
the surname of Kors, his stepfather’s name. His mother allowed him to choose a new first
name as well, and the name Michael David Kors was born.
Michael was exposed to the fashion industry through his mother’s career as a model. As a
child he decided he would either become a movie star or a fashion designer. At the age of
4 he was in cereal commercials and when he was a teenager he studied acting in Manhattan. He
began designing his own clothes around the same time and sold them out of his parents’
basement. Eventually he attended the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. He
began school in 1977, but dropped out nine months later.

        6.
      
    Next he moved on to work for Lothar’s, a boutique on 57th Street in New York. He clothed
many women here including celebrities like Cher and Diana Ross while learning valuable
lessons about the fashion business. Eventually Kors decided that he could design better
than the clothing that he was selling, so he launched his womenswear line in 1982 at Saks
Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman. His clothing was an instant hit and Michael Kors
became a relevant name in the fashion industry.
Kors has received many honors throughout his career, but most recently in 2013, he was
selected for The Time 100, Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the
world. He is also noted for participating in and helping causes such as world hunger, HIV/
AIDS and cancer research.

collectionS
The company is based on two different collections: the Michael Kors collection is the
luxury segment of the brand and the MICHAEL Michael Kors collection is a more accessible
luxury collection. Both collections offer accessories, apparel and footwear.

Michael Kors collection
The items in this collection are made from the highest quality materials such as leather
and other exotic skins. The handbags and small leather goods retail from $500 to $6,000
while the footwear ranges from $300 to $1,200 and the apparel retails from $400 to $4,000.

MICHAEL Michael Kors collection
The Michael Michael Kors collection focuses on handbags and accessories, but also
includes footwear and womenswear. The accessories include small leather goods (such
as clutches and wallets, wristlets and cosmetic cases) as well as women’s footwear and
dresses, tops, pants, jeans, skirts, shorts and outerwear. The handbags retail from $200 to
$800, the small leather goods are from $45 to $200, the footwear retails from $70 to $500
and the women’s clothing retails from $50 to $500. This collection is much more accessible
and affordable to those who want the “Michael Kors look” without the high price tag.

    BACKGROUND/HISTORY

Kors has become a household name after many years of struggles. Here he rings the opening bell of the NYSE in December 2011.

Although it may seem that the Michael Kors brand has become a success overnight due to
his recent popularity, it took years of hard work and dedication in making Kors’ vision and
dream a reality. After 32 years of creating simplicity, luxury and comfort, Kors has reached
great heights, especially recently as he continues to surpass other well-known brands in
the same category. It was not always this way, though.
In the early 1990s, the brand faced many financial setbacks that even forced Kors to
discontinue the more affordable line for quite some time. He was unable to execute his
complete vision for the accessories and perfume line in the early stages of the company
because of the lack of funds. The company was forced to reorganize under Chapter 11
bankruptcy.
The setbacks only made Kors more hungry for success. Earlier this year he was named
one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people, an honor that not many ever achieve.
Zac Posen, a younger notable designer, had this to say about Kors: “When I started
designing fashion in high school, around 1996, Michael Kors was the epitome of the
new look of American sportswear: elegant luxury, easy glamour and effortless chic. His
clothes merged the worlds of fashion and accessibility, which isn’t easy — there was a
sense of cleanliness in his designs. Nearly two decades later, Michael is poised to become
fashion’s next billionaire. It takes a great deal of resilience and staying power to last for
decades, and it’s a testament to Michael’s very clear vision.”
On top of the Michael Kors brand, Michael held the title of creative director for Celine in
1997. While he was working there for 6 years, he continued to work on and expand his own
line. The brand gained the most notoriety when he became a judge on Project Runway,
which he almost turned down. It was perhaps his greatest move that propelled him to the
stardom that he has today. In 2012 he stepped down from the role, but still makes guest
appearances as a judge from time to time.

    CULTURE
The company culture at Michael Kors is customer focused, as Kors is constantly looking
for ways to outfit the modern woman/man according to his or her needs. When entering
the retail stores this is evident in the way that the customer is treated. Those who work for
the company put an emphasis on pleasing the customer and finding the right products for
him or her.
When looking at the employee satisfaction, there is a high level of respect for the company.
Employees note that MK takes the time to train each individual to know the brand and to
properly convey the correct image. Websites such as indeed.com include mostly favorable
reviews from those who have worked for or currently work for the company. From the
very beginning, Michael has made a strong commitment to pleasing the customer which
is reflected in the way that the staff is trained. The in-store experience is high class and
reflects the “luxury” positioning of the brand.

Employer reviews show that the company is focused on training employees to be brand ambassadors. Source: indeed.com

    MARKET POSITION
Michael Kors is a leader in its category within the luxury goods industry. The following
share performance graph indicates how their stock has been performing in relation to
competitors such as Coach, Inc., Guess, Inc. PVH Corp, Limited Brands and the Ralph
Lauren Corporation.

The market share of Michael Kors is quite respectable for the apparel industry. While
Ralph Lauren, Louis Vuitton and Gucci make up a large part of the market, Kors is not far
behind. Ralph Lauren remains the only direct competitor that has a higher showing. This
is expected for a brand that has such a rich history.

    SWOT ANALYSIS

15

 
  


        17.
      
    [S]TRENGTHS
Resilience: The first strength of the Michael Kors brand is the fact that it is resilient. The
company has great brand managers have rescued the brand from a period when the quality
was not so high. They have been able to raise the prices on the product thus allowing the
quality to go up as well.
Segmented brand: The fact that Michael Kors offers two different lines: the Michael Kors
Collection and Michael Michael Kors allows the brand to reach a larger audience. While
the Collection may not be accessible to the general population, MK has created a more
affordable line that is still considered high-quality, but at a fraction of the price. This allows
those who cannot afford the Collection to feel as if they are a part of the MK brand. Reaching
a larger audience enables Kors to become more well-known and popular.
Celebrity Factor: Michael Kors embodies the jet set lifestyle that he promotes in his
brand. He is recognizable because of the fact that he has put himself in the public spotlight
as an ambassador for the brand. His appearances on Project Runway have enables him
to reach the viewers as well as celebrities. Michelle Obama and Heidi Klum, for example,
are known for wearing MK. When the general population sees these celebrities wearing
his clothing, shoes and accessories, they want to emulate their favorite stars and own the
same items.
Philanthropy: Fashion is not the only priority for Michael Kors. He has received numerous
honors for his philanthropic work. In 2013 he was listed on The Time 100 list, which names
him as one of the 100 most influential people of the world. For the last 20 years he has
been involved with God’s Love We Deliver, a non-profit organization that delivers meals
to people living with HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening illnesses. He is also known for
working to further cancer research.
High-quality goods and suppliers: The Michael Kors brand is known for producing high-quality
goods and that is also reflected in the suppliers that they work with. The licensing deals
with Fossil, Marchon and Estée Lauder are an example of this. These three brands have
great reputations and enhance the overall quality of MK. For those who cannot afford a
Louis Vuitton bag, for example, Michael Kors provides an alternative that is stylish and
fashion forward.
Jet Set style: Michael Kors associates himself and his brand with a “jet set” style that
personifies an individual who travels around the world in style. In a high economy, this
standard is not only something that the consumer desires, but is also attainable. The
everyday business woman, for example, can purchase clothes, shoes and accessories
from the brand that give her a “high class” feeling. MK’s print ads as well as online
promotion remain consistent with this ideal.

16

 
  


        18.
      
    “Jet Set Style” includes imagery of yachts, private jets and glamorous parties in upscale locations. These are just a few examples of the
ads that the Michael Kors brand has used over the years.

The subjects in Kors’ ads are most often about to board a private jet or are hanging out
on a yacht in the French Riviera. Wearing the MK brand can make anyone feel as if they
are jet setting, even though in reality they are sitting on the couch reading a magazine or
commuting to the office. The standard of luxury at an attainable price is a strength for the
brand.

17

 
  


        19.
      
    [W]EAKNESSES
Brand dilution: Since the Michael Kors brand is known for its high class jet set style, one
would not expect to find its products in bargain/discount stores such as Loehmann’s Ross,
Marshall’s or TJ Maxx. Unfortunately, MK’s products can regularly be found here, which
in turn dilutes the brand. While this availability makes it more accessible to lower income
people, the standard that the brand sets is more upscale than these bargain basements.
Those who are paying full price may become skeptical and find another brand that is not
as easy to attain.
Jet set in a low economy: When the economy takes a turn for the worse, consumers are
more concerned about buying necessities rather than achieving the “jet set” lifestyle.
Priorities change and high-priced handbags, jewelry, shoes and other accessories are no
longer as important as they were in a high economy. Income becomes discretionary and
people become much more cautious in their spending habits.
Michael as the face of the brand: Michael Kors himself personifies the brand image and
is a crucial part of the overall look. There is no successor to the brand as he does not have
children or relatives who would take over. The fact that he is so hands on and the brand
relies on him is a strength now, but if anything were to happen to him, the future of MK
could be in jeopardy. Similar situations have occurred with other brands such as when
Gianni Versace was murdered. Luckily his sister was able to take over and revitalize a
brand that was linked with his image, but with no successor, MK could fail.
Global impact: Michael Kors defines his brand by creating a worldly feel, and the global
presence has become greater in recent years; however, the brand is still much more
relevant in the United States than anywhere else in the world. Michael himself is known as
an “American fashion icon,” but wants to expand his brand to gain much more importance
throughout the world. To increase this presence, more stores must be opened outside of
the US and heavy marketing must be done to make other countries aware of them.

18

 
  


        20.
      
    [O]PPORTUNITIES
Global expansion: The weakness of lesser presence of the brand globally can be solved
through expansion throughout the world. This gives the brand a chance to enhance their
current image and increase sales. In addition to pushing the product globally, Kors can
use his philanthropy angle on a larger scale. He has begun to do this with the #watchhungerstop
project where he has teamed up with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in
the fight against hunger throughout the world. Rather than focusing on issues in the US, a
more global outlook could benefit the brand. #watchhungerstop is a step in this direction.

International philanthropy will help to increase brand recognition throughout the world and expand the brand beyond the US.

Purchase more brands and develop them: By using the profits from the Michael Kors
brand, he could purchase and develop more brands to include in his portfolio. This would
not only increase sales and profits, but also add more variety to the brand.
Children’s products: Currently, Kors focuses on women, with a smaller collection for
men. His collections do not include children, which could be key for company growth.
While women and men want to attain the jet set lifestyle, they often have families. The traditional
family from the past is now history and parents are including their children in their travels
and lifestyle choices. There is a wide variety of clothing, shoes and accessories offered for
children and Michael Kors could capitalize on this with a brand such as “Mikey” Michael
Kors, which plays off the MK name and gives it a fun youthful feeling.
Sub-Branding: The Michael Kors Collection can be unattainable for some while the Michael
Michael Kors brand is more attainable to the general population; however, there is still
room for a brand extension that caters to a lower budget. Companies like Ralph Lauren

19

 
  


        21.
      
    have several different lines that are accommodating to every budget and fit different price
points. If Michael Kors wanted to extend his line even further, he could create “Mike”
Michael Kors. The shortened name reflects lower prices and a more casual attitude. This
would allow those who could not previously afford the other lines to get in on the overall
jet set feeling.
Men’s line: While the current focus of the brand is on women as the target market, there
are great opportunities to further develop the men’s line. Men are no longer simply being
dressed by their girlfriends/wives; they care about how they look and put a lot of effort into
their personal style. Since Michael himself embodies this style, he is the brand ambassador
for modern men. Men are now picking up GQ and Esquire magazine to get ideas on how
they should dress. By advertising more frequently in these publications, men can get a
better feel for the brand’s message.

20

 
  


        22.
      
    [T]HREATS
European debt crisis/Chinese economic bubble: Just as Michael Kors looks to expand his
brand to the rest of the world, the European deb crisis is an extreme threat. As previously
mentioned, when the economy takes a downturn, people are no longer spending the way
that they used to. This has a negative impact on the brand’s expansion. MK must find a
way to market products in a light that shows them as being affordable, which is possible
with the Michael Michael Kors brand. This brand is much cheaper than brands such as
Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Gucci or Chanel for example. It is important to emphasize this and
show that the brand is a high-quality yet cheaper alternative.
United States Government Shutdown: The problem that is occurring overseas is also a
threat in the United States, especially with the recent government shutdown. The shutdown
caused a major panic where consumers were not purchasing anything while waiting to see
what would ultimately happen. The situation could even push us back into a recession and
a down economy is not ideal for a brand that pushes a jet set lifestyle. Frivolous purchases
are no longer a priority when people are struggling to buy necessities.
Increase in textile prices: An increase in textile prices could force the brand to charge
more for products, which would make it less accessible. On the other hand, if Michael
Kors were to use cheaper textiles, the brand’s quality would decrease significantly. This
would, in turn, cause them to lose customers and brand loyalty.
Cancelled contracts: Fossil, Marchon and Estée Lauder are very important as partners
with the Michael Kors brand. If contracts were cancelled by any of these companies it
would put MK into a situation where he would have to find new partners. There are long-standing
relationships with these other brands and ending them could tarnish the image of MK
and/or lower the standard of quality depending upon which companies replace them.
Generation gap: Currently Michael Kors is popular with certain generations, specifically
for career minded women who are sophisticated. The clothing/accessories and shoes are
targeted toward this market, but the question remains as to how well the company will
do when this market becomes too old for the look that he sells. Will the next generation
embrace MK in the same way that the current one does? Or will they find a new style icon
that fits them better?

    REVIEW/SUMMARY OF SWOT ANALYSIS

Kors is strong in the US, but the true test will be how well he can perform in China, a country that loves luxury goods.

Based on this SWOT analysis, it is evident that the Michael Kors brand has many
strengths, which is why they are a fierce competitor in the apparel industry. Michael Kors
himself is an asset to the brand and his celebrity friends help him to gain notoriety and
popularity. The current economy is not only a weakness, but also a threat to their sales;
however, this is a factor that is affecting the entire industry and is not unique to Kors.
The company should increase their presence overseas, especially in China, where luxury
goods are very popular. They also have a great opportunity to expand the brand to include
more items for men and add children into the mix. The combination of these two opportunities
creates a powerful combination that can take Kors to the next level.

    IV. SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS

23

 
  


        25.
      
    INDUSTRY SERVED
The current state of the apparel industry is up in the air due to the economic downturn.
This unfavorable condition, paired with the fact that we only make 2 percent of our clothing domestically, could lead to even greater problems. The industry in general has hit hard
times as commodity costs are increasing, populations are growing and resources are becoming
much more scarce. In addition to those factors, there is an intense need for social responsibility
in this industry.
When Bill Clinton was in the White House, he made great efforts and strides towards
regulating the apparel industry. His White House Apparel Industry Partnership helped to
establish rules and regulations regarding labor issues including sweatshops overseas.
Currently, there are more sweatshops in China and Southeast Asia, which makes it much
more difficult to regulate due to distance, language and cultural barriers. President
Obama has been under a microscope when it comes to these issues, mainly because he
has not commented on tragedies involving garment workers who make clothing for US
companies. Within two months there was a factory collapse in Bangladesh that killed over
1,110 garment workers and then 2 people died in a shoe factory that collapsed in Cambodia.
Another issue that plagues the industry is the use of underage models to promote clothing
in ads and on the runway. This goes along with the current lack of social responsibility.
This past summer, legislation was passed in New York that limits the amount of hours a
model under 18 can work. The industry is also working on promoting healthier bodies and
supposedly discourages eating disorders and waif-like models. This has yet to be seen
from many fashion houses, though, as they often put models that are underweight on the
runway.
According to Interbrand’s 100 Best Global Brands for 2013, the major apparel industry leaders
include Louis Vuitton (#17), H&M (#21), Nike (#24), Zara (#36), Gucci (#38), Hermes (#54),
Adidas (#55), Prada (#72), Burberry (#77), Ralph Lauren (#88) and Gap (#100). The fact
that more affordable brands such as H&M and Zara appear near the top of the list reflects
the current economic situation.
Designers and retailers both are not expecting much improvement in sales for this current
holiday season; their exact prediction: slow growth. On top of that, there are six fewer days
between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, which leaves less time for shopping as
well as impulse purchases. One source of hope for apparel manufacturers is the ease of
online shopping, which is more prevalent than ever.

24

 
  


        26.
      
    MARKETS SERVED
Michael Kors serves more than one market due to his wide variety of products and pricing. The
luxury line serves a high-end clientele while his more affordable line is targeted toward
the middle class who would like to appear to have the top of the line brand at a fraction of
the price.
The markets served can be broken down as follows:
The Affluent Market Segment: There are only certain people who can afford Michael
Kors, especially when it comes to the high end line. However, there is a greater amount of
people that can afford this brand than extreme luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton. The
chart below details the “rise of the mass affluent,” which shows that the population that
is considered middle income is rising while the higher income is rising as well. While the
middle income is rising, they aspire to feel like the higher income. Michael Kors is going
after the mass affluent market and capitalizes on the fact that the middle income want to
feel like the high income, so they created the more affordable “Michael Michael Kors” line.

25

 
  


        27.
      
    The Gender Market Segment: Michael Kors appeals to mainly women in his strategy,
and with good reason. The majority of household expenditures on apparel are courtesy
of women rather than men. The chart below indicates that in all age groupings, women
clearly spend more than men on apparel. Men are leaving this responsibility up to their
spouses, which is why Michael Kors is strategically targeting women.

Even when it comes to shopping online, women are more likely to pay attention to marketing
emails than men. Kors’ aggressive online approach is another avenue to get women interested
in his products. The online/social media factor will be covered in more detail later in the plan.

26

 
  


        28.
      
    The Age Market Segment: Women and men alike all want to feel young. Rather than identifying
with their own age group or an older group, they would most often consider themselves
as a part of a younger age group. This lack of acceptance makes them feel as if they are
more hip and trendy than their peer group. For this reason, Michael Kors appeals to many
age groups. Currently the brand is in high demand by a young generation. Many of these
customers are living at home as opposed to spending money to rent their own place. This
leaves them with an abundance of discretionary income because they are not paying for
housing. When this income is not consumed by rent, there are many options for the 18-31
year olds. They can easily purchase clothing and accessories that make them feel as if
they are part of the “cool” crowd, thus fitting in with their peers.
The following chart indicates that the amount of 18-31 year olds living at home has been
steadily increasing from 2007 to 2012. In 2012, the highest amount of 18-24 year olds were
living at home while the 25-31 year olds had only dropped off by .5%. The steady increase
overall is expected to continue as rents are raised. The economic downturn forced more
young people to live with their parents, even if they had jobs.

27

 
  


        29.
      
    The Geographic Market Segment: The Michael Kors brand has been known as an “American”
brand since it was founded. While he has continued to slowly expand into other markets,
there is a great need to expand into more countries, China being the most important. The
growth potential in that part of the world is huge at the moment and Kors needs to capitalize
on this. The chart below illustrates that the Chinese prefer to purchase brands that are
well-known internationally. This even overtakes superior craftsmanship in the leather category.
The Chinese are being driven by perception, and if Michael Kors becomes a popular brand
worldwide, then they would be more likely to purchase the products.

28

 
  


        30.
      
    Customers Based on Purchase Behaviors
When it comes to purchase behaviors for the Michael Kors brand, there are four main
groups of customers. These customers buy based on their values. The values are as follows:

PRICE CONSIDERATION
These are the people that buy based on their income. They spend in accordance with what
they earn and attempt to purchase products that will not “break the bank,” so to speak.
They look for deals and discounts and the Michael Michael Kors brand is perfect for the
careful spender as they can feel as if they own a luxury product, but are paying a lower
price for it because it is not Kors’ top of the line.

QUALITY CONSIDERATION
This group of customers consists of those who buy based on the quality factor. Kors’ products
are known for using high-quality materials and they are also known for their craftsmanship.
This group will purchase the brand because they know that the goods are not going to fall
apart and will age well over time.

CHANNEL CONSIDERATION
The internet has created an entirely new avenue for customers to purchase products.
There are customers that will only purchase items online due to the ease and comfort of
shopping at home and having them delivered to them. On the other hand, there are customers that
prefer to go into a store, look at the product and deal with a person rather than a computer.
The fact that Kors has perfected both of these avenues bodes well for the company. Keeping
a strong relationship with online clients as well as in-person shoppers allows the company
to stay relevant in this technological era.

EGO CONSIDERATION
Most shoppers enjoy feeding their egos through purchasing high-end items. Michael
Kors sells products that fit in this category. There are customers who want to always have
something that their friends do not have and high-priced items are often a way to achieve
this. This is especially prevalent when it comes to Kors’ luxury line.

29

 
  


        31.
      
    COMPETITION
Michael Kors faces intense competition from other companies in the industry. The company’s
top competitor is Coach, Inc. Two other top competitors are Ralph Lauren Corporation and
Marc Jacobs. The following is an analysis on the three main competitors.

COACH
Coach began as a leather-goods maker in a Manhattan loft in 1941. They began as Gail
Leather Products, but changed their name to Coach Products, Inc in the mid-70s. The
company currently sells accessories that include handbags, wallets and watches in their
stores as well as in boutiques in select department stores and specialty retailers.
There was a long period where Coach was number one in their space, until Michael Kors
slowly came in and began to steal customers. Recently there has been a great deal of
buzz in the fashion industry about the performance of the Coach stock vs. Michael Kors’
stock. Kors has been on a steady climb while Coach has been falling. This holiday season
has shown that within the younger audience especially, Kors is the top choice. Coach has
become stale and “older” as of late and the brand needs to address this in order to remain
competitive.

The Coach shopping experience is the closest competition for Kors. The look and feel of the stores are even very similar.

30

 
  


        32.
      
    COACH SWOT ANALYSIS

While Coach is known for their quality leather goods and accessories, the brand has become
diluted because of the fact that they have a large amount of outlet stores. This fact can
lead to customers not seeing the prestige of the brand as they had in the past since everyone
can own a Coach item; therefore, it is no longer “luxury.” Like Kors, the company is more
American than global and needs further expansion overseas. The changes in trends indicate
that Coach needs to change their looks to be in line with the times. Their social media
presence is also lacking compared to their competitors. It seems that they are resistant to
the current social media boom and need to catch up to Kors in that area.

31

 
  


        33.
      
    RALPH LAUREN
Ralph Lauren is a company that designs, markets and sells clothing, accessories, home
furnishings and fragrances to men, women and children worldwide. It was founded in
1967 by Ralph Lauren, a notable American designer. Polo Ralph Lauren is the flagship
brand while there are several other brands under the company name. Those labels include:
Ralph Lauren Black Label, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Ralph Lauren Blue Label, Lauren
Ralph Lauren, Club Monaco and Chaps.
Ralph Lauren has had great success in marketing his products due to the fact that the
labels cover many different looks an feel while remaining true to the brand image at the
same time. The looks are much more traditional than Kors’ and tend to appeal to an older
audience than those who are fond of Kors. The diversity of the brand ranges from red
carpet gowns to athletic wear for sporting events. Ralph Lauren is known for having his
clothes in the Olympics as well as in numerous sporting events throughout the world.

Ralph Lauren offers a more “classic” look and feel to their stores and products than Kors.

32

 
  


        34.
      
    RALPH LAUREN SWOT ANALYSIS

Ralph Lauren’s rich history and broad range of products are an asset to the company.
There are, however, issues that come with that. The classic looks may be preferred by an
older audience that is more traditional. They may want to create another line that is more
modern and appeals to the audience that is interested in Kors’ updated looks. Ralph Lauren
also needs to increase their social media presence. While many lawsuits and controversies
have plagued the company, they need to focus on PR and finding a way to engage the
younger crowd.

33

 
  


        35.
      
    MARC JACOBS
Perhaps the only direct competitor that sells designs that are trendy with the younger
market that Kors is currently dominating is Marc Jacobs. Marc is another well-known
American fashion designer who began his career designing for high-profile companies. In
1993 he launched his own company, Marc Jacobs International Company, L.P. In 2001 he
introduced the Marc by Marc Jacobs line, which is in direct competition with the Michael
Michael Kors line.
Marc Jacobs has been met with many challenges and controversies for years. Between
plagiarism accusations and other lawsuits, he has continued to create fun designs that
resonate with a younger audience. The different price points of the two lines make it more
accessible than other luxury companies and a threat to Kors and his different lines.
Jacobs continues to use his creative director status of different companies such as Louis
Vuitton and Diet Coke to keep his name fresh and to make sure his image is constantly
evolving. He currently has about 300 stores in 60 countries.

Marc Jacobs is perhaps the only competitor that captures the trendy look as well as Kors. However, their sales are not as high.

34

 
  


        36.
      
    MARC JACOBS SWOT ANALYSIS

While Marc Jacobs is very similar to the Michael Kors brand, Marc himself has caused a
lot of controversy throughout his career. He has not only been accused of plagiarizing the
design of a scarf from another designer, but it was recently discovered that the “faux” fur
that he uses in some of his garments is actually fur from raccoon dogs in China. The company has great opportunities to capitalize on its social media popularity and compete with
Kors on that level, but Jacobs’ flamboyant and outspoken personality tend to get him in
trouble.

35

 
  


        37.
      
    Technology and Innovation
The Michael Kors brand is known for constant changes and innovation in the new lines
that are presented each season. The “jet set” style is the underlying focus of every collection,
but there are always new twists presented. The inspirations, fabric choices and designs
are constantly evolving.
The customer experience with the brand is their number one priority. By interviewing several
Michael Kors team members at one of the company’s stores, it is evident that a luxury
experience is the main priority. The most important goal is to make the customers feel
comfortable and welcomed rather than to simply try to make a sale. The innovation in the
overall experience enhances the brand image without pushing items on the customer.

The iphone 5 & 5S clutch is a technological innovation from Kors. It is also one of the products that is also sold at the Apple Store.

Another factor that enhances the Michael Kors brand is that he is up to date with technology.
When cell phones became popular, women were looking for a fashionable way to carry
them without having the hassle of losing them in their purses. Michael Kors came out with
designs that included cell phone pockets. Recently, the wristlet became very popular, as it
is a way for a woman to carry a phone, credit cards and cash without having to use a large
purse. Michael has specifically designed these wristlets with the right dimensions and
pockets to hold a phone. He has also designed presentation cases for ipads, which are a
stylish way for women to carry their tablets to work or just for fun.

36

 
  


        38.
      
    Michaelkors.com and destinationkors.com provide a shopper with style ideas and innovation.

The Michael Kors website is a technological innovation as well. It enables the customer
to view the items, learn about them and to also find out more about the company’s vision
through their blog, destinationkors.com.
While remaining innovative and incorporating technology, Michael Kors uses these factors
to promote helping important causes. He has created campaigns that benefit the less
fortunate, with the latest being #watchhungerstop, which has helped deliver millions of
meals to those who cannot afford to eat.

37

 
  


        39.
      
    Twitter, Facebook and Instagram: just three of the many social media platforms that Kors is dominating at the moment.

As a technologically savvy brand, Michael Kors is active on all social media platforms. He
posts on Facebook, tweets on Twitter, gains followers on Tumblr and posts images on
Instagram. He is quick to adapt to new platforms and sees that social media is not just a
fad. The amount of followers that he has on these sites is overwhelming compared to his
competitors.

    IV. STRATEGIC MARKETING PLAN

        41.
      
    ASSUMPTIONS

The assumptions that I have for the Michael Kors brand are:

• Sales goals will be up for the year 30%-40% based on the past growth.
• Market share will grow, especially in the accessories space since
it is growing across the board on a worldwide scale.
• New markets will be expanded into China
• New consumer groups will include men and children
• Prices will go up at the rate of inflation (3-5% increase)
• Incentives such as a loyalty program will be added
• Strategic Alliances will be made including the men’s/sports
market and expanding into a new market: children

        44.
      
    STRATEGIES/ACTIONS-GOAL #1
Increase revenue by 30% in 2014

INCREASE PRICE OF PRODUCT
In order to increase the prices of the products in the Michael Kors lines, an ultra-premium
label (MK Michael Kors) should be introduced. This should be included at the top of the
brand and consist of items that are high-quality and produced in small amounts. Only the
highly affluent customers will be able to afford these products, which will cause others to
aspire to be on this level. These items, made in small quantities, will increase demand and
the popularity will rise because of the limited amounts.

INCREASE AWARENESS
Social media, product placement and PR are all actions that support this strategy. By
creating buzz, especially online, the brand will become even more prevalent than it is
currently. A social media campaign will be implemented that combines the Kors celebrity
factor. Through online contests, customers who purchase products and share their
experiences will be entered to win a day with one of Kors’ celebrity influencers that he
has used in the past/present to promote the brand.
Traditional advertising will also be continued. Magazine ads, billboards and TV commercials
will all be reevaluated regarding how effective they have been in the past. Changes will be
made, if necessary and new campaigns will be created to increase awareness.

FIND NEW CHANNELS
Currently, the most promising international channel is China. The fact that the country’s
inhabitants are obsessed with purchasing luxury goods helps Kors to expand his presence
overseas on an international level. By opening stores in China and advertising in a way
that will impress the Chinese people, Kors could become a new competitor in the luxury
goods market.

NEW PRODUCT INNOVATION
Research and Development is the key in new product innovation. The brand has become
very popular based on its unique looks that make women feel beautiful. Through extensive
research, Kors can continue his development of these products. By including new lines
for men and children, he can take the brand to a new level. Men’s accessories are a must,
judging by the international demand for them. New lines and items will support the goal of
increasing revenue.

43

 
  


        45.
      
    STRATEGIES/ACTIONS-GOAL #2
Increase market share from 6.6% to 13% in five years

FIND NEW CHANNELS
By going more global with the jet set lifestyle look, the customer base will expand and the
market share will steadily increase. As previously mentioned, China is the main target for
opening more stores. Not only is it important for Kors to utilize this channel, but also for
him to find out what the Chinese are looking for and do extensive research before further
entering the market. Development of products that are important to the population in
China will give them the edge over brands who simply release the same products in China
as in the US. R&D is important when completing this task.
Another way to go about this is to also add more stores in the United States. The proper
research needs to be conducted to decide where more stores are needed. Simply adding
new stores is not always helpful, so strategically placing these stores is important.

PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION
In order to gain a larger portion of the market share, the products must be differentiated
from others in the same market. Demonstration of quality and unique features is a must.
By not discounting the products as well, the customer will see the value in the brand an
view it as a top tier brand rather than something that can be found in a bargain bin. Kors
must not allow his product to be sold in discount stores such as Ross or TJ Maxx. These
stores dilute the quality of the brand as a while.
The website now includes a blog that Kors uses to promote his products in everyday use.
This site and blog can be further enhanced by creating a new section: “What makes us
different.” This section would detail the innovations that separate Kors from other brands.
For example, the partnership with Apple is a point of difference as other companies in his
category are not partnered with them. Kors needs to outline the key features on the products,
such as the iphone clutch that was mentioned earlier in this plan.

44

 
  


        46.
      
    STRATEGIES/ACTIONS-GOAL #3
Include Michael Kors Men’s Accessories, a sports clothing
line as well as a children’s line within 3 years

PRODUCT INNOVATION
Not only is it important for Kors to introduce new products, but it is also necessary for
him to create products that are innovative and different from that of the direct competition.
Innovation in any industry will be copied as soon as it is implemented, which makes it
important to continually conduct research and develop products according to the needs of
the market.

PRODUCT EXPANSION
Rather than simply creating new products, expanding upon existing products is also a
must. Research and development is again key for this to succeed. Existing products
become “old” as soon as they are in the stores because there are new features that are
always being introduced.
By creating a children’s line, a key expansion will be made that opens an entirely new
market segment for Kors. This could put him in front of the competition that has not yet
entered this arena. It is crucial that the expansion makes sense. For example, Kors can
design children’s clothing, but also focus on children’s accessories. By expanding in this
area, he will have an edge due to the fact that he is already well-known for his women’s accessories.

STRATEGIC ALLIANCE
Aligning with other companies has worked well for Kors as outlined earlier in this plan.
In order to come out with the proposed sports line, Kors should first experiment with this
idea by partnering with Nike to create a limited-edition Kors for Nike line. This alliance
would allow him to test the waters without immersing himself completely. By using the
experience and notoriety of Nike as an asset, Kors would be exposed to the world of sports
clothing including learning the best methods and what materials should be used. This
partnership could be short term or continue based on sales and demand. Both Nike and
Kors come out as winners if it is a success.

45

 
  


        47.
      
    STRATEGIES/ACTIONS-GOAL #4
Prices are to remain stable or increase in time

MAINTAIN BRAND INTEGRITY
To keep the Michael Kors brand image at a premium status, the integrity of the brand
must be monitored at all times. Prices should remain stable or be raised in order to make
sure that the brand does not take on a “cheap” image. For this reason, there should be
absolutely NO discounting of the products. Apple is a company that follows this model to
much success. To appear luxurious, shoppers should not be grabbing at discount bins or
shopping for Kors’ products at a bargain store.
Since Kors’ products are also sold in stores such as Macy’s and Bloomingdales, those
companies will not be allowed to place the merchandise on sales that the stores are having.
For example, Macy’s coupons that apply to the entire store must have a clause on the back
that prohibits the coupon from being used on Kors’ products. This keeps the company on
track to keep prices stable or raise them.

LIMIT AVAILABILITY
In order to limit availability of the products and create buzz in the consumer’s mind, the
amount of SKUs should be increase while the quantity per SKU should decrease. This
makes the consumer believe that they are purchasing a product that is in high demand
because there are not many of them. Not only does this work for sales, but it also makes
them feel more important because they have something that not many other people have.

MAINTAIN OR INCREASE DEMAND
Social media and PR create buzz that helps Kors to increase demand of his products.
Using celebrities to display his products in public makes the brand appear chic and
important. Online contests via Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr enhance this strategy. By
creating a contest that allows users to win a day with their favorite celebrity, Kors creates
buzz that increases the memory of his products. If someone is entering the contest on a
social media site, he or she will be exposed to the products and may end up clicking on a
link to buy something.

46

 
  


        48.
      
    STRATEGIES/ACTIONS-GOAL #5
Increase Facebook likes/Twitter followers by 5% each month

INCREASE AWARENESS
In order to increase awareness of the brand, the use of social media must be optimized.
Currently, Kors is the clear leader when compared to his competitors, but in order to keep
up with Marc Jacobs, who is inching up on him slowly, he needs to remain transparent
and unique. The number of tweets/posts is not the key when it comes to social media; the
quality of each one is of the utmost importance. Marc Jacobs tweets almost twice as often
as Kors, but still does not have as many followers. Carefully crafted tweets and posts engage
the audience without overdoing it.

Other brands may tweet more than Kors, but his tweets are focused and targeted, which gain more followers in the long run.

Increasing awareness is easy when a brand is clear and authentic. Kors himself has one
Twitter account for himself/his brand, that way the customers do not become confused
and forced to follow two different accounts. Marc Jacobs, for example, has one account for
himself and another for his brand. This segmented approach creates uncertainty in followers
who may decide that following more than one account is not beneficial for them. People
want all of their information clearly laid out in one place. Jacobs may be losing followers
while Kors gains them in his clean approach.

Marc Jacobs attempts to clear up the confusion due to the segmentation of his brand on Twitter. Are people listening, though?

47

 
  


        49.
      
    DIFFERENTIATION
While increasing consumer awareness of the brand through social media platforms, the
brand must also be differentiated from its competitors. One point of differentiation is that
Kors himself composes most of the tweets for the brand. Often companies have generic
writers who tweet about the brand in general, but Kors makes sure his stamp of approval
is included with the tweets, therefore he becomes more genuine in the eyes of his followers.
Personal touches such as tweets that include photos of Kors in everyday situations make
him more real than a predictable and untouchable CEO.
One point of differentiation is that Kors is taking the time to become a strong presence on
Tumblr, which is where the young audience currently spends their time. Rather than relying
on the traditional avenues such as Facebook and Twitter, he takes his campaign to a different level.
This may be a reason that he resonates so well with the younger generation. Kors needs to
use this account to post contests/giveaways as well.

The rumor is that the kids are all on Tumblr, so Kors is, too. Adapting to trends is key in the apparel industry.

Another point of differentiation is Kors’ use of hashtags. His current hashtag is #WhatsInYourKors,
where followers are encouraged to share what they keep in their Michael Kors handbags.
They are invited to post words and images that can easily be searched by other followers.
This provides style inspiration from the community rather than Kors dictating what his
customers should be wearing/carrying. Kors needs to continue creating unique hashtags in
order to increase followers. This, along with contests, will attract more users.

#WhatsInYourKors encourages engagement and give Kors an authentic image

    SUMMARY/CONCLUSIONS
The current state of the economy in both the Unites States and the rest of the world has
created unfavorable conditions for the apparel industry. Michael Kors is one company that
is thriving despite these factors. Kors continues to climb the ladder of the industry and is
passing key competitors along the way. Coach, for example, held a much larger share of
the market at one time, but Kors is now surpassing the brand.
While Kors continues to differentiate his products from others in the market, he will have
to take several steps in order to continue to grow. The focus and goals of my marketing plan
include increasing revenue, increasing market share, introducing new products, maintaining
or increasing prices and increasing brand awareness through social media platforms.
Actions and strategies that were set forth support these goals. They include new product
innovation and current product expansion, finding new channels, forming strategic alliances,
maintaining brand integrity, limiting availability and product/brand differentiation.
The implementation of my strategic marketing plan will ensure that Kors’ brand continues
to thrive and grow for many years to come.

Personal life[edit]
Kors was born Karl Anderson, Jr.[5] on Long Island, New York, the son of Joan Hamburger, a former model, and her first husband, Karl Anderson, Sr, a college student.[6][7][8] His mother remarried Bill Kors when he was five, and his surname was changed to Kors. His mother told him that he could choose a new first name as well; subsequently he renamed himself Michael David Kors.[8] grew up in Merrick, New York and graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore, New York. Kors' mother is Jewish and his father was of Swedish descent.[5][9][10][11] Kors married his partner, Lance Le Pere, on August 16, 2011, in Southampton, New York.[2][12]
Career[edit]
Kors' affinity for fashion started when he was very young. His mother thought his affinity might have been caused in part by his exposure to the apparel industry through her modeling career.[13] Michael, at the age of five, even redesigned his mother's wedding dress for her second marriage.[14] As a teen, Kors began designing clothes and selling them out of his parents' basement, which he renamed the Iron Butterfly.[13] Kors also took acting lessons when he was young, but stopped when he was 14 when he decided to focus on becoming a fashion designer.[15]
In 1977, he enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City.[16] However, he dropped out after only nine months and took a job at a boutique called Lothar's across from Bergdorf Goodman on 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan, where he started as a salesperson and went on to become both the designer and visual display head for the store. Shortly after, Dawn Mello, the fashion director at Bergdorf's, discovered Kors. She asked if he would show his collection to Bergdorf Goodman's buyers and that was just the beginning.[17]
In 1981, Kors launched his Michael Kors women's label at Bergdorf Goodman. In 1990, the company launched KORS Michael Kors as a licensee. A Chapter 11 filing in 1993, caused by the closure of the licensing partner for KORS Michael Kors, forced him to put the KORS line on hold. He managed to get back on his feet by 1997 and launched a lower priced line and at the same time was named the first women’s ready-to-wear designer for French house Celine.[18] In his tenure at Celine, Kors turned the fashion house around with successful accessories and a critically acclaimed ready-to-wear line. Kors left Celine in October 2003 to concentrate on his own brand. Kors launched his menswear line in 2002.

The MICHAEL Michael Kors line was launched in 2004, joining the original Michael Kors Collection label. The MICHAEL Michael Kors line includes women's handbags and shoes as well as women's ready-to-wear apparel. As of the end of the first fiscal quarter in 2016, Kors has over 770 Lifestyle stores around the world. Currently, Kors has Collection boutiques in New York, Beverly Hills, Palm Beach, Chicago, Miami and Southampton. In the U.S, his women's runway collection, labeled Michael Kors Collection, is sold at Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and numerous specialty stores. Michael Kors Collection is also carried at the brand's stores in London, Paris, Cannes, Milan, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Seoul. The year 2016 marked the 35th anniversary of Kors' business.

Among the celebrities who have worn Kors' designs are Olivia Wilde, Dakota Johnson, Blake Lively, Kate Hudson, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Kate Middleton, Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lopez, Hillary Clinton, Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, Heidi Klum, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michelle Obama wore a black sleeveless dress from the designer for her first term official portrait as First Lady and later sported Kors again at the 2015 State of the Union address.[19] Viola Davis wore a custom Michael Kors Collection gown when accepting a Golden Globe for best supporting actress in a motion picture for her role in Fences. Kate Hudson and Olivia Wilde both wore gowns by the designer to the 2016 Golden Globes, and Emily Blunt, nominated for her role in Into The Woods, wore a white custom gown by the designer in 2015. Joan Allen wore his gown when she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in The Contender. As creative director of Celine, Kors designed many outfits for actresses to wear on screen, including Gwyneth Paltrow in Possession;[20] and Rene Russo in The Thomas Crown Affair.[21] One of his gowns was worn by Alicia Keys for her performance at Barack Obama's inaugural ball on January 21, 2013.[22]
The ad campaigns for Kors, shot by Mario Testino, often reflect the jet-set sportswear that his fans like. Previous campaigns include the model Carmen Kass on a safari in Africa and relaxing on a yacht. More recent campaigns feature models Joan Smalls and Freja Beha-Erichsen living the jet set lifestyle.
Kors was a judge on the Emmy-nominated reality television program Project Runway, which aired on Bravo for five seasons; subsequent seasons aired on Lifetime. On December 18, 2012, it was announced that Kors would be leaving Project Runway, to be replaced by fellow designer Zac Posen.[23]
In January 2014, Forbes reported that Kors now has a personal fortune in excess of $1billion, making him the latest fashion industry billionaire. Michael Kors Holdings had already “minted two billionaires”: Silas Chou and Lawrence Stroll.[24]
Other honors[edit]

2016: The World Food Programme honored Kors with the McGovern-Dole Leadership award, presented by former vice president Joe Biden.
2015: Named a Global Ambassador Against Hunger for the United Nations World Food Programme.
2015: God’s Love We Deliver dedicated the Michael Kors Building at the non-profit’s new SoHo headquarters in honor of Kors’ ongoing support.

2010: Kors was the youngest recipient ever of the Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and received the Fragrance Foundation’s FiFi Award for Lifetime Achievement.








Legal issues[edit]
In January 2009, the estate of the artist-designer Tony Duquette sued Kors for trademark infringement after Kors allegedly used Duquette's name and images in promoting Kors' 2009 resortwear collection.[25]
In July 2013, he became the second luxury brand, after Tiffany & Co, to sue Costco for falsely claiming in advertisements that they sold his product.[26][27]
In popular culture[edit]
Kors was referenced in the film The Devil Wears Prada by Meryl Streep's character, Miranda Priestly. In the scene, Priestly sweeps into her office and gives a list of instructions to her personal assistant (Emily Blunt). Priestly says, "RSVP 'yes' to Michael Kors' party and I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30 and pick me up at 9:45 sharp".[28]
Kors is also mentioned in Big Sean's song "Dance" by Nicki Minaj. Drake also mentions Michael Kors in his song "From Time", and rapper Pusha T in his song "Numbers on the Boards". Additionally, Kors guest starred as himself in a Fashion Week themed episode of the hit teen show Gossip Girl; the same show that repeatedly showcases several pieces from his collections.

In 1981, Kors launched his Michael Kors women's label at Bergdorf Goodman. In 1990, the company launched KORS Michael Kors as a licensee. A Chapter 11 filing in 1993, caused by the closure of the licensing partner for KORS Michael Kors, forced him to put the KORS line on hold. He managed to get back on his feet by 1997 and launched a lower priced line and at the same time was named the first women’s ready-to-wear designer for French house Celine.[18] In his tenure at Celine, Kors turned the fashion house around with successful accessories and a critically acclaimed ready-to-wear line. Kors left Celine in October 2003 to concentrate on his own brand. Kors launched his menswear line in 2002.

Personal life[edit]
Kors was born Karl Anderson, Jr.[5] on Long Island, New York, the son of Joan Hamburger, a former model, and her first husband, Karl Anderson, Sr, a college student.[6][7][8] His mother remarried Bill Kors when he was five, and his surname was changed to Kors. His mother told him that he could choose a new first name as well; subsequently he renamed himself Michael David Kors.[8] grew up in Merrick, New York and graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore, New York. Kors' mother is Jewish and his father was of Swedish descent.[5][9][10][11] Kors married his partner, Lance Le Pere, on August 16, 2011, in Southampton, New York.[2][12]
Career[edit]
Kors' affinity for fashion started when he was very young. His mother thought his affinity might have been caused in part by his exposure to the apparel industry through her modeling career.[13] Michael, at the age of five, even redesigned his mother's wedding dress for her second marriage.[14] As a teen, Kors began designing clothes and selling them out of his parents' basement, which he renamed the Iron Butterfly.[13] Kors also took acting lessons when he was young, but stopped when he was 14 when he decided to focus on becoming a fashion designer.[15]
In 1977, he enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City.[16] However, he dropped out after only nine months and took a job at a boutique called Lothar's across from Bergdorf Goodman on 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan, where he started as a salesperson and went on to become both the designer and visual display head for the store. Shortly after, Dawn Mello, the fashion director at Bergdorf's, discovered Kors. She asked if he would show his collection to Bergdorf Goodman's buyers and that was just the beginning.[17]
In 1981, Kors launched his Michael Kors women's label at Bergdorf Goodman. In 1990, the company launched KORS Michael Kors as a licensee. A Chapter 11 filing in 1993, caused by the closure of the licensing partner for KORS Michael Kors, forced him to put the KORS line on hold. He managed to get back on his feet by 1997 and launched a lower priced line and at the same time was named the first women’s ready-to-wear designer for French house Celine.[18] In his tenure at Celine, Kors turned the fashion house around with successful accessories and a critically acclaimed ready-to-wear line. Kors left Celine in October 2003 to concentrate on his own brand. Kors launched his menswear line in 2002.

Personal life[edit]
Kors was born Karl Anderson, Jr.[5] on Long Island, New York, the son of Joan Hamburger, a former model, and her first husband, Karl Anderson, Sr, a college student.[6][7][8] His mother remarried Bill Kors when he was five, and his surname was changed to Kors. His mother told him that he could choose a new first name as well; subsequently he renamed himself Michael David Kors.[8] grew up in Merrick, New York and graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore, New York. Kors' mother is Jewish and his father was of Swedish descent.[5][9][10][11] Kors married his partner, Lance Le Pere, on August 16, 2011, in Southampton, New York.[2][12]
Career[edit]
Kors' affinity for fashion started when he was very young. His mother thought his affinity might have been caused in part by his exposure to the apparel industry through her modeling career.[13] Michael, at the age of five, even redesigned his mother's wedding dress for her second marriage.[14] As a teen, Kors began designing clothes and selling them out of his parents' basement, which he renamed the Iron Butterfly.[13] Kors also took acting lessons when he was young, but stopped when he was 14 when he decided to focus on becoming a fashion designer.[15]
In 1977, he enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City.[16] However, he dropped out after only nine months and took a job at a boutique called Lothar's across from Bergdorf Goodman on 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan, where he started as a salesperson and went on to become both the designer and visual display head for the store. Shortly after, Dawn Mello, the fashion director at Bergdorf's, discovered Kors. She asked if he would show his collection to Bergdorf Goodman's buyers and that was just the beginning.[17]
In 1981, Kors launched his Michael Kors women's label at Bergdorf Goodman. In 1990, the company launched KORS Michael Kors as a licensee. A Chapter 11 filing in 1993, caused by the closure of the licensing partner for KORS Michael Kors, forced him to put the KORS line on hold. He managed to get back on his feet by 1997 and launched a lower priced line and at the same time was named the first women’s ready-to-wear designer for French house Celine.[18] In his tenure at Celine, Kors turned the fashion house around with successful accessories and a critically acclaimed ready-to-wear line. Kors left Celine in October 2003 to concentrate on his own brand. Kors launched his menswear line in 2002.

The MICHAEL Michael Kors line was launched in 2004, joining the original Michael Kors Collection label. The MICHAEL Michael Kors line includes women's handbags and shoes as well as women's ready-to-wear apparel. As of the end of the first fiscal quarter in 2016, Kors has over 770 Lifestyle stores around the world. Currently, Kors has Collection boutiques in New York, Beverly Hills, Palm Beach, Chicago, Miami and Southampton. In the U.S, his women's runway collection, labeled Michael Kors Collection, is sold at Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and numerous specialty stores. Michael Kors Collection is also carried at the brand's stores in London, Paris, Cannes, Milan, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Seoul. The year 2016 marked the 35th anniversary of Kors' business.




A dress by Michael Kors, 2010


Among the celebrities who have worn Kors' designs are Olivia Wilde, Dakota Johnson, Blake Lively, Kate Hudson, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Kate Middleton, Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lopez, Hillary Clinton, Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, Heidi Klum, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michelle Obama wore a black sleeveless dress from the designer for her first term official portrait as First Lady and later sported Kors again at the 2015 State of the Union address.[19] Viola Davis wore a custom Michael Kors Collection gown when accepting a Golden Globe for best supporting actress in a motion picture for her role in Fences. Kate Hudson and Olivia Wilde both wore gowns by the designer to the 2016 Golden Globes, and Emily Blunt, nominated for her role in Into The Woods, wore a white custom gown by the designer in 2015. Joan Allen wore his gown when she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in The Contender. As creative director of Celine, Kors designed many outfits for actresses to wear on screen, including Gwyneth Paltrow in Possession;[20] and Rene Russo in The Thomas Crown Affair.[21] One of his gowns was worn by Alicia Keys for her performance at Barack Obama's inaugural ball on January 21, 2013.[22]
The ad campaigns for Kors, shot by Mario Testino, often reflect the jet-set sportswear that his fans like. Previous campaigns include the model Carmen Kass on a safari in Africa and relaxing on a yacht. More recent campaigns feature models Joan Smalls and Freja Beha-Erichsen living the jet set lifestyle.
Kors was a judge on the Emmy-nominated reality television program Project Runway, which aired on Bravo for five seasons; subsequent seasons aired on Lifetime. On December 18, 2012, it was announced that Kors would be leaving Project Runway, to be replaced by fellow designer Zac Posen.[23]
In January 2014, Forbes reported that Kors now has a personal fortune in excess of $1billion, making him the latest fashion industry billionaire. Michael Kors Holdings had already “minted two billionaires”: Silas Chou and Lawrence Stroll.[24]
Other honors[edit]

2016: The World Food Programme honored Kors with the McGovern-Dole Leadership award, presented by former vice president Joe Biden.
2015: Named a Global Ambassador Against Hunger for the United Nations World Food Programme.
2015: God’s Love We Deliver dedicated the Michael Kors Building at the non-profit’s new SoHo headquarters in honor of Kors’ ongoing support.


2013: Selected for The Time 100, the magazine's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world. He also made the New York Observer's list of the 100 Most Influential New Yorkers, under the fashion category, and was named to Out magazine’s 2014 Power 50 List.
2013: Honored with the 2013 Couture Council Award for Artistry of Fashion by The Couture Council of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology.

2012: Honored with the Golden Heart Lifetime Achievement Award by God's Love We Deliver, a non-profit organization that distributes fresh meals to people living with HIV/AIDS and other diagnoses, which he has been involved with for over 20 years.
2010: Received the Oliver R. Grace Award for Distinguished Service in Advancing Cancer Research, an annual honor bestowed by the Cancer Research Institute, a U.S. nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing immune system-based treatments for cancer.
2010: Kors was the youngest recipient ever of the Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and received the Fragrance Foundation’s FiFi Award for Lifetime Achievement.








Legal issues[edit]
In January 2009, the estate of the artist-designer Tony Duquette sued Kors for trademark infringement after Kors allegedly used Duquette's name and images in promoting Kors' 2009 resortwear collection.[25]
In July 2013, he became the second luxury brand, after Tiffany & Co, to sue Costco for falsely claiming in advertisements that they sold his product.[26][27]
In popular culture[edit]
Kors was referenced in the film The Devil Wears Prada by Meryl Streep's character, Miranda Priestly. In the scene, Priestly sweeps into her office and gives a list of instructions to her personal assistant (Emily Blunt). Priestly says, "RSVP 'yes' to Michael Kors' party and I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30 and pick me up at 9:45 sharp".[28]
Kors is also mentioned in Big Sean's song "Dance" by Nicki Minaj. Drake also mentions Michael Kors in his song "From Time", and rapper Pusha T in his song "Numbers on the Boards". Additionally, Kors guest starred as himself in a Fashion Week themed episode of the hit teen show Gossip Girl; the same show that repeatedly showcases several pieces from his collections.

Michael Kors Quotes






1. The store recently held an exclusive preview of Kors's fall collection. Zac Posen also has been popular this season, as has Jacobs, whose fall collection Monahan called a statement.



2. What are we going to do, sue our biggest customers?3. I think there's a couture thing going with Chloe that is not at all what we've seen before.



4. There's cool bluish white, white with a yellow cast, a rosy cast, a creamy cast. It's kind of cool to mix it all up. Wear a vanilla shade, ecru and optic white, and mix it all together. If you're confused about the different whites, go to the local paint store, they'll sort it out.


5. We had a very tough time with this, and if you're looking for a job, definitely give me a call, I'd love to hear from you.



6. I am taking a little break this evening. And what could be more of a vacation than seeing a Versace show? I loved every look and I even picked out a couple for Lucy.7. Lots of shine for evening...lots of ornamentation (with) a lot of Art Deco-sort-of-feeling to it because, again, I think this collection really is New York. So, automatically to me, it's the Chrysler Building.8. If you don't have outside money, the road is 20 times as long.



9. The most exciting thing to say now is: "Oh, she really looks pretty!". That's not such a dirty word anymore.



10. We don't want to wear black every day, but we don't want head-to-toe color every day either. Green can sort of do both and I think that's what's great about it.11. There are two kinds of designers: ones who are very happy locked in their office surrounded by their coterie. The last thing they need to do is to go to a trunk show; they'd go running for the hills. I not only enjoy it, I think, how do you design things that are applicable to life - unless you live it?



12. The biggest lesson that I've learned is that fashion is this tightrope where you have to be consistent but inconsistent. You need the connective thread but at the same time you need a sense of surprise.




13. When you try on something, you have to ask yourself: "How many ways could I wear this? Could I wear it to work? To dinner or drinks? Will it span the seasons" If you have to think too hard about those questions, then skip it.



14. People always think that designers hate each other. And we're certainly a competitive lot, but we also enjoy each other's company.
15. People want to look taller and thinner. No one says:"Ooh! Let me buy that dress because it makes me feel matronly!"16. The '90s will be looked back on as ushering in an era of comfort.



17. There's a whole generation of women who never really heard the word investment before, when it came to fashion. They've been buying things because they were cheap.18. I grew up in a family of people who were obsessed with fashion.19. I think a lot of women have too many mini skirts in their closets.20. I wasn't Barbie-obsessed. I think my mother might have been my Barbie.



21. I wear the same thing every day. I always pack two black jackets, loads of black T-shirts, loads of white jeans. I feel a little fresh and glamorous and graphic.


22. In the '80s, it got to the point where we'd have shows with a hundred looks. You'd want to order a pizza before it was over!23. Learn to invest in the best quality you can afford and wear pieces in different ways.



24. My apartment looks like no one lives in it.


25. My legacy would be that you don't have to give up anything. You can be chic but have a sense of humor, you can be sexy but comfortable, you can be timeless but fresh.26. My mom was a model. She had me at 20, so she was a young mother.



27. For me, true luxury can be caviar or a day with no meetings, no appointments and no schedule.


28. I can't dance and I can't sing too well.29. I don't even think of going to Europe as going to another country now.



30. I can sketch up a storm, and I'm very involved in how clothes are constructed, but I have a short attention span.

31. I know what women look good in. I don't think the rules ever change.32. Clothes are like a good meal, a good movie, great pieces of music.



33. Americans are always a little bit insecure.34. Give me Caviar Kaspia and give me a hamburger. I love the two extremes.35. I am the oldest young designer in New York City.36. A man in a well tailored suit will always shine brighter than a guy in an off-the-rack suit.37. American women often fall into the trap of: "Oh, these are my weekend clothes. These are my work clothes. This is what I wear at night." It's so old-fashioned.



38. I grew up surrounded by these tough, ballsy, strong women. They were also adoring women, but they were the kind of women who would argue over what kind of pants you were wearing or the color of your nail polish.39. Because of what's going on with the economy, I think women are realizing that maybe they don't need a closet full of clothes. They just need the right clothes.



40. North Americans as a whole need to embrace having clothes altered to their body. I hear it all the time: why do the Europeans always look so good? They have a relationship with their tailor and spend the time and money to make their clothes look their best.



41. When I was a kid, I was trendier. I'd wear anything. I was in love with beads and platforms.

42. I think the older I get, the more I realize that the ultimate luxury is time.What do you think of Michael Kors' quotes?Feel free to comment and share this blog post if you find it interesting!

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Because of what's going on with the economy, I think women are realizing that maybe they don't need a closet full of clothes. They just need the right clothes.
Michael Kors


Women,
Think,
Clothes



















A man in a well tailored suit will always shine brighter than a guy in an off-the-rack suit.
Michael Kors


Man,
Shine,
Will
























There are two kinds of designers: ones who are very happy locked in their office surrounded by their coterie. The last thing they need to do is to go to a trunk show; they'd go running for the hills. I not only enjoy it, I think, how do you design things that are applicable to life - unless you live it?
Michael Kors


Life,
Happy,
Design



















When you try on something, you have to ask yourself, 'How many ways could I wear this? Could I wear it to work? To dinner or drinks? Will it span the seasons' If you have to think too hard about those questions, then skip it.
Michael Kors


Work,
Yourself,
Dinner



















My legacy would be that you don't have to give up anything. You can be chic but have a sense of humor, you can be sexy but comfortable, you can be timeless but fresh.
Michael Kors


Humor,
Sexy,
Legacy



















For me, true luxury can be caviar or a day with no meetings, no appointments and no schedule.
Michael Kors


Day,
Meetings,
Me



















I grew up surrounded by these tough, ballsy, strong women. They were also adoring women, but they were the kind of women who would argue over what kind of pants you were wearing or the color of your nail polish.
Michael Kors


Women,
Strong,
Color



















When I was a kid, I was trendier. I'd wear anything. I was in love beads and platforms.
Michael Kors


Love,
Kid,
Platforms



















I think the older I get, the more I realize that the ultimate luxury is time.
Michael Kors


Time,
Realize,
Think
























Learn to invest in the best quality you can afford and wear pieces in different ways.
Michael Kors


Best,
Quality,
Learn



















The biggest lesson that I've learned is that fashion is this tightrope where you have to be consistent but inconsistent. You need the connective thread but at the same time you need a sense of surprise.
Michael Kors


Time,
Fashion,
Surprise



















I know what women look good in. I don't think the rules ever change.
Michael Kors


Change,
Women,
Good



















People want to look taller and thinner. No one says, 'Ooh! Let me buy that dress because it makes me feel matronly!'
Michael Kors


Dress,
Look,
People



















Americans are always a little bit insecure.
Michael Kors


Little,
Always,
Little Bit



















Clothes are like a good meal, a good movie, great pieces of music.
Michael Kors


Music,
Good,
Great
























I am the oldest young designer in New York City.
Michael Kors


I Am,
City,
Young



















Give me Caviar Kaspia and give me a hamburger. I love the two extremes.
Michael Kors


Love,
Me,
Two



















I wasn't Barbie-obsessed. I think my mother might have been my Barbie.
Michael Kors


Mother,
Think,
Been



















I wear the same thing every day. I always pack two black jackets, loads of black T-shirts, loads of white jeans. I feel a little fresh and glamorous and graphic.
Michael Kors


Day,
Black,
White



















I grew up in a family of people who were obsessed with fashion.
Michael Kors


Family,
Fashion,
People



















My apartment looks like no one lives in it.
Michael Kors


Looks,
Apartment,
Like



















My mom was a model. She had me at 20, so she was a young mother.
Michael Kors


Mother,
Mom,
Me
























I think a lot of women have too many mini skirts in their closets.
Michael Kors


Women,
Think,
Skirts



















North Americans as a whole need to embrace having clothes altered to their body. I hear it all the time: why do the Europeans always look so good? They have a relationship with their tailor and spend the time and money to make their clothes look their best.
Michael Kors


Time,
Relationship,
Money



















I can't dance and I can't sing too well.
Michael Kors


Dance,
Sing,
Well



















There's a whole generation of women who never really heard the word investment before, when it came to fashion. They've been buying things because they were cheap.
Michael Kors


Women,
Fashion,
Generation

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
