Healthy Inspiration for Every Day









Buddy Up
Research shows that partnering with a friend on your wellness journey helps increase motivation, accountability and results.









Swap Out Sodas
A 12 oz soda contains roughly 9 tsps of added sugar. Replacing one with sparkling water each day can cut more than 65 cups of sugar in a year!








Healthy Hydration
One 0.5L bottle of sparkling water contains about ⅓ the daily recommended amount of water.












Cheers To Zero Cal
Simply swapping out a 5 oz glass of wine for a sparkling water can save roughly 125 calories.









Kick Start Your Morning
When you start hydrated it’s easier to stay hydrated. Begin your day with a bottle of refreshing sparkling water.








Freshen Up Your Cup
Add fresh fruit to your sparkling water to give it a kick of color and an extra splash of flavor.













Simple Steps
Work a little extra exercise into your day by taking the stairs instead of the elevator or by having a walking meeting.









Make Habits Stick
Overly ambitious goals can often lead to discouragement. Start with small, specific goals that are easier to achieve.








Portion Pointer
If you want to avoid extra calories, eat from smaller plates and bowls to naturally limit portion size.

Since 1994, we have reduced the amount of plastic in our half-liter bottles by 60%. And since 2016, thanks to the high recycling rate of California residents and our partnership with CarbonLITE, 9 out of 10 of our bottles made in California incorporate 50% post-consumer recycled plastic content (rPET). This recent change increases the amount of recycled material used in ARROWHEAD bottles by 40%.

Why Plastic is a resource
All plastic is not created equal.  Some plastic, like the durable #1 PET (called rPET when recycled), is inherently reusable and can be more easily recycled and reused without losing its functionality. By using rPET in our bottles, we can have a measurable impact on reducing our production of greenhouse gases and reducing the amount of plastic in landfills.



One of the most commonly used plastics for single-use products.



91.6% less energy is needed to make rPET vs. virgin (or entirely new) plastics.



The energy saved by recycling one PET bottle will power a computer for 25 minutes.


For more information about the recycling process and plastics check out the GOOD guide to recycling.

Facilities and Distribution
An important step in reducing our environmental impact is improving the energy and water efficiency at our facilities. We’ve already made a lot of changes, and will continue to look for more innovative ways to conserve at our bottling plants.




The two wind turbines at our bottling plant in Cabazon, California provide 30% of the facility’s power.






Cabazon Bottling Facility, CA, 2015



Here's how we're making a positive impact:



Conserving Water
New technology in our California bottling plants will save approximately 55 million gallons of water per year starting in 2016.



Increasing Fuel Efficieny
We added 20 alternative fuel powered trucks to the fleet in California this year.



Lowering Emissions
At our Cabazon facility, we have reduced CO2 emissions by 7,320 tons, saving the equivalent of approximately 1,897 acres of trees.

Our Springs | Arrowhead® Brand Spring Water




















































			Menu 




Home









From here. For Here 
We love when our water quenches the thirst of people who live near the springs it came from. That’s why we only bottle Arrowhead® Mountain Spring Water from carefully selected mountain spring sources in and West of the Rockies. (It’s how we provide that fresh taste.)


San Bernadino Mountains, CA, 2015
Near Arrowhead Spring








Come along on a tour of our 13 springs.

Canada Spring (1)
N. California Springs (5)
Arrowhead Spring (1)
Colorado Spring (1)
S. California Springs (5)

Our water is Mother Nature’s recipe. It’s filtered through rock and sand then naturally emerges to the surface through springs. Want to know more? We’re happy to show you around the places we call home.

ARROWHEAD SPRING
Our original spring source
Our namesake spring can be found on a mountain in the San Bernardino range just east of Los Angeles. These mountains have beautiful hiking trails and spectacular views.




Arrowhead Spring








Northern California Springs
A few stops around Sacramento
It may be known for wine, the Golden Gate Bridge and Silicon Valley, but we know Northern California has more to offer. Like the five springs we source water from — White Meadow, Lukens, Sopiago, Sugar Pine and Arcadia.




LUKEN SPRINGS


ARCADIA SPRINGS


WHITE MEADOW SPRING


SOPIAGO SPRINGS


SUGAR PINE SPRING







Southern California Springs
Where the springs are our stars
Most people know Southern California for its beaches, mountains and deserts. But mountain springs are a little harder to come by, which is why we’re proud to share these five with you.




COYOTE SPRINGS


LONG POINT RANCH SPRINGS


DEER CANYON SPRINGS


SOUTHERN PACIFIC SPRING


PALOMAR MOUNTAIN GRANITE SPRINGS







Canada Spring
The northernmost stop on our tour 
The great outdoors knows no bounds. We trekked up to British Columbia until we hit a little town called Hope. There we found another high-quality mountain spring that helps us bring the taste of Arrowhead® Mountain Spring Water to our friends and neighbors in the Pacific Northwest.




HOPE SPRINGS







Colorado Spring
Right in the heart of the Rockies
Colorado is known for a lot of things — hiking, snowboarding, cycling and even microbrewing. But we think its greatest accomplishment is the fresh-tasting spring water that comes from the mountains.




RUBY SPRINGS





View full map






Over 120 Years of refreshment
Since 1895 Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water has been providing fresh-tasting spring water to our fellow Californians. Today, our 13 springs refresh all our friends and neighbors in and west of the Rockies.
















Mother Nature is our Muse
To make sure we’re being responsible to the earth and our neighbors, we bottle spring water that naturally flows to the surface of our springs. We also have a team of geologists, natural resource managers and field experts who monitor and manage our springs and the surrounding land so that we are sourcing sustainably.
See our Sustainability Efforts





Nature's Recipe
What makes our water taste so fresh? It’s a couple of things really. One is the natural blend of minerals in every sip. The other is the 10-step quality process our water goes through. It’s what makes Arrowhead, Arrowhead. Download our quality report to learn more.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Arrowhead Products | History












































































Arrowhead Products was founded in 1937 as Arrowhead Rubber Company.  In 1942, Arrowhead Rubber conceived the idea of rubber coated fabric ducting which gave birth to "Airtron" products.  This rapidly became the company’s most important product during WWII.

In 1944, Arrowhead Rubber Company was sold to National Motor Bearing.  In 1951, Arrowhead Rubber began designing and producing high-altitude pressure suits called "G.U.S." (Garment, Upper Stratosphere).  The suit was also worn 
            by Hollywood actor Lee Marvin in a movie titled, "Man in Orbit."




In 1956, Federal Mogul purchased National Motor Bearing and changed the name of the company from Arrowhead Rubber Company to Arrowhead Products.  In 1960, the company moved from its Signal Hill location to Los Alamitos.  And, in 1962 being a pioneer in the space industry, Arrowhead Products was awarded the prime contract from NASA to design and manufacture the entire propellant system First Stage Apollo Booster Rocket.
In 1983, Arrowhead Products was sold to Vesper Corporation now called Industrial Manufacturing Company based out of Brecksville, OH
Our legacy continues for future generations.

1.	INTRODUCTION
 Arrowhead Products offers repairs of its products through its FAA Part 145 certificated repair facility located on the premises.   Our repair station number is OHTR662X.  We are also EASA approved.   Turn-around time ranges from 25 to 45 days after receipt of quote approval and may occasionally vary depending on availability of certain sub-components.

2.	WARRANTY
 Arrowhead Products offers a warranty to the original equipment purchaser of any products that it is free from defects in workmanship and materials for a period of 2 years on new product.  Warranty does not cover wear and tear associated with normal operations. During the warranty period, Arrowhead Products allows warranty returns to the factory for repair or replacement of any part which is in non-conformance to its specifications.    If you are not sure the part is warrantable, please contact a customer service representative to get answers to your questions prior to shipping, doing so will prevent delays at receiving and expedite your orders and claims. 
 Once a part is received, Arrowhead Products will either accept or deny warranty based on initial testing and inspection of the part down to the component level.  Customer-induced damage resulting from misuse, mishandling, missing components, or modification to such parts is considered a non-warrantable condition and therefore warranty will be denied. Refurbishment or upgrading of a product to the latest specification is considered non-warranty and will be re-configured to a Repair Service transaction.  Arrowhead Products is not responsible for any damage to the product during transportation to our facility.  Please insure that parts are properly packaged for their journey to Arrowhead.
 Arrowhead Products rigorously tests all its products to ensure optimum quality and reliability.   However, in the event of a failure, return the part to Arrowhead Products for evaluation and testing.   If warranty is accepted, the customer will be notified of the acceptance and Arrowhead will repair the unit (or replace at its option) at no cost to the customer.  Further, warranty repairs will be returned to customer freight pre-paid.

Healthy Inspiration for Every Day









Buddy Up
Research shows that partnering with a friend on your wellness journey helps increase motivation, accountability and results.









Swap Out Sodas
A 12 oz soda contains roughly 9 tsps of added sugar. Replacing one with sparkling water each day can cut more than 65 cups of sugar in a year!








Healthy Hydration
One 0.5L bottle of sparkling water contains about ⅓ the daily recommended amount of water.












Cheers To Zero Cal
Simply swapping out a 5 oz glass of wine for a sparkling water can save roughly 125 calories.









Kick Start Your Morning
When you start hydrated it’s easier to stay hydrated. Begin your day with a bottle of refreshing sparkling water.








Freshen Up Your Cup
Add fresh fruit to your sparkling water to give it a kick of color and an extra splash of flavor.













Simple Steps
Work a little extra exercise into your day by taking the stairs instead of the elevator or by having a walking meeting.









Make Habits Stick
Overly ambitious goals can often lead to discouragement. Start with small, specific goals that are easier to achieve.








Portion Pointer
If you want to avoid extra calories, eat from smaller plates and bowls to naturally limit portion size.

Commitment to California | Arrowhead® Brand Spring Water



















































			Menu 




Home









Committed to our home state
The ARROWHEAD brand started in California over 120 years ago. For decades, we’ve worked hard to respect and care for the brand’s mountain spring sources and their surrounding environments. We take our time researching, evaluating, and carefully selecting mountain springs that can be managed for long-term sustainability.



San Bernardino Mountains, CA, 2015
Near Arrowhead Spring








From one generation to the next
Our team of natural resource managers and field experts care for our spring sources and their surroundings so that Arrowhead will be enjoyed for generations to come.











Protecting Nature is Second Nature
See how we’re doing right by nature from our springs to our bottles.



Water Stewardship
We take pride in the care we provide for our mountain spring sources and surrounding local waterways.



Recycling and Reducing
We’re committed to using post-consumer recycled plastic in our most popular sized bottles throughout California.



Community Commitment
We collaborate with local groups to help empower communities throughout California to become water stewards and to take pride in their local environment. 





Water Stewardship




We are for water
Being responsible to California means maintaining our springs for long-term sustainability. That’s why we have a team of experts dedicated to watching over each one of our 13 spring sources. We also partner with local groups like the Inland Empire Waterkeeper to care for the Upper Santa Ana River Watershed and other local waterways.
Learn More










Recycling and Reducing





Our packaging promise
Since 1994, we have reduced the amount of plastic in our half-liter bottles by 60%. And since 2016, thanks to the high recycling rate of California residents and our partnership with CarbonLITE, 9 out of 10 of our bottles made in California incorporate 50% post-consumer recycled plastic content (rPET). This recent change increases the amount of recycled material used in ARROWHEAD bottles by 40%.
Learn More



San Bernadino Mountains, CA, 2015
Near Arrowhead Spring







Why Plastic is a resource
All plastic is not created equal.  Some plastic, like the durable #1 PET (called rPET when recycled), is inherently reusable and can be more easily recycled and reused without losing its functionality. By using rPET in our bottles, we can have a measurable impact on reducing our production of greenhouse gases and reducing the amount of plastic in landfills.



One of the most commonly used plastics for single-use products.



91.6% less energy is needed to make rPET vs. virgin (or entirely new) plastics.



The energy saved by recycling one PET bottle will power a computer for 25 minutes.


For more information about the recycling process and plastics check out the GOOD guide to recycling.
Learn More

Jordan E. Rosenfeld, Andrew Janik, “Recycling Plastic is Surprisingly Complex. Here’s What Happens After the Bin.” WWW.GOOD.IS December 1, 2015








Facilities and Distribution
An important step in reducing our environmental impact is improving the energy and water efficiency at our facilities. We’ve already made a lot of changes, and will continue to look for more innovative ways to conserve at our bottling plants.




The two wind turbines at our bottling plant in Cabazon, California provide 30% of the facility’s power.






Cabazon Bottling Facility, CA, 2015



Here's how we're making a positive impact:



Conserving Water
New technology in our California bottling plants will save approximately 55 million gallons of water per year starting in 2016.



Increasing Fuel Efficieny
We added 20 alternative fuel powered trucks to the fleet in California this year.



Lowering Emissions
At our Cabazon facility, we have reduced CO2 emissions by 7,320 tons, saving the equivalent of approximately 1,897 acres of trees.





Community Commitment




Meet your Neighbors
We’ve highlighted a few of our team members to show what it means to work for the ARROWHEAD brand. Their passion for community efforts, respect for nature and high standard for quality demonstrate what it means to be “Arrowhead Proud”.

Our Partnerships In California
In 2015, we donated more than 3 million bottles of ARROWHEAD to communities in need throughout the state. For us, being an active member of the community goes beyond donations. It also means working together with other local groups who share similar values and goals. We’re proud to call the following organizations our partners:






Southern California  Mountains Foundation
The Southern California Mountains Foundation (SCMF) is a non-profit organization that aims to connect communities with public land and foster life-long commitments to environmental stewardship. We have been partners for over 20 years, and recently donated 90 acres of land in the Angeles Oaks area of the San Bernardino Mountains to the Foundation to contribute to their ongoing efforts.

Throughout the years, we’ve been able to sponsor their educational Environmental Learning Center, festivals, and internship programs. In 2016, we invested in a groundwater treatment project that will help increase the availability and reliability of local water supplies for the community. Learn More







American River Headwater Restoration with The Nature Conservancy
The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is a leading conservation organization whose mission is to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends. TNC is co-leading a forest and watershed restoration and research effort in the headwaters of the American River—the watershed that is the primary drinking water source for Sacramento. The goal is to manage the forests to reduce the risk of wildfire and help safeguard water quality, potentially increasing water quantity. We look forward to working with the multiple groups who have joined forces on this important effort. Learn More

From here. For Here 
We love when our water quenches the thirst of people who live near the springs it came from. That’s why we only bottle Arrowhead® Mountain Spring Water from carefully selected mountain spring sources in and West of the Rockies. (It’s how we provide that fresh taste.)

ARROWHEAD SPRING
Our original spring source
Our namesake spring can be found on a mountain in the San Bernardino range just east of Los Angeles. These mountains have beautiful hiking trails and spectacular views.




Arrowhead Spring








Northern California Springs
A few stops around Sacramento
It may be known for wine, the Golden Gate Bridge and Silicon Valley, but we know Northern California has more to offer. Like the five springs we source water from — White Meadow, Lukens, Sopiago, Sugar Pine and Arcadia.




LUKEN SPRINGS


ARCADIA SPRINGS


WHITE MEADOW SPRING


SOPIAGO SPRINGS


SUGAR PINE SPRING







Southern California Springs
Where the springs are our stars
Most people know Southern California for its beaches, mountains and deserts. But mountain springs are a little harder to come by, which is why we’re proud to share these five with you.




COYOTE SPRINGS


LONG POINT RANCH SPRINGS


DEER CANYON SPRINGS


SOUTHERN PACIFIC SPRING


PALOMAR MOUNTAIN GRANITE SPRINGS







Canada Spring
The northernmost stop on our tour 
The great outdoors knows no bounds. We trekked up to British Columbia until we hit a little town called Hope. There we found another high-quality mountain spring that helps us bring the taste of Arrowhead® Mountain Spring Water to our friends and neighbors in the Pacific Northwest.




HOPE SPRINGS







Colorado Spring
Right in the heart of the Rockies
Colorado is known for a lot of things — hiking, snowboarding, cycling and even microbrewing. But we think its greatest accomplishment is the fresh-tasting spring water that comes from the mountains.




RUBY SPRINGS

Over 120 Years of refreshment
Since 1895 Arrowhead Mountain Spring Water has been providing fresh-tasting spring water to our fellow Californians. Today, our 13 springs refresh all our friends and neighbors in and west of the Rockies.
















Mother Nature is our Muse
To make sure we’re being responsible to the earth and our neighbors, we bottle spring water that naturally flows to the surface of our springs. We also have a team of geologists, natural resource managers and field experts who monitor and manage our springs and the surrounding land so that we are sourcing sustainably.
See our Sustainability Efforts





Nature's Recipe
What makes our water taste so fresh? It’s a couple of things really. One is the natural blend of minerals in every sip. The other is the 10-step quality process our water goes through. It’s what makes Arrowhead, Arrowhead. Download our quality report to learn more.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Fortunately, LegalZoom makes the process of starting an LLC affordable and simple. With three LLC pricing packages to choose from, there is a package to fit the needs of any business. The Economy package LLC cost includes filing of the document forming the LLC with the state, a personalized operating agreement, name availability check, a financial account authorization letter, and a 30 business day turnaround. Standard package LLC fees include everything from the Economy package with a 15 business day turnaround, plus a company seal and binder, and 20 customized membership certificates. The Express Gold LLC formation package includes everything from the Standard package with a 7-10 business day turnaround, plus a Federal Tax ID (EIN) (discounted and expedited), a tax consultation with 1-800Accountant, and a 30-day trial of attorney advice. Get started forming an LLC by answering a few questions about your business. We'll assemble your LLC documents and file them directly with the appropriate state agency and you'll receive your completed LLC package by mail. The LLC price for all packages includes a 100% satisfaction guarantee and a Peace of Mind Review.
