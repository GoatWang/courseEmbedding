            I thoroughly enjoyed reading How We Got The Bible. This book is very informative, well-formatted and easy to understand. As I was reading, I didn't feel weighed down with excessive dates, terms and events, but I was engaged all the way through! I believe How We Got The Bible should be in every Christian's list of books-to-read. This book would also serve great for historians and even skeptics. How We Got The Bible is definitely not a one-time read and I will be using this book as a reference guide whenever necessary. Thank you so much Timothy Jones and Rose Publishing for this material. God bless!

            We are doing this study in a small group.  Very interesting, there are scriptures to study with the book material.  We are really enjoying the study.  We have people who are very familiar with the Bible and some brand new Christians who have no knowledge of the scriptures or the history of our Bible, and we are all learning something.  Highly recommend this study.  Would even work for a new Christians class.

            I was expecting a small response in our men's group for this study,  Instead we ran about 30 guys. They kept coming back for more. The study was very well done, and even entertaining. But, the best part was how it gave us more confidence in relying on the scriptures as God's holy Word. I highly recommend it.

            "How We Got The Bible" described how the Bible was written, copied, translated, and basically how we got the Bible that we use today. It's written from a conservative, Protestant viewpoint. Not only did the author explain how we got the Bible, but he dealt with some common claims that skeptics make. He showed that the Bible IS trustworthy. This book was easy to read and to follow, and it used charts to help break down some ideas for quick reference.


This book is intended for Christians who want to know more about the origins of the Bible. It's part of a larger DVD group study on the topic (though the book stands on its own). It did a good job of giving a solid, basic overview of the topics covered. Christians who wish to debate skeptics on these topics will probably need to read a more in-depth book, but I'd recommend this as a relatively quick read for Christians who simply want the basics.


I received this book as an ebook review copy from the publisher.

            Recommended Christian History Made Easy DVD series with Leader Guide


Please note:  This is a review of the "12-Session DVD Study with printable leader guide, fliers & posters (PDF)" not the "Complete Kit" edition.


My recommendation:


This DVD series is a thorough yet easily understood introduction to Christian History, which I suggest will fulfill the needs of your individual or Protestant group study as well as deepen your faith.  I noted a few points that do not agree with Catholic doctrine, but Jones did a good job avoiding the trouble spots.  The included DVD with PDF files for printable leader guide and promotional materials was thorough and easily adaptable for many uses.  


Highlights:  


Jones' knowledge is extensive, easy to follow.  Terms clearly indicated on screen when new topics.  Useful info about the transition from oral tradition to written word.  


Negatives/Distractions: (for which I will deduct one star from total of five stars)


1) Lecture-type gets tiresome but he does a good job of presentation without distractions, and pictures and humorous visuals help.  


2) I was concerned that Dr. Jones skips the early chapters of the book of Acts and  begins with Acts 28 and Paul.  What about the earlier church - Stephen, Peter and James? 


3) The video and sound were out of sync in one of the CDs, but I assume I could have exchanged for a quality copy. 


In compliance with the Federal Trade Commission, Rose Publishing provided me with an advanced reader copy with the request that I provide a review, positive or negative.

            As pastor of a small congregation, many were wanting to know more of the history between the 1st century and today. As a student who has been through seminary, I wanted a concise study that would bridge the gap. This study, conducted by Dr. Timothy Paul Jones was exactly what we needed. It is an entertaining and informative, conservative study on those years. The study is broken down in such a way as to give the reader/student informative and applicable insight into the troubles of the church from the 1st century to today. Many resources are recommended during the study to give interested students further recommendations. I have graduated from seminary, with a B.A. in Biblical studies and a Masters of Divinity and this study manages to condense this information into 12 weeks. I would highly recommend this to any student needing a refresher and any layperson interested in learning more of how the church came to where she is today. Great product!

            I was SO looking forward to using this DVD series with our small group that meets in our home, but was sadly disappointed. The author/presenter has an engaging and enjoyable style, he comes across as very personable and knowledgeable, but he speaks too fast, and seems to highlight random events and people in the time period he is covering. The result is a largely disjointed presentation. The accompanying book (an optional purchase) provides an outline for notetaking and contains additional information beyond the lecture, but even that lacks important events, features, and people. I think the presentation would have been greatly enhanced with even a simple timeline graphic, perhaps highlighting the era being covered in each lesson, and some kind of explanation, even a very brief one, of why certain things are covered while others are not. For instance, the Gutenberg Press is mentioned very briefly, and no mention at all that the first printing was of a Bible... or why that was an important event in the development of Christian thought and practice. I had hoped to finish the course with a better understanding of the development of the Church overall and the people and events that contributed to that, but while there were some interesting things I learned about, I didn't get a sense of the whole. The rest of our group had the same impression. The last two lessons were the most enjoyable with a call to a deeper and more personal commitment to reaching the world with the message of the gospel.

Description


It’s time to open your eyes to the freeing power of authentic grace—grace that releases us from trying to earn God's favor, grace that enables us to rest in the finished work of Christ, grace that liberates from the tyranny of trying to please others.
 
That's what the theology of Martin Luther and John Calvin did in their own day for the people around them. Time magazine recently dubbed Calvinism as one of the top ten ideas changing the world right now. And yet most of these discussions center on the issue of predestination or on whether particular people agree with the five points of Calvinism. Daniel Montgomery and Timothy Paul Jones think it's time to rescue the theology of the Reformers from such stale scholasticizing and to declare anew the dangerous and intoxicating joy of the gospel that they
proclaimed.
 
PROOF stands for planned grace, resurrecting grace, outrageous grace, overcoming grace, and forever grace. The authors offer proof of God’s grace upon which people can stand against  the attacks of legalism that have led many of God's people to lose sight of the freedom and joy of the gospel.  And this proof is intoxicating—it’s like a 200-proof drink that will leave you spiritually staggering at its effect on your life. God’s grace not only declares us “not guilty!” in his presence, it changes our relationship with God—forever.?

DescriptionAuthor's BiographyReviewsFirst Chapter






															            																		
						There is an undeniable hunger for spiritual nourishment and direction, but many of us dont have time for extensive, time-consuming exercises.  In Awake My Soul, Timothy Jones offers an accessible spirituality that real people can incorporate into each busy day.Beginning with the premise that you dont have to be a saint to be spiritually alive, Jones focuses our attention on twelve ways to find new meaning in everyday experiences.  These suggestions are reminders of what we have forgotten along lifes roadthat God is within reach, and that we must keep our eyes and ears open to find grace and joy in the simplest things of daily life.  Jones shows us how turning our thoughts to God can transform daily pressures into spiritual enrichment.  Because his approach grows out of routines that are familiar to us all, it doesnt seem so overwhelming to make a long-term commitment to what promises to be the most rewarding contribution we will ever make to our spiritual well-being.
