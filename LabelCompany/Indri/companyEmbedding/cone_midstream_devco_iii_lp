CONE Midstream to Acquire Remaining 25% Additional Interest in Anchor Systems

                            Company Release - 11/16/2016 6:00 AM ET



CANONSBURG, Pa., Nov.  16, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CONE Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:CNNX) (the “Partnership”) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire an additional 25% ownership interest in CONE Midstream DevCo I LP, commonly referred to as the “Anchor Systems”.  The transaction, which is expected to close before the end of the fourth quarter, is for a total purchase consideration of $248 million, comprised of $140 million in cash and issuance of approximately 5.2 million common limited partnership units to our Sponsors.  The cash portion of the purchase consideration will be funded through borrowings under the Partnership’s $250 million revolving credit facility(1), which had $41 million drawn as of September 30, 2016.  The Partnership currently owns a 75% interest in the Anchor Systems, and acquisition of the remaining 25% ownership interest will increase the Partnership’s ownership share of the Anchor Systems to 100%(2).  The interest is being acquired from CONE Gathering LLC, which is jointly owned by subsidiaries of our Sponsors, CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE:CNX) and Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NBL).
John T. Lewis, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive officer of CONE Midstream GP LLC, said, “We are pleased to announce our first dropdown transaction.  This acquisition demonstrates our commitment to grow CNNX over the long term, the supportive nature of our relationship with our Sponsors, and our Sponsors' confidence in the continued future growth of CONE. “We project acquisition of the remaining 25% ownership interest in the Anchor Systems will be immediately accretive to our unitholders,” continued Mr. Lewis.  “The financial impact of the acquisition is not included in our current EBITDA or DCF guidance and, depending on the timing of transaction closing, will be additive to those projected results.  The anticipated increase in distributable cash flow is expected to increase our future cash distribution coverage and enhance our ability to continue to grow our quarterly cash distributions over time.  Using a combination of debt and equity financing for this transaction keeps our balance sheet strong and leaves additional debt capacity for financing growth through new organic projects and third party opportunities.  We continue to view our very robust distribution coverage and low leverage as important positive attributes that set CONE Midstream apart from others in the industry.” The terms of the transaction were approved by the Board of Directors of CONE Midstream GP LLC (the “General Partner”) following prior approval by the Board of Director's Conflicts Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors. The Conflicts Committee engaged Evercore Partners to act as its independent financial advisor and to render a fairness opinion, and Locke Lord LLP to act as its legal advisor. _______________ (1) The Partnership's revolving debt facility has an accordion feature which provides for an increase in potential total borrowing capacity to $500 million. (2) Following the close of the announced transaction, the Partnership will own a 100% interest in CONE Midstream DevCo I LP (the “Anchor Systems”).  It will continue to own a 5% interest in CONE Midstream DevCo II LP (the “Growth Systems”), and a 5% interest in CONE Midstream DevCo III LP (the “Additional Systems”).  CONE Gathering LLC, which is jointly owned by subsidiaries of CONSOL Energy Inc. and Noble Energy, Inc., will continue to own 95% interests in each of the Growth Systems and Additional Systems. CONE Midstream Partners is a growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by CONSOL Energy Inc.(NYSE:CNX) and Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NBL), whom we refer to as our Sponsors, to own, operate, develop and acquire natural gas gathering and other midstream energy assets to service our Sponsors' production in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.  Our assets include natural gas gathering pipelines and compression and dehydration facilities, as well as condensate gathering, collection, separation and stabilization facilities.  More information is available at our website www.conemidstream.com. This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.  Statements that are predictive in nature, that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or that include the words  "project", "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate" and other expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and that do not relate to historical matters identify forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that actual outcomes and results will not differ materially from those expected by our management.  Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward-looking statements include, among others: the acquisition of an additional 25% interest in the Anchor Systems may not close as anticipated; the effects of changes in market prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil on our Sponsors’ drilling and development plans on our dedicated acreage and the volumes of natural gas and condensate that are produced on our dedicated acreage; changes in our Sponsors’ drilling and development plans in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale; our Sponsors’ ability to meet their drilling and development plans in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale; the demand for natural gas and condensate gathering services; changes in general economic conditions; competitive conditions in our industry; actions taken by third-party operators, gatherers, processors and transporters; our ability to successfully implement our business plan; and our ability to complete internal growth projects on time and on budget. You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.  Although forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs at the time they are made, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the factors described under “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise, unless required by law.

"We project acquisition of the remaining 25% ownership interest in the Anchor Systems will be immediately accretive to our unitholders," continued Mr. Lewis.  "The financial impact of the acquisition is not included in our current EBITDA or DCF guidance and, depending on the timing of transaction closing, will be additive to those projected results.  The anticipated increase in distributable cash flow is expected to increase our future cash distribution coverage and enhance our ability to continue to grow our quarterly cash distributions over time.  Using a combination of debt and equity financing for this transaction keeps our balance sheet strong and leaves additional debt capacity for financing growth through new organic projects and third party opportunities.  We continue to view our very robust distribution coverage and low leverage as important positive attributes that set CONE Midstream apart from others in the industry."


                                        








The terms of the transaction were approved by the Board of Directors of CONE Midstream GP LLC (the "General Partner") following prior approval by the Board of Director's Conflicts Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors. The Conflicts Committee engaged Evercore Partners to act as its independent financial advisor and to render a fairness opinion, and Locke Lord LLP to act as its legal advisor.

		[(2)]
	 Following the close of the announced transaction, the Partnership will own a 100% interest in CONE Midstream DevCo I LP (the "Anchor Systems").  It will continue to own a 5% interest in CONE Midstream DevCo II LP (the "Growth Systems"), and a 5% interest in CONE Midstream DevCo III LP (the "Additional Systems").  CONE Gathering LLC, which is jointly owned by subsidiaries of CONSOL Energy Inc. and Noble Energy, Inc., will continue to own 95% interests in each of the Growth Systems and Additional Systems.

CONE GATHERING LLC SELLS
ADDITIONAL INTEREST IN PIPELINE AND COMPRESSION SYSTEMS TO CONE
MIDSTREAM PARTNERS LP

HOUSTON AND PITTSBURGH
(November 16, 2016) – Noble
Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NBL ) and CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE:
CNX ) (the “Sponsors”) announced today that CONE
Gathering LLC, which is jointly owned by the Sponsors, has entered
into a definitive agreement to contribute its remaining 25%
ownership interest in CONE Midstream DevCo I LP (the “Anchor
Systems”) to CONE Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: CNNX )
for a total valuation of $248 million. Upon closing, each
Sponsor will receive $70 million in cash and approximately 2.6
million limited partnership units of CNNX.

The Anchor Systems include over 125
miles of pipelines and 650 million cubic feet per day of natural
gas compression capacity, which gather and transport production
from the Sponsors’ Marcellus natural gas assets. The
Anchor Systems represent a substantial majority of CNNX’s
revenues and cash flows.

The transaction represents the
initial dropdown of assets from the Sponsors following CNNX’s
IPO in late 2014. As part of the transaction, the Conflicts
Committee of the Board of Directors of CNNX consulted with an
independent valuation expert who issued a fairness opinion to
CNNX.

Following closing of the
transaction, which is anticipated by the end of 2016, CNNX will own
100% of the Anchor Systems. CONE Gathering LLC continues to
own 95% interests in each of the CONE Midstream DevCo II LP (the
“Growth Systems”) and CONE Midstream DevCo III LP (the
“Additional Systems”), with CNNX owning the remaining
5% in each. NBL and CNX will each hold approximately 34.2% of
the common and subordinated limited partnership units of CNNX,
combined.

and production companies, with operations centered in the major

Item 1.01



Entry into
a Material Definitive Agreement.




 

Contribution
Agreement

On
November 15, 2016, CONE Midstream Partners LP, a Delaware
limited partnership (the “ Partnership
”), entered into a Contribution Agreement (the “
Contribution Agreement ”), by and among CONE
Gathering LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“
CONE Gathering ”) and a midstream joint venture
formed by CONSOL Energy Inc., a Delaware corporation (“
CONSOL ”), and Noble Energy, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (“ Noble ”), CONE Midstream
GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the general
partner of the Partnership (the “ General
Partner ”), the Partnership, CONE Midstream Operating
Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “
Operating Company ”), and the other parties
thereto, pursuant to which the Partnership will acquire the
remaining 25% limited partner interest (the “
Acquisition ”) in CONE Midstream DevCo I LP, a
Delaware limited partnership (“ DevCo I LP
”), from CONE Gathering in exchange for (i) cash
consideration in the amount of $140 million, (ii) the
Partnership’s issuance of 5,183,154 common units (the “
Unit Consideration ”) representing limited
partner interests in the Partnership (“ Common
Units ”) at an issue price of $20.42 per Common Unit
(the “ Common Unit Issue Price ”) and
(iii) the Partnership’s issuance to the General Partner of an
additional general partner interest in the Partnership in an amount
necessary for the General Partner to maintain its two percent
general partner interest in the Partnership. The Common Unit Issue
Price was calculated as the volume-weighted average trading price
of the Common Units over the trailing 20-day trading period ending
on November 11, 2016. The Partnership expects to fund the cash
consideration with borrowings under its revolving credit facility.
The Acquisition is expected to close on or about November 16, 2016,
subject to customary closing conditions (the “
Closing ”). CONE Gathering will distribute the
cash consideration and will have the Unit Consideration issued 50%
to CNX Gas Company LLC, a Virginia limited liability company
(“ CNX ”) and a wholly owned subsidiary
of CONSOL, and 50% to Noble or one or more of its wholly owned
subsidiaries.

Consummation
of the Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions.
There can be no assurance that all of the closing conditions will
be satisfied or that anticipated benefits of the Acquisition will
be realized. Under the Contribution Agreement, it is a condition to
the Closing that the Partnership obtain sufficient proceeds from
financing arrangements that will be used by the Partnership
exclusively to pay the cash consideration and other expenses or
disbursements directly related to the Closing.

The
Contribution Agreement and the above descriptions have been
included to provide investors and security holders with information
regarding the terms of the Contribution Agreement. They are not
intended to provide any other factual information about the
Partnership, the General Partner, CONE Gathering or the Operating
Company, or each of their respective subsidiaries, affiliates or
equity holders. The representations, warranties and covenants
contained in the Contribution Agreement were made only for purposes
of that agreement and as of specific dates; were solely for the
benefit of the parties to the Contribution Agreement; and may be
subject to limitations agreed upon by the parties, including being
qualified by confidential disclosures made by each contracting
party to the other as a way of allocating contractual risk between
them that differ from those applicable to investors. Moreover, the
subject matter of the representations and warranties are subject to
more recent developments. Accordingly, investors should be aware
that these representations, warranties and covenants or any
description thereof alone may not describe the actual state of
affairs of the Partnership, the General Partner, CONE Gathering or
the Operating Company, or each of their respective subsidiaries,
affiliates or equity holders as of the date they were made or at
any other time.

 

The
foregoing description of the Contribution Agreement is not complete
and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
the Contribution Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this
Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated in this Item 1.01
by reference.

 

Amended
and Restated Operational Services Agreement

Pursuant
to the Contribution Agreement, the Partnership and CNX have agreed
to amend and restate the Operational Services Agreement, dated
September 30, 2014, by and between the Partnership and CNX (the
“ Original Operational Services Agreement
,” and, as amended and restated, the “ A&R
Operational Services Agreement ”) in order to reflect
the transactions contemplated by the recently announced exchange
agreement under which CNX and Noble agreed to separate their
Marcellus Shale joint venture by creating two separate operating
areas (the “ Exchange Agreement ”). The
form of the A&R Operational Services Agreement has been agreed
to in the Contribution Agreement and will be executed and become
effective in connection with the closing of the Exchange
Agreement.

Consistent
with the Original Operational Services Agreement, the A&R
Operational Services Agreement requires CNX to provide certain
operational services to the Partnership and its subsidiaries in
support of the Partnership’s and its

 

 


  


 

 

subsidiaries’
business, including (i) routine and emergency maintenance and
repair services with respect to the Partnership’s midstream
assets, (ii) subject to certain limitations, the management of
acquisitions by, and the operations of, the Partnership and its
subsidiaries and (iii) such other services that the Partnership and
CNX may mutually agree upon from time to time. CNX will prepare and
submit for the Partnership’s approval an annual operating and
capital expenditure budget for each of DevCo I, CONE Midstream
DevCo II LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“ DevCo II
LP ”), and CONE Midstream DevCo III LP, a Delaware
limited partnership (“ DevCo III LP ”).
CNX will submit actual expenditures for reimbursement on a monthly
basis, and the Partnership will reimburse CNX for any direct
third-party costs actually incurred by CNX in providing these
services.

The
A&R Operational Services Agreement will remain in full force
and effect after effectiveness unless terminated by either party.
CNX may terminate the A&R Operational Services Agreement at any
time upon 180 days prior notice or immediately if the Partnership
becomes insolvent, declares bankruptcy or takes any action in
furtherance of, or indicated the Partnership’s consent to,
approval of, or acquiescence in, a similar proceeding . The
Partnership may terminate the A&R Operational Services
Agreement at any time following September 30, 2034 upon 180 days
prior notice or immediately (i) if CNX becomes insolvent, declares
bankruptcy or takes any action in furtherance of, or indicated
CNX’s consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, a similar
proceeding, (ii) upon a finding of CNX’s willful misconduct
or gross negligence that has had a material adverse effect on the
Partnership’s business and/or (iii) in the event of certain
defaults by CNX in the performance of its covenants or obligations
under the A&R Operational Services Agreement.

Under the
A&R Operational Services Agreement, CNX will indemnify the
Partnership from any claims, losses or liabilities incurred by the
Partnership, including third-party claims, arising from CNX’s
performance of the agreement to the extent caused by CNX’s
gross negligence or willful misconduct up to a specified amount.
The Partnership will indemnify CNX from any claims, losses or
liabilities incurred by CNX, including any third-party claims,
arising from CNX’s performance of the agreement, except to
the extent such claims, losses or liabilities are caused by
CNX’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Amended
and Restated Gathering Agreements

Pursuant
to the Contribution Agreement, the Partnership, Noble, CNX and
other parties thereto have agreed to amend and restate their
existing gathering agreements (as amended and restated, the “
A&R Gathering Agreements ”) in order to
reflect the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement.
The form of the A&R Gathering Agreements has been agreed to in
the Contribution Agreement and will be executed and become
effective in connection with the closing of the Exchange Agreement.
As the A&R Gathering Agreements are merely intended to reflect
the change in ownership of the properties underlying the Marcellus
Shale joint venture as between CONSOL and Noble, the entry into the
A&R Gathering Agreements is not expected to have a material
impact on the Partnership.

Pursuant
to the 20-year, fixed-fee A&R Gathering Agreements, Noble and
CNX have agreed to dedicate all of their existing acres in the
dedication area from the Marcellus Shale formation to the
Partnership for natural gas midstream services and to dedicate
their existing acreage in the Moundsville area (Marshall County,
West Virginia) and the Majorsville area (Marshall County, West
Virginia and Greene and Washington Counties, Pennsylvania) from the
Marcellus Shale formation to the Partnership for condensate
gathering and handling services. The Partnership has the right of
first offer to provide midstream services to Noble and CNX on
certain acreage adjacent to the dedication area (the “
ROFO Area ”). The Partnership also has an
option to provide natural gas midstream services to Noble and CNX
on their existing acres in the ROFO Area and on any future acreage
in the ROFO Area covering the Marcellus Shale formation that is
acquired by Noble or CNX and that is not subject to a pre-existing
third-party commitment.

Under the
A&R Gathering Agreements, the Partnership receives a fee based
on the type and scope of the midstream services the Partnership
provides. For the services the Partnership provides with respect to
natural gas from the Marcellus Shale formation that does not
require downstream processing, or dry gas, the Partnership receives
a fee of $0.41 per MMBtu. For the services the Partnership provides
with respect to the natural gas that requires downstream
processing, or wet gas, and with respect to condensate, the
Partnership receives a fee based on the scope of services the
Partnership provides. The Partnership’s fee for wet gas is
$0.282 per MMBtu in the Moundsville area (Marshall County, West
Virginia) with respect to Noble and in the Pittsburgh International
Airport area with respect to CNX, and $0.564 per MMBtu for all
other areas in the dedication area. The Partnership’s fee for
condensate services is $5.125 per Bbl in the Majorsville area and,
with respect to Noble, $2.563 per Bbl in the Moundsville
area.

The
Partnership has agreed to gather, compress and redeliver all of
Noble and CNX’s owned and controlled dedicated natural gas
produced from the Marcellus Shale on a firm commitment,
first-priority basis. The Partnership has agreed to gather,
stabilize and store all of Noble and CNX’s dedicated
condensate produced from the Marcellus Shale on a firm
commitment,

 

 


  


 

 

first
priority basis. Each quarter, Noble and CNX will provide the
Partnership an update on their drilling and development operations,
which will include a detailed description of the drilling plans and
well locations for the following 24 months and a long-term plan
that will include drilling plans and production forecasts. The
Partnership will meet monthly with Noble and CNX to discuss the
Partnership’s current plans to timely construct the necessary
facilities to be able to provide midstream services to Noble and
CNX on the Partnership’s dedicated acreage. In the event that
the Partnership does not perform its obligations under the A&R
Gathering Agreements, Noble and CNX will be entitled to certain
rights and procedural remedies thereunder, including the temporary
and/or permanent release from dedication discussed below and
indemnification from the Partnership.

In
addition to the owned and controlled natural gas and condensate
that is produced from the dedicated acreage in the Marcellus Shale,
each of Noble and CNX may elect to dedicate other properties
located in the dedication area to us in which either Noble or CNX
has an interest. If Noble or CNX elects to dedicate any such
property then Noble or CNX will propose a fee for the associated
midstream services the Partnership would provide. The Partnership
has agreed that if the fee proposed by Noble or CNX for midstream
services for such property will provide the Partnership a certain
return on its operating expenses and any incremental capital
expenses required to provide such midstream services, then the
Partnership will provide such midstream services on a second
priority basis, second only to the first priority basis afforded
Noble and CNX’s dedicated production produced from the
Marcellus Shale.

The
A&R Gathering Agreements also provide that in certain
situations, such as an uncured default of any of the
Partnership’s material obligations during the period the
Partnership is in default of a material obligation under the
A&R Gathering Agreements for more than 45 days but less than 90
days, the Partnership’s dedicated acreage can be temporarily
released from its dedication. If the Partnership interrupts or
curtails the receipt of Noble or CNX’s gas for a period of
five consecutive days or more than seven days within any
consecutive two week period, then Noble or CNX can temporarily
release from the dedication under the A&R Gathering Agreements
the affected volumes for a period lasting until the first day of
the month following 30 days after the Partnership’s notice to
Noble and CNX that the interruption or curtailment has ended. Any
temporary releases of acreage from the Partnership’s
dedication could materially adversely affect its business,
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability
to make cash distributions.

The
A&R Gathering Agreements will run with the land and be binding
on a transferee of any of the Partnership’s dedicated
acreage; however, each of Noble or CNX may transfer a portion of
the dedicated acreage free of the dedication to the Partnership.
The amount of acreage that may be transferred free of the
dedication will be increased (or decreased) by the adjusted net
acreage acquired (or divested) by Noble or CNX in the dedication
area, such adjustment to be based on the geographic location of the
acreage within the dedicated area. There are no restrictions under
the A&R Gathering Agreements on Noble or CNX’s ability to
transfer acreage in the ROFO Area, and any transferee of Noble or
CNX’s acreage in the ROFO Area will not be subject to the
Partnership’s right of first offer.

Upon
completion of its initial 20-year term on September 30, 2034, each
of the A&R Gathering Agreements will continue in effect from
year to year until such time as the respective agreement is
terminated by either the Partnership or Noble or CNX, respectively,
to such agreement on or before 180 days prior written
notice.

Relationships

Each of
the General Partner, the Partnership, Operating Company, DevCo I
LP, DevCo II LP and DevCo III LP is a direct or indirect
subsidiary, as applicable, of CONE Gathering, which is owned 50% by
CONSOL and 50% by Noble. As a result, certain individuals,
including directors of the General Partner, serve as officers
and/or directors of CONSOL or Noble. The General Partner, as the
general partner of the Partnership, owns a two percent general
partner interest in the Partnership and all of the
Partnership’s incentive distribution rights. CNX owns
4,519,060 Common Units and14,581,561 subordinated units
representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (“
Subordinated Units ”), which represents an
approximate 32.1% aggregate limited partner interest in the
Partnership, and NBL Midstream, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, owns 4,519,061 Common Units and 14,581,560 Subordinated
