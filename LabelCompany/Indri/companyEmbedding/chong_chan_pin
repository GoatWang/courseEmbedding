Kulicke & Soffa Appoints Chan Pin Chong as Vice President, Wedge Bonder Business Unit

    SINGAPORE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: KLIC) ("Kulicke & Soffa",

      "K&S" or the "Company") today announced

      that the Company appointed Chan Pin Chong as Vice President, Wedge

      Bonder Business Unit, effective immediately. Mr. Chong will be based at

      the K&S Office in Santa Ana, California, and report to the Company's

      President and Chief Executive Officer, Bruno Guilmart. Mr. Chong will

      succeed Matt Vorona, Vice President, Wedge Bonder Business Unit, who

      will be leaving in March 2014 after a long and successful career with

      K&S that began when the company acquired Orthodyne Electronics.

    

Mr. Guilmart continued, "Matt has done a tremendous job navigating our

      Wedge Bonder business through acquisition, moving manufacturing from

      California to Asia, and through difficult business conditions. I thank

      him for his hard work and dedication during his long leadership career

      with wedge bonding. I'm very pleased that he will remain with us for a

      transition period in order to transfer responsibilities to Chan Pin. I

      also welcome Chan Pin to the K&S leadership team. He's a seasoned

      executive that will lead the Wedge Bonding business unit to creatively

      look for and aggressively develop new market opportunities and

      strengthen our product portfolio."

    

Mr. Chong brings over 20 years of experience in the semiconductor and

      electronics industries, having held engineering and operations roles in

      his early career, spending the last 10 years in sales, business unit

      management and executive management roles. He started his career first

      as a Process and Test Engineer for Motorola, then Manufacturing Manager

      for Flextronics (NASDAQ: FLEX), followed by a long career at KLA-Tencor

      (NASDAQ: KLAC), holding such diverse positions as Sr. Technical Director

      and General Manager for a specific business unit. His most recent

      accomplishments were as Vice President of Sales and General Manager for

      Form Factor (NASDAQ: FORM) in Singapore, and then as Global President &

      CEO at Everett Charles Technologies. Mr. Chong received bachelor's

      degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from the State

      University of New York at Buffalo and a master's degree in business

      administration from the University of Leicester, UK.

    


      "I look forward to the challenge and am excited to join the K&S Wedge

      Bonding team," said Mr. Chong. "The semiconductor and hybrid markets

      will continue to evolve with technology requirements and challenges. I

      will focus on aligning our roadmap to meet our customer's requirements

      and grow our business by partnering with existing and emerging

      customers."
