   	Coverage Options to Ease Your Worries



   	We believe insurance should ease your concerns, not cause them. After all, what good is insurance if you have to worry about using it? Having the confidence that you're covered today can help you stay ahead of the unexpected, whether that’s damage from a rogue shopping cart or something more serious, like emergency medical costs.    Every Liberty Mutual Auto Insurance policy begins with valuable protection against costs associated with injuries to others and damage to their property if you are legally responsible for a car accident. From there, we offer options to cover the cost of damage from collision and non-collision related incidents. When you create a customized quote you'll be able to choose the coverage types and amounts that make the most sense to you, including:








   	New Car Replacement


Additional Coverage


   	Get the money for a brand new car when your totaled car is under a year old and has fewer than 15,000 miles.1









   	Better Car Replacement™


Additional Coverage


   	Get the money for a car that's one model year newer with 15,000 fewer miles than your totaled car.1









   	Accident Forgiveness


Additional Coverage


   	When you're involved in your first accident, we won't raise your insurance rates.2









   	Deductible Fund™


Additional Feature


   	Lowers and eventually eliminates your collision deductible.3









   	Medical Payments


Standard Coverage


   	Pays the initial medical expenses of people injured in your car.









   	Rental Car Reimbursement


Additional Coverage


   	Pays for a rental while your car is being repaired at an approved repair facility.4













   	Many Ways to Save Money



   	Better coverage doesn't have to break your budget. That's why we offer many car insurance discounts, some of which are built right into your policy, while others are determined on an individual basis. When you quote online or over the phone, we'll make sure you get all the discounts you qualify for and the lowest price possible. You can save in the following ways:










   	Bundle and Save


   	Save when you bundle your auto and home policies together.5











   	Multi-Car Discount


   	Save when you add multiple vehicles to your policy.6











   	Vehicle Safety Features Discount


   	Save when your car has certain features designed to keep you safe.6











   	New Vehicle Discount


   	Save when you add or change a vehicle on your policy.

Liberty Mutual Group, more commonly known by the name of its primary line of business, Liberty Mutual Insurance, is an American diversified global insurer, and the fourth-largest property and casualty insurer in the United States.[2] It ranks 76th on the Fortune 100 list of largest corporations in the United States based on 2013 revenue.[3] Based in Boston, Massachusetts, it employs over 50,000 people in more than 900 locations throughout the world. As of December 31, 2015, Liberty Mutual Insurance had $121.7 billion in consolidated assets, $102.5 billion in consolidated liabilities, and $37.6 billion in annual consolidated revenue.[1][4] The company, founded in 1912, offers a wide range of insurance products and services, including personal automobile, homeowners, workers' compensation, commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, general liability, global specialty, group disability, fire and surety.[5][6]

Liberty Mutual Group owns, wholly or in part, local insurance companies in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China (including Hong Kong), Colombia, Ecuador, India, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Venezuela and Vietnam.
In the United States, Liberty Mutual remains a mutual company where policyholders holding contracts for insurance are considered shareholders in the company. However, Liberty Mutual Group's brand usually operates as a separate entity outside the United States. In other countries, subsidiaries are often created in countries where legally recognized mutual company benefits cannot be enjoyed.
The current CEO is David H. Long. He succeeded his predecessor Edmund (Ted) F. Kelly on June 29, 2011.[7][8] Ted Kelly was appointed CEO in 1998.[9] In April 2013, Ted Kelly stepped down from the board of directors, as chairman.[10]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Liberty Mutual was founded in 1912 as the Massachusetts Employees Insurance Association (MEIA), following passage of a Massachusetts state law requiring employers to protect their employees with workers’ compensation insurance in 1911.[11] The first branch office was opened in 1914, and later that year, the company wrote its first automobile insurance policy. The company was founded as a Massachusetts Mutual Company, where its insureds have ownership in the company. The name was changed in 1917 to the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and, through partnerships, the company began offering full-coverage auto policies.
Structural changes[edit]
In 1964, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company began offering life insurance through its Liberty Life Assurance Branch. In 2002, the company converted into its current mutual holding company structure. The conversion was controversial, as it proposed to give policyholders an interest in the mutual insurance company, which some policyholders believed would dilute their interest in the overall company and limit their dividends.[12] A lawsuit was filed, alleging that information provided to policyholders was misleading. Liberty Mutual settled the lawsuit in December 2001, which required additional disclosure and limited certain compensation to company officers and directors.[13] Despite these concerns, the plan was approved by voting policyholders around November 2001.[14] Leveraging the greater flexibility of the mutual company structure, Liberty Mutual transformed from a single-line, highly regional insurer to one of the world's leading property and casualty insurance companies.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]
Liberty Mutual's growth has been both organic and through acquisition. Early acquisitions were small, but Liberty Mutual has made several large acquisitions over the past decade, including the high-profile acquisition of Safeco Corporation in 2008. Liberty Mutual agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of Safeco for $68.25 per share, for a total transaction price of approximately $6.2 billion. The result of this activity was an increase in revenue from $6 billion to over $30 billion in twelve years. In 1999, the company purchased Wausau Insurance Cos.[15]
Liberty Mutual created a television commercial in 2006 about people doing good things for strangers, reporting that the "overwhelming" positive response they received for the ad led to their decision to create the website The Responsibility Project.[16]
Liberty Mutual is also the sole corporate sponsor of the long-running PBS documentary series, American Experience, and has produced special commercial messages for airing during American Experience broadcasts. In 2011, as part of the company's "Real America" campaign, the company introduced two new commercials featuring Sacagawea and Paul Revere.
In 2011, the company began construction of the Liberty Mutual Tower, a 22-story skyscraper as part of its World Headquarters Expansion Project.[17] The building received its certificate of occupancy in June 2013.[18]
Organizational structure[edit]
Strategic business units[edit]
Liberty Mutual conducts all of its business through four strategic business units: US Consumer Markets, Commercial Insurance, Global Consumer Markets, and Global Specialty.[19]

US Consumer Markets[edit]
Passenger automobile, homeowners, life, annuity, and other property and casualty insurance products are available via Liberty Mutual's US Consumer Markets line. These products are branded under the Liberty Mutual Insurance and Safeco names, and are distributed via a vast network of over 2,300 sales professionals. Other distribution means are call centers, third-party producers, and the company's own website. Over 10,000 insurance agencies across the United States carry Safeco-branded products.[20]
Commercial insurance[edit]
Property and casualty, as well as group benefits commercial insurance products fall into two distinct categories: Business Insurance and National Insurance. The former caters to businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees, while the latter serves businesses in certain industries or which have greater than 1,000 employees. Group benefits products include disability insurance and group life insurance.[20]
Global Consumer Markets[edit]
Localized insurance companies sell Liberty International's products in 18 different countries and markets. International products are offered to both individual and business customers, and include property and casualty insurance, as well as health and life insurance products. The largest international product offering is passenger automobile insurance for private individuals.[20]
Global Specialty[edit]
The Global Specialty insurance line offers specialty products, such as marine, energy, aviation, professional liability, and crisis management, offered through 40 Liberty International Underwriters offices worldwide. In addition, Liberty International Underwriters provides global multi-line insurance and reinsurance written on its Lloyd's Syndicate 4472 platform. Global Specialty also includes reinsurance products offered through Liberty Mutual Reinsurance.[20]

Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety[edit]
Founded in 1954, the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety has studied the occupational safety and health of workers. Its scientific contributions include machine safeguarding guidelines, the Cornell-Liberty Survival Car, and ergonomic guidelines that have informed the basis for national and international safety standards. More recently, the Institute developed the Workplace Safety Index, which is an annual ranking of the leading causes of the most disabling occupational injuries in the United States.
The Institute's scientists conduct field and laboratory experiments to study the major causes of work-related injury and disability, publishing their results in peer-reviewed scientific literature. Institute findings are the basis for safety programs, recommendations, and software used by Liberty Mutual loss control consultants in order to help policyholders enhance worker safety. The Institute’s work is non-proprietary, and is available to the public.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27]

In 2012 and 2013, a series of investigative articles were published in Liberty Mutual's hometown newspaper: The Boston Globe. These reports were written by Brian McGrory who later became the editor of The Boston Globe. It reported issues related to excessive compensation and questionable weekend trips using the fleet of five long-range corporate jets by its executives.[28] In the investigative reporting series, as a columnist, a number of questions related to the company were discovered; among them- (all cited):
In 2006, Liberty Mutual claims employees in the Los Angeles area desired overtime pay for work and labor accomplished related to claims work. The situation escalated, and Liberty Mutual accepted a legal question which was originally in the form of four class action lawsuits filed by its own claims representatives and employees. Some questions started in 2006 in North Carolina.[29]
Questions of this particular suit, from Liberty Mutual employees, resulted from the company's desired service to a claim, versus claim outcomes. Liberty Mutual worked on specific metrics. This case provided the company with legal precedent to claims handling and ability to process claims based on values from third party information outside of claims that repair or replace property without having to view the physical property insured. As such, Liberty Mutual closed all its locations in Los Angeles, the nation's second largest insurance market, following this action at the behest of its employees.
In late 2012, the company won an appeal granting it the ability not to pay employees for work performed on an overtime basis. Pursuit was considered an award for the insurance industry as a whole.[30] In this specific case, Liberty Mutual failed to appear. Instead, they relied on an Amicus Brief filed on behalf of the US Department of Labor.[31] The Court decided, based on the Amicus Brief, that claims personnel are exempt "Administrative Employees" and not subject to overtime pay, further supporting the mutual company's goals. In late 2012, the California Supreme Court also redacted court documents.[32]
"The benefits of political friendship" provides a newspaper published report on Liberty Mutual's political ties, including ties to Deval Patrick, the then Governor of Massachusetts. This friendship is alleged to have resulted in Liberty Mutual's receipt of tax breaks in the amount of $41M.[33]
"Perspectives Can Change at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published look at Liberty Mutual's claims process; where Liberty Mutual sued its own insured for filing a claim; and forced an award against Liberty Mutual. The article also disclosed that Liberty Mutual's legal team that represented the case usually paid less than half of the judgements.[34]
"Liberty Mutual: Your premiums, his premium office" provides a newspaper published account of CEO David H Long's desire to redecorate his 1,000sq foot office at a price of $4.5M. The article also discusses the need of the insurance company to have four corporate jets.[35]
"An Untimely Award" provides a newspaper published report of corporate governance at Liberty Mutual.[36]
"View from the top at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published report from Boston Globe editor, Brian McGrory who was invited to the recently renovated CEO suite at Liberty Mutual.[37]
"Lots more to Liberty Mutual pay story" provides a newspaper published report of a comparative analysis of other executives' pay in Boston.[38]
"At Liberty Mutual, Accounting To No One For Executive Privileges" provides a newspaper published report and review of itineraries of the fleet of corporate jets, and executive compensation which includes "Make believe stock options". By virtue of a Mutual-Company setup, its customers own stock in the company.[39]

Liberty Mutual Group, more commonly known by the name of its primary line of business, Liberty Mutual Insurance, is an American diversified global insurer, and the fourth-largest property and casualty insurer in the United States.[2] It ranks 76th on the Fortune 100 list of largest corporations in the United States based on 2013 revenue.[3] Based in Boston, Massachusetts, it employs over 50,000 people in more than 900 locations throughout the world. As of December 31, 2015, Liberty Mutual Insurance had $121.7 billion in consolidated assets, $102.5 billion in consolidated liabilities, and $37.6 billion in annual consolidated revenue.[1][4] The company, founded in 1912, offers a wide range of insurance products and services, including personal automobile, homeowners, workers' compensation, commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, general liability, global specialty, group disability, fire and surety.[5][6]

Liberty Mutual Group owns, wholly or in part, local insurance companies in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China (including Hong Kong), Colombia, Ecuador, India, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Venezuela and Vietnam.
In the United States, Liberty Mutual remains a mutual company where policyholders holding contracts for insurance are considered shareholders in the company. However, Liberty Mutual Group's brand usually operates as a separate entity outside the United States. In other countries, subsidiaries are often created in countries where legally recognized mutual company benefits cannot be enjoyed.
The current CEO is David H. Long. He succeeded his predecessor Edmund (Ted) F. Kelly on June 29, 2011.[7][8] Ted Kelly was appointed CEO in 1998.[9] In April 2013, Ted Kelly stepped down from the board of directors, as chairman.[10]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Liberty Mutual was founded in 1912 as the Massachusetts Employees Insurance Association (MEIA), following passage of a Massachusetts state law requiring employers to protect their employees with workers’ compensation insurance in 1911.[11] The first branch office was opened in 1914, and later that year, the company wrote its first automobile insurance policy. The company was founded as a Massachusetts Mutual Company, where its insureds have ownership in the company. The name was changed in 1917 to the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and, through partnerships, the company began offering full-coverage auto policies.
Structural changes[edit]
In 1964, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company began offering life insurance through its Liberty Life Assurance Branch. In 2002, the company converted into its current mutual holding company structure. The conversion was controversial, as it proposed to give policyholders an interest in the mutual insurance company, which some policyholders believed would dilute their interest in the overall company and limit their dividends.[12] A lawsuit was filed, alleging that information provided to policyholders was misleading. Liberty Mutual settled the lawsuit in December 2001, which required additional disclosure and limited certain compensation to company officers and directors.[13] Despite these concerns, the plan was approved by voting policyholders around November 2001.[14] Leveraging the greater flexibility of the mutual company structure, Liberty Mutual transformed from a single-line, highly regional insurer to one of the world's leading property and casualty insurance companies.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]
Liberty Mutual's growth has been both organic and through acquisition. Early acquisitions were small, but Liberty Mutual has made several large acquisitions over the past decade, including the high-profile acquisition of Safeco Corporation in 2008. Liberty Mutual agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of Safeco for $68.25 per share, for a total transaction price of approximately $6.2 billion. The result of this activity was an increase in revenue from $6 billion to over $30 billion in twelve years. In 1999, the company purchased Wausau Insurance Cos.[15]
Liberty Mutual created a television commercial in 2006 about people doing good things for strangers, reporting that the "overwhelming" positive response they received for the ad led to their decision to create the website The Responsibility Project.[16]
Liberty Mutual is also the sole corporate sponsor of the long-running PBS documentary series, American Experience, and has produced special commercial messages for airing during American Experience broadcasts. In 2011, as part of the company's "Real America" campaign, the company introduced two new commercials featuring Sacagawea and Paul Revere.
In 2011, the company began construction of the Liberty Mutual Tower, a 22-story skyscraper as part of its World Headquarters Expansion Project.[17] The building received its certificate of occupancy in June 2013.[18]
Organizational structure[edit]
Strategic business units[edit]
Liberty Mutual conducts all of its business through four strategic business units: US Consumer Markets, Commercial Insurance, Global Consumer Markets, and Global Specialty.[19]

US Consumer Markets[edit]
Passenger automobile, homeowners, life, annuity, and other property and casualty insurance products are available via Liberty Mutual's US Consumer Markets line. These products are branded under the Liberty Mutual Insurance and Safeco names, and are distributed via a vast network of over 2,300 sales professionals. Other distribution means are call centers, third-party producers, and the company's own website. Over 10,000 insurance agencies across the United States carry Safeco-branded products.[20]
Commercial insurance[edit]
Property and casualty, as well as group benefits commercial insurance products fall into two distinct categories: Business Insurance and National Insurance. The former caters to businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees, while the latter serves businesses in certain industries or which have greater than 1,000 employees. Group benefits products include disability insurance and group life insurance.[20]
Global Consumer Markets[edit]
Localized insurance companies sell Liberty International's products in 18 different countries and markets. International products are offered to both individual and business customers, and include property and casualty insurance, as well as health and life insurance products. The largest international product offering is passenger automobile insurance for private individuals.[20]
Global Specialty[edit]
The Global Specialty insurance line offers specialty products, such as marine, energy, aviation, professional liability, and crisis management, offered through 40 Liberty International Underwriters offices worldwide. In addition, Liberty International Underwriters provides global multi-line insurance and reinsurance written on its Lloyd's Syndicate 4472 platform. Global Specialty also includes reinsurance products offered through Liberty Mutual Reinsurance.[20]

As of December 31, 2015, Liberty Mutual Insurance had $121.7 billion in consolidated assets, $102.5 billion in consolidated liabilities, and $37.6 billion in annual consolidated revenue.[1][4] The company, founded in 1912, offers a wide range of insurance products and services, including personal automobile, homeowners, workers' compensation, commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, general liability, global specialty, group disability, fire and surety.[5][6]

However, Liberty Mutual Group's brand usually operates as a separate entity outside the United States. In other countries, subsidiaries are often created in countries where legally recognized mutual company benefits cannot be enjoyed.
The current CEO is David H. Long. He succeeded his predecessor Edmund (Ted) F. Kelly on June 29, 2011.[7][8] Ted Kelly was appointed CEO in 1998.[9] In April 2013, Ted Kelly stepped down from the board of directors, as chairman.[10]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Liberty Mutual was founded in 1912 as the Massachusetts Employees Insurance Association (MEIA), following passage of a Massachusetts state law requiring employers to protect their employees with workers’ compensation insurance in 1911.[11] The first branch office was opened in 1914, and later that year, the company wrote its first automobile insurance policy. The company was founded as a Massachusetts Mutual Company, where its insureds have ownership in the company. The name was changed in 1917 to the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and, through partnerships, the company began offering full-coverage auto policies.
Structural changes[edit]
In 1964, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company began offering life insurance through its Liberty Life Assurance Branch. In 2002, the company converted into its current mutual holding company structure. The conversion was controversial, as it proposed to give policyholders an interest in the mutual insurance company, which some policyholders believed would dilute their interest in the overall company and limit their dividends.[12] A lawsuit was filed, alleging that information provided to policyholders was misleading. Liberty Mutual settled the lawsuit in December 2001, which required additional disclosure and limited certain compensation to company officers and directors.[13] Despite these concerns, the plan was approved by voting policyholders around November 2001.[14] Leveraging the greater flexibility of the mutual company structure, Liberty Mutual transformed from a single-line, highly regional insurer to one of the world's leading property and casualty insurance companies.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]
Liberty Mutual's growth has been both organic and through acquisition. Early acquisitions were small, but Liberty Mutual has made several large acquisitions over the past decade, including the high-profile acquisition of Safeco Corporation in 2008. Liberty Mutual agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of Safeco for $68.25 per share, for a total transaction price of approximately $6.2 billion. The result of this activity was an increase in revenue from $6 billion to over $30 billion in twelve years. In 1999, the company purchased Wausau Insurance Cos.[15]
Liberty Mutual created a television commercial in 2006 about people doing good things for strangers, reporting that the "overwhelming" positive response they received for the ad led to their decision to create the website The Responsibility Project.[16]
Liberty Mutual is also the sole corporate sponsor of the long-running PBS documentary series, American Experience, and has produced special commercial messages for airing during American Experience broadcasts. In 2011, as part of the company's "Real America" campaign, the company introduced two new commercials featuring Sacagawea and Paul Revere.
In 2011, the company began construction of the Liberty Mutual Tower, a 22-story skyscraper as part of its World Headquarters Expansion Project.[17] The building received its certificate of occupancy in June 2013.[18]
Organizational structure[edit]
Strategic business units[edit]
Liberty Mutual conducts all of its business through four strategic business units: US Consumer Markets, Commercial Insurance, Global Consumer Markets, and Global Specialty.[19]

US Consumer Markets[edit]
Passenger automobile, homeowners, life, annuity, and other property and casualty insurance products are available via Liberty Mutual's US Consumer Markets line. These products are branded under the Liberty Mutual Insurance and Safeco names, and are distributed via a vast network of over 2,300 sales professionals. Other distribution means are call centers, third-party producers, and the company's own website. Over 10,000 insurance agencies across the United States carry Safeco-branded products.[20]
Commercial insurance[edit]
Property and casualty, as well as group benefits commercial insurance products fall into two distinct categories: Business Insurance and National Insurance. The former caters to businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees, while the latter serves businesses in certain industries or which have greater than 1,000 employees. Group benefits products include disability insurance and group life insurance.[20]
Global Consumer Markets[edit]
Localized insurance companies sell Liberty International's products in 18 different countries and markets. International products are offered to both individual and business customers, and include property and casualty insurance, as well as health and life insurance products. The largest international product offering is passenger automobile insurance for private individuals.[20]
Global Specialty[edit]
The Global Specialty insurance line offers specialty products, such as marine, energy, aviation, professional liability, and crisis management, offered through 40 Liberty International Underwriters offices worldwide. In addition, Liberty International Underwriters provides global multi-line insurance and reinsurance written on its Lloyd's Syndicate 4472 platform. Global Specialty also includes reinsurance products offered through Liberty Mutual Reinsurance.[20]

Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety[edit]
Founded in 1954, the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety has studied the occupational safety and health of workers. Its scientific contributions include machine safeguarding guidelines, the Cornell-Liberty Survival Car, and ergonomic guidelines that have informed the basis for national and international safety standards. More recently, the Institute developed the Workplace Safety Index, which is an annual ranking of the leading causes of the most disabling occupational injuries in the United States.
The Institute's scientists conduct field and laboratory experiments to study the major causes of work-related injury and disability, publishing their results in peer-reviewed scientific literature. Institute findings are the basis for safety programs, recommendations, and software used by Liberty Mutual loss control consultants in order to help policyholders enhance worker safety. The Institute’s work is non-proprietary, and is available to the public.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27]
Controversy[edit]





This article may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards. The specific problem is: this section is disorganized and poorly written Please help improve this article if you can. (December 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


In 2012 and 2013, a series of investigative articles were published in Liberty Mutual's hometown newspaper: The Boston Globe. These reports were written by Brian McGrory who later became the editor of The Boston Globe. It reported issues related to excessive compensation and questionable weekend trips using the fleet of five long-range corporate jets by its executives.[28] In the investigative reporting series, as a columnist, a number of questions related to the company were discovered; among them- (all cited):
In 2006, Liberty Mutual claims employees in the Los Angeles area desired overtime pay for work and labor accomplished related to claims work. The situation escalated, and Liberty Mutual accepted a legal question which was originally in the form of four class action lawsuits filed by its own claims representatives and employees. Some questions started in 2006 in North Carolina.[29]
Questions of this particular suit, from Liberty Mutual employees, resulted from the company's desired service to a claim, versus claim outcomes. Liberty Mutual worked on specific metrics. This case provided the company with legal precedent to claims handling and ability to process claims based on values from third party information outside of claims that repair or replace property without having to view the physical property insured. As such, Liberty Mutual closed all its locations in Los Angeles, the nation's second largest insurance market, following this action at the behest of its employees.
In late 2012, the company won an appeal granting it the ability not to pay employees for work performed on an overtime basis. Pursuit was considered an award for the insurance industry as a whole.[30] In this specific case, Liberty Mutual failed to appear. Instead, they relied on an Amicus Brief filed on behalf of the US Department of Labor.[31] The Court decided, based on the Amicus Brief, that claims personnel are exempt "Administrative Employees" and not subject to overtime pay, further supporting the mutual company's goals. In late 2012, the California Supreme Court also redacted court documents.[32]
"The benefits of political friendship" provides a newspaper published report on Liberty Mutual's political ties, including ties to Deval Patrick, the then Governor of Massachusetts. This friendship is alleged to have resulted in Liberty Mutual's receipt of tax breaks in the amount of $41M.[33]
"Perspectives Can Change at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published look at Liberty Mutual's claims process; where Liberty Mutual sued its own insured for filing a claim; and forced an award against Liberty Mutual. The article also disclosed that Liberty Mutual's legal team that represented the case usually paid less than half of the judgements.[34]
"Liberty Mutual: Your premiums, his premium office" provides a newspaper published account of CEO David H Long's desire to redecorate his 1,000sq foot office at a price of $4.5M. The article also discusses the need of the insurance company to have four corporate jets.[35]
"An Untimely Award" provides a newspaper published report of corporate governance at Liberty Mutual.[36]
"View from the top at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published report from Boston Globe editor, Brian McGrory who was invited to the recently renovated CEO suite at Liberty Mutual.[37]
"Lots more to Liberty Mutual pay story" provides a newspaper published report of a comparative analysis of other executives' pay in Boston.[38]
"At Liberty Mutual, Accounting To No One For Executive Privileges" provides a newspaper published report and review of itineraries of the fleet of corporate jets, and executive compensation which includes "Make believe stock options". By virtue of a Mutual-Company setup, its customers own stock in the company.[39]

In the United States, Liberty Mutual remains a mutual company where policyholders holding contracts for insurance are considered shareholders in the company. However, Liberty Mutual Group's brand usually operates as a separate entity outside the United States. In other countries, subsidiaries are often created in countries where legally recognized mutual company benefits cannot be enjoyed.
The current CEO is David H. Long. He succeeded his predecessor Edmund (Ted) F. Kelly on June 29, 2011.[7][8] Ted Kelly was appointed CEO in 1998.[9] In April 2013, Ted Kelly stepped down from the board of directors, as chairman.[10]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Liberty Mutual was founded in 1912 as the Massachusetts Employees Insurance Association (MEIA), following passage of a Massachusetts state law requiring employers to protect their employees with workers’ compensation insurance in 1911.[11] The first branch office was opened in 1914, and later that year, the company wrote its first automobile insurance policy. The company was founded as a Massachusetts Mutual Company, where its insureds have ownership in the company. The name was changed in 1917 to the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and, through partnerships, the company began offering full-coverage auto policies.
Structural changes[edit]
In 1964, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company began offering life insurance through its Liberty Life Assurance Branch. In 2002, the company converted into its current mutual holding company structure. The conversion was controversial, as it proposed to give policyholders an interest in the mutual insurance company, which some policyholders believed would dilute their interest in the overall company and limit their dividends.[12] A lawsuit was filed, alleging that information provided to policyholders was misleading. Liberty Mutual settled the lawsuit in December 2001, which required additional disclosure and limited certain compensation to company officers and directors.[13] Despite these concerns, the plan was approved by voting policyholders around November 2001.[14] Leveraging the greater flexibility of the mutual company structure, Liberty Mutual transformed from a single-line, highly regional insurer to one of the world's leading property and casualty insurance companies.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]
Liberty Mutual's growth has been both organic and through acquisition. Early acquisitions were small, but Liberty Mutual has made several large acquisitions over the past decade, including the high-profile acquisition of Safeco Corporation in 2008. Liberty Mutual agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of Safeco for $68.25 per share, for a total transaction price of approximately $6.2 billion. The result of this activity was an increase in revenue from $6 billion to over $30 billion in twelve years. In 1999, the company purchased Wausau Insurance Cos.[15]
Liberty Mutual created a television commercial in 2006 about people doing good things for strangers, reporting that the "overwhelming" positive response they received for the ad led to their decision to create the website The Responsibility Project.[16]
Liberty Mutual is also the sole corporate sponsor of the long-running PBS documentary series, American Experience, and has produced special commercial messages for airing during American Experience broadcasts. In 2011, as part of the company's "Real America" campaign, the company introduced two new commercials featuring Sacagawea and Paul Revere.
In 2011, the company began construction of the Liberty Mutual Tower, a 22-story skyscraper as part of its World Headquarters Expansion Project.[17] The building received its certificate of occupancy in June 2013.[18]
Organizational structure[edit]
Strategic business units[edit]
Liberty Mutual conducts all of its business through four strategic business units: US Consumer Markets, Commercial Insurance, Global Consumer Markets, and Global Specialty.[19]

US Consumer Markets[edit]
Passenger automobile, homeowners, life, annuity, and other property and casualty insurance products are available via Liberty Mutual's US Consumer Markets line. These products are branded under the Liberty Mutual Insurance and Safeco names, and are distributed via a vast network of over 2,300 sales professionals. Other distribution means are call centers, third-party producers, and the company's own website. Over 10,000 insurance agencies across the United States carry Safeco-branded products.[20]
Commercial insurance[edit]
Property and casualty, as well as group benefits commercial insurance products fall into two distinct categories: Business Insurance and National Insurance. The former caters to businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees, while the latter serves businesses in certain industries or which have greater than 1,000 employees. Group benefits products include disability insurance and group life insurance.[20]
Global Consumer Markets[edit]
Localized insurance companies sell Liberty International's products in 18 different countries and markets. International products are offered to both individual and business customers, and include property and casualty insurance, as well as health and life insurance products. The largest international product offering is passenger automobile insurance for private individuals.[20]
Global Specialty[edit]
The Global Specialty insurance line offers specialty products, such as marine, energy, aviation, professional liability, and crisis management, offered through 40 Liberty International Underwriters offices worldwide. In addition, Liberty International Underwriters provides global multi-line insurance and reinsurance written on its Lloyd's Syndicate 4472 platform. Global Specialty also includes reinsurance products offered through Liberty Mutual Reinsurance.[20]

Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety[edit]
Founded in 1954, the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety has studied the occupational safety and health of workers. Its scientific contributions include machine safeguarding guidelines, the Cornell-Liberty Survival Car, and ergonomic guidelines that have informed the basis for national and international safety standards. More recently, the Institute developed the Workplace Safety Index, which is an annual ranking of the leading causes of the most disabling occupational injuries in the United States.
The Institute's scientists conduct field and laboratory experiments to study the major causes of work-related injury and disability, publishing their results in peer-reviewed scientific literature. Institute findings are the basis for safety programs, recommendations, and software used by Liberty Mutual loss control consultants in order to help policyholders enhance worker safety. The Institute’s work is non-proprietary, and is available to the public.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27]
Controversy[edit]

In 2012 and 2013, a series of investigative articles were published in Liberty Mutual's hometown newspaper: The Boston Globe. These reports were written by Brian McGrory who later became the editor of The Boston Globe. It reported issues related to excessive compensation and questionable weekend trips using the fleet of five long-range corporate jets by its executives.[28] In the investigative reporting series, as a columnist, a number of questions related to the company were discovered; among them- (all cited):
In 2006, Liberty Mutual claims employees in the Los Angeles area desired overtime pay for work and labor accomplished related to claims work. The situation escalated, and Liberty Mutual accepted a legal question which was originally in the form of four class action lawsuits filed by its own claims representatives and employees. Some questions started in 2006 in North Carolina.[29]
Questions of this particular suit, from Liberty Mutual employees, resulted from the company's desired service to a claim, versus claim outcomes. Liberty Mutual worked on specific metrics. This case provided the company with legal precedent to claims handling and ability to process claims based on values from third party information outside of claims that repair or replace property without having to view the physical property insured. As such, Liberty Mutual closed all its locations in Los Angeles, the nation's second largest insurance market, following this action at the behest of its employees.
In late 2012, the company won an appeal granting it the ability not to pay employees for work performed on an overtime basis. Pursuit was considered an award for the insurance industry as a whole.[30] In this specific case, Liberty Mutual failed to appear. Instead, they relied on an Amicus Brief filed on behalf of the US Department of Labor.[31] The Court decided, based on the Amicus Brief, that claims personnel are exempt "Administrative Employees" and not subject to overtime pay, further supporting the mutual company's goals. In late 2012, the California Supreme Court also redacted court documents.[32]
"The benefits of political friendship" provides a newspaper published report on Liberty Mutual's political ties, including ties to Deval Patrick, the then Governor of Massachusetts. This friendship is alleged to have resulted in Liberty Mutual's receipt of tax breaks in the amount of $41M.[33]
"Perspectives Can Change at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published look at Liberty Mutual's claims process; where Liberty Mutual sued its own insured for filing a claim; and forced an award against Liberty Mutual. The article also disclosed that Liberty Mutual's legal team that represented the case usually paid less than half of the judgements.[34]
"Liberty Mutual: Your premiums, his premium office" provides a newspaper published account of CEO David H Long's desire to redecorate his 1,000sq foot office at a price of $4.5M. The article also discusses the need of the insurance company to have four corporate jets.[35]
"An Untimely Award" provides a newspaper published report of corporate governance at Liberty Mutual.[36]
"View from the top at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published report from Boston Globe editor, Brian McGrory who was invited to the recently renovated CEO suite at Liberty Mutual.[37]
"Lots more to Liberty Mutual pay story" provides a newspaper published report of a comparative analysis of other executives' pay in Boston.[38]
"At Liberty Mutual, Accounting To No One For Executive Privileges" provides a newspaper published report and review of itineraries of the fleet of corporate jets, and executive compensation which includes "Make believe stock options". By virtue of a Mutual-Company setup, its customers own stock in the company.[39]

Liberty Mutual Group, more commonly known by the name of its primary line of business, Liberty Mutual Insurance, is an American diversified global insurer, and the fourth-largest property and casualty insurer in the United States.[2] It ranks 76th on the Fortune 100 list of largest corporations in the United States based on 2013 revenue.[3] Based in Boston, Massachusetts, it employs over 50,000 people in more than 900 locations throughout the world. As of December 31, 2015, Liberty Mutual Insurance had $121.7 billion in consolidated assets, $102.5 billion in consolidated liabilities, and $37.6 billion in annual consolidated revenue.[1][4] The company, founded in 1912, offers a wide range of insurance products and services, including personal automobile, homeowners, workers' compensation, commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, general liability, global specialty, group disability, fire and surety.[5][6]

Liberty Mutual Group owns, wholly or in part, local insurance companies in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China (including Hong Kong), Colombia, Ecuador, India, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Venezuela and Vietnam.
In the United States, Liberty Mutual remains a mutual company where policyholders holding contracts for insurance are considered shareholders in the company. However, Liberty Mutual Group's brand usually operates as a separate entity outside the United States. In other countries, subsidiaries are often created in countries where legally recognized mutual company benefits cannot be enjoyed.
The current CEO is David H. Long. He succeeded his predecessor Edmund (Ted) F. Kelly on June 29, 2011.[7][8] Ted Kelly was appointed CEO in 1998.[9] In April 2013, Ted Kelly stepped down from the board of directors, as chairman.[10]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Liberty Mutual was founded in 1912 as the Massachusetts Employees Insurance Association (MEIA), following passage of a Massachusetts state law requiring employers to protect their employees with workers’ compensation insurance in 1911.[11] The first branch office was opened in 1914, and later that year, the company wrote its first automobile insurance policy. The company was founded as a Massachusetts Mutual Company, where its insureds have ownership in the company. The name was changed in 1917 to the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and, through partnerships, the company began offering full-coverage auto policies.
Structural changes[edit]
In 1964, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company began offering life insurance through its Liberty Life Assurance Branch. In 2002, the company converted into its current mutual holding company structure. The conversion was controversial, as it proposed to give policyholders an interest in the mutual insurance company, which some policyholders believed would dilute their interest in the overall company and limit their dividends.[12] A lawsuit was filed, alleging that information provided to policyholders was misleading. Liberty Mutual settled the lawsuit in December 2001, which required additional disclosure and limited certain compensation to company officers and directors.[13] Despite these concerns, the plan was approved by voting policyholders around November 2001.[14] Leveraging the greater flexibility of the mutual company structure, Liberty Mutual transformed from a single-line, highly regional insurer to one of the world's leading property and casualty insurance companies.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]
Liberty Mutual's growth has been both organic and through acquisition. Early acquisitions were small, but Liberty Mutual has made several large acquisitions over the past decade, including the high-profile acquisition of Safeco Corporation in 2008. Liberty Mutual agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of Safeco for $68.25 per share, for a total transaction price of approximately $6.2 billion. The result of this activity was an increase in revenue from $6 billion to over $30 billion in twelve years. In 1999, the company purchased Wausau Insurance Cos.[15]
Liberty Mutual created a television commercial in 2006 about people doing good things for strangers, reporting that the "overwhelming" positive response they received for the ad led to their decision to create the website The Responsibility Project.[16]
Liberty Mutual is also the sole corporate sponsor of the long-running PBS documentary series, American Experience, and has produced special commercial messages for airing during American Experience broadcasts. In 2011, as part of the company's "Real America" campaign, the company introduced two new commercials featuring Sacagawea and Paul Revere.
In 2011, the company began construction of the Liberty Mutual Tower, a 22-story skyscraper as part of its World Headquarters Expansion Project.[17] The building received its certificate of occupancy in June 2013.[18]
Organizational structure[edit]
Strategic business units[edit]
Liberty Mutual conducts all of its business through four strategic business units: US Consumer Markets, Commercial Insurance, Global Consumer Markets, and Global Specialty.[19]

US Consumer Markets[edit]
Passenger automobile, homeowners, life, annuity, and other property and casualty insurance products are available via Liberty Mutual's US Consumer Markets line. These products are branded under the Liberty Mutual Insurance and Safeco names, and are distributed via a vast network of over 2,300 sales professionals. Other distribution means are call centers, third-party producers, and the company's own website. Over 10,000 insurance agencies across the United States carry Safeco-branded products.[20]
Commercial insurance[edit]
Property and casualty, as well as group benefits commercial insurance products fall into two distinct categories: Business Insurance and National Insurance. The former caters to businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees, while the latter serves businesses in certain industries or which have greater than 1,000 employees. Group benefits products include disability insurance and group life insurance.[20]
Global Consumer Markets[edit]
Localized insurance companies sell Liberty International's products in 18 different countries and markets. International products are offered to both individual and business customers, and include property and casualty insurance, as well as health and life insurance products. The largest international product offering is passenger automobile insurance for private individuals.[20]
Global Specialty[edit]
The Global Specialty insurance line offers specialty products, such as marine, energy, aviation, professional liability, and crisis management, offered through 40 Liberty International Underwriters offices worldwide. In addition, Liberty International Underwriters provides global multi-line insurance and reinsurance written on its Lloyd's Syndicate 4472 platform. Global Specialty also includes reinsurance products offered through Liberty Mutual Reinsurance.[20]

Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety[edit]
Founded in 1954, the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety has studied the occupational safety and health of workers. Its scientific contributions include machine safeguarding guidelines, the Cornell-Liberty Survival Car, and ergonomic guidelines that have informed the basis for national and international safety standards. More recently, the Institute developed the Workplace Safety Index, which is an annual ranking of the leading causes of the most disabling occupational injuries in the United States.
The Institute's scientists conduct field and laboratory experiments to study the major causes of work-related injury and disability, publishing their results in peer-reviewed scientific literature. Institute findings are the basis for safety programs, recommendations, and software used by Liberty Mutual loss control consultants in order to help policyholders enhance worker safety. The Institute’s work is non-proprietary, and is available to the public.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27]
Controversy[edit]





This article may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards. The specific problem is: this section is disorganized and poorly written Please help improve this article if you can. (December 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


In 2012 and 2013, a series of investigative articles were published in Liberty Mutual's hometown newspaper: The Boston Globe. These reports were written by Brian McGrory who later became the editor of The Boston Globe. It reported issues related to excessive compensation and questionable weekend trips using the fleet of five long-range corporate jets by its executives.[28] In the investigative reporting series, as a columnist, a number of questions related to the company were discovered; among them- (all cited):
In 2006, Liberty Mutual claims employees in the Los Angeles area desired overtime pay for work and labor accomplished related to claims work. The situation escalated, and Liberty Mutual accepted a legal question which was originally in the form of four class action lawsuits filed by its own claims representatives and employees. Some questions started in 2006 in North Carolina.[29]
Questions of this particular suit, from Liberty Mutual employees, resulted from the company's desired service to a claim, versus claim outcomes. Liberty Mutual worked on specific metrics. This case provided the company with legal precedent to claims handling and ability to process claims based on values from third party information outside of claims that repair or replace property without having to view the physical property insured. As such, Liberty Mutual closed all its locations in Los Angeles, the nation's second largest insurance market, following this action at the behest of its employees.
In late 2012, the company won an appeal granting it the ability not to pay employees for work performed on an overtime basis. Pursuit was considered an award for the insurance industry as a whole.[30] In this specific case, Liberty Mutual failed to appear. Instead, they relied on an Amicus Brief filed on behalf of the US Department of Labor.[31] The Court decided, based on the Amicus Brief, that claims personnel are exempt "Administrative Employees" and not subject to overtime pay, further supporting the mutual company's goals. In late 2012, the California Supreme Court also redacted court documents.[32]
"The benefits of political friendship" provides a newspaper published report on Liberty Mutual's political ties, including ties to Deval Patrick, the then Governor of Massachusetts. This friendship is alleged to have resulted in Liberty Mutual's receipt of tax breaks in the amount of $41M.[33]
"Perspectives Can Change at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published look at Liberty Mutual's claims process; where Liberty Mutual sued its own insured for filing a claim; and forced an award against Liberty Mutual. The article also disclosed that Liberty Mutual's legal team that represented the case usually paid less than half of the judgements.[34]
"Liberty Mutual: Your premiums, his premium office" provides a newspaper published account of CEO David H Long's desire to redecorate his 1,000sq foot office at a price of $4.5M. The article also discusses the need of the insurance company to have four corporate jets.[35]
"An Untimely Award" provides a newspaper published report of corporate governance at Liberty Mutual.[36]
"View from the top at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published report from Boston Globe editor, Brian McGrory who was invited to the recently renovated CEO suite at Liberty Mutual.[37]
"Lots more to Liberty Mutual pay story" provides a newspaper published report of a comparative analysis of other executives' pay in Boston.[38]
"At Liberty Mutual, Accounting To No One For Executive Privileges" provides a newspaper published report and review of itineraries of the fleet of corporate jets, and executive compensation which includes "Make believe stock options". By virtue of a Mutual-Company setup, its customers own stock in the company.[39]

Liberty Mutual Group owns, wholly or in part, local insurance companies in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China (including Hong Kong), Colombia, Ecuador, India, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Venezuela and Vietnam.
In the United States, Liberty Mutual remains a mutual company where policyholders holding contracts for insurance are considered shareholders in the company. However, Liberty Mutual Group's brand usually operates as a separate entity outside the United States. In other countries, subsidiaries are often created in countries where legally recognized mutual company benefits cannot be enjoyed.
The current CEO is David H. Long. He succeeded his predecessor Edmund (Ted) F. Kelly on June 29, 2011.[7][8] Ted Kelly was appointed CEO in 1998.[9] In April 2013, Ted Kelly stepped down from the board of directors, as chairman.[10]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Liberty Mutual was founded in 1912 as the Massachusetts Employees Insurance Association (MEIA), following passage of a Massachusetts state law requiring employers to protect their employees with workers’ compensation insurance in 1911.[11] The first branch office was opened in 1914, and later that year, the company wrote its first automobile insurance policy. The company was founded as a Massachusetts Mutual Company, where its insureds have ownership in the company. The name was changed in 1917 to the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and, through partnerships, the company began offering full-coverage auto policies.
Structural changes[edit]
In 1964, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company began offering life insurance through its Liberty Life Assurance Branch. In 2002, the company converted into its current mutual holding company structure. The conversion was controversial, as it proposed to give policyholders an interest in the mutual insurance company, which some policyholders believed would dilute their interest in the overall company and limit their dividends.[12] A lawsuit was filed, alleging that information provided to policyholders was misleading. Liberty Mutual settled the lawsuit in December 2001, which required additional disclosure and limited certain compensation to company officers and directors.[13] Despite these concerns, the plan was approved by voting policyholders around November 2001.[14] Leveraging the greater flexibility of the mutual company structure, Liberty Mutual transformed from a single-line, highly regional insurer to one of the world's leading property and casualty insurance companies.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]
Liberty Mutual's growth has been both organic and through acquisition. Early acquisitions were small, but Liberty Mutual has made several large acquisitions over the past decade, including the high-profile acquisition of Safeco Corporation in 2008. Liberty Mutual agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of Safeco for $68.25 per share, for a total transaction price of approximately $6.2 billion. The result of this activity was an increase in revenue from $6 billion to over $30 billion in twelve years. In 1999, the company purchased Wausau Insurance Cos.[15]
Liberty Mutual created a television commercial in 2006 about people doing good things for strangers, reporting that the "overwhelming" positive response they received for the ad led to their decision to create the website The Responsibility Project.[16]
Liberty Mutual is also the sole corporate sponsor of the long-running PBS documentary series, American Experience, and has produced special commercial messages for airing during American Experience broadcasts. In 2011, as part of the company's "Real America" campaign, the company introduced two new commercials featuring Sacagawea and Paul Revere.
In 2011, the company began construction of the Liberty Mutual Tower, a 22-story skyscraper as part of its World Headquarters Expansion Project.[17] The building received its certificate of occupancy in June 2013.[18]
Organizational structure[edit]
Strategic business units[edit]
Liberty Mutual conducts all of its business through four strategic business units: US Consumer Markets, Commercial Insurance, Global Consumer Markets, and Global Specialty.[19]

US Consumer Markets[edit]
Passenger automobile, homeowners, life, annuity, and other property and casualty insurance products are available via Liberty Mutual's US Consumer Markets line. These products are branded under the Liberty Mutual Insurance and Safeco names, and are distributed via a vast network of over 2,300 sales professionals. Other distribution means are call centers, third-party producers, and the company's own website. Over 10,000 insurance agencies across the United States carry Safeco-branded products.[20]
Commercial insurance[edit]
Property and casualty, as well as group benefits commercial insurance products fall into two distinct categories: Business Insurance and National Insurance. The former caters to businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees, while the latter serves businesses in certain industries or which have greater than 1,000 employees. Group benefits products include disability insurance and group life insurance.[20]
Global Consumer Markets[edit]
Localized insurance companies sell Liberty International's products in 18 different countries and markets. International products are offered to both individual and business customers, and include property and casualty insurance, as well as health and life insurance products. The largest international product offering is passenger automobile insurance for private individuals.[20]
Global Specialty[edit]
The Global Specialty insurance line offers specialty products, such as marine, energy, aviation, professional liability, and crisis management, offered through 40 Liberty International Underwriters offices worldwide. In addition, Liberty International Underwriters provides global multi-line insurance and reinsurance written on its Lloyd's Syndicate 4472 platform. Global Specialty also includes reinsurance products offered through Liberty Mutual Reinsurance.[20]

Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety[edit]
Founded in 1954, the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety has studied the occupational safety and health of workers. Its scientific contributions include machine safeguarding guidelines, the Cornell-Liberty Survival Car, and ergonomic guidelines that have informed the basis for national and international safety standards. More recently, the Institute developed the Workplace Safety Index, which is an annual ranking of the leading causes of the most disabling occupational injuries in the United States.
The Institute's scientists conduct field and laboratory experiments to study the major causes of work-related injury and disability, publishing their results in peer-reviewed scientific literature. Institute findings are the basis for safety programs, recommendations, and software used by Liberty Mutual loss control consultants in order to help policyholders enhance worker safety. The Institute’s work is non-proprietary, and is available to the public.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27]
Controversy[edit]

In 2012 and 2013, a series of investigative articles were published in Liberty Mutual's hometown newspaper: The Boston Globe. These reports were written by Brian McGrory who later became the editor of The Boston Globe. It reported issues related to excessive compensation and questionable weekend trips using the fleet of five long-range corporate jets by its executives.[28] In the investigative reporting series, as a columnist, a number of questions related to the company were discovered; among them- (all cited):
In 2006, Liberty Mutual claims employees in the Los Angeles area desired overtime pay for work and labor accomplished related to claims work. The situation escalated, and Liberty Mutual accepted a legal question which was originally in the form of four class action lawsuits filed by its own claims representatives and employees. Some questions started in 2006 in North Carolina.[29]
Questions of this particular suit, from Liberty Mutual employees, resulted from the company's desired service to a claim, versus claim outcomes. Liberty Mutual worked on specific metrics. This case provided the company with legal precedent to claims handling and ability to process claims based on values from third party information outside of claims that repair or replace property without having to view the physical property insured. As such, Liberty Mutual closed all its locations in Los Angeles, the nation's second largest insurance market, following this action at the behest of its employees.
In late 2012, the company won an appeal granting it the ability not to pay employees for work performed on an overtime basis. Pursuit was considered an award for the insurance industry as a whole.[30] In this specific case, Liberty Mutual failed to appear. Instead, they relied on an Amicus Brief filed on behalf of the US Department of Labor.[31] The Court decided, based on the Amicus Brief, that claims personnel are exempt "Administrative Employees" and not subject to overtime pay, further supporting the mutual company's goals. In late 2012, the California Supreme Court also redacted court documents.[32]
"The benefits of political friendship" provides a newspaper published report on Liberty Mutual's political ties, including ties to Deval Patrick, the then Governor of Massachusetts. This friendship is alleged to have resulted in Liberty Mutual's receipt of tax breaks in the amount of $41M.[33]
"Perspectives Can Change at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published look at Liberty Mutual's claims process; where Liberty Mutual sued its own insured for filing a claim; and forced an award against Liberty Mutual. The article also disclosed that Liberty Mutual's legal team that represented the case usually paid less than half of the judgements.[34]
"Liberty Mutual: Your premiums, his premium office" provides a newspaper published account of CEO David H Long's desire to redecorate his 1,000sq foot office at a price of $4.5M. The article also discusses the need of the insurance company to have four corporate jets.[35]
"An Untimely Award" provides a newspaper published report of corporate governance at Liberty Mutual.[36]
"View from the top at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published report from Boston Globe editor, Brian McGrory who was invited to the recently renovated CEO suite at Liberty Mutual.[37]
"Lots more to Liberty Mutual pay story" provides a newspaper published report of a comparative analysis of other executives' pay in Boston.[38]
"At Liberty Mutual, Accounting To No One For Executive Privileges" provides a newspaper published report and review of itineraries of the fleet of corporate jets, and executive compensation which includes "Make believe stock options". By virtue of a Mutual-Company setup, its customers own stock in the company.[39]

Liberty Mutual Group, more commonly known by the name of its primary line of business, Liberty Mutual Insurance, is an American diversified global insurer, and the fourth-largest property and casualty insurer in the United States.[2] It ranks 76th on the Fortune 100 list of largest corporations in the United States based on 2013 revenue.[3] Based in Boston, Massachusetts, it employs over 50,000 people in more than 900 locations throughout the world. As of December 31, 2015, Liberty Mutual Insurance had $121.7 billion in consolidated assets, $102.5 billion in consolidated liabilities, and $37.6 billion in annual consolidated revenue.[1][4] The company, founded in 1912, offers a wide range of insurance products and services, including personal automobile, homeowners, workers' compensation, commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, general liability, global specialty, group disability, fire and surety.[5][6]

Liberty Mutual Group owns, wholly or in part, local insurance companies in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China (including Hong Kong), Colombia, Ecuador, India, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Venezuela and Vietnam.
In the United States, Liberty Mutual remains a mutual company where policyholders holding contracts for insurance are considered shareholders in the company. However, Liberty Mutual Group's brand usually operates as a separate entity outside the United States. In other countries, subsidiaries are often created in countries where legally recognized mutual company benefits cannot be enjoyed.
The current CEO is David H. Long. He succeeded his predecessor Edmund (Ted) F. Kelly on June 29, 2011.[7][8] Ted Kelly was appointed CEO in 1998.[9] In April 2013, Ted Kelly stepped down from the board of directors, as chairman.[10]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Liberty Mutual was founded in 1912 as the Massachusetts Employees Insurance Association (MEIA), following passage of a Massachusetts state law requiring employers to protect their employees with workers’ compensation insurance in 1911.[11] The first branch office was opened in 1914, and later that year, the company wrote its first automobile insurance policy. The company was founded as a Massachusetts Mutual Company, where its insureds have ownership in the company. The name was changed in 1917 to the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and, through partnerships, the company began offering full-coverage auto policies.
Structural changes[edit]
In 1964, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company began offering life insurance through its Liberty Life Assurance Branch. In 2002, the company converted into its current mutual holding company structure. The conversion was controversial, as it proposed to give policyholders an interest in the mutual insurance company, which some policyholders believed would dilute their interest in the overall company and limit their dividends.[12] A lawsuit was filed, alleging that information provided to policyholders was misleading. Liberty Mutual settled the lawsuit in December 2001, which required additional disclosure and limited certain compensation to company officers and directors.[13] Despite these concerns, the plan was approved by voting policyholders around November 2001.[14] Leveraging the greater flexibility of the mutual company structure, Liberty Mutual transformed from a single-line, highly regional insurer to one of the world's leading property and casualty insurance companies.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]
Liberty Mutual's growth has been both organic and through acquisition. Early acquisitions were small, but Liberty Mutual has made several large acquisitions over the past decade, including the high-profile acquisition of Safeco Corporation in 2008. Liberty Mutual agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of Safeco for $68.25 per share, for a total transaction price of approximately $6.2 billion. The result of this activity was an increase in revenue from $6 billion to over $30 billion in twelve years. In 1999, the company purchased Wausau Insurance Cos.[15]
Liberty Mutual created a television commercial in 2006 about people doing good things for strangers, reporting that the "overwhelming" positive response they received for the ad led to their decision to create the website The Responsibility Project.[16]
Liberty Mutual is also the sole corporate sponsor of the long-running PBS documentary series, American Experience, and has produced special commercial messages for airing during American Experience broadcasts. In 2011, as part of the company's "Real America" campaign, the company introduced two new commercials featuring Sacagawea and Paul Revere.
In 2011, the company began construction of the Liberty Mutual Tower, a 22-story skyscraper as part of its World Headquarters Expansion Project.[17] The building received its certificate of occupancy in June 2013.[18]
Organizational structure[edit]
Strategic business units[edit]
Liberty Mutual conducts all of its business through four strategic business units: US Consumer Markets, Commercial Insurance, Global Consumer Markets, and Global Specialty.[19]

US Consumer Markets[edit]
Passenger automobile, homeowners, life, annuity, and other property and casualty insurance products are available via Liberty Mutual's US Consumer Markets line. These products are branded under the Liberty Mutual Insurance and Safeco names, and are distributed via a vast network of over 2,300 sales professionals. Other distribution means are call centers, third-party producers, and the company's own website. Over 10,000 insurance agencies across the United States carry Safeco-branded products.[20]
Commercial insurance[edit]
Property and casualty, as well as group benefits commercial insurance products fall into two distinct categories: Business Insurance and National Insurance. The former caters to businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees, while the latter serves businesses in certain industries or which have greater than 1,000 employees. Group benefits products include disability insurance and group life insurance.[20]
Global Consumer Markets[edit]
Localized insurance companies sell Liberty International's products in 18 different countries and markets. International products are offered to both individual and business customers, and include property and casualty insurance, as well as health and life insurance products. The largest international product offering is passenger automobile insurance for private individuals.[20]
Global Specialty[edit]
The Global Specialty insurance line offers specialty products, such as marine, energy, aviation, professional liability, and crisis management, offered through 40 Liberty International Underwriters offices worldwide. In addition, Liberty International Underwriters provides global multi-line insurance and reinsurance written on its Lloyd's Syndicate 4472 platform. Global Specialty also includes reinsurance products offered through Liberty Mutual Reinsurance.[20]

Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety[edit]
Founded in 1954, the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety has studied the occupational safety and health of workers. Its scientific contributions include machine safeguarding guidelines, the Cornell-Liberty Survival Car, and ergonomic guidelines that have informed the basis for national and international safety standards. More recently, the Institute developed the Workplace Safety Index, which is an annual ranking of the leading causes of the most disabling occupational injuries in the United States.
The Institute's scientists conduct field and laboratory experiments to study the major causes of work-related injury and disability, publishing their results in peer-reviewed scientific literature. Institute findings are the basis for safety programs, recommendations, and software used by Liberty Mutual loss control consultants in order to help policyholders enhance worker safety. The Institute’s work is non-proprietary, and is available to the public.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27]
Controversy[edit]





This article may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards. The specific problem is: this section is disorganized and poorly written Please help improve this article if you can. (December 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


In 2012 and 2013, a series of investigative articles were published in Liberty Mutual's hometown newspaper: The Boston Globe. These reports were written by Brian McGrory who later became the editor of The Boston Globe. It reported issues related to excessive compensation and questionable weekend trips using the fleet of five long-range corporate jets by its executives.[28] In the investigative reporting series, as a columnist, a number of questions related to the company were discovered; among them- (all cited):
In 2006, Liberty Mutual claims employees in the Los Angeles area desired overtime pay for work and labor accomplished related to claims work. The situation escalated, and Liberty Mutual accepted a legal question which was originally in the form of four class action lawsuits filed by its own claims representatives and employees. Some questions started in 2006 in North Carolina.[29]
Questions of this particular suit, from Liberty Mutual employees, resulted from the company's desired service to a claim, versus claim outcomes. Liberty Mutual worked on specific metrics. This case provided the company with legal precedent to claims handling and ability to process claims based on values from third party information outside of claims that repair or replace property without having to view the physical property insured. As such, Liberty Mutual closed all its locations in Los Angeles, the nation's second largest insurance market, following this action at the behest of its employees.
In late 2012, the company won an appeal granting it the ability not to pay employees for work performed on an overtime basis. Pursuit was considered an award for the insurance industry as a whole.[30] In this specific case, Liberty Mutual failed to appear. Instead, they relied on an Amicus Brief filed on behalf of the US Department of Labor.[31] The Court decided, based on the Amicus Brief, that claims personnel are exempt "Administrative Employees" and not subject to overtime pay, further supporting the mutual company's goals. In late 2012, the California Supreme Court also redacted court documents.[32]
"The benefits of political friendship" provides a newspaper published report on Liberty Mutual's political ties, including ties to Deval Patrick, the then Governor of Massachusetts. This friendship is alleged to have resulted in Liberty Mutual's receipt of tax breaks in the amount of $41M.[33]
"Perspectives Can Change at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published look at Liberty Mutual's claims process; where Liberty Mutual sued its own insured for filing a claim; and forced an award against Liberty Mutual. The article also disclosed that Liberty Mutual's legal team that represented the case usually paid less than half of the judgements.[34]
"Liberty Mutual: Your premiums, his premium office" provides a newspaper published account of CEO David H Long's desire to redecorate his 1,000sq foot office at a price of $4.5M. The article also discusses the need of the insurance company to have four corporate jets.[35]
"An Untimely Award" provides a newspaper published report of corporate governance at Liberty Mutual.[36]
"View from the top at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published report from Boston Globe editor, Brian McGrory who was invited to the recently renovated CEO suite at Liberty Mutual.[37]
"Lots more to Liberty Mutual pay story" provides a newspaper published report of a comparative analysis of other executives' pay in Boston.[38]
"At Liberty Mutual, Accounting To No One For Executive Privileges" provides a newspaper published report and review of itineraries of the fleet of corporate jets, and executive compensation which includes "Make believe stock options". By virtue of a Mutual-Company setup, its customers own stock in the company.[39]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
