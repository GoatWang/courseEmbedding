What is the financial pay off for a novelist like Stephen King to include blatant product placements in the storyline? - QuoraThis page may be out of date.

Hide this message.QuoraSign In Agents Product Placement Stephen King (author) Fiction Writers and Authors Literature Question That Contains Assumptions BooksWhat is the financial pay off for a novelist like Stephen King to include blatant product placements in the storyline?Not to pick on SK specifically but he seems to use a lot of brand names in his books, including The Dome, which is not worth the read.  He's not alone. How is the quid pro quo set up? Does he write [insert sports car brand here] and then let the agents deal with it? I see it in the movies. Is it as prevalent a financing vehicle and promo platform in fiction?UpdateCancelAnswer Wiki2 Answers  Bob LeDrew, I'm the host of "The Kingcast", a podcast about Stephen King. I have studied ma.Answered 338w agoI am reasonably sure that King receives no compensation for a product mention in his fiction (movies would be something else, as those discussions would be done by the producers but not the author.) King's assistant has told me that he has never received compensation for this (however, he has received unsolicited samples of some products). King has always used the names of real-life products in his works. His argument has been that it adds an air of versimilitude to the fiction; critics have pointed at the practice as evidence of his low-brow-itude.779 Views · 1 UpvoteRelated QuestionsMore Answers BelowHow much did Sunseeker pay for product placement in the James Bond movies?What are blatant examples product placement in films?How much does Coke pay to have a 2-second product placement in a movie?Are there any examples of product placement in songs?What is Stephen King known for?

5.0 out of 5 starsA grisly, dark compilation. A must have for Horror lovers.ByJC Brennanon June 11, 2017The Sickness is a compilation of six short stories including The Sickness, The Clarion Call, What The Blind Eye Sees, Phantom Scry, Temptress, and The Deadly Lion, that are well worth the read.  My favorites of the six I would have to say, though a difficult decision, are The Clarion Call, which bought a tear to my eye, and The Deadly Lion.  Although these two are my favorite the passage I love most comes from Phantom Scry:  “‘It’s alright now,’ she whispered into his ear. ‘You took my life, and now I have taken yours. Everything is going to be okay now…’”I can’t tell anymore for it will give the story away and I honestly hate when that happens.All six stories are fabulous written though the first story one must have the stomach to read. The story is on a topic in which is considered taboo and frowned upon by the majority of society. However, writing a good story does take us in a direction we may not have normally ventured. This author has done just that in a very crafted, skilled way. Some of these stories are of a grislier nature, but all are brilliantly structured.My only suggestion to this author is to find a way to separate yourself from the famed writer, Stephen King. Your writing is of an accomplished nature and excellent quality. You should find a light of your own, without misidentification that placing you in the shadow of another author.

3.0 out of 5 starsThis book was not written by Stephen King, but another writer using the name Stephen R. KingByMonteon February 26, 2017Please be aware, this author was NOT Stephen King, but another author named Stephen R. King. I feel that while I enjoyed some of the stories in this anthology of short stories, they definitely fell short of what Stephen King would have written. I will be more careful in the future, I do not intend to buy anymore books by this author and I think Amazon cold make it a little clearer, in the future, that there are two authors, with similar names, both writing in similar styles.
