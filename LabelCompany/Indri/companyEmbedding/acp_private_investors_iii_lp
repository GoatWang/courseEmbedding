What You Should Know




Can I get an investment property funded using NONE of my own money?

                    Yes and no. It does not have to be your personal funds, however someone will typically have
                    to put money down toward the purchase of an investment property before a lender will seriously
                    consider your loan request. Lenders want you to have "some skin in the game."
                    As a rule of thumb make sure you have 5% or more available - the more the better.
                    If you are refinancing, money down is not always necessary provided you have sufficient equity in
                    the property.
                

What exactly does CiX do?

                    CiX takes the stress out of buying and refinancing investment properties by allowing consumers to
                    get multiple
                    offers from several hard and private money, asset-based lenders in a matter of minutes.
                

We make the funding process so easy, why would you need to look elsewhere?

                    It's free and only takes about 37 seconds to request the funding you need. Your request for funding
                    will be sent
                    to our lending partners who are ready, willing and able to lend on your property. We have the most;
                    diverse,
                    active, and professional pool of lenders on the planet, so if you can't get funding here, it's very
                    likely you
                    can't get funding anywhere.
                

The stress is finally gone

                    Before CiX existed, when you needed funding for a real estate investment you only really had one
                    option… Hope.
                    You had to present your deal to the one or two lenders you could find and hope they would come
                    through.
                    This is not only stressful but very time consuming. Many real estate investors spend more time
                    looking for money
                    than looking for deals. Not anymore. With CiX you can secure the funding you need with the click of
                    a few buttons.
                

Money is now looking for you

                    Lenders have raised billions to deploy into the market and need borrowers like you to lend to. It is
                    simple supply
                    and demand. Money is now looking for you! This means you have more options, can get better rates and
                    terms, and
                    ultimately keep more of the money you make.
                

All the best real estate investment lenders are here

                    We've consolidated the nations best hardmoney + private real estate investment lenders into a
                    funding database under one virtual roof. To gain access to this elite network and a virtually
                    unlimited amount of funding for residential and commercial lending, all you have to do is request
                    the type of funding you’re looking for. The best part is, this tool is 100% free!
                

Lenders will compete to fund your investment property

                    Your request for funding is sent to a network of qualified lenders. Our software analyzes their bids
                    and matches
                    you with the lenders who are willing to meet your unique needs at the lowest rate! For the first
                    time in history,
                    the real estate investment lending industry has been consolidated and is now fully available to you
                    with the click
                    of a few buttons!
                

You can receive loans based off the deal not your credit

                    Our network of lenders provides funding based on the numbers in the deal -- not your credit. Good
                    credit does not
                    hurt, but is not required. Since loans are based on the property, personal info such as bank
                    statements, tax returns,
                    social security number are not required to get matched with the right lender(s)!
                

You sure are lucky you found us

                    No more middlemen raising prices
                    No more missing deals because you can’t get funding
                    No more wasting time looking for lenders
                    No more overpaying for money
                

All of your funding problems are solved here!

                    You can finally get funding for your real estate investments without all the brain damage. Find the
                    cash you need to

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

About ACP  




Who We Are
Austin Capital Corporation ("Austin Capital" or "ACC") is a private investment management company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio that creates value through investments in lower middle market companies, principally in the Midwest, on behalf of a network of private investors.   
Austin Capital manages a range of affiliated investments and managed Austin Capital Partners, L.P. (or "ACP"), a private equity fund headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. The fund was formed in 2002 by its principals: Darrell W. Austin, William E. Conway and Charles R. Emrick, Jr.  Samuel S. Hartwell joined the Firm in 2007. Prior to forming Austin Capital and ACP, our principals and investors invested informally together in multiple transactions over the years. We are an experienced and cohesive team.  
Darrell Austin and Samuel Hartwell, as Austin Capital Corporation ("ACC"), are the active managers.  
While our investment criteria are flexible and opportunistic, our primary market focus is on smaller private companies that are transitioning ownership to achieve liquidity, diversify risk, or obtain needed growth capital.
Our investors include a number of highly successful operating executives who can lend their operating expertise to our portfolio companies as appropriate.
Our Philosophy
Austin Capital seeks to obtain superior long-term returns on invested capital. Over the years, we have found that we can achieve this goal by following some fundamental principles:

Structuring creative but prudent capital structures that enable us to simultaneously satisfy the goals of a business owner while minimizing financial risk;
Supporting proven management teams that are our equity partners, and whose long term interests are aligned with ours;
Building a portfolio of companies which share an established history of profitability and a range of products or services that have a sustainable competitive advantage;
Appropriately leveraging the experience and skills of our team of investors�experienced executives themselves.
Austin Capital's Role With Portfolio Companies
Our operating partners�the senior manager or managers in our portfolio companies�retain direct responsibility for managing their portfolio company, developing its strategic business plan, and executing that plan.
Our team brings experience and expertise in the area of operations, corporate finance, corporate development, and strategic growth. Post-transaction, our role will be visible through active board participation, support of corporate finance initiatives, coaching, or project work if appropriate.
The Board of Directors of a typical portfolio company will include one or more of ACC's principals and one or more of our Advisory Board members, each of whom will be an active and valued member of the team.

What is Unique About Austin Capital
In conversations with professionals, management teams, and business
owners, a number of themes recur about the uniqueness of our team and
our approach to private equity:

We are one of the few private equity funds in Northeast Ohio focused on transactions valued under $20 million.
We will bring significant operating expertise to our portfolio
company investments through the active board- level involvement of one
or more of our Advisory Board members.
We will back proven management teams, but we can replace senior management with proven operating executives if desired.
We can structure opportunities creatively to allow selling shareholders to remain active in the business and continue to participate as owners.

Kennet invests in Telemedicine Clinic
 
Kennet Partners leads €7m financing of European teleradiology market leader
Kennet Partners, a leading international growth equity investor focused on the technology sector, is pleased to announce the first investment from its new fund, Kennet III L.P. Kennet has led a €7m financing of European Telemedicine Clinic ('TMC'), the European market leader in the provision of sub-specialized teleradiology services to public and private healthcare providers.
Teleradiology involves the transmission of digitised diagnostic images - such as x-rays, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans and CT/PET scans - to a remote location for interpretation by certified radiologists. In recent years, demand for advanced diagnostic scans has increased significantly, leading to long waiting times for patients and highlighting a shortage of specialized radiologists in many countries.
As a result, hospitals are looking to teleradiology to provide access to sub-specialty diagnostic services, and to achieve their objective of reducing patient waiting times. TMC was one of the first European providers of teleradiology services and is currently the leader in the UK and Europe.
According to Frost & Sullivan, some 91 million digital radiography exams took place in Europe in 2006, a figure that is expected to grow to 198 million by 2010, with most of the increase coming from the so-called complex modalities - MRI and CT/PET. It is estimated that in the most advanced European markets for teleradiology - the UK, Spain and Scandinavia - less than 4% of these exams are currently being interpreted remotely. Evidence from more mature markets, such as the US, indicates that up to 20% of diagnostic exams will eventually be reported remotely.
TMC was founded in 2001 by David Backstom and Henrik Agrell in Barcelona, Spain. Today, more than 80 experienced radiologists work for TMC. From the company's centralized reading facility in Barcelona, a large base of UK radiologists serve the UK market. The company also provides European hospitals with on-call ('nighthawking') services from Sydney, Australia. TMC pioneered the establishment of new quality and control processes for remote reading centers, and as a result the company is considered a quality leader in this market.
“What impressed us about TMC's management was the speed with which they established the company as both the quality and volume leader in the market. TMC is setting the standard for sub-specialty radiology services in Europe today. We are delighted to support the TMC team as they cement their position in the global market for telemedicine services,” said Maximilian Bleyleben of Kennet Partners.
“The timing of Kennet's investment could not be better for TMC. With Kennet on board, TMC will further accelerate its growth and presence in the UK and other geographic markets and to develop new service offerings.

What You Should Know




Can I get an investment property funded using NONE of my own money?

                    Yes and no. It does not have to be your personal funds, however someone will typically have
                    to put money down toward the purchase of an investment property before a lender will seriously
                    consider your loan request. Lenders want you to have "some skin in the game."
                    As a rule of thumb make sure you have 5% or more available - the more the better.
                    If you are refinancing, money down is not always necessary provided you have sufficient equity in
                    the property.
                

What exactly does CiX do?

                    CiX takes the stress out of buying and refinancing investment properties by allowing consumers to
                    get multiple
                    offers from several hard and private money, asset-based lenders in a matter of minutes.
                

We make the funding process so easy, why would you need to look elsewhere?

                    It's free and only takes about 37 seconds to request the funding you need. Your request for funding
                    will be sent
                    to our lending partners who are ready, willing and able to lend on your property. We have the most;
                    diverse,
                    active, and professional pool of lenders on the planet, so if you can't get funding here, it's very
                    likely you
                    can't get funding anywhere.
                

The stress is finally gone

                    Before CiX existed, when you needed funding for a real estate investment you only really had one
                    option… Hope.
                    You had to present your deal to the one or two lenders you could find and hope they would come
                    through.
                    This is not only stressful but very time consuming. Many real estate investors spend more time
                    looking for money
                    than looking for deals. Not anymore. With CiX you can secure the funding you need with the click of
                    a few buttons.
                

Money is now looking for you

                    Lenders have raised billions to deploy into the market and need borrowers like you to lend to. It is
                    simple supply
                    and demand. Money is now looking for you! This means you have more options, can get better rates and
                    terms, and
                    ultimately keep more of the money you make.
                

All the best real estate investment lenders are here

                    We've consolidated the nations best hardmoney + private real estate investment lenders into a
                    funding database under one virtual roof. To gain access to this elite network and a virtually
                    unlimited amount of funding for residential and commercial lending, all you have to do is request
                    the type of funding you’re looking for. The best part is, this tool is 100% free!
                

Lenders will compete to fund your investment property

                    Your request for funding is sent to a network of qualified lenders. Our software analyzes their bids
                    and matches
                    you with the lenders who are willing to meet your unique needs at the lowest rate! For the first
                    time in history,
                    the real estate investment lending industry has been consolidated and is now fully available to you
                    with the click
                    of a few buttons!
                

You can receive loans based off the deal not your credit

                    Our network of lenders provides funding based on the numbers in the deal -- not your credit. Good
                    credit does not
                    hurt, but is not required. Since loans are based on the property, personal info such as bank
                    statements, tax returns,
                    social security number are not required to get matched with the right lender(s)!
                

You sure are lucky you found us

                    No more middlemen raising prices
                    No more missing deals because you can’t get funding
