Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Bunge lays out case for independence in restructuring
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    4:36 PM ET 07/20/2017
                                                


Global grain trader Bunge Ltd.'s (BG) cost cutting and restructuring plans could buy it time in the face of a takeover bid from a larger rival as it struggles to stay independent during a slump in the commodities market, analysts said. The moves seek to reduce overhead costs by $250 million by the end of 2019.

















                                                    Bunge overhaul is latest shake-up for struggling grain sector
                                                


                                                    Reuters –

         The undersigned, ENRIQUE H. BOILINI (the "Undersigned"), does

hereby nominate, constitute and appoint Carla L. Heiss, John Tropeano and Thomas

revocation and to act singly hereunder, in the discretion of such

Attorney-in-Fact, in the name of and on behalf of the Undersigned as fully as

the Undersigned could if the Undersigned were present and acting in person, to

perform any and all acts that may be necessary or desirable to complete, make

and execute any and all required or voluntary filings (the "Filings") under

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange

Act"), and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder, with the Securities

and Exchange Commission, the New York Stock Exchange, Bunge Limited (the

under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act as a result of the Undersigned's

position as an officer and/or director of the Company or the Undersigned's

"Beneficial Ownership" (within the meaning of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act)

said Attorney-in-Fact shall do or cause to be done by virtue of this Power of

Attorney. The Undersigned hereby acknowledges that the Attorney-in-Fact, in

ten percent of any class of equity securities of the Company and for such time

thereafter as may be necessary to make any such filings, unless earlier revoked

or modified by the Undersigned in writing. The Undersigned hereby revokes all

prior powers of attorney relating to the foregoing acts.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Undersigned has hereunto signed this Power of

Attorney this 25 day of May, 2006.
