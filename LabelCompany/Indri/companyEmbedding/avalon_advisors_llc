You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Avalon Advisors







Industry: Asset Management
Investment Date: March 2008
Headquarters: Houston, TX
Website: www.avalonadvisors.com



 Investment Overview:
Avalon Advisors (“Avalon”) is a Houston-based asset management firm that manages equity, fixed income and balanced portfolios for wealthy families, endowments, foundations and trusts.  The company provides a high level of customer service and customized solutions for clients in a cost effective and tax efficient manner.  Avalon was founded in April 2001 and is led by its founding partners, Robert Gauntt, Henry Latrigue, Willie Langston, and Kevin Lilly.  Avalon has grown into one of the largest independent asset management firms in Texas with approximately $6.1 billion in assets under management.  In 2011, The Carlyle Group made a significant minority investment in Avalon.  The Carlyle transaction allowed an attractive return on our original investment, while continuing as a minority shareholder.  Carlyle later sold their interest to the Cynosure Group, a Salt Lake City, Utah-based investment firm, and a group of large family offices that now collectively own Avalon with Platform and Avalon's founders and employees.
 
 Transaction Background:
The Platform team had a relationship with Avalon since its inception in 2001. In late 2007, we approached Avalon’s founders and quickly agreed that a partnership could be mutually beneficial. We closed our investment in early 2008, providing partial liquidity to Avalon’s founders and an opportunity to extend ownership to other Avalon employees. Platform’s role in the partnership is to provide guidance on the strategy and necessary infrastructure to continue to grow the company.

Carlyle Global Financial Services Partners 



Acquired
Sep 2011



Status
Exited







Carlyle professionals partnered with Avalon Advisors, LLC to expand its product offering and distribution. Avalon, an unlevered growth investment by the Financial Services team, offered several opportunities for value creation.




About Avalon Advisors and the Transaction
Carlyle invested in Avalon in September 2011 through Carlyle Global Financial Services Partners.
Avalon, founded in 2001, is a fee-based wealth advisor and asset manager based in Houston, Texas with an additional office in San Antonio, Texas. Texas has one of the largest ultra-high net worth populations in the United States with Houston having the largest ultra-high net worth population in Texas.
While the clients are primarily Texas domiciled high-net worth individuals and families, Avalon does have clients across the country and a growing institutional base. Avalon acts as both a wealth advisor and an investor. Avalon advises clients on their total portfolio and manages a series of core portfolios that act as a proprietary investment vehicle for a portion of the client’s wealth. 
Avalon’s four founding partners include three wealth advisors who had worked together for more than 20 years and managed the Texas private client business for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley along with a lead investment professional who had been CIO of Chase Asset Management. 
Key Value Creation Metrics
Expanded products to include a broad range of equity and fixed income offerings along with several third-party alternative investment products (including two with Carlyle)
Launched multiple new internally managed strategies both in fixed income and equities
Expanded alternative product offering through joint ventures with several alternative asset managers including Carlyle
Acquired Houston Global Investors, enhancing international equity capabilities

Expanded distribution through office expansion into San Antonio, new institutional distribution / sales channels and new strategic relationships in the Intermountain West region
Enhanced operations through the reallocation of reporting lines, including the implementation of an operating committee, the hiring of several new executives, and the launching of a broker-dealer to better position Avalon with alternative partners
Partnering with Management for Next Stage of Growth
During Carlyle’s investment, in partnership with management, Avalon significantly expanded its product set in response to client demand to include a broad range of proprietary domestic and international equity and fixed income offerings along with several alternative investment products. The product offering expansion, coupled with strong investment performance, led to meaningful growth in assets under management. During Carlyle’s investment, assets under management grew from less than $4 billion to approximately $6 billion, representing an increase of more than 65%.
Executing Successful Sale to Strategic Investors
In a two-stage process, on September 14, 2015, Carlyle closed the sale of 50% of its interest in Avalon to The Cynosure Group, a Salt Lake City-based investment company formed to bring together the resources of a number of family offices. December 16, 2016, Carlyle sold its remaining stake in Avalon to several Houston-based families.















How Carlyle Creates Value
Deep industry expertise. Global scale and presence. Extensive network of Operating Executives. And a wealth of investment portfolio data; we call it The Carlyle Edge. These are the four pillars of Carlyle’s value creation model. By leveraging these core capabilities and resources—Carlyle has established a 29-year overall track record of investing in companies, working to make them better and serving our investors' needs.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
