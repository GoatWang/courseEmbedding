Cornerstone Strategic Value Fund, Inc.


                  Cornerstone Strategic Value Fund, Inc. is a closed-end investment company. Its investment objective is to seek long-term capital appreciation through investment primarily in equity securities of U.S. and non-U.S. companies.

Vice President

                                    Prior                


Doliver Capital Advisors LP


                  Doliver Capital Advisors employs the following three investment strategies: core, market neutral and enhanced trading.For their core strategy, the firm purchases underpriced closed-end funds (CEFs) that participate in long-term market returns. This strategy continues to be both non-leveraged and subject to normal market fluctuations. Turnover is moderate and does not focus on short-term gains. This strategy is most suitable for self-directed retirement programs (i.e. IRAs), pension plans and generally those who wish to profit from the long-term, upward direction of the market.Doliver's market neutral strategy, like their core strategy, purchases underpriced CEFs and does not use leverage. Turnover is moderate and does not focus on the short term gains. In addition, Doliver sells short S&P futures in each customers account to reduce the risk of the portfolio to overall market fluctuations or declines. This program is most suitable for customers whose primary investment objective is capital preservation, with a secondary objective and emphasis on long term capital appreciation.For their enhanced trading strategy, Doliver purchases underpriced CEFs and may also sell short overpriced CEFs. ETFs and index futures may be employed, along with leverage and hedging, in an attempt to take advantage of shorter term market movements and to maximize return. This strategy is only suitable for clients who seek higher returns through capital appreciation and are willing to accept higher risk.

Research Interests

My overall research interests are related to the structure/function relationships of proteins. For many years, these have focused on two areas: eukaryotic signal transduction and co/post-translational processing of protein N-termini.  We are presently using proteomic/bioinformatic approaches to study both areas primarily through the use of mass spectrometry. 


An important segment of cell signaling is dependent on polypeptide growth factors and their receptors. Our recent studies have focused primarily on the TrkA receptor and the downstream phosphorylations that it induces. Utilizing stably transfected chimeric receptors with the ectodomain of the PDGF receptor and the transmembrane and endodomain of the TrkA receptor to define signaling responses, we have quantitatively determined the shifts (both positive and negative) in the phosphoproteome induced after 20 min of stimulation in PC12 cells. These modifications primarily involve serine and threonine residues (tyrosine modifications generally occur at much shorter time points of stimulation). By comparison to other analyses with the EGF receptor in human cells at the same time interval following activation, there was a dramatic similarity in response as judged by the responses of various kinase classes (determined by substrate motifs).  We have also used the same paradigm to study the effects of mutating known tyrosine docking sites (Y490 and Y785) on this profile. These analyses revealed that there are additional signaling regions/docking sites on the TrkA endodomain that are not subject to activation by the phosphoryaltion of Y490 or Y785.  We are now expanding these studies to determine the profile of Lys-ε-acetylation and O-GlcNAc modification of serine and threonine residues as an overlay study to the phosphoproteomic analysis. The techniques utilized in these studies will also be useful in other applications such as determining the basis of drug resistance in cancer and in the differentiation of stem cells. In addition, in collaboration with the Shokat Laboratory, we have also been addressing the immediate substrates of the TrkA kinase domain utilizing mutants that can utilize special ATP derivatives and bearing the same signaling alterations. 


The earliest modifications of proteins following the initiation of protein synthesis are N-terminal modifications that can be divided into three main groups: those that modify the α-amino group, those that modify the side chain of the N-terminal residue and those that involve proteolysis of one or more amino acids. There are more than three dozen such alterations, some of which are quite common and are essentially ubiquitous, and others that are quite rare. Similarly, some occur as co-translational events while others take place only later in the lifetime of the protein, after it is fully synthesized. We have focused on the removal of initiator methionine residues and the acetylation of the Nα-amino group (with or without the methionine). Defects in these modifications have been increasingly tied to various pathologies and form the basis for further investigations.

   Ralph Bradshaw | CORNERSTONE STRATEGIC VALUE FUND INC | ZoomInfo.comBoulder Growth & Income Reckoning with Questionable Shareholders - Boulder Growth & Income Fund, Inc. (NYSE:BIF) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Boulder Growth & Income Reckoning with Questionable ShareholdersNov.19.08 | About: Boulder Growth (BIF) James LaDue The Boulder Growth & Income Fund (NYSE:BIF) recently received two unsolicited shareholder proposals to elect alternative directors to the Fund's Board of Directors, terminate its investment co-advisory contracts and continue an "aggressive" level-rate distribution policy. Ralph W. Bradshaw and Ronald G. Olin, the aforementioned shareholders, suspiciously have a history of simultaneously submitting such requests, an issue Boulder plans to bring to the attention of the SEC.
These similar proposals submitted by Ralph W. Bradshaw and Ronald G. Olin to other closed-end funds were conducted in concert with the affiliated Doliver Capital Adviser institutional manager, whose hold currently stands at approximately 17% of the Fund's shares. This association Boulder also finds questionable considering the affiliated group has neglected to meet federal securities laws in filing their status as such.
Moreover, the group proposed the termination of the investment co-advisory contract between the Fund and Boulder Investment Advisers and Stewart Investment Advisers (the "Boulder Advisers"). With this, it is anticipated the group would have proposed Cornerstone Advisors as the replacement adviser based on past behavior. To this, Fund president Steve Miller commented:
It's hard to imagine that someone with Cornerstone's track record would have the audacity to suggest that the Boulder Advisers with their track record be replaced. Maybe they should take care of the cooking in their own kitchen before they recommend a new chef in ours.
Reiterating his position, Miller disclosed:
…. the trailing one-year period ending 10/31/08 CRF's total return on NAV was -40.35% and CLM's was -38.5%. This compares to BIF's return on NAV for the same period of -17.3%. CRF's market price has suffered even more, falling from a lofty 105% premium in July 2008 to about a 10% premium as of last Friday. And CLM was at a 64% premium in May 2008 and as of Friday was at a discount of -1.2%.
As far as the group’s proposal for an "aggressive level-rate distribution policy," the Board perceived this as overlooking the many factors not taken into consideration. These factors include implementing and maintaining a level-rate distribution policy, Including the Fund's previously stated goal of tying its distribution rate to its long-term performance, compliance with certain federal securities laws on maintaining the level-rate distribution policy, the impact of an aggressive policy on the Fund's leverage coverage ratio, the policy's current and long-term efficacy in narrowing the Fund's discount from net asset value, the tax consequences of level-rate distributions and the long-term investment interests of all of the Fund's shareholders.

Miller continued:

The Fund intends to pursue very aggressively its claims that this group and their investors are acting in violation of federal securities laws, including referring this matter to the SEC. We are concerned that, given their past tactics and their poor stewardship of the Cornerstone Funds, their proposals would destroy value and not serve the long-term interests of our shareholders. Any proposal such as theirs to destroy the long-term value of one of the better-performing closed-end equity funds must be viewed with great skepticism.
We believe that the shareholder group led by Messrs. Olin and Bradshaw, including Doliver, is known in the closed-end fund industry as a group who acts in concert to gain control over closed-end funds with little regard for federal securities laws. This group tries to take action with respect to its own interests to profit at the expense of the interests of long-term shareholders. This group may posture itself to be an advocate for shareholder rights, but we believe that it acts only for its investors' personal profit, irrespective of whether their proposed actions are detrimental to long-term shareholders who have invested in the Fund. They have targeted the wrong Fund.

Additionally, Boulder plans to refer the group’s excess holdings to the SEC for review and other independent remedies against the group for possible violations of federal securities laws. The Fund is a closed-end management investment company co-managed by Stewart Investment Advisers and Boulder Investment Advisers, LLC.
