About Ear Piercing


Everything You Need to Know

Claire’s has pierced more than 94 Million ears worldwide - that’s more piercings than anyone on the planet!
Ear Piercing is FREE every day at Claire’s with the purchase of a Starter Kit. This includes your choice of piercing earrings, Claire’s Ear Care Solution and special offer for your next visit.



All About The Piercing Earring

At Claire’s, ears are our specialty! Our piercing equipment and Piercing Earrings are designed to only pierce Ear Lobes and Outer Ear Cartilage (select locations only).
Every piercing earring we carry meets or exceeds US FDA and EC European Standards & Regulations – which are the highest standards & regulations world-wide.
Our Piercing Earrings are especially designed with ultra-fine points and thin posts to pierce gently and promote quick healing. They are also individually packaged in a disposable, sterilized single-use cartridge.
We offer the best selection of Piercing Earrings in tons of styles and at a price for any budget. Our 14kt Yellow Gold and White Gold styles are genuine gold and we offer Medical Grade Stainless Steel, Titanium and 24kt Gold Plated Stainless Steel.
To become an Ear Piercing Specialist our associates complete an intensive Ear Piercing Training & Certification Program. During the training, our associates learn everything they need to know to ensure safe piercing practices as well as comply with any government guidelines.



Every Ear is Different

Like a fingerprint, your ear shape is unique too! Your Ear Piercing Specialist will examine your ear before piercing. For some Ears a longer post maybe necessary to ensure the most successful healing period and the Ear Piercing Specialist may recommend the use of a “Long Post” earring.
During this process, the Ear Piercing Specialist will also check for any scar tissue, keloids or cysts that could prevent a successful piercing and healing period. If a keloid or cyst is found, the Ear Piercing Specialist may not be able to successfully complete your piercing during your visit.



The Piercing

Once you have picked the perfect earring for your new piercing and filled out the appropriate form we can get started with your new piercing!
Your Ear Piercing Specialist will wear single-use latex-free gloves and makes certain all of our equipment is cleaned and sanitized before and after each use.
After the Ear Piercing Specialist has examined your ears, they will clean and mark your ear lobe with a surgical marking pen for placement and give you a chance to check it out. Once you agree that it’s at the perfect spot the piercing itself begins.
We’ll also coach you on the method for cleaning and caring for your new piercing using Claire’s Ear Care Solution - which is crucial to a successful outcome with your new Claire’s Piercing.





More Information


Perfectly Cared For

For detailed ear care instructions, please check out Claire's Aftercare Video
Our Starter Kit includes your Piercing Earrings and a bottle of Claire’s Ear Care Solution. Claire’s Ear Care Solution is specially formulated so it won’t sting or burn newly pierced ears.
Most of the problems that can arise post-piercing are a result from poor care of a new piercing. Make sure to ALWAYS follow these simple guidelines:

Always wash your hands with anti-bacterial soap before touching your ears or earrings. Avoid touching your new piercing except during cleaning.
Clean the front and back of your piercing 3 times a day by applying a generous amount of Claire’s Ear Care Solution with a cotton ball or cotton swab.
Check the clutch back position and make sure the earring clutch is pushed back into the safety notch on the post. The tip of the post should be covered and the clutch should never be pushed flush against the ear.
Gently slide the Ear Piercing Earring back and forth, and then rotate the earring a few turns forward and backward. This allows for the Ear Care Solution to work its way into the piercing.
Protect your new piercing from soap, cosmetics, perfume and hair products. Be extra careful brushing your hair, exercising, talking on the phone, swimming, sleeping or wearing headphones.

Ear Lobe Piercings - Leave your piercing earrings in for 6 weeks before you remove them or insert any other earring. Post earrings must be worn at all times for 6 months to make sure your piercing stays the perfect size.
Outer Ear Cartilage – Piercing must be left in for 8-12 weeks before removal and post style earrings must be worn for 12 months after that. Cartilage piercing is not available at all locations; please ask an Associate for details.
Note: Pain, redness or swelling that last longer than 24 hours after piercings is NOT normal. If redness or swelling occurs, consult your physician.



Every Ear has a Story

We chatted with Kennedi, age 10, and asked her about her experience getting her ears pierced at Claire's.
So, Kennedi, how long have you been pierced?
A little over a month.
And where did you get your ears pierced at?
 
	At the Claire's in the St. Louis Galleria Mall. My Dad, sister, Aunt and two cousins were all with me.

	 
What style did you choose?
I chose the aquamarine stone because I liked the color but I also really liked the crystal daisies and the yellow one (topaz).
Can you describe your experience - what happened first?
I went in and told the lady at the counter I wanted my ears pieced. She brought me over to sit in the chair and took time to explain everything to me so that I didn’t have any questions. Then I got to pick out my pair.
What was the person who pierced you like?
She was nice and explained everything to me really well.
Did it hurt?
No it was just a pinch and very fast.
How is cleaning your earrings going?
She smiles and sheepishly admits, “ Sometimes I forget but I now am trying really hard to do it once a day.”



Almost All Ages

At Claire’s we specialize in ears of all ages. Infants will need to have a DPT, which typically takes place at 8 weeks old. Minors will need a parent or legal guardian present to sign the Claire’s Ear Piercing Registry and to show a government issued ID before getting started.
We want your child to have a wonderful piercing experience. If your child appears distressed, we may be unable to complete a successful piercing. At that time, our Ear Piercing Specialist will recommend waiting until a time your child is able to comfortably continue the piercing procedure.
You may also want to have both ears pierced at the same time by two Ear Piercing Specialists. Please contact your local store to determine the perfect time for this service to take place.



Come Into Claire's

No need to make an appointment...really! You can find the Claire's nearest you by clicking here. Not all locations pierce cartilage, so check store for details.
Claire's Ear Piercing Specialists have all received required training to pierce your ears. Once you've completed the Registry, the Specialist will wear single-use, disposable gloves and first clean the surface of your ears with a disinfectant solution swab. They will then pierce your ear with a Professional Piercing System. This system consists of an instrument that creates minimal discomfort and ensures the right amount of pressure is carefully applied to effectively pierce the ear and insert the ear-piercing earring. The Specialist will clean the ear-piercing instrument before and after each use.

Operating income was $28,676,000 against $14,994,000 for the same period in the last year. Loss before income tax expense was $14,904,000 against $40,085,000 for the same period in the last year.

Net sales were affected by an increase in same store sales and an increase in new concession store sales and new store sales, offset by the effect of store closures, an unfavorable foreign currency translation effect of non-U.S. net sales and decreased shipments to franchisees. Net sales would have increased 2.4% excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Consolidated same store sales increased 4.4%.

Apr 12 17
Claire's Stores Inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year ended January 28, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported net sales of $382,456,000 against $402,601,000 for the same period in the last year, the decrease was attributable to the effect of store closures, a decrease in same store sales, an unfavorable foreign currency translation effect of non-U.S. net sales and decreased shipments to franchisees, partially offset by new concession store sales and new store sales. Net sales would have decreased 2.7% excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes. Consolidated same store sales decreased 1.0%, with North America same store sales decreasing 2.3% and Europe same store sales increasing 1.3%.

Operating income was $16,947,000 against loss of $93,311,000 for the same period in the last year.

Claire's is an American retailer of accessories and jewelry primarily aimed toward girls and young women, founded in 1961, and based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.[2]
As of October 27, 2012, Claire's has 3,469 stores in 36 countries: 1,947 in North America (United States & Canada), 1,141 in Europe (United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Spain, Ireland, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Italy), and 381 franchised and licensed stores elsewhere in the world (Japan, Middle East, India, Mexico, Turkey, Ukraine, Greece, Serbia, Malta, Guatemala, El Salvador, Panama, Venezuela, and Dominican Republic)[3]
Their stores are in 95% of all U.S. shopping malls, and Claire's has done more ear piercings than any other retailer, over 90 million in 25+ years.[4]
In 1996, Leslie Mann of the Chicago Tribune said that "Although the management of Claire's says the company doesn't advertise and is deliberately low-profile, the name "Claire" is as familiar to female Baby Boomers as "Ringo". To the Boomers' mall-cruising daughters—and, more and more, to their sons—it's right up there with singer Puff Daddy."[5]

Illinois office[edit]
Claire's has its Illinois offices in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.[15][16] The facility is a brown brick building off of Interstate 90 (Northwest Tollway),[5][17] near Barrington Road.[17] The building serves as Claire's distribution center and main facility, and all merchandise is routed through this facility. Its products, which as of 1996 are mainly imported, are distributed and marketed through the Hoffman Estates location.[5] The company's buying, distribution, and marketing divisions are in the Hoffman Estates facility.[18] As of 1996, 236 full-time employees and several temporary employees worked in the facility. Leslie Mann of the Chicago Tribune said that the facility "contrasts with Claire's glittery stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and Japan."[5] Mann added that "Except for the prototype store in the lobby and the fashion accessories that line the walls of the buyers' offices, the center is unremarkable."[5]
Previously a facility in Wood Dale, Illinois served the purposes now held by the Hoffman Estates office.[5] In early January 1995 Pfizer sold its Hoffman Estates headquarters building for $7.4 million to Claire's so it could consolidate its operations in Memphis, Tennessee. At the time the Hoffman Estates office had 247,000 square feet (22,900 m2) of space.[17] In 1998 Claire's announced plans to build a two-story office building and a 275,000-square-foot (25,500 m2) warehouse at the Hoffman Estates site. This would double the total amount of space at the Illinois site.[19]
Florida office[edit]
Its Florida office in Pembroke Pines, Florida, in Greater Miami.[20][21] The Florida offices are west of the intersection of Flamingo Road and Pines Boulevard. It has 26,000 square feet (2,400 m2) of space in its Florida offices.[22] As of 1997 the CEO has his office in Pembroke Pines.[5] In addition, the company's customer service and investor relations divisions are located in the Pembroke Pines offices.[18] In November 1990 Claire's moved its Florida offices from northern Dade County to Pembroke Pines. The former headquarters in Dade County had 10,000 square feet (930 m2) of space.[22]
Store types[edit]

Stores are aimed principally at teens and tweens, and as such have a kid's section. They average about 1,000 sq. feet, are typically located in malls, and carry the widest selection of merchandise among Claire's brands. Claire's merchandise is targeted at different age groups ranging from babies to young adults. Customers can find earrings, necklaces, bracelets, purses, hair accessories, and fashion accessories. Claire's stores are merchandised to accommodate these different ages, and fashion trends are manipulated to appeal to all ages.
Within America and Canada, Claire's also operates under the Icing brand. These stores are targeted towards young women aged 19–28. The merchandise has a higher price point, and is more mature. Most items are accessories and jewelry, but merchandise also includes items like candles, mineral-based cosmetics, 21st birthday accessories, bachelorette accessories, footwear and many other items. Icing typically does not offer licensed merchandise.[23]
Merchandise[edit]
Claire's sell accessories geared towards tweens, teens, and young adults, meant to imitate higher end fashion trends. Costume jewelry, imitation jewelry of precious gems and materials such as pearls and diamonds, branded merchandise advertising tween musicians, body jewelry, hair accessories, and clothing items are available for purchase. The store's merchandise is often divided into sections. Claire's Club is a line of accessories meant for children under 7, featuring princess-themed jewelry and accessories with children's musicians such as Sophia Grace & Rosie. The rest of the store is for tweens to teens, or those over 12 years of age.
Claire's also carries an assortment of seasonal holiday items such as Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, 4th of July, Halloween, and Christmas items.
Nearly all Claire's locations also offer ear piercing as all the staff are fully trained in using the Studex Gun. Claire's start piercing customers at the age of four months with their sixteen-week immunizations and does not pierce the cartilage of people under 14. Although Claire's target customers are girls and young women, as fashion trends have changed, it has also become a popular place for boys to get their ears pierced as well.
The store carries its own range of perfumes.

Claire's is an American retailer of accessories and jewelry primarily aimed toward girls and young women, founded in 1961, and based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.[2]
As of October 27, 2012, Claire's has 3,469 stores in 36 countries: 1,947 in North America (United States & Canada), 1,141 in Europe (United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Spain, Ireland, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Italy), and 381 franchised and licensed stores elsewhere in the world (Japan, Middle East, India, Mexico, Turkey, Ukraine, Greece, Serbia, Malta, Guatemala, El Salvador, Panama, Venezuela, and Dominican Republic)[3]
Their stores are in 95% of all U.S. shopping malls, and Claire's has done more ear piercings than any other retailer, over 90 million in 25+ years.[4]
In 1996, Leslie Mann of the Chicago Tribune said that "Although the management of Claire's says the company doesn't advertise and is deliberately low-profile, the name "Claire" is as familiar to female Baby Boomers as "Ringo". To the Boomers' mall-cruising daughters—and, more and more, to their sons—it's right up there with singer Puff Daddy."[5]

Illinois office[edit]
Claire's has its Illinois offices in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.[15][16] The facility is a brown brick building off of Interstate 90 (Northwest Tollway),[5][17] near Barrington Road.[17] The building serves as Claire's distribution center and main facility, and all merchandise is routed through this facility. Its products, which as of 1996 are mainly imported, are distributed and marketed through the Hoffman Estates location.[5] The company's buying, distribution, and marketing divisions are in the Hoffman Estates facility.[18] As of 1996, 236 full-time employees and several temporary employees worked in the facility. Leslie Mann of the Chicago Tribune said that the facility "contrasts with Claire's glittery stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and Japan."[5] Mann added that "Except for the prototype store in the lobby and the fashion accessories that line the walls of the buyers' offices, the center is unremarkable."[5]
Previously a facility in Wood Dale, Illinois served the purposes now held by the Hoffman Estates office.[5] In early January 1995 Pfizer sold its Hoffman Estates headquarters building for $7.4 million to Claire's so it could consolidate its operations in Memphis, Tennessee. At the time the Hoffman Estates office had 247,000 square feet (22,900 m2) of space.[17] In 1998 Claire's announced plans to build a two-story office building and a 275,000-square-foot (25,500 m2) warehouse at the Hoffman Estates site. This would double the total amount of space at the Illinois site.[19]

It has 26,000 square feet (2,400 m2) of space in its Florida offices.[22] As of 1997 the CEO has his office in Pembroke Pines.[5] In addition, the company's customer service and investor relations divisions are located in the Pembroke Pines offices.[18] In November 1990 Claire's moved its Florida offices from northern Dade County to Pembroke Pines. The former headquarters in Dade County had 10,000 square feet (930 m2) of space.[22]
Store types[edit]




Claire's branch in North Street, Chichester






Claire's branch in Boulevard Saint Michel, Paris






Glendale, Queens, New York


Stores are aimed principally at teens and tweens, and as such have a kid's section. They average about 1,000 sq. feet, are typically located in malls, and carry the widest selection of merchandise among Claire's brands. Claire's merchandise is targeted at different age groups ranging from babies to young adults. Customers can find earrings, necklaces, bracelets, purses, hair accessories, and fashion accessories. Claire's stores are merchandised to accommodate these different ages, and fashion trends are manipulated to appeal to all ages.
Within America and Canada, Claire's also operates under the Icing brand. These stores are targeted towards young women aged 19–28. The merchandise has a higher price point, and is more mature. Most items are accessories and jewelry, but merchandise also includes items like candles, mineral-based cosmetics, 21st birthday accessories, bachelorette accessories, footwear and many other items. Icing typically does not offer licensed merchandise.[23]
Merchandise[edit]
Claire's sell accessories geared towards tweens, teens, and young adults, meant to imitate higher end fashion trends. Costume jewelry, imitation jewelry of precious gems and materials such as pearls and diamonds, branded merchandise advertising tween musicians, body jewelry, hair accessories, and clothing items are available for purchase. The store's merchandise is often divided into sections. Claire's Club is a line of accessories meant for children under 7, featuring princess-themed jewelry and accessories with children's musicians such as Sophia Grace & Rosie. The rest of the store is for tweens to teens, or those over 12 years of age.
Claire's also carries an assortment of seasonal holiday items such as Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, 4th of July, Halloween, and Christmas items.
Nearly all Claire's locations also offer ear piercing as all the staff are fully trained in using the Studex Gun. Claire's start piercing customers at the age of four months with their sixteen-week immunizations and does not pierce the cartilage of people under 14. Although Claire's target customers are girls and young women, as fashion trends have changed, it has also become a popular place for boys to get their ears pierced as well.
The store carries its own range of perfumes.

Claire's is an American retailer of accessories and jewelry primarily aimed toward girls and young women, founded in 1961, and based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.[2]
As of October 27, 2012, Claire's has 3,469 stores in 36 countries: 1,947 in North America (United States & Canada), 1,141 in Europe (United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Spain, Ireland, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Italy), and 381 franchised and licensed stores elsewhere in the world (Japan, Middle East, India, Mexico, Turkey, Ukraine, Greece, Serbia, Malta, Guatemala, El Salvador, Panama, Venezuela, and Dominican Republic)[3]
Their stores are in 95% of all U.S. shopping malls, and Claire's has done more ear piercings than any other retailer, over 90 million in 25+ years.[4]
In 1996, Leslie Mann of the Chicago Tribune said that "Although the management of Claire's says the company doesn't advertise and is deliberately low-profile, the name "Claire" is as familiar to female Baby Boomers as "Ringo". To the Boomers' mall-cruising daughters—and, more and more, to their sons—it's right up there with singer Puff Daddy."[5]

Illinois office[edit]
Claire's has its Illinois offices in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.[15][16] The facility is a brown brick building off of Interstate 90 (Northwest Tollway),[5][17] near Barrington Road.[17] The building serves as Claire's distribution center and main facility, and all merchandise is routed through this facility. Its products, which as of 1996 are mainly imported, are distributed and marketed through the Hoffman Estates location.[5] The company's buying, distribution, and marketing divisions are in the Hoffman Estates facility.[18] As of 1996, 236 full-time employees and several temporary employees worked in the facility. Leslie Mann of the Chicago Tribune said that the facility "contrasts with Claire's glittery stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and Japan."[5] Mann added that "Except for the prototype store in the lobby and the fashion accessories that line the walls of the buyers' offices, the center is unremarkable."[5]
Previously a facility in Wood Dale, Illinois served the purposes now held by the Hoffman Estates office.[5] In early January 1995 Pfizer sold its Hoffman Estates headquarters building for $7.4 million to Claire's so it could consolidate its operations in Memphis, Tennessee. At the time the Hoffman Estates office had 247,000 square feet (22,900 m2) of space.[17] In 1998 Claire's announced plans to build a two-story office building and a 275,000-square-foot (25,500 m2) warehouse at the Hoffman Estates site. This would double the total amount of space at the Illinois site.[19]
Florida office[edit]
Its Florida office in Pembroke Pines, Florida, in Greater Miami.[20][21] The Florida offices are west of the intersection of Flamingo Road and Pines Boulevard. It has 26,000 square feet (2,400 m2) of space in its Florida offices.[22] As of 1997 the CEO has his office in Pembroke Pines.[5] In addition, the company's customer service and investor relations divisions are located in the Pembroke Pines offices.[18] In November 1990 Claire's moved its Florida offices from northern Dade County to Pembroke Pines. The former headquarters in Dade County had 10,000 square feet (930 m2) of space.[22]
Store types[edit]

Stores are aimed principally at teens and tweens, and as such have a kid's section. They average about 1,000 sq. feet, are typically located in malls, and carry the widest selection of merchandise among Claire's brands. Claire's merchandise is targeted at different age groups ranging from babies to young adults. Customers can find earrings, necklaces, bracelets, purses, hair accessories, and fashion accessories. Claire's stores are merchandised to accommodate these different ages, and fashion trends are manipulated to appeal to all ages.
Within America and Canada, Claire's also operates under the Icing brand. These stores are targeted towards young women aged 19–28. The merchandise has a higher price point, and is more mature. Most items are accessories and jewelry, but merchandise also includes items like candles, mineral-based cosmetics, 21st birthday accessories, bachelorette accessories, footwear and many other items. Icing typically does not offer licensed merchandise.[23]
Merchandise[edit]
Claire's sell accessories geared towards tweens, teens, and young adults, meant to imitate higher end fashion trends. Costume jewelry, imitation jewelry of precious gems and materials such as pearls and diamonds, branded merchandise advertising tween musicians, body jewelry, hair accessories, and clothing items are available for purchase. The store's merchandise is often divided into sections. Claire's Club is a line of accessories meant for children under 7, featuring princess-themed jewelry and accessories with children's musicians such as Sophia Grace & Rosie. The rest of the store is for tweens to teens, or those over 12 years of age.
Claire's also carries an assortment of seasonal holiday items such as Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, 4th of July, Halloween, and Christmas items.
Nearly all Claire's locations also offer ear piercing as all the staff are fully trained in using the Studex Gun. Claire's start piercing customers at the age of four months with their sixteen-week immunizations and does not pierce the cartilage of people under 14. Although Claire's target customers are girls and young women, as fashion trends have changed, it has also become a popular place for boys to get their ears pierced as well.
The store carries its own range of perfumes.

Claire's is an American retailer of accessories and jewelry primarily aimed toward girls and young women, founded in 1961, and based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.[2]
As of October 27, 2012, Claire's has 3,469 stores in 36 countries: 1,947 in North America (United States & Canada), 1,141 in Europe (United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Spain, Ireland, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Italy), and 381 franchised and licensed stores elsewhere in the world (Japan, Middle East, India, Mexico, Turkey, Ukraine, Greece, Serbia, Malta, Guatemala, El Salvador, Panama, Venezuela, and Dominican Republic)[3]
Their stores are in 95% of all U.S. shopping malls, and Claire's has done more ear piercings than any other retailer, over 90 million in 25+ years.[4]
In 1996, Leslie Mann of the Chicago Tribune said that "Although the management of Claire's says the company doesn't advertise and is deliberately low-profile, the name "Claire" is as familiar to female Baby Boomers as "Ringo". To the Boomers' mall-cruising daughters—and, more and more, to their sons—it's right up there with singer Puff Daddy."[5]

Illinois office[edit]
Claire's has its Illinois offices in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.[15][16] The facility is a brown brick building off of Interstate 90 (Northwest Tollway),[5][17] near Barrington Road.[17] The building serves as Claire's distribution center and main facility, and all merchandise is routed through this facility. Its products, which as of 1996 are mainly imported, are distributed and marketed through the Hoffman Estates location.[5] The company's buying, distribution, and marketing divisions are in the Hoffman Estates facility.[18] As of 1996, 236 full-time employees and several temporary employees worked in the facility. Leslie Mann of the Chicago Tribune said that the facility "contrasts with Claire's glittery stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and Japan."[5] Mann added that "Except for the prototype store in the lobby and the fashion accessories that line the walls of the buyers' offices, the center is unremarkable."[5]
Previously a facility in Wood Dale, Illinois served the purposes now held by the Hoffman Estates office.[5] In early January 1995 Pfizer sold its Hoffman Estates headquarters building for $7.4 million to Claire's so it could consolidate its operations in Memphis, Tennessee. At the time the Hoffman Estates office had 247,000 square feet (22,900 m2) of space.[17] In 1998 Claire's announced plans to build a two-story office building and a 275,000-square-foot (25,500 m2) warehouse at the Hoffman Estates site. This would double the total amount of space at the Illinois site.[19]
Florida office[edit]
Its Florida office in Pembroke Pines, Florida, in Greater Miami.[20][21] The Florida offices are west of the intersection of Flamingo Road and Pines Boulevard. It has 26,000 square feet (2,400 m2) of space in its Florida offices.[22] As of 1997 the CEO has his office in Pembroke Pines.[5] In addition, the company's customer service and investor relations divisions are located in the Pembroke Pines offices.[18] In November 1990 Claire's moved its Florida offices from northern Dade County to Pembroke Pines. The former headquarters in Dade County had 10,000 square feet (930 m2) of space.[22]
Store types[edit]

Stores are aimed principally at teens and tweens, and as such have a kid's section. They average about 1,000 sq. feet, are typically located in malls, and carry the widest selection of merchandise among Claire's brands. Claire's merchandise is targeted at different age groups ranging from babies to young adults. Customers can find earrings, necklaces, bracelets, purses, hair accessories, and fashion accessories. Claire's stores are merchandised to accommodate these different ages, and fashion trends are manipulated to appeal to all ages.
Within America and Canada, Claire's also operates under the Icing brand. These stores are targeted towards young women aged 19–28. The merchandise has a higher price point, and is more mature. Most items are accessories and jewelry, but merchandise also includes items like candles, mineral-based cosmetics, 21st birthday accessories, bachelorette accessories, footwear and many other items. Icing typically does not offer licensed merchandise.[23]
Merchandise[edit]
Claire's sell accessories geared towards tweens, teens, and young adults, meant to imitate higher end fashion trends. Costume jewelry, imitation jewelry of precious gems and materials such as pearls and diamonds, branded merchandise advertising tween musicians, body jewelry, hair accessories, and clothing items are available for purchase. The store's merchandise is often divided into sections. Claire's Club is a line of accessories meant for children under 7, featuring princess-themed jewelry and accessories with children's musicians such as Sophia Grace & Rosie. The rest of the store is for tweens to teens, or those over 12 years of age.
Claire's also carries an assortment of seasonal holiday items such as Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, 4th of July, Halloween, and Christmas items.
Nearly all Claire's locations also offer ear piercing as all the staff are fully trained in using the Studex Gun. Claire's start piercing customers at the age of four months with their sixteen-week immunizations and does not pierce the cartilage of people under 14. Although Claire's target customers are girls and young women, as fashion trends have changed, it has also become a popular place for boys to get their ears pierced as well.
The store carries its own range of perfumes.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Why Claire's is no jewel


Claire's Stores Inc. has grown to nearly 3,500 stores in the U.S. and abroad by selling costume jewelry to tweens who buy and discard $10 necklaces faster than they unfriend their friends. The value of the retailer's stock in its planned IPO�may be just as fleeting.�  The Hoffman Estates-based company has boosted sales nearly 16 percent over the past four years, to $1.56 billion, posted increased same-store sales in 10 of the past 13 quarters and expanded outside the U.S. The company's trendy product mix, ranging from $3.50 Jolly Rancher-flavored lip balm to $9.50 chandelier earrings, is allowance-friendly, and its purple signs are fixtures in most American malls.  “Claire's is very strong in the 10-to-14 age category,” says Neil Stern, a senior partner at Chicago retail consultancy McMillan Doolittle & Co. “They grab young customers because they do (ear) piercing, and they hold on to them until they hit freshman or sophomore year.” But that might not be enough to pay off the $2.4 billion debt that Claire's carries following its takeover by Apollo Management LP, a New York private-equity firm, in 2007. With weak cash flow and no access to investment-grade debt, the company is hoping a public offering will help retire $522 million in debt that comes due in 2015. “Claire's doesn't have many choices right now,” says Monica Aggarwal, a credit analyst at New York-based Fitch Ratings Inc.  If Claire's can pull off its IPO deal, it will underscore the market's increasing appetite for public offerings, particularly from companies sponsored by private-equity firms. It also would signify something of a resurrection of the retailer, which not long ago was expected to follow Linens "n Things Inc. (another Apollo purchase) into a leveraged-buyout grave.  But if anything goes wrong—say, teen spending weakens or competitors take away too much market share—Claire's could default on its loans or go bankrupt by 2016, according to a scenario explored in a recent Standard & Poor's note.  Claire's, which was debt-free prior to Apollo's purchase, turned in $189 million in profit on sales of $1.48 billion in 2006, its last year as a public company. By 2012, net income totaled just $6 million on sales of $1.56 billion, as the company shoveled $206 million toward interest payments. With debt that stands at about eight times its annual earnings, Claire's is the most highly leveraged of 25 retail and consumer companies followed by Fitch.
PAYING DOWN DEBT
Other retail and consumer companies have used proceeds from an IPO to pay down debt, though none was as leveraged as Claire's.  When nutrition store operator GNC Holdings Inc., formerly also owned by Apollo, went public in 2011, it used $240 million in net proceeds, combined with cash on hand, to pay down about $520 million of its $900 million in debt. Today, GNC's stock is up to more than $45, a whopping 184 percent above its $16 debut, and same-store sales are improving markedly.

One difference is that Pittsburgh-based GNC actually had some cash on hand. Claire's cash flow, on the other hand, dwindled to $15 million in 2012, down from $32 million in 2011 and $103 million in 2010. In March, Standard & Poor's cut the company's debt rating to deep junk territory. New York-based S&P analyst David Kuntz predicts that Claire's “substantially leveraged capital structure with very thin cash flow” is unlikely to change in the coming year, despite the possibility of a slight increase in same-store sales. Claire's has another problem, Mr. Stern says: It has carpeted North America with nearly 2,000 stores in 88 percent of domestic malls. For substantial growth, the company must look overseas. The company has 1,161 stores in Europe and tested the Chinese market last year, with three stores. It says it will open 150 company-owned stores globally in 2013 and explore Brazil, Russia and Australia via franchises.  The company also faces tougher competition from apparel retailers Forever 21 and H&M, which sell accessories for as low as $5, and rapidly expanding upstarts. They include Francesca's Holdings Corp., which opened 76 Francesca's Collections jewelry boutiques across the U.S. in 2012 and increased sales more than 45 percent to $296 million, and Charming Charlie Inc., which opened 60 locations last year. Despite the uncertainties, Apollo says it's time to cash out. “We're selling everything not nailed down,” Apollo Chairman and CEO Leon Black said at an investment conference in Los Angeles this month.

Claire's is an American retailer of accessories and jewelry primarily aimed toward girls and young women, founded in 1961, and based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.[2]
As of October 27, 2012, Claire's has 3,469 stores in 36 countries: 1,947 in North America (United States & Canada), 1,141 in Europe (United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Spain, Ireland, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Italy), and 381 franchised and licensed stores elsewhere in the world (Japan, Middle East, India, Mexico, Turkey, Ukraine, Greece, Serbia, Malta, Guatemala, El Salvador, Panama, Venezuela, and Dominican Republic)[3]
Their stores are in 95% of all U.S. shopping malls, and Claire's has done more ear piercings than any other retailer, over 90 million in 25+ years.[4]
In 1996, Leslie Mann of the Chicago Tribune said that "Although the management of Claire's says the company doesn't advertise and is deliberately low-profile, the name "Claire" is as familiar to female Baby Boomers as "Ringo". To the Boomers' mall-cruising daughters—and, more and more, to their sons—it's right up there with singer Puff Daddy."[5]

Illinois office[edit]
Claire's has its Illinois offices in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.[15][16] The facility is a brown brick building off of Interstate 90 (Northwest Tollway),[5][17] near Barrington Road.[17] The building serves as Claire's distribution center and main facility, and all merchandise is routed through this facility. Its products, which as of 1996 are mainly imported, are distributed and marketed through the Hoffman Estates location.[5] The company's buying, distribution, and marketing divisions are in the Hoffman Estates facility.[18] As of 1996, 236 full-time employees and several temporary employees worked in the facility. Leslie Mann of the Chicago Tribune said that the facility "contrasts with Claire's glittery stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and Japan."[5] Mann added that "Except for the prototype store in the lobby and the fashion accessories that line the walls of the buyers' offices, the center is unremarkable."[5]
Previously a facility in Wood Dale, Illinois served the purposes now held by the Hoffman Estates office.[5] In early January 1995 Pfizer sold its Hoffman Estates headquarters building for $7.4 million to Claire's so it could consolidate its operations in Memphis, Tennessee. At the time the Hoffman Estates office had 247,000 square feet (22,900 m2) of space.[17] In 1998 Claire's announced plans to build a two-story office building and a 275,000-square-foot (25,500 m2) warehouse at the Hoffman Estates site. This would double the total amount of space at the Illinois site.[19]
Florida office[edit]
Its Florida office in Pembroke Pines, Florida, in Greater Miami.[20][21] The Florida offices are west of the intersection of Flamingo Road and Pines Boulevard. It has 26,000 square feet (2,400 m2) of space in its Florida offices.[22] As of 1997 the CEO has his office in Pembroke Pines.[5] In addition, the company's customer service and investor relations divisions are located in the Pembroke Pines offices.[18] In November 1990 Claire's moved its Florida offices from northern Dade County to Pembroke Pines. The former headquarters in Dade County had 10,000 square feet (930 m2) of space.[22]
Store types[edit]

Stores are aimed principally at teens and tweens, and as such have a kid's section. They average about 1,000 sq. feet, are typically located in malls, and carry the widest selection of merchandise among Claire's brands. Claire's merchandise is targeted at different age groups ranging from babies to young adults. Customers can find earrings, necklaces, bracelets, purses, hair accessories, and fashion accessories. Claire's stores are merchandised to accommodate these different ages, and fashion trends are manipulated to appeal to all ages.
Within America and Canada, Claire's also operates under the Icing brand. These stores are targeted towards young women aged 19–28. The merchandise has a higher price point, and is more mature. Most items are accessories and jewelry, but merchandise also includes items like candles, mineral-based cosmetics, 21st birthday accessories, bachelorette accessories, footwear and many other items. Icing typically does not offer licensed merchandise.[23]
Merchandise[edit]
Claire's sell accessories geared towards tweens, teens, and young adults, meant to imitate higher end fashion trends. Costume jewelry, imitation jewelry of precious gems and materials such as pearls and diamonds, branded merchandise advertising tween musicians, body jewelry, hair accessories, and clothing items are available for purchase. The store's merchandise is often divided into sections. Claire's Club is a line of accessories meant for children under 7, featuring princess-themed jewelry and accessories with children's musicians such as Sophia Grace & Rosie. The rest of the store is for tweens to teens, or those over 12 years of age.
Claire's also carries an assortment of seasonal holiday items such as Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, 4th of July, Halloween, and Christmas items.
Nearly all Claire's locations also offer ear piercing as all the staff are fully trained in using the Studex Gun. Claire's start piercing customers at the age of four months with their sixteen-week immunizations and does not pierce the cartilage of people under 14. Although Claire's target customers are girls and young women, as fashion trends have changed, it has also become a popular place for boys to get their ears pierced as well.
The store carries its own range of perfumes.

Claire's is an American retailer of accessories and jewelry primarily aimed toward girls and young women, founded in 1961, and based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.[2]
As of October 27, 2012, Claire's has 3,469 stores in 36 countries: 1,947 in North America (United States & Canada), 1,141 in Europe (United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Spain, Ireland, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Italy), and 381 franchised and licensed stores elsewhere in the world (Japan, Middle East, India, Mexico, Turkey, Ukraine, Greece, Serbia, Malta, Guatemala, El Salvador, Panama, Venezuela, and Dominican Republic)[3]
Their stores are in 95% of all U.S. shopping malls, and Claire's has done more ear piercings than any other retailer, over 90 million in 25+ years.[4]
In 1996, Leslie Mann of the Chicago Tribune said that "Although the management of Claire's says the company doesn't advertise and is deliberately low-profile, the name "Claire" is as familiar to female Baby Boomers as "Ringo". To the Boomers' mall-cruising daughters—and, more and more, to their sons—it's right up there with singer Puff Daddy."[5]

History[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2013)

Offices[edit]
As of 2014 Claire's has 6 offices:[2]

Birmingham: Europe HQ, Europe Distribution Center

Paris: Field Support
Madrid: Field Support

Illinois office[edit]
Claire's has its Illinois offices in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.[15][16] The facility is a brown brick building off of Interstate 90 (Northwest Tollway),[5][17] near Barrington Road.[17] The building serves as Claire's distribution center and main facility, and all merchandise is routed through this facility. Its products, which as of 1996 are mainly imported, are distributed and marketed through the Hoffman Estates location.[5] The company's buying, distribution, and marketing divisions are in the Hoffman Estates facility.[18] As of 1996, 236 full-time employees and several temporary employees worked in the facility. Leslie Mann of the Chicago Tribune said that the facility "contrasts with Claire's glittery stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and Japan."[5] Mann added that "Except for the prototype store in the lobby and the fashion accessories that line the walls of the buyers' offices, the center is unremarkable."[5]
Previously a facility in Wood Dale, Illinois served the purposes now held by the Hoffman Estates office.[5] In early January 1995 Pfizer sold its Hoffman Estates headquarters building for $7.4 million to Claire's so it could consolidate its operations in Memphis, Tennessee. At the time the Hoffman Estates office had 247,000 square feet (22,900 m2) of space.[17] In 1998 Claire's announced plans to build a two-story office building and a 275,000-square-foot (25,500 m2) warehouse at the Hoffman Estates site. This would double the total amount of space at the Illinois site.[19]
Florida office[edit]
Its Florida office in Pembroke Pines, Florida, in Greater Miami.[20][21] The Florida offices are west of the intersection of Flamingo Road and Pines Boulevard. It has 26,000 square feet (2,400 m2) of space in its Florida offices.[22] As of 1997 the CEO has his office in Pembroke Pines.[5] In addition, the company's customer service and investor relations divisions are located in the Pembroke Pines offices.[18] In November 1990 Claire's moved its Florida offices from northern Dade County to Pembroke Pines. The former headquarters in Dade County had 10,000 square feet (930 m2) of space.[22]
Store types[edit]

Stores are aimed principally at teens and tweens, and as such have a kid's section. They average about 1,000 sq. feet, are typically located in malls, and carry the widest selection of merchandise among Claire's brands. Claire's merchandise is targeted at different age groups ranging from babies to young adults. Customers can find earrings, necklaces, bracelets, purses, hair accessories, and fashion accessories. Claire's stores are merchandised to accommodate these different ages, and fashion trends are manipulated to appeal to all ages.
Within America and Canada, Claire's also operates under the Icing brand. These stores are targeted towards young women aged 19–28. The merchandise has a higher price point, and is more mature. Most items are accessories and jewelry, but merchandise also includes items like candles, mineral-based cosmetics, 21st birthday accessories, bachelorette accessories, footwear and many other items. Icing typically does not offer licensed merchandise.[23]
Merchandise[edit]
Claire's sell accessories geared towards tweens, teens, and young adults, meant to imitate higher end fashion trends. Costume jewelry, imitation jewelry of precious gems and materials such as pearls and diamonds, branded merchandise advertising tween musicians, body jewelry, hair accessories, and clothing items are available for purchase. The store's merchandise is often divided into sections. Claire's Club is a line of accessories meant for children under 7, featuring princess-themed jewelry and accessories with children's musicians such as Sophia Grace & Rosie. The rest of the store is for tweens to teens, or those over 12 years of age.
Claire's also carries an assortment of seasonal holiday items such as Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, 4th of July, Halloween, and Christmas items.
Nearly all Claire's locations also offer ear piercing as all the staff are fully trained in using the Studex Gun. Claire's start piercing customers at the age of four months with their sixteen-week immunizations and does not pierce the cartilage of people under 14. Although Claire's target customers are girls and young women, as fashion trends have changed, it has also become a popular place for boys to get their ears pierced as well.
The store carries its own range of perfumes.

Claire's is an American retailer of accessories and jewelry primarily aimed toward girls and young women, founded in 1961, and based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.[2]
As of October 27, 2012, Claire's has 3,469 stores in 36 countries: 1,947 in North America (United States & Canada), 1,141 in Europe (United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Spain, Ireland, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Italy), and 381 franchised and licensed stores elsewhere in the world (Japan, Middle East, India, Mexico, Turkey, Ukraine, Greece, Serbia, Malta, Guatemala, El Salvador, Panama, Venezuela, and Dominican Republic)[3]
Their stores are in 95% of all U.S. shopping malls, and Claire's has done more ear piercings than any other retailer, over 90 million in 25+ years.[4]
In 1996, Leslie Mann of the Chicago Tribune said that "Although the management of Claire's says the company doesn't advertise and is deliberately low-profile, the name "Claire" is as familiar to female Baby Boomers as "Ringo". To the Boomers' mall-cruising daughters—and, more and more, to their sons—it's right up there with singer Puff Daddy."[5]

Illinois office[edit]
Claire's has its Illinois offices in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.[15][16] The facility is a brown brick building off of Interstate 90 (Northwest Tollway),[5][17] near Barrington Road.[17] The building serves as Claire's distribution center and main facility, and all merchandise is routed through this facility. Its products, which as of 1996 are mainly imported, are distributed and marketed through the Hoffman Estates location.[5] The company's buying, distribution, and marketing divisions are in the Hoffman Estates facility.[18] As of 1996, 236 full-time employees and several temporary employees worked in the facility. Leslie Mann of the Chicago Tribune said that the facility "contrasts with Claire's glittery stores in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and Japan."[5] Mann added that "Except for the prototype store in the lobby and the fashion accessories that line the walls of the buyers' offices, the center is unremarkable."[5]
Previously a facility in Wood Dale, Illinois served the purposes now held by the Hoffman Estates office.[5] In early January 1995 Pfizer sold its Hoffman Estates headquarters building for $7.4 million to Claire's so it could consolidate its operations in Memphis, Tennessee. At the time the Hoffman Estates office had 247,000 square feet (22,900 m2) of space.[17] In 1998 Claire's announced plans to build a two-story office building and a 275,000-square-foot (25,500 m2) warehouse at the Hoffman Estates site. This would double the total amount of space at the Illinois site.[19]
Florida office[edit]
Its Florida office in Pembroke Pines, Florida, in Greater Miami.[20][21] The Florida offices are west of the intersection of Flamingo Road and Pines Boulevard. It has 26,000 square feet (2,400 m2) of space in its Florida offices.[22] As of 1997 the CEO has his office in Pembroke Pines.[5] In addition, the company's customer service and investor relations divisions are located in the Pembroke Pines offices.[18] In November 1990 Claire's moved its Florida offices from northern Dade County to Pembroke Pines. The former headquarters in Dade County had 10,000 square feet (930 m2) of space.[22]
Store types[edit]




Claire's branch in North Street, Chichester






Claire's branch in Boulevard Saint Michel, Paris






Glendale, Queens, New York


Stores are aimed principally at teens and tweens, and as such have a kid's section. They average about 1,000 sq. feet, are typically located in malls, and carry the widest selection of merchandise among Claire's brands. Claire's merchandise is targeted at different age groups ranging from babies to young adults. Customers can find earrings, necklaces, bracelets, purses, hair accessories, and fashion accessories. Claire's stores are merchandised to accommodate these different ages, and fashion trends are manipulated to appeal to all ages.
Within America and Canada, Claire's also operates under the Icing brand. These stores are targeted towards young women aged 19–28. The merchandise has a higher price point, and is more mature. Most items are accessories and jewelry, but merchandise also includes items like candles, mineral-based cosmetics, 21st birthday accessories, bachelorette accessories, footwear and many other items. Icing typically does not offer licensed merchandise.[23]
Merchandise[edit]
Claire's sell accessories geared towards tweens, teens, and young adults, meant to imitate higher end fashion trends. Costume jewelry, imitation jewelry of precious gems and materials such as pearls and diamonds, branded merchandise advertising tween musicians, body jewelry, hair accessories, and clothing items are available for purchase. The store's merchandise is often divided into sections. Claire's Club is a line of accessories meant for children under 7, featuring princess-themed jewelry and accessories with children's musicians such as Sophia Grace & Rosie. The rest of the store is for tweens to teens, or those over 12 years of age.
Claire's also carries an assortment of seasonal holiday items such as Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, 4th of July, Halloween, and Christmas items.
Nearly all Claire's locations also offer ear piercing as all the staff are fully trained in using the Studex Gun. Claire's start piercing customers at the age of four months with their sixteen-week immunizations and does not pierce the cartilage of people under 14. Although Claire's target customers are girls and young women, as fashion trends have changed, it has also become a popular place for boys to get their ears pierced as well.
The store carries its own range of perfumes.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
