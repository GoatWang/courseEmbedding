                                            January 24, 2017
                                        


                                                   
                                                        The New York Times:  Hoping to Strike Gold Again, Silver Lake Leads Investment in Koubei
                                                    
                                                




Silver Lake is leading a group in a $1.1 billion investment in Koubei, a business meant to help bring local services — from restaurants to local stores — even closer into Alibaba’s orbit. Koubei is part of what is increasingly known as the online-to-offline sector, or O2O, meant to help attract customers of internet services to physical locations and services.
                                         





                                            December 27, 2016
                                        


                                                   
                                                        Fortune: Dell EMC Merger: The Gamblers Behind Tech’s Biggest Deal Ever
                                                    
                                                




“Everything’s bigger in Texas—even the deals. Just ask Michael Dell, founder and CEO of his namesake company, once the largest PC maker in the country. In 2013, along with private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, he took Dell private, a transaction worth $24.4 billion—the largest leveraged buyout since the Great Recession. The sequel, two years later, was even grander.”                                        





                                            November 16, 2016

What the UFC deal represents is something entirely different, a new and even more audacious strategic strike that aims to challenge the core assumptions of the entertainment industry. Because this time, instead of just helping others create projects, they’ve made a major, multibillion-dollar leap into owning content themselves.                                        





                                            August 5, 2016
                                        


                                                   
                                                        The New York Times: How Dell Raised $67 Billion for the Biggest Tech Deal Ever
                                                    
                                                




How Dell, led by Michael Dell, and its financial backer, the investment firm Silver Lake, made it this far is in part a tale of an unusual struggle to finance the biggest-ever takeover in the tech industry, one that drew on debt raised in the face of tumultuous markets. The undertaking included the fourth-largest investment-grade corporate bond ever raised, the second-largest this year, as ranked by Thomson Reuters.                                        





                                            July 11, 2016
                                        


                                                   
                                                        The New York Times: U.F.C. Sells Itself for $4 Billion
                                                    
                                                




Backing the deal are the private equity heavyweights Silver Lake, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and the investment firm of the billionaire Michael S. Dell. The deal highlights the power and reach of the 23-year-old U.F.C., whose fights are now shown in more than 156 countries and take place in all 50 states, and which claims millennials as some 45 percent of its audience.                                        





                                            June 16, 2016
                                        


                                                   
                                                        Variety: Cast & Crew Entertainment Buying CAPS Payroll
                                                    
                                                




Silver Lake, the controlling shareholder of Cast & Crew, said it is committing “substantial” additional equity to fund the acquisition and support Cast & Crew’s continued growth. Since Silver Lake’s acquisition of Cast & Crew in July, the company has accelerated investments to strategically align the company for the digital future of the industry.

Silver Lake’s investment in Symantec back in February anticipated a transaction like the Blue Coat deal, with the firm setting itself up to provide additional financing if Symantec were to pursue a deal that needed private equity help. And Silver Lake believes that other, smaller acquisitions may be in the offing for the security software provider in the future.

BC and Silver Lake bought MultiPlan about two months after the Viant deal closed and focused on integrating the businesses. Under BC and Silver Lake, Ebitda increased about 50%.

Private equity firm Silver Lake Partners has agreed to acquire a minority stake in Ancestry.com in a deal that values the privately held genealogy website at $2.6 billion, including debt. The investment represents a bet that Ancestry's fast-growing DNA business will continue to expand.

Emanuel and Whitesell have used the Silver Lake money to acquire or team with a whopping 12 businesses, branching into areas including Professional Bull Riders, an e-sports league with Turner and buying former client Donald Trump's Miss Universe Organization. Emanuel, who has taken the lead on the fashion and international businesses, and Whitesell, whose focus is sports, also are executing an aggressive strategy of integrating the formerly siloed divisions.

SoftBank, the Japanese technology group, has invested $250m in WME-IMG, which represents stars ranging from actor Ben Affleck to tennis player Serena Williams, in a deal that values the entertainment, sports and fashion company at $5.5bn. The deal represents a steep increase in the value of WME-IMG over the past two years.

Private-equity firm Silver Lake is making a $500 million investment in Symantec Corp. and taking a board seat in a bid to boost the cybersecurity company. Symantec makes security software, a hot commodity in times of rising concerns about the safety of the Internet and global hacking.

In a year of few tech-industry IPOs, most of which disappointed, GoDaddy is a shining example of how business and finance are supposed to work.

                                                        The Wall Street Journal: Exchange Operator ICE to Buy Interactive Data for $5.2 Billion
                                                    
                                                




Silver Lake and Warburg Pincus stand to nearly triple their money on their 2010 acquisition of Interactive Data, reflecting the recent surge in demand for fixed-income data. The value of their roughly $1.2 billion stake in the original deal is worth over $3 billion in the sale to ICE.

In striking its deal of more than $60 billion, Dell and its financial backer, the investment firm Silver Lake, are betting that a huge acquisition will help one of the best-known names in the industry keep up with the times. Buying EMC would give Dell one of the biggest names in computer data storage, adding to existing offerings like network servers, corporate software and mobile devices.

In seeking out Silver Lake, Motorola Solutions is hoping to accelerate a transition from selling only radios that police officers, fire departments and other emergency workers use, to a broader emergency communications platform.

Tintri just closed a healthy $125 million Series F funding round which it will use to build out channel and marketing activities around its storage appliance. This round was led by Silver Lake Kraftwerk.

Private equity firm Silver Lake has acquired Cast & Crew Entertainment Services, the Burbank-based payroll services company, for $700 million.

Private equity firm Silver Lake Partners LP said on Monday it would lead a $500 million investment in Qunar Cayman Islands Ltd, the Chinese travel website controlled by the country's internet search engine company Baidu Inc. In its second biggest investment in China after its deal with e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Silver Lake said it would invest $330 million in Qunar in the form of convertible bonds.

Ten years ago, Silver Lake and KKR partnered to create Avago Technologies, through the purchase of Agilent’s semiconductor business. They then took the company in public in 2009 and, by 2011, had effectively exited with 5x cash-on-cash returns. [Silver Lake] made a $1 billion convertible debt investment into Avago to help finance the LSI purchase. Were Silver Lake to convert its notes at Avago’s current trading price, the stake would be worth approximately $3 billion.

An accelerating wave of consolidation in the semiconductor industry has a new point man: Hock Tan, a press-shy numbers guy now mounting the largest takeover in high-tech history. “He has a unique ability to run a big business as if it were a small business,” said Kenneth Hao, an Avago director and managing partner at Silver Lake, the chip maker’s second-largest investor.

Shares of Virtu Financial Inc. surged in their market debut. The company expects to invest in the business a small amount of the money raised in the offering, while the bulk of it will be used to buy out current investors, which include executives and private-equity firm Silver Lake.

The company’s shares made their trading debut on Wednesday at $26.15, about 30 percent above the initial public offering price of $20 a share, a dollar more than the top end of the expected range. Since its takeover by three private equity firms — Silver Lake, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Technology Crossover Ventures — for $2.25 billion in 2011, GoDaddy has expanded both its line of offerings and its international presence.

Silver Lake, the firm that helped Michael Dell take his computer company private, plans to announce on Wednesday that it has invested $250 million in Red Ventures for a minority stake. The investment is a wager that the company and its suite of marketing tools represent a unique, and highly lucrative, approach to acquiring customers for companies like DirecTV, Verizon and MetLife.

Silver Lake is now looking to a century-old Hollywood talent agency behind Matt Damon and Serena Williams for its next big windfall. The investment in William Morris Endeavor, the agency run by Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell, “will be one of the highest returning investments that we have done”, says Egon Durban, Silver Lake’s managing partner.

The market debut of the Alibaba Group, the Chinese Internet titan, hit the stock markets like a meteor last week, ending its first day of public trading on Friday worth a staggering $231 billion.

Since 2010, Mercury’s majority owner has been the investment firm Silver Lake Partners, which invested about $450 million in cash in exchange for a 62 percent stake. Since then, the company has expanded its reach, including increasing its merchant base to 90,000 from 40,000 in 2009. During that same time, its revenue grew to $237 million from $87 million, while its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization nearly tripled to $93 million.

The IMG purchase, financed by Silver Lake, puts WME into new territory. Though the potential of IMG’s sports properties hogged the headlines post-deal – the company is active in highly lucrative college sports leagues as well as golf – a closer examination of IMG reveals plenty of fashion opportunities for its new owners.

Avago Technologies plans to make the biggest acquisition in its history — with the help of a former owner. As part of the deal, Silver Lake will invest $1 billion in the form of a convertible note, supplementing a $4.6 billion loan from a group of banks.

With shareholders formally approving the company’s sale to Mr. Dell and the investment firm Silver Lake Partners for $24.9 billion earlier in the day, the task now lies in what the founder described as optimizing the company’s current form. Over the last five years, Mr. Dell has moved to shift Dell from primarily making personal computers toward providing software and services for corporate clients.

It has been a while since there has been a notable departure at tech giant Hewlett-Packard. But the dry spell is over. Ajei Gopal, an HP senior vice president and general manager in its software business unit, is leaving the company for a position with the private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, sources tell AllThingsD.

For Dell, a $24.4 billion deal to take itself private is a bold move out of Wall Street’s harsh spotlight as it tries to remake itself in a world where personal computers are no longer the big business in technology. The private equity firm Silver Lake, one of the most prominent investors in technology companies, is contributing about $1 billion in cash.

Silver Lake is doubling down on digital media by bringing on Dave Habiger as a Senior Advisor. Habiger most recently served as the CEO of U.K.-based pay TV set-top box maker NDS and before that led the digital movie download provider Sonic Solutions.

Silver Lake started building relations with Alibaba Group almost as soon as it launched its Asia operations in 2008. When Alibaba decided last year that it wanted to facilitate the sale of a 5.7% stake, Silver Lake and its counterparts presented the right solution at the right time. This transaction was named Private Equity Deal of the Year at the AVCJ China Awards.

Despite waning investor sentiment, large U.S. buyout firms are some of the fittest in the industry and the most likely to produce outsized returns, according to the Spring 2011 HEC Dow Jones Private Equity Fitness Ranking. For the second year running, Silver Lake retained its #1 ranking.

Silver Lake, the technology investment firm, has bought a 31 per cent stake in William Morris Endeavor Entertainment to finance the expansion of the media and entertainment agency into new digital areas.

                                                        The New York Times: Silver Lake's Hutchins Named a Director of the New York Fed
                                                    
                                                




Private equity is again getting a seat at the table at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. On Thursday, the regulator named Glenn Hutchins, Co-Founder of Silver Lake, as a new director. 





                                            July 12, 2011

The new team added features and new versions of Skype every four to six weeks, and dove into significant new businesses, including smartphone apps, deals to embed Skype in consumer products like TVs and game consoles, and partnerships with Facebook and Verizon Wireless. Just a year after the buyout, Skype was surging: Users had climbed to 600 million from about 400 million a year earlier — and it saw rising usage of its video calling services.                                        





                                            June 22, 2011

Forward-looking private equity investors can reap strong returns from global growth opportunities, despite the powerful headwinds that are buffeting the U.S. economy, according to Glenn Hutchins, Co-Founder of Silver Lake.

Silver Lake and the other investors swiftly moved to spruce up Skype. Over the last two years, they have pushed the Internet company to increase its focus on development, shortened product cycles and forged new partnerships. Skype also moved to build out its services in the mobile and the enterprise space, both considered high-growth markets.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
