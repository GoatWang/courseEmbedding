The Fairholme Fund NASDAQ: FAIRXSTATUS: OPEN TO NEW INVESTORSThe Fairholme Fund seeks to achieve long-term growth of capital by investing in a focused portfolio of equity and fixed-income securities.Performance*The value of a $10,000 investment in The Fairholme Fund at its December 29, 1999, inception had, by June 30, 2017, grown to $52,537 (calculated by assuming reinvestment of distributions into additional fund shares). A concurrent $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 Index grew only to $23,236.The potential advantages of The Fairholme Fund's long-term focused investment approach are most evident when evaluating our performance over any 5-year period since FAIRX inception.Through June 30, 2017, The Fairholme Fund has achieved 145 positive 5-year return periods and only 6 negative 5-year return periods, compared with 124 positive 5-year return periods and 27 negative 5-year return periods for the S&P 500. The Fairholme Fund's average rolling 5-year return was 65.70% versus 43.75% for the S&P 500. The Fairholme Fund has outperformed the S&P 500 in 98 of 151 5-year periods, calculated after each month’s end. The Fairholme Fund’s worst 5-year-period return was (6.89)% versus (29.05)% for the S&P 500. In its best 5-year period, The Fairholme Fund’s return was 185.26% versus the S&P 500’s best return of 181.57%.Standardized returns are available by clicking FAIRX FACTS in the menu to the left.  * Mutual fund investing involves risks, including loss of principal. The information on this page covers the period from inception of The Fairholme Fund (December 29, 1999) to June 30, 2017. Past performance information quoted does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment in The Fairholme Fund will fluctuate; an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information quoted. Performance figures are after expenses and assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains but do not reflect a 2.00% fee on shares redeemed within 60 days of purchase. Most recent month-end performance and answers to any questions you may have can be obtained by calling Shareholder Services at (866) 202-2263. The S&P 500 Index is a broad-based measurement of changes in the stock market, is used for comparative purposes only, and is not meant to be indicative of The Fairholme Fund’s performance, asset composition, or volatility. The Fairholme Fund maintains a focused portfolio of investments in a limited number of issuers and does not seek to diversify its investments. This exposes The Fairholme Fund to the risk of unanticipated industry conditions and risks particular to a single company or the securities of a single company. The Fairholme Fund’s performance may differ markedly from the performance of the S&P 500 Index in either up or down market trends. The performance of the S&P 500 Index is shown with all dividends reinvested and does not reflect any reduction in performance for the effects of transaction costs or management fees. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. The Fairholme Fund’s total expense ratio reflected in its prospectus dated March 30, 2017, was 1.03%.Fairholme Funds, Inc.TERMS OF USE   PRIVACY POLICY   PROSPECTUSAll investments are subject to inherent risk, including possible loss of the principal amount invested.

An investment in American International Group demonstrates Fairholme's commitment to identifying established public companies trading at prices well below our estimates of their intrinsic value. A leader in global property and casualty insurance, with over 70 million* customers and client relationships worldwide,  AIG is an example of a recovering icon that fell out of favor with investors.*AIG.com, "Our Businesses"







Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We believe that these two companies may be the most important financial institutions in the United States – perhaps the world – and directly support housing affordability and accessibility, including the uniquely American 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. They are a major reason why our country did not descend into a second Great Depression. Millions of American families depend on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to lower the costs and improve access to homeownership. In times of stress, these two have helped to ensure the continued functioning of the U.S. housing market. They have no substitutes. Fairholme’s investment in Fannie and Freddie demonstrates a commitment to ignore the crowd and invest in valuable, systemically important institutions – even those that are politically unpopular.







Bank of America spent tens of billions to clean up Countrywide Financial, which was no easy task. As the heavy lifting winds down, we believe the bank's profitability will shine through and the stock will begin to flex some muscle. 







Sears, a real estate behemoth in retailer's clothing, remains our proverbial beach ball held under water. Based on our latest estimates of underlying asset values, our research suggests that this may be a good long-term holding. Click here for important disclaimers, current performance, and portfolio composition information.

Prepare — Fairholme Capital Management


























































Despite claims to the contrary, even the best fund managers can never predict with any certainty what the future holds. Since fortune-telling is not a viable option, we must be prepared to react to whatever reality comes our way.Fairholme views market crashes, panics, and downturns as opportunities to buy more of the companies we love at fire sale prices. The only way to exploit these opportunities is to have cash on hand.Opportunities to buy companies at bargain prices arise suddenly and unexpectedly. A lawsuit, criminal probe, industrial accident, or recession may send a company's shares into a tailspin. In such a case, and if the company is otherwise sound, we may look beyond the fear and buy as aggressively as others sell. Often the price drop is a knee-jerk overreaction, artificially compounded by pessimism and algorithmic sell orders. Fairholme believes that maintaining a cash cushion may give us the peace of mind to ride out downturns. A lack of cash may sometimes force us to sell our holdings into a very soft market, which may further depress the prices of these holdings.Naysayers argue that holding a large amount of cash that yields nearly nothing is foolish, and perhaps it is - until it isn't. On all counts, we think it's better to have cash and not need it, rather than to need it and not have it. Investors who criticize hoarding large amounts of cash in good times may want to reflect upon that long-neglected investment treatise: Aesop's "The Ant and the Grasshopper."
