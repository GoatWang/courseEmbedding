Title: CASE Albert Cheng v Tse Wai Chun Paul
 1CASE Albert Cheng v Tse Wai Chun Paul Albert Cheng 1st defendant / 1st appellant    Tse Wai Chun Paul/ Plaintiff  Respondent  Commercial Radio 2nd defendant  Lam Yuk Wah 3rd defendant / 2nd appellant  2CASE Albert Cheng v Tse Wai Chun PaulProfile of Albert Cheng - known as Taipan A public affairs radio commentator Profile of Tse Wai Chun Paul - a solicitor   3Background In September 1991, Mr Au Wing Cheung (Mr Au) was instructed by his then employer Select Tours International Company Limited (Select Tours) to lead a tour group to the Philippines.   4Background On 7 September 1991, when the tour group was going through the customs in Manila Airport, Mr Au and a member of the tour group, Mr Wong Chuen Ming (Mr Wong), were arrested together with a number of other members of the group for trafficking in a drug which was commonly known as "ice".   Both Mr Au and Mr Wong were prosecuted, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the court in the Philippines. This had attracted a lot of publicity in Hong Kong. Some people believed that Mr Au and Mr Wong were innocent. They formed various groups organising campaigns seeking their release.  One of these groups was the Tourist Industry Rescue Group of which Select Tours was a member and the plaintiff its honorary legal adviser. The 1st defendant had also organised another group and various activities which were aimed at the same objective.   5Background   As a result of the campaigns by these various groups, Mr Au and Mr Wong were released by the Government of the Philippines in July 1996 and returned to Hong Kong. They were accompanied by various people including the plaintiff and the 1st defendant.   Understandably, different people claimed credit for the successful return of Mr Au and Mr Wong.   After Mr Au's return to Hong Kong, there was a suggestion that he should claim compensation from his ex-employer Select Tours for the period in which he was detained in the Philippines, i.e. from September 1991 to July 1996. It would seem that the plaintiff had advised Mr Au not to make the claim whereas the 1st defendant urged him to do so.   6The conversation in question On 1st August 1996, the 1st and 3rd defendants were co-hosts in a phone-in radio talk show broadcast on the Chinese channel of the Commercial Radio which was run by the 2nd defendant. The name of the programme was "Teacup in a Storm".  During the programme, the 1st and 3rd defendants said something about the plaintiff which the plaintiff alleged was defamatory of him. It was a conversation between the two defendants. A record of the conversation together with a translation thereof were annexed to the Re-Amended Statement of Claim.  The plaintiff alleged that the 1st and 3rd defendants had defamed him by saying that he was one of those people who had subjected Mr Au and his family to threat and intimidation during Mr Au's detention in the Philippines and that he had given advice to Mr Au on Mr Au's claim for compensation from his previous employer Select Tours, having regard only to the interest of the travel industry but not that of Mr Au.  Thus, it was alleged that the 1st and 3rd defendants had imputed that the plaintiff had acted unprofessionally, unethically and allowed himself to be put into a position of conflict of interest.   7Defences and reply In response to the claim, the three defendants raised the following defences  1. the statements complained of did not refer to the plaintiff and were not defamatory  2. they were true or substantially true and  3. in so far as they consisted of expressions of opinion, they constituted fair comment on a matter of public interest.   8Defences and reply In reply to the defendants' defences, the plaintiff pleaded that the 1st and 3rd defendants published the words complained of maliciously. As particulars of malice, it was alleged that  1. the 1st and 3rd defendants knew and/or believed that the words were untrue  2. they published the words with reckless disregard as to whether the words were true or false and  3. the words were published with certain motives. As particulars of such motives, the plaintiff relied on a number of matters, namely, the 1st and 3 rd defendants wanted (1) to persuade Mr Au into pursuing his claim against Select Tours for compensation, (2) to pressurize Select Tours into compensating Mr Au (3) to gratify their animosity against the plaintiff and Select Tours  4. to belittle the efforts of the plaintiff and to distinguish the 1st defendant's efforts with regard to giving assistance to Mr Au, and  5. to raise a new controversy so as to arouse the interest of the audience in continuing to listen to their programme.   9The trial judge  The trial judge had ruled that there was no evidence of malice on the part of the 2nd defendant. He also ruled that there was no evidence that the 3rd defendant knew or believed the words to be true or had any animosity against the plaintiff or wanted to belittle the efforts of the plaintiff.  10The trial judge  Hon Chan, CJHC  After a trial before Yuen J and a jury, on the plaintiff's claim for damages for defamation against the 3 defendants, the jury awarded 80,000.00 to the plaintiff against the 1st and 3rd defendants and held the 2nd defendant not liable. This is an appeal by the 1st and 3rd defendants against the verdict of the jury.  The defendants claimed that the remarks objected to were fair comment. The jury found against the two individual defendants, it had to be assumed , on the basis of malice. The Court of Appeal rejected their appeals. The defendants appealed to the Court of Final Appeal.   11Court of Final Appeal January 2001Chief Justice Li  The Court unanimously allows the appeal and makes the following orders (1) The jury's verdicts regarding Mr Cheng and Mr Lam are quashed (2) The orders made against them by Yuen J and the Court of Appeal are set aside (3) A new trial extending to all issues is ordered as against Mr Cheng and Mr Lam. As to costs, the Court unanimously makes an order nisi in the terms set out in my judgment.  12reports after verdict   13Chief Justice Li The freedom of speech  The freedom of speech (or the freedom of expression) is a freedom that is essential to Hong Kong's civil society. It is constitutionally guaranteed by the Basic Law (Article 27). The right of fair comment is a most important element in the freedom of speech.  In a society which greatly values the freedom of speech and safeguards it by a constitutional guarantee, it is right that the courts when considering and developing the common law should not adopt a narrow approach to the defence of fair comment. See Eastern Express Publisher Ltd v. Mo Man Ching (1999) 2 HKCFAR 264 at 278. The courts should adopt a generous approach so that the right of fair comment on matters of public interest is maintained in its full vigour.  14Costs  As Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead NPJ pointed out, the legal arguments on the issue of malice raised before the Court of Appeal and this Court were not raised before the judge. No argument was advanced before the judge that the motives particularised under head (3) and (4) would not in law defeat the defence of fair comment.   In the circumstances, I would make the following order nisi on costs (1) There be no order as to costs before the judge. (2) The respondent should pay the appellants' costs in the appeal to the Court of Appeal and this Court.  15Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead NPJ  This is an appeal in a defamation action. It raises an important point on the defence of fair comment. The title of this defence is misleading. Comment, or honest comment, would be a more satisfactory name. In this judgment I adhere, reluctantly, to the traditional terminology. .   16Fair commentthe objective limits (Fivefold)  In order to identify the point in issue I must first set out some non-controversial matters about the ingredients of this defence. These are well established. They are fivefold.   17Fair commentthe objective limits (Fivefold)  First, the comment must be on a matter of public interest. Public interest is not to be confined within narrow limits today see Lord Denning in London Artists Ltd v. Littler 1969 2 QB 375, 391.  Second, the comment must be recognisable as comment, as distinct from an imputation of fact. If the imputation is one of fact, a ground of defence must be sought elsewhere, for example, justification or privilege. Much learning has grown up around the distinction between fact and comment. For present purposes it is sufficient to note that a statement may be one or the other, depending on the context. Ferguson J gave a simple example in the New South Wales case of (1923) 2 Myerson v. Smith's Weekly 4 SR (NSW) 20, 26  "To say that a man's conduct was dishonourable is not comment, it is a statement of fact. To say that he did certain specific things and that his conduct was dishonourable is a statement of fact coupled with a comment".   18Fair commentthe objective limits (Fivefold)  Third, the comment must be based on facts which are true or protected by privilege  see, for instance, London Artists Ltd v. Littler 1969 2 QB 375, 395. If the facts on which the comment purports to be founded are not proved to be true or published on a privilege occasion, the defence of fair comment is not available.  Next, the comment must explicitly or implicitly indicate, at least in general terms, what are the facts on which the comment is being made. The reader or hearer should be in a position to judge for himself how far the comment was well founded.   19Fair commentthe objective limits (Fivefold)  Finally, the comment must be one which could have been made by an honest person, however prejudiced he might be, and however exaggerated or obstinate his views see Lord Porter in Turner v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures Ltd 1950 1 AER 449, 461, commenting on an observation of Lord Esher MR in Merivale v. Carson (1888) 20 QBD 275, 281. It must be germane to the subject matter criticised. Dislike of an artist's style would not justify an attack upon his morals or manners. But a critic need not be mealy-mouthed in denouncing what he disagrees with. He is entitled to dip his pen in gall for the purposes of legitimate criticism see Jordan CJ in Gardiner v. Fairfax (1942) 42 SR (NSW) 1 71, 174.  20Malice  The plaintiff may still defeat ('rebut') the defence by proving that when he made his comment the defendant was, in the time-hallowed expression, 'actuated by malice'.  In ordinary usage malice carries connotations of spite and ill-will. In legal usage malice sometimes bears its popular meaning, sometimes not. It is an imprecise term. Historically, even within the bounds of the law of defamation, malice has borne more than one meaning. Historically, defamation lay in publishing the words complained of 'falsely and maliciously'. In this context malice meant merely that publication had been a wrongful act, done intentionally and without lawful excuse see Bayley J in Bromage v. Prosser (1825) 4 BC 247, 255. This was sometimes called malice in law, as distinct from malice in fact. But even malice 'in fact', otherwise known as express malice or actual malice, may cover states of mind which are not malicious in the ordinary sense of the word. This is so in the context of the defence of qualified privilege. It is no wonder that Lord Bramwell described malice as 'that unfortunate word' see Abrath v. North Eastern Railway Co (1886) 11 App Cas 247, 253.  21Lord Nicholls  The defence of fair comment, which are objective, malice is subjective.  When making the defamatory comment the defendant acted dishonestly.  The law protects the freedom to express opinions, not vituperative make-believe.   22The legal issue on this appeal Whether, in contemplation of law, malice may exist in this context even when the defendant positively believed in the soundness of his comment.  Whether the purpose for which a defendant stated an honestly held opinion may deprive him of the protection of the defence of fair comment for instance, if his purpose was to inflict injury, as when a politician seeks to damage his political opponent, or if he was simply acting out of spite.  The meaning of malice has been comprehensively analysed in relation to the defence of qualified privilege, most notably in the speech of Lord Diplock in Horrocks v. Lowe 1975 AC 135.  Indeed, there has been surprisingly little judicial discussion of this subject over the last 150 years.  The (English) Report of the Committee on Defamation, published in 1975, stated that under the present state of the law a person was acting maliciously where he was dishonest or reckless 'or actuated by spite, ill-will, or any other indirect or improper motive' see para. 153. On this appeal the defendants challenged this view of the law.   23Motive  Honesty required that the defendants genuinely believed the comments they made. Anything less would not do. If they knew their comments were untrue, or were recklessly indifferent to the truth or falsity of their comments, they were acting dishonestly.  Proof of malice is the means whereby a plaintiff can defeat a defence of fair comment where a defendant is abusing the defence. Abuse consists of using the defence for a purpose other than that for which it exists. The purpose for which the defence of fair comment exists is to facilitate freedom of expression by commenting on matters of public interest. This accords with the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression. And it is in the public interest that everyone should be free to express his own, honestly held views on such matters, subject always to the safeguards provided by the objective limits mentioned above.  24Public Interest  The public interest in freedom to make comments within these limits is of particular importance in the social and political fields. Professor Fleming stated the matter thus in his invaluable book on The Law of Torts, 9th edition, p 648  ".. untrammelled discussion of public affairs and of those participating in them is a basic safeguard against irresponsible political power. The unfettered preservation of the right of fair comment is, therefore, one of the foundations supporting our standards of personal liberty."  The purpose and importance of the defence of fair comment are inconsistent with its scope being restricted to comments made for particular reasons or particular purposes, some being regarded as proper, others not. Especially in the social and political fields, those who make public comments usually have some objective of their own in mind, even if it is only to publicise and advance themselves. They often have what may be described as an 'ulterior' object.  25Public Interest  Liberty to make such comments, genuinely held, on matters of public interest lies at the heart of the defence of fair comment. That is the very object for which the defence exists. Commentators, of all shades of opinion, are entitled to 'have their own agenda'. Politicians, social reformers, busybodies, those with political or other ambitions and those with none, all can grind their axes. The defence of fair comment envisages that everyone is at liberty to conduct social and political campaigns by expressing his own views, subject always.  Nor is it for the courts to choose between 'public' and 'private' purposes, or between purposes they regard as morally or socially or politically desirable and those they regard as undesirable. That would be a highly dangerous course. That way lies censorship. That would defeat the purpose for which the law accords the defence of freedom to make comments on matters of public interest. The objective safeguards, coupled with the need to have a genuine belief in what is said, are adequate to keep the ambit of permissible comment within reasonable bounds.  26Spiteful comments  One particular motive calls for special mention spite or ill-will. This raises a difficult point. I confess that my first, instinctive reaction was that the defence of fair comment should not be capable of being used to protect a comment made with the intent of injuring another out of spite, even if the person who made the comment genuinely believed in the truth of what he said. Personal spite, after all, is four square within the popular meaning of malice. Elsewhere the law proscribes conduct of this character for instance, in the field of nuisance, as exemplified by the well known case of the householder who made noises on musical instruments with the intention of annoying his neighbour (Christie v. Davey 1893 1 Ch 316).  The comment is one which is based on fact it is made in circumstances where those to whom the comment is addressed can form their own view on whether or not the comment was sound and the comment is one which can be held by an honest person.  The spiteful publication of a defamatory statement of fact attracts no remedy if the statement is proved to be true.   27Case  Horrocks v. Lowe  The defence of qualified privilege    Lord Diplock's authoritative analysis of malice for the purposes of the defence of qualified privilege, with a view to seeing how far it is applicable to the defence of fair comment.    "Even a positive belief in the truth of what is published on a privileged occasion ... may not suffice to negative express malice if it can be proved that the defendant misused the occasion for some purpose other that that for which the privilege is accorded by the law. The commonest case is where the dominant motive which actuates the defendant is not a desire to perform the relevant duty or to protect the relevant interest, but to give vent to his personal spite or ill will towards the person he defames." P. 150  28Case  Horrocks v. Lowe  Lord Diplock continued by noting that there may be other improper motives which destroy the privilege. He instanced the case where a defendant's dominant motive may have been to obtain 'some private advantage unconnected with the duty or the interest which constitutes the reason for the privilege'.  Instances of misuse of qualified privilege may not be instances of misuse of fair comment.    The rationale of the defence of qualified privilege is the law's recognition that there are circumstances when there is a need, in the public interest, for a particular recipient to receive frank and uninhibited communication of particular information from a particular source see Reynolds v. Times Newspapers Ltd 1999 3 WLR 1010, 1017.    The rationale of the defence of fair comment is different, and is different in a material respect. It is not based on any notion of performance of a duty or protection of an interest.  29The fair comment cases  Merivale v. Carson (1888) 20 QBD 275  Thomas v. Bradbury, Agnew  Co Ltd 1906 2 KB 627  The position was similar in Slim v. Daily Telegraph Ltd 1968 2 QB 157, a decision of the Court of Appeal. The action arose from the publication in a newspaper of a letter which commented adversely on the conduct of a former town clerk. Lord Denning MR, at page 170, said that the writer must honestly express his real view 'so long as he does this, he has nothing to fear'.  Diplock J seems there to have regarded intention to injure or other ulterior motive as antithetical to honesty, on the footing that when a person is actuated by such a motive the view which he expresses will not be his genuine view. It is to be noted, however, that malice was not suggested in that case.   30The fair comment cases  Blackburn J, sitting in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, in Renouf v. Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Ltd (1977) ACTR 35.  Blackburn J noted that, unlike with the defence of qualified privilege, malice in the context of fair comment cannot simply be characterised as the abuse of a special legal relationship. Everything must turn on the state of mind of the person making the comment. Proof that the comment was motivated by a desire to embarrass or prejudice the plaintiff is not sufficient to constitute malice. It must be shown to have distorted the judgment of the defendant before it can avail the plaintiff.    31The fair comment cases  "If the plaintiff can show that the opinion represented by the comment was affected by personal hostility, or some such irrelevant motive in such a way that it does not represent a disinterested judgment upon the matter which is the subject of the comment, then the reply of malice succeeds notwithstanding that it is not proved that the comment was insincere - ie did not represent the defendant's real opinion. It seems to me that unless this is so, the law ignores the common human experience that personal animosity may perfectly consort with sincerity to produce a comment which is harmful and unfair".   32The fair comment cases  Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead NPJ disagrees with Blackburn Js   A comment which falls within the objective limits of the defence of fair comment can lose its immunity only by proof that the defendant did not genuinely hold the view he expressed. Honesty of belief is the touchstone. Actuation by spite, animosity, intent to injure, intent to arouse controversy or other motivation, whatever it may be, even if it is the dominant or sole motive, does not of itself defeat the defence. However, proof of such motivation may be evidence, sometimes compelling evidence, from which lack of genuine belief in the view expressed may be inferred. Proof of motivation may also be relevant on other issues in the action, such as damages.  The Chief Judge concluded that the summing up was in line with the rationale behind the defence and in accordance with the law as stated in Horrocks v. Lowe.   33Motives of comments 1.  The first motive they have pleaded is that they wanted to persuade Mr AU Wing-cheung to sue Select Tours.    2. To pressurise Select Tours into compensating Mr AU Wing-cheung.    3. To gratify their animosity against the plaintiff and/or Select Tours'     4. To belittle the efforts of the plaintiff in distinguishing the 1st defendant's efforts in assisting Mr AU  5. To raise a new controversy, and thereby arousing the publics interest in continuing to listen to the Teacup in a Storm programme.   34Motives of comments  Proof of malice is the means whereby a plaintiff can defeat a defence of fair comment where a defendant is abusing the defence. Abuse consists of using the defence for a purpose other than that for which it exists. The purpose for which the defence of fair comment exists is to facilitate freedom of expression by commenting on matters of public interest. This accords with the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression.  Commentators, of all shades of opinion, are entitled to have their own agenda. Politicians, social reformers, busybodies, those with political or other ambitions and those with none, all can grind their axes  Nor is it for the courts to choose between public and private purposes, or between purposes they regard as morally or socially or politically desirable and those they regard as undesirable. That would be a highly dangerous course. That way lies censorship.   35Motives of comments  The Cheng case caused a flurry of newspaper comment Some suggested that it ws unfair to plaintiffs. Others suggested that Lord Nicholls was somehow going too far in changing the common law, especially as an expatriate judge in Hong Kong. He did not, of course, do so alone, in fact the rest of the court unanimously supported him.  The Cheng case does not deal with the position where, for example, the statement is contained in a letter written to the press and the editor has no malice but the letter writer does. However, the current view of the meaning of fair will permit the paper to raise the defence if the statement could have been made by an honest person and they will only be defeated by their own malice and not that of the writer of the letter. (Jill Cottrell)  36Per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead NPJ  The freedom of speech was constitutionally guaranteed by art.27 of the Basic Law. The right of fair comment was a most important element in the freedom of speech and when considering the right the courts should adopt a generous approach, so that the right was maintained in its full vigour (Eastern Express Publisher Ltd  Another v Mo Man Ching Another (1999) 2 HKCFAR264 applied). (seep.422F-H.)   The common law of England and Hong Kong recognizes a fair comment defence to defamation actions. The accepted core of this defence is the right of any person to comment on matters of public concern, provided that the comment is based on identifiable and true (or privileged) statements of fact.  Hong Kong residents shall have freedom of speech, of the press and of publication freedom of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration and the right and freedom to form and join trade unions, and to strike. (Article 27, Basic Law)    37Critiques  1. This is a radical departure from the law as it stood before  2. It was formulated by a judge with no roots in and no  understanding of Hong Kong, and no accountability to the  Hong Kong people  3. That is, for these reasons, inappropriate for Hong Kong.  4. It tilts the balance too far, especially in non-political contexts,  against private rights.  Points 1-3 are taken from the remarks of Ma Lik, a Hong Kong member of the National Peoples Congress.  Point 4 is taken from an article by Shiu Sin-Por, Executive Director of One Country, Two Systems Research Institute.    38Jill Cottrell I favour that decision and hope hat it will be adopted in other common law jurisdictions.  I recognise that the price may be that the feelings of some individuals will be hurt.  It is not a pleasant experience to have ones actions, motives and morals publicly commented on, even if it is clear that the statement is a comment.  However, in modern literate societies, freedom of speech on matters of public interest is something which can only enhance the informed involvement of citizens in public affairs.  It represents a natural development of law, not a radical departure.  (Jill Cottrell, Fair comment, Judges and Politics in Hong Kong)   .

About Wing Chun Kung Fu



Wing Chun Kung-Fu (a.k.a Ving Tsun, Wing Tsun, etc) is considered the world's most technically advanced and devastating form of hand-to-hand combat. It is the original mixed-martial art of ancient China. Called the "sawed-off shotgun" of the martial arts world, it can be learned very quickly and is designed specifically to defeat other martial arts as well as stronger, bigger, and faster opponents. Here you will find the largest selection of Wing Chun products in the world. Click to learn more, or start shopping by clicking a link above.
				



Wing Chun is a Chinese style of Kung-Fu that was made famous by students of Grandmaster Yip Man (Ip Man), such as Bruce Lee, 					William Cheung, and Wong Shun Leung. The art came to prominence due to Ip Man's students winning a large number of challenge matches (beimo) against kung-fu masters and Muay-Thai fighters in the 1950's and 60's. Ip Man stated that if one of his students lost a fight after learning the second Wing Chun form, he would jump off the roof of a building. Since then Wing Chun has become one of the most practiced Martial Arts in the world. It focuses on simple, direct, efficient, and simultaneous attacks and defenses.
				

																									You will notice that 					
					Wing Chun varies greatly from person to person (or from lineage to lineage), even though many people all trained under Ip Man. This is due to the way Ip Man taught at different stages of his life, the understanding of the student, and the personal interpretations and changes by the student over time. Wing Chun is a kung-fu style based on theory rather than technique, and thus very customizable to the individual practitioner. There are also some 					Non-Yip Man lineages of Wing Chun that are very good.
				




The System's Components


					The main empty-hand forms inWing Chun are Sil Lum Tao (Little Idea Form), Chum Kiu (Searching Bridge), and Biu Jee (Shooting Fingers). There is also the extremely famous Wing Chun Wooden Dummy (Mook Yan Jong), and the Wing Chun weapons forms for the Butterfly Swords (Bart Jaam Do) and Long Pole (Luk Dim Boon Kwan, or dragon pole). Wing Chun also has a tripodal form (for kicks). A few lineages use the training rings (rattan rings, iron rings) and there are many other minor components that vary throughout the different lineages.


Wing Chun is also known for its Chi Sao sensitivity drill, also known as "sticky hands", and lesser known Chi Gerk (or "sticky legs") which enable the practitioner to fight by the sense of touch alone and cover his or her openings while striking the opponent. You will often see this demonstrated with one practitioner wearing a blindfold and fighting "blind". You will also find conditioning, Iron Palm Training, and Mui Fa Jong (Plum Flower Post) and footwork training in many Wing Chun lineages as well.
				
Books and DVD videos are available on all of these major components of the system as well as wing chun techniques, 	sparring/fighting, self-defense, history, philosophy, theory, drills, ground fighting and more. We have any training equipment and weapons you might need to practice this incredible martial art and a variety of other merchandise including dit-da-jow, (healing liniments), artwork,  collectibles, and our famous wall bags for increasing your punching power. Lastly, we carry home study programs if you don't have a school nearby... but if you want to learn everything you can online, courses at the Wing Chun University teach the entire system and all its components.




About the Different Spellings of 
				Wing Chun


					You will notice that the name of the art is spelled many different ways ( 					
					Wing Chun, Ving Tsun, Weng Chun, Wing Tsun, Wing Tsjun, Wing Tzun, Wing Tjun, Vinh Xuan, etc). The original spelling was Wing Chun (and this is still the most common spelling used across all lineages). This was later supposedly changed to Ving Tsun due to the fact that the British that were occupying Hong Kong were making fun of the initials WC, which refers to "Water Closet" or a bathroom. The spelling was supposed suggested by Wong Shun Leung or Yip Man. The Ving Tsun Athletic Association in Hong Kong, which was established in 1967, was the first to use this spelling.
				


By using different spellings, organizations and schools generally want to indicate that they have a certain trademarked version of the system. Wing Tsun was Leung Ting's way of trademarking his style of the art, and Wing Tjun, Wing Tsjun, Wing Tzun, etc are all students of that lineage that broke away and still teach. Weng Chun is an older lineage of the art taught in China, and Vinh Xuan is the Vietnamese lineage. "Traditional Wing Chun" is William Chung's trademarked version of the art."Applied Wing Chun" is Duncan Leung's trademarked version of the art.
Although the spellings above reflect different 	Wing Chun lineages much of the spelling differences within the system itself are simply due to a lack of standardization in the romanization of the Chinese words. The Chinese writing consists only of symbols. The different spellings have arisen by translating the consonance of the Chinese character to a Western phonetical alphabet.
