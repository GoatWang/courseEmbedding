(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. This section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statement because of various factors, including those described in the section titled "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in Part I of this Quarterly Report. Introductory Note and Corporate Overview  C&J Energy Services Ltd. is a Bermuda exempt company listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "CJES." Effective as of March 24, 2015, we completed the combination of C&J Energy Services, Inc. ("Legacy C&J") with the completion and production services business (the "C&P Business") of Nabors Industries Ltd. ("Nabors") pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of June 25, 2014, by and among Legacy C&J, Nabors, Nabors Red Lion Limited (subsequently renamed C&J Energy Services Ltd., "New C&J"), Nabors CJ Merger Co. and CJ Holding Co. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Nabors separated the C&P Business from the rest of its operations and consolidated this business under New C&J. A Delaware subsidiary of New C&J then merged with and into Legacy C&J, with Legacy C&J continuing as the surviving corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of New C&J (such transactions referred to collectively as the "Merger"). Effective upon closing of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), shares of common stock of Legacy C&J were converted into common shares of New C&J on a 1-for-1 basis, New C&J was renamed "C&J Energy Services Ltd." and its common shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "CJES," which was previously used by Legacy C&J following completion of our initial public offering in 2011. After giving effect to the Merger, Nabors owned approximately 53% of our outstanding common shares, with Legacy C&J shareholders owning the remaining 47% of our outstanding common shares. As of May 6, 2016, Nabors owns approximately 52% of our outstanding common shares. We are led primarily by the individuals who served as Legacy C&J's executive officers prior to the Merger. Pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act, following the closing of the Merger, New C&J is the successor issuer to Legacy C&J and is deemed to succeed to Legacy C&J's reporting history under the Exchange Act. Because Legacy C&J was considered the accounting acquirer in the Merger under U.S generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"), Legacy C&J is also considered the accounting predecessor of C&J Energy Services Ltd.  -32- Table of Contents  which is focused on strengthening, expanding and diversifying our business through (1) the growth of our assets, customer base and geographic reach, both domestically and internationally, for our core service lines and (2) strategic initiatives advancing service line diversification, vertical integration and technological advancement.  Over the last several years we have also significantly invested in our research and technology capabilities, including the development of a state-of-the-art research and technology center with a team of engineers and support staff. We believe that one of the strategic benefits of this division is the ability to develop and implement new technologies and respond to changes in customer requirements and industry demand. Our efforts to date have been focused on developing innovative, fit-for-purpose solutions designed to enhance our core service offerings, increase completion efficiencies, provide cost savings to our operations and add value for our customers. Several of our research and technology initiatives are now generating monthly cost savings for our expanded, integrated completion services operations, which is central to our overall strategy of proactively managing our costs to maximize returns. Additionally, several of these investments are delivering value-added products and services that, in addition to producing revenue, are generating demand from key customers. We believe these capabilities can provide a competitive advantage as customers look for innovative means for extracting oil and gas in the most economical and efficient way possible. That said, as with our other service lines and divisions, we have been forced to implement meaningful cost reductions that negatively impact our research and technology initiatives, including significantly scaling back or delaying certain projects.  Recent Developments  Temporary Limited Waiver under Credit Agreement  We were not in compliance with the Minimum Cumulative Consolidated EBITDA Covenant required to be tested as of March 31, 2016 under the Amended Credit Agreement governing our Credit Facilities, which is considered an event of default with respect to the Credit Agreement. We have obtained a temporary limited waiver agreement from certain of the lenders in respect of this covenant violation effective from March 31, 2016 through May 31, 2016, wherein such lenders have agreed not to consider the covenant violation an event of default through May 31, 2016. We are actively negotiating with the  -33- Table of Contents  lenders to resolve this matter, including with respect to alternatives to our current capital structure. If this temporary limited waiver agreement is not extended, the lenders holding more than 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Revolver and the Five-Year Term Loans may take certain actions, including terminating the revolving commitments, declaring the unpaid principal amount of the Revolver and the Five Year Term Loans immediately due and payable, requiring letters of credit to be cash collateralized, and exercising other rights and remedies available under the Amended Credit Agreement. The lenders holding more than 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Seven-Year Term Loans could take similar actions with respect to the Seven-Year Term Loans, but only after the termination and acceleration of the Revolver and Five-Year Term Loans.  While we are optimistic that ongoing negotiations with lenders will lead to satisfactory resolution of these issues, we cannot provide any assurance that these negotiations will be successful, and we are also exploring available financing and restructuring options. If we are unable to find acceptable alternatives to our current capital structure, or if we are unable to finance our operations on acceptable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.  The foregoing description of the waiver agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the waiver agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Quarterly Report and is incorporated herein by reference. Please also see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Description of our Credit Agreement" in this Part I, Item 2 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for the definitions of the capitalized terms used herein and a more detailed discussion of our Credit Agreement, including the covenant violation resulting in an event of default noted above. For additional discussion of the known, material risks associated with our ongoing negotiations with the lenders regarding available financing and restructuring options, please see "Risk Factors" in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report, as well as "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report.  Going Concern Uncertainty  Low utilization and pricing levels due to the ongoing industry downturn materially and negatively impacted our operational and financial performance, resulting in a net loss of $872.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and a net loss of $428.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Given these financial results and the inability to comply with the Minimum Cumulative Consolidated EBITDA Covenant under our Credit Agreement described herein under " - Temporary Limited Waiver under Credit Agreement," there is substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. For additional information, please see "Risk Factors" in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report, as well as "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report.  C&J Energy Services 2016 Performance Incentive Compensation Plan and Key Employee Incentive Plan  Effective May 5, 2016, our Board of Directors (the "Board") approved the terms of the C&J Energy Services 2016 Senior Executive Incentive Plan (the "SEIP Plan") and the C&J Energy Services 2016 Key Employee Incentive Plan (the "KEIP Plan" and, together with the SEIP Plan, the "Incentive Plans"). The Incentive Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board.  Pursuant to the terms of the SEIP Plan, our named executive officers and certain other executive officers will be eligible to receive performance-based cash awards on a quarterly basis. A participant's target award opportunity under the SEIP Plan is equal to 50 to 100% of the participant's year-end cash bonus target, plus 25 to 50% of the participant's annual long-term incentive target and, depending on the level of achievement of performance goals, a participant's final award may be as little as zero or as much as 150% of the target award opportunity. Awards are earned under the SEIP Plan based on the Company's achievement during each calendar quarter in 2016 of performance goals related to the Company's EBITDA, defined as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, weighted at 80%, and the Company's total recordable injury rate, weighted at 20%. The Compensation Committee determines the achievement of the performance goals after the end of each calendar quarter, and, to the extent earned for a quarter, a participant's award under the SEIP Plan is paid in a lump sum in cash soon after the end of the calendar quarter. A SEIP Plan participant will forfeit any unpaid portions of an award granted under the SEIP Plan upon termination of the participant's employment. Awards granted under the SEIP Plan are intended to be in lieu of any annual cash incentive bonus awards and annual long-term equity incentive award that the participant might be eligible and/or entitled to receive, and such are specifically deemed to be an annual cash incentive bonus award and an annual long-term equity incentive award that the participant might be eligible and/or entitled to receive for purposes of any employment agreement between the Company and the participant.  -34- Table of Contents  Pursuant to the terms of the KEIP Plan, certain key employees not participating in the SEIP Plan will be eligible to receive cash awards on a quarterly basis, subject only to employment on the date such payments are made. Awards granted under the KEIP Plan are intended to be in lieu of any annual cash incentive bonus awards and annual long-term equity incentive award that the participant might be eligible and/or entitled to receive, and such are specifically deemed to be an annual cash incentive bonus award and an annual long-term equity incentive award that the participant might be eligible and/or entitled to receive for purposes of any employment agreement between the Company and the participant.  The foregoing descriptions of the Incentive Plans are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full texts of such Incentive Plans, copies of which are filed as Exhibit 10.2 and Exhibit 10.3, respectively, to this Quarterly Report and are incorporated herein by reference.  Changes in Management  On March 11, 2016, our founder and former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Josh Comstock, died unexpectedly and the Board appointed Randall McMullen, Jr. as Chief Executive Officer effective immediately. Mr. McMullen has also continued performing his duties as the Company's President and Chief Financial Officer and continues to serve as a member of the Board.  In connection with the succession evaluation following the death of Mr. Comstock, the Board decided to separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the Company's bye-laws, the Chairman of the Board may be appointed and removed only by the unanimous approval of the independent directors. The Board has not yet designated a successor to act as Chairman of the Board and will do so in due course.  Operating Segments  Our Completion Services segment consists of over 1.2 million hydraulic horsepower, over 130 wireline units and over 40 coiled tubing units, having significantly increased our asset base as a result of the Merger. However, not all of these assets are utilized fully or at all at any given time, due to, among other things, scheduled maintenance and downtime. Additionally, in response to the continued deterioration in market conditions over the course of 2015 and through the first quarter of 2016, we implemented aggressive cost control measures and aligned our assets with industry demand, which included stacking or idling unproductive equipment across our asset base within each service line.  -35- Table of Contents  Management evaluates our Completion Services segment's operational performance and allocates resources primarily based on Adjusted EBITDA because it provides important information to us about the activity and profitability of our lines of business within this segment. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure computed as total earnings (loss) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, other income (expense), net, net gain or loss on disposal of assets, acquisition-related costs, and non-routine items.  First quarter 2016 revenue from our Completion Services segment was $162.5 million, representing approximately 60.3% of our total revenue, with Adjusted EBITDA of $(9.2) million; compared to $256.6 million of revenue and $10.0 million of Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2015, and $371.0 million of revenue and $49.8 million of Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2015.  Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA from our Completion Services segment for the first quarter of 2016 were negatively impacted by lower overall utilization and pricing levels. As we progressed through the first quarter, we experienced a significant decline in activity and pricing across our service lines and operating areas as crude oil prices decreased and the drilling rig count continued to fall. As utilization fell, we strategically stacked additional equipment, closed unprofitable facilities, reduced head count and aggressively cut costs in order to further lower our operational cost structure. Specifically in our hydraulic fracturing division, key customers in core basins delayed or canceled previously scheduled work, and several of our largest competitors drove pricing below breakeven levels in order to protect or grow market share. We continued to work with specific customers in core basins in order to maintain market share and position the Company to maintain a strategic position for growth once the market begins to recover. In most cases, as utilization fell and margins declined, we made the decision to stack an additional 30% of our working hydraulic horsepower. In both our coiled tubing and wireline divisions, we experienced decreases in utilization and aggressive price competition, which forced us to continue rightsizing those businesses by stacking more equipment and further reducing head count in order to protect margin and limit reductions in profitability.  Moving into the second quarter, our Completion Services segment has continued to face significant challenges, despite the fact that overall activity levels modestly improved entering April from the lows experienced during the first quarter as customers finalized their capital budgets after a substantial pullback in the first quarter due to falling oil prices. However, in our hydraulic fracturing business, we continue to struggle to maintain utilization in the highly competitive environment with irrational, unsustainable pricing. There also continues to be an extreme lack of visibility with regard to near-term market conditions, but we believe that our cost cutting efforts have appropriately rightsized the business for the conditions expected in the second quarter. Our primary focus continues to be to meet the needs of our customers in the most cost efficient way possible, which will best position the Company for future growth in connection with any market recovery. Well Support Services  Our Well Support Services segment, which was acquired in the Merger as part of the C&P Business, consists of the following service lines: (1) rig services, including providing workover and well servicing rigs that are involved in routine repair and maintenance, completions, re-drilling and plug and abandonment operations; (2) fluid management services, including manufacturing, transportation, storage and disposal services for fluids used in the drilling, completion and workover of oil and gas well; and (3) other special well site services. Our rig services line is the greatest driver of revenue for this segment.  Our Well Support Services segment consists of 500 workover rigs utilized by the rig services line and a fleet of 1,452 fluid services trucks, 5,227 frac tanks and 29 salt water disposal wells utilized by our fluid management services line. However, not all of these assets are utilized fully or at all at any given time, due to, among other things, scheduled maintenance and downtime. Additionally, in response to the continued deterioration in market conditions over the course of the year, we implemented aggressive cost control measures and aligned our assets with industry demand, which included stacking or idling unproductive equipment across our asset base within each service line.  Management evaluates our Well Support Services segment operations' performance and allocates resources primarily based on activity levels, specifically rig and trucking hours, as well as Adjusted EBITDA. The following table presents rig and trucking hours, along with Adjusted EBITDA, for our Well Support Services segment for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (dollars in millions):  -36- Table of Contents   Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Revenue $ 95.5 $ 135.7 Adjusted EBITDA $ 5.0 $ 22.3 Total rigs 500 519 Total rig hours 105,120 148,187 Total trucks 1,452 1,425 Total truck hours 382,357 481,901  As with our Completion Services segment, results from our Well Support Services segment were negatively impacted by lower utilization and more competitive pricing across all service lines and operational markets. We experienced unprecedented levels of customer slowdown due to falling oil prices that . . .  May 10, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

C&J Energy Services, Ltd.'s Stock Slumps on Earnings Miss
The oil-field services company is working through an action plan to improve its performance.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Nov 5, 2015 at 1:30PM
            
            






What: Shares of C&J Energy Services (NYSE:CJES) were hit hard on Thursday after it reported disappointing third-quarter results. The company missed analysts' estimates, reporting a wider-than-expected loss. 
So what: For the quarter, C&J Energy Services reported an adjusted loss of $76.5 million, or $0.65 per share, which was $0.02 per share more than the consensus estimate. Meanwhile, revenue of $427.5 million was a few million dollars weaker than analysts were expecting. 
The company's stumbles can be directly attributed to "another extremely challenging quarter," according to CEO Josh Comstock, that was caused by "the sustained weakness and volatility in oil prices." In particular, the company's Completion Service segment was weak after a decline in activity levels was coupled with increased pricing pressure. Furthermore, its hydraulic fracturing services were deeply affected by two "atypical events," according to Comstock. First, it aggressively reduced pricing with one of its most active customers to maintain that relationship, resulting in weaker margins. Second, it changed to an alternative lubricant to reduce costs, but the product didn't perform to expectations. This, along with fluids that had metallurgical issues, caused failures and damaged parts. Because of these issues it was no surprise to see Comstock say that he was "disappointed" with the company's results.
It is worth noting, however, that C&J Energy Services' results contrasted starkly with those of its much larger peers, especially Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL). In fact, Halliburton President Jeff Miller said that he was "pleased" with the company's results. This was after Halliburton outperformed most of its peer group, including its largest rival, by delivering better revenue and margins on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Furthermore, because of its scale and diversification, Halliburton has been in a much better position to weather the downturn than a niche oil-field service company like C&J Energy Services. 
Now what: Clearly, C&J Energy Services has some work to do to resolve its issues. It has already instituted a detailed action plan to enhance profitability, and Comstock noted that the initial results are positive. That has him confident that the fourth quarter will show some financial improvements. That said, the company could continue to struggle in 2016 if industry conditions don't improve.

Hamilton, Bermuda-based C&J drills wells and provides related services, and the filing comes four months after founder and Chief Executive Officer Josh Comstock died unexpectedly at age 46. C&J joins more than 100 energy producers and service companies that have filed for bankruptcy in the past two years after a debt-funded boom turned to bust when oil prices collapsed. The company filed for bankruptcy in Houston to implement an agreement reached with lenders who hold 83 percent of its credit facility debt, according to a company statement. Under a previously disclosed plan, lenders will receive all the stock in a reorganized C&J, subject to dilution for management incentive awards.  Lenders will backstop a rights offering for up to $200 million in stock in the reorganized company and provide a $100 million loan, which will increase its liquidity, according to the plan. The lenders include Ascribe Capital, Blue Mountain Capital Management, GSO Capital Partners, Silver Point Capital, Solus Alternative Asset Management and Symphony Asset Management, according to securities filings. Equity holders will receive seven-year warrants that are convertible into 6 percent of the stock in the reorganized company, with a strike price of $1.55 billion, according to securities filings. The plan is subject to court approval. C&J said it expects to emerge from bankruptcy within six months. Most of the publicly traded energy-related companies that have filed for bankruptcy in the current commodity downturn have been exploration and production.   Bankrupt publicly traded service companies include CHC Group Ltd 61C1.MU, which provides helicopter flights for the energy sector, and offshore drilling providers Vantage Drilling Co (VTGDF.PK) and Hercules Offshore Inc HEROQ.PK, which filed twice in less than a year.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.
