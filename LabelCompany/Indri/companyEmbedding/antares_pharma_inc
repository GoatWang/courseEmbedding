News Detail


Date : 2002-01-08Companies : Antares Pharma, Inc., ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Antares Pharma, Inc., Licenses Rights To Hormone Product To Biosante Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
Antares Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANTR) ) today announced a license  agreement with BioSante Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (OTCBB: BTPH) in which  BioSante licensed from Antares Pharma development and marketing rights  to a hormone replacement gel for use by women. The product is a  transdermal gel hormone replacement product initially to be developed  for the treatment of female sexual dysfunction (FSD).  The  product is an estradiol/testosterone combination gel, based on Antares  Pharma's Combi Gel™ technology. The product is a gel formulation of  estradiol and testosterone being developed for the treatment of female  sexual dysfunction (FSD) caused by depressed hormone levels in  postmenopausal women and is designed to be quickly absorbed through the  skin after application on the arms, shoulders, thighs or abdomen. The  gel is designed to deliver both hormones to the blood stream evenly over  24 hours from a cosmetically elegant, non-invasive system.   BioSante acquired exclusive marketing rights, with the right to grant  sub-licenses, for the combination estradiol and testosterone Combi Gel™  in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Israel, Australia, New Zealand,  Malaysia, China, Indonesia and South Africa (the "Territory"). Antares  Pharma will receive milestone payments and, once regulatory approval to  market is received and sales have commenced, royalties on sales of the  products in the whole Territory. BioSante will fund the development  programs for the product.   "This is a significant expansion of  our hormonal product relationship with BioSante, as well as another  validation of Antares Pharma's unique transdermal gel technology. We are  delighted to enhance our collaboration with BioSante," said Dr. Roger  G. Harrison, president and chief executive officer of Antares Pharma.  "We are pleased to sign this additional license with Antares Pharma.  The combination estradiol/testosterone gel brings to five the number of  hormone replacement gels we will have in human clinical development,"  said Stephen M. Simes, president and chief executive officer of  BioSante. "We look forward to a long and fruitful relationship with  Antares Pharma."  Bioinnovators, Inc., a pharmaceutical industry  consulting group, estimates that within five years the market for  testosterone products for women will exceed $600 million. According to a  1999 University of Chicago study, 43% of American women (about 40  million) experience some degree of impaired sexual function. The  majority of women with FSD are postmenopausal, experiencing FSD due to  hormonal changes following menopause, whether natural or surgical.  About Antares Pharma Antares Pharma develops and markets innovative and effective  pharmaceutical delivery solutions, including needle-free and mini-needle  injector systems, gel technologies and transdermal products. These  delivery systems improve both the efficiency of drug therapies and the  patient's quality of life. The Company currently distributes its  needle-free injector systems for the delivery of insulin and growth  hormone in more than 20 countries and an estradiol transdermal patch for  hormone replacement therapy. In addition, Antares Pharma has five  products under development and is conducting ongoing research to create  new products that combine various elements of the Company's technology  portfolio. Antares Pharma has corporate headquarters in Exton,  Pennsylvania, with research facilities in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and  Basel, Switzerland.  About BioSante Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  BioSante is an emerging pharmaceutical company developing a robust  pipeline of hormone replacement products to treat hormone deficiencies  in men and women. BioSante also is developing its nanoparticulate-based  platform technology (CAP) for novel vaccines, vaccine adjuvants and drug  delivery systems.   Statements included in this press release  that are not historical in nature are "forward-looking statements"  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of  1995. These statements include those related to: the acceptance of  Antares Pharma's product offerings by drug development companies; the  ability to develop a gel-based carrier for the injector systems;  continued sales of products currently on the market; and the successful  development, approval, and commercialization of products and  technologies in the pipeline. The Company cautions readers that  forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and  uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially.  Such risks and uncertainties include: lack of acceptance of the  Company's product offerings by drug development companies; inability to  extend patent expiration deadlines; competition for serving the market  for protein-based drugs; failure of products in clinical trials;  decreased sales of the Company's currently marketed products; and other  risks and factors identified from time to time in the Company's reports  filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Antares Pharma  claims the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements  contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

PhRMA’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care, improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies. In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
