Michael J. Bevan

































Michael J. Bevan

















Houston native Michael J. Bevan was once described by his grandmother as "pretty funny". He carries the weight of that title with him every day. When his childhood goal of being a household cat didn't pan out, he developed a more realistic dream of being an actor. He recently graduated from NYU Tisch where he learned that the Dollar Pizza on 6th and Waverly is by far the best one in Manhattan. He is currently working and residing in New York City.

 Like a slow motion scene from a tragedy I see the paramedics administering CPR to you as you lay on your livingroom floor...silent, motionless. The most courageous man I have ever known.  As my heart shattered into a million tiny pieces in that one moment all time stood still and I knew I could never be the same. Who will hold me when I cry and tell me that everything will be alright? Who will catch me when I fall down these troubling steps of life?   My daddy, my hero, my inspiration, the Lord took you in the blink of an eye. Just know that you have shown me the greatest love of all, the love of a father to his baby girl.   Daddy, I will always be your baby and while you're up there watching over me just know that I will be alright, for you.Your daughter,Tammy Lynn
