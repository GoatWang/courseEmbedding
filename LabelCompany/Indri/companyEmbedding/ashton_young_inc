Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Credit One Bank® Platinum Visa®


                                            Expensive. Off shore call center and a pain to close. Even after I had built my credit and other cards were  lowering my rates and fees, Credit One did not and it is next to impossible to talk to their obviously Indian call center employees. Hire Americans.

                                            This place is a joke. Customer service agents are unprofessional and inexperienced, can barely form a sentence in a comprehensive manor.

Stage Stores Credit Card


                                            I was charged fees then late fees then fees. So $28.22 balance appeared out of thin air without any purchase. I moved while opening the credit card account so I did not receive statements on time (or maybe they did not send it to me). Called and got $17 back. As for the rest, I...show more

Amazon.com Store Card


                                            IF I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO I WOULD! Amazon/Synchrony Bank will cut your limit out of no where, even when making monthly payments. I've spent almost a year trying to pay off a card THEY maxed out and now they have sent to collections AS IM PAYING IT! DO NOT APPLY FOR THIS CARD!
