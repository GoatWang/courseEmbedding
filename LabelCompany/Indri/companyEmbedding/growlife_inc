The Recognized Leader in Hydroponic Equipment and Supplies












GrowLife, Inc. is a nationally recognized cultivation brand, providing world-class hydroponic equipment, lighting, nutrients, media, and other cultivation supplies to commercial and urban operations. With a complete selection of cultivation products combined with logistics and distribution services, GrowLife can help responsible cultivation operations efficiently control supply costs, manage build-out investments, track supply usage and streamline workflows.




Introducing GrowLife Cube, Annual Subscription Supplies Service   
Urban Farming Program to Expand Indoor Growing Community




SEATTLE, Wash.–(BUSINESS WIRE)—June 22, 2016 — GrowLife, Inc. (OTCBB: PHOT), one of the nation’s most recognized indoor cultivation service providers, today announced GrowLife Cube, a new subscription service for emerging indoor growers.
GrowLife will service the demand from aspirational indoor cultivators in many states, from first-time growers to those entrepreneurs seeking to scale-up and become professional cultivators. GrowLife Cube, found at Greners.com, is a complete indoor growing subscription service that provides an ecologically friendly environment with indoor growing equipment packages starting at $499 and monthly supplies and consulting services to help bring crops to harvest. For a limited time, the introductory Micro Starter Package includes 12 months of supplies at no extra charge. Each month the subscriber will receive the necessary supplies to keep their crop on track.
GrowLife Cube is designed to affordably help new growers get started and yield several indoor crops in their first year, whether in an apartment, basement or garage. “There is great demand for developing indoor cultivation skills. Although some scattered information can be found, there are few complete and affordable growing solutions, such as GrowLife Cube, which include hydroponic techniques that are ecologically sound, start-up equipment and regular supplies to support production from amateur to professional growers,” stated Marco Hegyi, GrowLife’s President and CEO. “GrowLife is constantly receiving requests from customers to help them utilize innovative indoor growing equipment and supplies. Thus, GrowLife is now helping to develop an even greater community of urban farmers.”
GrowLife continues to support its commercial cultivators through its direct, e-commerce and retail sales channels. “GrowLife serves large, sophisticated indoor cultivation operations in states such as Colorado, Washington and California,” added Joe Barnes, GrowLife’s SVP of Business Development. “But, the grow-it-yourself (GIY) and licensed caregiver growers in dozens of states do not have the resources or access to the necessary supplies and support to develop high-quality indoor growing skills.” GrowLife Cube is configured to produce different sized crops, from 1 pound to Professional 2.5 pounds for each light. A new Micro Starter Package at $499 is specially designed for micro-greens, developing indoor growing skills and includes all the necessary equipment and supplies for the first year. More details may be found at www.greners.com.
Our shareholders and others interested in GrowLife can stay informed by using the SEC website, join me on Twitter @marcohegyi and the Medium @hegyi blog.

GrowLife Secures Additional Financing
July 16, 2015 18:16
The Company received an initial funding tranche of $700,000 on July 9, 2015 to grow profitability and fund steps to full regulatory compliance.
SEATTLE, Wash.–(BUSINESS WIRE)– July 16, 2015 — GrowLife, Inc. (PHOT), one of the largest cultivation service providers in the nation, announced today a closing of up to $3,000,000 in financing from a single institutional accredited investor with an initial tranche of $700,000 in financing funded on July 9, 2015.
The Company entered into and closed a Securities Purchase Agreement and related agreements dated July 9, 2015 (the “Transaction Documents”) with an accredited investor (the “Purchaser”) whereby the Company agreed to sell up to $3,000,000 of senior secured, convertible, redeemable debentures to the Purchaser, of which $700,000 was purchased and funded on July 9, 2015.
The Company plans to immediately deploy much of the capital into revenue-generating product initiatives while also earmarking a portion of the proceeds to target getting current in its reporting obligations with the SEC and using our best efforts to secure listing on the OTCQB within ninety (90) days of closing of the financing.
“The GrowLife team remains focused on reaching its goal to get current in its SEC reporting, achieve re-listing on the OTC Markets to enhance liquidity and build shareholder value with this additional financing,” said Marco Hegyi, CEO of GrowLife, Inc. Mr. Hegyi added, “Everyone has worked hard to secure financing on reasonable terms during this period to get GrowLife back on track. Much of this funding will be applied to enhance revenue and reach profitability.”
Further details in regards to the financing can be found in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on July 16, 2015.

GrowLife Announced Revenues of $2.1 Million for Third Quarter Ending September 30, 2014
November 20, 2014 12:15
SEATTLE–(Business Wire)–GrowLife, Inc. (OTC:PHOT), one of the largest cultivation service providers in the nation, reported today in its latest financial statement revenues of $2.1 million for the third quarter ending on September 30, 2014. GrowLife also reported gross margins were (8.5%), resulting from the Company’s decision to convert its high inventory level of $1.8 million from last quarter to working capital and reduce ending inventory at $800,000. General and administrative expenses were $1.9 million for the quarter, which included approximately $1.1 million in non-cash stock expenses.
 
“Our third quarter revenues delivered an impressive 60 percent growth compared to this time last year, which is when we first recognized revenue from major retail acquisition that occurred in June 2013,” said Marco Hegyi, President of GrowLife, Inc. “As we continue to work through challenges such as limited access to capital due to gray market trading and lawsuits, which are in negotiations, we elected to convert about three month’s of inventory into cash while optimizing sales.”
Mr. Hegyi, who assumed leadership over the Company in the second quarter 2014, has reduced operational expenses while increasing revenue. The Company has achieved record revenue of $6.7 million in the first nine months of 2014 over last year’s $2.9 million, representing 131% growth.
“Our solid revenue is attributed to customers and management who have remained confident in our future,” said Hegyi. “The Company’s growth is now moving closer to critical mass, where gross profit will offset expenses, and move us towards profitability.”
Noteworthy details from today’s extensive quarterly report are as follows:
Q3 2014 Highlights

Net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2014 increased $792,000 to $2,105,000 as compared to $1,313,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2013.
Gross margin was $(179,000) as compared to $262,000 for the three months September 30, 2013.
The gross margin was (8.5%) for the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to 19.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2013. The decrease was due to selling our products at a higher discount and the liquidation of inventory at lower margins during the three months ended September 30, 2014.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2014 increased $633,000 to $1,923,000 as compared to $1,290,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2013. Non-cash general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2014 totaled $1,062,000.
Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2014 was $35,664,000 as compared to other expense of $777,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2013.

Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2014 was $37,766,000 as compared to a net loss of $1,805,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2013 for the reasons discussed above.
Our cash used in operations for the three months ended September 30, 2014 was $411,000.

YTD 2014 Highlights

Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased $3,806,000 to $6,745,000 as compared to $2,939,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013.
Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased $3,654,000 to $5,903,000 as compared to $2,249,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013.
Gross margin was $842,000 as compared to $690,000 for the nine months September 30, 2013. The gross margin was 12.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to 23.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2013.
General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased $3,138,000 to $6,684,000 as compared to $3,546,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Non-cash general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 totaled $3,359,000.
Our cash used in operations for the nine months ending on September 30, 2014 was $1,979,000.

GrowLife implemented additional changes to its business operations that were reflected in the third quarter, such as payroll, rent and other expense reductions, comprehensive market coverage, and the consolidation of disparate business divisions. These critical changes should be more apparent in the three months ended December 31, 2014.

      uplisting on the OTCQB to further these goals.”
    

      Mr. Hegyi continued, “I am grateful to our shareholders, investors and 
      partners who have stood by us during this challenging time. We will

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

GrowLife Announced Revenues of $2.1 Million for Third Quarter Ending September 30, 2014
November 20, 2014 12:15
SEATTLE–(Business Wire)–GrowLife, Inc. (OTC:PHOT), one of the largest cultivation service providers in the nation, reported today in its latest financial statement revenues of $2.1 million for the third quarter ending on September 30, 2014. GrowLife also reported gross margins were (8.5%), resulting from the Company’s decision to convert its high inventory level of $1.8 million from last quarter to working capital and reduce ending inventory at $800,000. General and administrative expenses were $1.9 million for the quarter, which included approximately $1.1 million in non-cash stock expenses.
 
“Our third quarter revenues delivered an impressive 60 percent growth compared to this time last year, which is when we first recognized revenue from major retail acquisition that occurred in June 2013,” said Marco Hegyi, President of GrowLife, Inc. “As we continue to work through challenges such as limited access to capital due to gray market trading and lawsuits, which are in negotiations, we elected to convert about three month’s of inventory into cash while optimizing sales.”
Mr. Hegyi, who assumed leadership over the Company in the second quarter 2014, has reduced operational expenses while increasing revenue. The Company has achieved record revenue of $6.7 million in the first nine months of 2014 over last year’s $2.9 million, representing 131% growth.
“Our solid revenue is attributed to customers and management who have remained confident in our future,” said Hegyi. “The Company’s growth is now moving closer to critical mass, where gross profit will offset expenses, and move us towards profitability.”
Noteworthy details from today’s extensive quarterly report are as follows:
Q3 2014 Highlights

Net revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2014 increased $792,000 to $2,105,000 as compared to $1,313,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2013.
Gross margin was $(179,000) as compared to $262,000 for the three months September 30, 2013.
The gross margin was (8.5%) for the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to 19.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2013. The decrease was due to selling our products at a higher discount and the liquidation of inventory at lower margins during the three months ended September 30, 2014.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2014 increased $633,000 to $1,923,000 as compared to $1,290,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2013. Non-cash general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2014 totaled $1,062,000.
Other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2014 was $35,664,000 as compared to other expense of $777,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2013. The expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2014 included loss on change – derivative liability warrants of $6,949,000 and interest expense of $28,715,000.
Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2014 was $37,766,000 as compared to a net loss of $1,805,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2013 for the reasons discussed above.
Our cash used in operations for the three months ended September 30, 2014 was $411,000.

YTD 2014 Highlights

Net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased $3,806,000 to $6,745,000 as compared to $2,939,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013.
Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased $3,654,000 to $5,903,000 as compared to $2,249,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013.
Gross margin was $842,000 as compared to $690,000 for the nine months September 30, 2013. The gross margin was 12.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to 23.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2013.
General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased $3,138,000 to $6,684,000 as compared to $3,546,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Non-cash general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 totaled $3,359,000.
Our cash used in operations for the nine months ending on September 30, 2014 was $1,979,000.

GrowLife implemented additional changes to its business operations that were reflected in the third quarter, such as payroll, rent and other expense reductions, comprehensive market coverage, and the consolidation of disparate business divisions. These critical changes should be more apparent in the three months ended December 31, 2014.
