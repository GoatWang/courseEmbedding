Summary







 


Overall Rating

3 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 3 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 856 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund's expenses are rated as Low because they are below the 20th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.







How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.




How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



Seeks a high level of current income.




Strategy



Normally investing at least 80% of assets in investment-grade debt securities (those of medium and high quality) of all types and repurchase agreements for those securities. Potentially investing in lower-quality debt securities. Engaging in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the fund.


Risk



Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt security to decrease. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks. Lower-quality bonds can be more volatile and have greater risk of default than higher-quality bonds. Leverage can increase market exposure and magnify investment risk.



Short Term Redemption Fee
None



Who May Want To Invest

Someone who is seeking potential returns primarily in the form of interest dividends rather than through an increase in share price.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.




How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt security to decrease. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks. Lower-quality bonds can be more volatile and have greater risk of default than higher-quality bonds. Leverage can increase market exposure and magnify investment risk.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

� 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
2. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
3. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
4. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
5. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.  The Top Ten Holdings and Top 5 Issuers do not include money market instruments or futures contracts, if any.  Depository receipts are normally combined with the underlying security.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment option reports its holdings. Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section. Some report them in this section in addition to the equity, bond and other allocation shown. Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown. If the allocation without the foreign component equals (or rounds to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
6. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
7. Net Other Assets can include fund receivables, fund payables, and offsets to other derivative positions, as well as certain assets that do not fall into any of the Portfolio Composition categories. Depending on the extent to which the fund invests in derivatives and the number of positions that are held for future settlement, Net Other Assets can be a negative number.
8. Credit ratings for a rated issuer or security are categorized using the highest credit rating among the following three Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations ("NRSRO"): Moody's Investors Service (Moody's); Standard & Poor's Rating Services (S&P); or Fitch, Inc.  Securities that are not rated by any of these three NRSRO's (e.g. equity securities, if held) are categorized as Not Rated.  All U.S. government securities are included in the U.S. Government category. The table information is based on the combined investments of the fund and its pro rata share of any investments in other Fidelity funds.
9. Fixed Income StyleMap� StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit quality and interest rate sensitivity.  Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's holdings, are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
10. Expense Cap is a limit that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 10/31/2020 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time.  After the expiration date, the expense cap may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, the issuer of a mutual fund is the fund or trust which issues the shares; the issuer of collective investment trusts is the underlying trust or investment vehicle which issues the units; the issuer of a stock fund is the company which issues the shares; the issuer of options such as separate accounts and strategies is the plan which makes them available; the issuer of a fixed return option is the insurance company or other company which offers the investment; the issuer of an annuity contract is the insurance company and/or the insurance company separate account.

Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

DAX Fund Description
The Horizons DAX Germany ETF tracks a cap-weighted, total return index of the 30 largest and most liquid securities traded on the Frankfurt Exchange.
  
DAX FactSet Analytics Insight
DAX offers a concentrated, mega-cap play on German stocks. It tracks the most famous German index in the world, the DAX index, which holds the 30 largest German companies by market cap. Since most of Germany’s mega-caps are export-oriented, DAX can also be viewed as a play on Germany’s exporting prowess. The fund’s index is unique in that it’s one of the few indexes that’s calculated with dividends reinvested, displayed as a total return index. Unlike some of its total-market peers, the ETF is not currency-hedged, meaning DAX investors are fully exposed to movements in the euro. The fund undercuts the largest Germany ETF, iShares’ EWG. However, weak investor interest to-date means DAX isn't cheap to trade, driving up all in costs. We also see elevated closure risk.The fund rebranded and changed its name from Recon Capital DAX Germany ETF to Horizons DAX Germany ETF on 2/28/2017.



DAX MSCI ESG Fund metrics Insight

Strategy and process

More than 10 asset classes: The fund holds a variety of investments in all market conditions to be positioned to benefit from a wide range of opportunities.
Individual securities: The managers select individual stocks and bonds, not other funds, to finely tune the portfolio and avoid overlap in holdings.
Active rebalancing: The managers proactively pursue opportunities and regularly rebalance the portfolio to maintain a consistent risk profile.







Manager commentary | Q2 2017
Security selection can drive diversification
Jason Vaillancourt, Co-Head of Global Asset Allocation, explains how security selection can be a method of diversification.













 Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 
Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund, which is 1% in the first year, declining to 0.5% in the second year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T1, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Class R5/R6 shares, available to qualified employee-benefit plans only, are sold without an initial sales charge and have no CDSC. Class Y shares are generally only available for corporate and institutional clients and have no initial sales charge. Performance for Class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T1 shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the period, some funds had expenses limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.

Benefit of diversifying with a single fund.





** FundVisualizer comparison based on Putnam fund versus the largest fund in its Morningstar category.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

 Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 
Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund, which is 1% in the first year, declining to 0.5% in the second year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T1, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares).  Class R5/R6 shares, available to qualified employee-benefit plans only, are sold without an initial sales charge and have no CDSC. Class Y shares are generally only available for corporate and institutional clients and have no initial sales charge. Performance for Class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T1 shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the period, some funds had expenses limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.

The up-market capture ratio is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has risen. The ratio is
calculated by dividing the manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the up-market, and multiplying that factor by 100. The down-market capture ratio
is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has dropped. The ratio is calculated by dividing the
manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the down-market and multiplying that factor by 100.

The Russell 3000 Index is an unmanaged index of the 3,000 largest U.S. companies. You cannot invest directly in an index.
 Consider these risks before investing: Allocation of assets among asset classes may hurt performance. Stock and bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons, including general financial market conditions, factors related to a specific issuer or industry and, with respect to bond prices, changing market perceptions of the risk of default and changes in government intervention. These factors may also lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond markets. International investing involves currency, economic, and political risks. Emerging-market securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks. Investments in small and/or midsize companies increase the risk of greater price fluctuations. Growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments, and value stocks may fail to rebound. Funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed. Mortgage-backed investments, unlike traditional debt investments, are also subject to prepayment risk, which means that they may increase in value less than other bonds when interest rates decline and decline in value more than other bonds when interest rates rise. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate risk (the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise) and credit risk (the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments). Default risk is generally higher for non-qualified mortgages. Interest-rate risk is greater for longer-term bonds, and credit risk is greater for below-investment-grade bonds. Unlike bonds, funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses. The use of derivatives may increase these risks by increasing investment exposure (which may be considered leverage) or, in the case of over-the-counter instruments, because of the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations. You can lose money by investing in the fund.

State Street Russell Small/Mid Cap® Index Non-Lending Series Fund   Class C (since 8/29/1997)























Fund Overview




Objective



The State Street Russell Small / Mid Cap® Index Fund (the "Fund") seeks an investment return that approximates as closely as practicable, before expenses, the performance of the Russell Small Cap Completeness® Index (the "Index") over the long term.




Strategy



The Fund is managed using a "passive" or "indexing" investment approach, by which SSGA attempts to match, before expenses, the performance of the Index. SSGA will typically attempt to invest in the equity securities comprising the Index, in approximately the same proportions as they are represented in the Index. Equity securities may include common stocks, preferred stocks, depository receipts, or other securities convertible into common stock. The Fund may purchase securities in their initial public offerings ("IPOs"). In some cases, it may not be possible or practicable to purchase all of the securities comprising the Index, or to hold them in the same weightings as they represent in the Index. In those circumstances, SSGA may employ a sampling or optimization technique to construct the portfolio in question.  From time to time securities are added to or removed from the Index. SSGA may sell securities that are represented in the Index, or purchase securities that are not yet represented in the Index, prior to or after their removal or addition to the Index.  The Fund may at times purchase or sell index futures contracts, or options on those futures, or engage in other transactions involving the use of derivatives, in lieu of investment directly in the securities making up the Index or to enhance the Fund's replication of the Index return. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Index.


Risk



The securities of smaller, less well-known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies. Value and growth stocks can perform differently from other types of stocks. Growth stocks can be more volatile. Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.



Short Term Redemption Fee
None



Who May Want To Invest

Someone who is seeking the potential for long-term share-price appreciation and, secondarily, dividend income.
Someone who is seeking both growth- and value-style investments and who is willing to accept the generally greater volatility of investments in smaller companies.

Additional Disclosures

The investment option is a collective investment trust. The trustee is State Street Global Advisors Ltd Funds. It is managed by State Street Global Advisors (Chicago). This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the fund.
The Russell Small Cap Completeness measures the performance of the Russell 3000&reg Index companies excluding S&P 500&reg constituents.
This investment option is not a mutual fund.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
2. Daily return information, including YTD (Daily) returns are calculated by Fidelity, using NAV and distribution information provided by third party providers, including, but not limited to: Investment Managers, Morningstar LLC, Plan Fiduciaries, Third party Trustees, Issuers and other outside entities.  The daily returns calculated by Fidelity may vary slightly from the non-daily returns calculated by the third party providers for similar time periods.  The official returns offered by the third party providers shall constitute the final returns for the investment option.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later). Some products do not have monthly performance data available back to inception date. The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in asset allocation and hybrid funds, where for example, the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.  Due to time-lags in reporting, the as-of date may be the date the data was reported rather than the date the fund held the assets.  For funds that invest in other funds, the underlying funds may report their holdings on different schedules, so the aggregated information presented may include results from a combination of reporting periods.
6. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
7. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.

1 It seems that whoever you talk to in the pensions industry about their current hot topic, the answer is Multi-Asset Credit (MAC). But what does this term really mean? The answer, it appears, depends who you ask. When you also consider Absolute Return Bond (ARB) funds, which are often talked about in the same breath, the potential for confusion is rife. The purpose of this newsletter is firstly to consider the role that credit typically plays within a portfolio. We then compare this to the types of asset MAC/ARB funds hold before considering the strategic and tactical case for such funds. What role does credit play within a pension scheme portfolio? Whilst bonds will act as a diversifying asset in a typical portfolio, for a defined benefit pension scheme a credit portfolio will tend to be heavily focused towards Sterling denominated investment grade credit. To understand why this is we need to consider the dual role that credit typically plays within a portfolio: However, the Sterling investment grade market is a small component of the global bond market; its current market cap is 540bn compared to the global investment grade bond market of 12.5tn, with a further 1.4tn in high yield and emerging markets. Does this historic focus solely on one part of the market remain justified? Let s start by considering the current state of the broad credit market. 1 2 To provide some interest rate protection and thereby provide a level of matching to the funding assumptions; an asset that has exposure to movements in mid and long-dated interest rates, i.e. gilt yields. To provide some excess returns over and above that available on Gilts. Again, this is often required within an actuary s funding model. Given the Sterling investment grade market has the closest link to Sterling denominated liabilities, with a slightly longer duration than the global bond market, it is easy to see why pension schemes focus has been on this part of the market. MAC/ARB investing aims to open up the available universe of credit investments. The approach involves gaining exposure to a wide variety of areas of the credit market, both by geography and instrument selection. At the same time the approach involves removing, or significantly reducing, the interest rate exposure associated with a traditional bond investment approach. The approach involves active management and should not be managed against a market benchmark but against a measure of cash returns. 1 of 62 How is the credit market currently positioned? Multi-Asset Credit Yields: Example asset categories It almost doesn t matter which part of the credit market you are considering; yields are close to record lows in absolute terms and the spread, the additional yield on credit over government bonds, 25% Source: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, iboxx Western European Loans Global High Yield is closing in on pre-crisis lows. The charts to the right set out the absolute yields in the top chart and the spread in the bottom chart. US High Yield Global Emerging Markets Sterling Non-Gilts If we take US High Yield bonds as an example, the current annual yield is 5.94% compared to an 15% average yield over the past 15 years of 9.9%. The spread is currently 3.6% compared to an average spread of 6.2% over the past 15 years. A similar story is true in investment grade credit, where the spread has fallen to around 1%. Whilst 5% this remains above pre-crises lows of around 0.63% there has been a significant change in the composition of that index over the period Comparing the current index to that pre-crisis we see a significant increase in the proportion of the benchmark rated A and BBB. The ratings on AAA, AA securities are around their pre-crisis lows, for example AA rated debt has a current spread of 0.63% compared to 0.64% in June Trustees should consider the impact of the change in composition of the benchmark index on their credit allocation. 25% 15% Multi-Asset Credit Spreads: Example asset categories Western European Loans Source: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, iboxx Global High Yield US High Yield Global Emerging Markets Sterling Non-Gilts 5% of 63 Are historically low spreads justified? To an extent yes, the level of defaults remain low compared to historical standards and corporates in general have low levels of leverage and large cash amounts. Clearly risks remain; if growth does not follow through and/or interest rates rise, the servicing of this debt may become more problematic. This brings us onto the second area to be concerned about, and that is liquidity. Liquidity is one of those wonderful things that tends to be there until the point at which you need it. The corporate bond market is fundamentally less liquid than it used to be. Due to new capital requirements banks are far less likely to supply liquidity to the bond market than before the crisis. Schemes therefore need to be very comfortable in the quality of the credit they hold as they may not be able to sell it in the event of another crisis. One of the key rationales for MAC investing is to fully open up the availability of the credit markets and, as well as those subsets listed above, also potentially allow for investments in: Sub-investment grade bonds (High Yield) Cash Emerging market bonds, both corporate and government, both local and hard currency (typically US Dollar) Floating rate bonds Secured and unsecured lending Loans Convertible and hybrid bonds What assets might a Multi-Asset Credit fund invest in? As mentioned above, the Sterling investment grade market is a small subset of the entire credit market. A scheme invested in this part of the market may expect to hold: Traditional investment grade corporate bonds In fact the benchmark index will also include: Supranational bonds Government bonds Sterling denominated emerging market bonds Asset Backed Securities Some hybrid bonds 3 of 64 Trustees could make a strategic allocation to any part of the credit market, for example a separate allocation to local currency EM bonds, High Yield bonds etc. However, this has significant governance implications and, therefore, what MAC funds potentially offer is all of this under one roof and the ability to delegate to the manager the choice of which part of the global credit market to invest in. 100% 90% 80% 70% Ratings allocation of three example funds Cash NR CCC B Is this potential realised? In the chart to the right we set out the asset allocation of three funds that fall under the MAC banner. We see that there is indeed a wider range of asset classes being invested in. However, we also see a significant difference in the asset allocation, whether we consider that by broad asset class or by credit rating. 60% 50% 40% 30% BB BBB A AA AAA What we can quickly conclude is that different managers will have different areas of expertise and therefore have different ways of managing a MAC fund. It is worth noting that there are certain sectors of the credit market that MAC funds tend not to invest in. These are the less liquid parts of 0% A B C Source: Investment managers the market and include: Private debt (including mezzanine financing) Asset class allocation of three example funds Infrastructure and real estate debt Direct lending 100% 90% 80% Emerging Markets ABS IG Credit 70% Loans 60% High Yield 50% Government 40% Cash 30% 0% A B C Source: Investment managers 4 of 65 What s the difference with an absolute return bond (ARB) fund? ARB funds are often mentioned in the same breath as MAC funds. The term absolute shouldn t be taken literally; these funds can and will fall in value in certain market conditions. Whilst ARB funds will tend to invest in similar types of asset to a MAC fund, there are significant differences. One of the key differences in an ARB fund is the ability to short (benefit from a fall in price) the market or certain investments. MAC funds tend to be long only. There are a number of implications of this difference compared to a MAC fund: ARB funds are more focused on investment grade credit given the desire to be able to short. It is very difficult to go short or quickly exit sub-investment grade positions. There is a greater reliance on manager skill, known as alpha, to generate the returns in an ARB fund. A MAC fund will tend to generate a greater proportion of its returns from exposure to the credit market, known as beta. Manager selection and skill are vital for both ARB and MAC funds. We would expect ARB funds to fall less in the event of a downturn in credit markets. They aim to be less volatile than MAC funds. In contrast we would expect lower long term returns from an ARB fund than a MAC fund. Of course there is a certain amount of generalisation in the above; one of the key conclusions is that trustees need to decide on the type of credit exposure they want and which areas of the market they feel are most attractive. Only then should they consider the choice of manager. 1 2 So how might a pension scheme use a MAC/ARB fund? In addition to getting a broader exposure to the credit market the other key advantage of a MAC/ ARB fund is that they will have little or no strategic exposure to duration; the box below sets out how this may be achieved. Most will benchmark themselves against LIBOR, or some other measure of cash returns. This offers two potential uses to pension funds: The primary use in our opinion, and where they have generally been used to date, is alongside an LDI mandate. In this scenario trustees separate out the two reasons for holding credit within a portfolio; liability protection and excess return. Here the LDI hedging portfolio, through swaps, repos etc., provides the interest rate and inflation protection. The credit portfolio is then used to outperform the liability benchmark. An alternative use would be for those who hold a traditional credit mandate and still want exposure to credit spreads but feel that the yield curve is currently under-estimating the rate of future rises in yields. As regular readers know, we don t feel this risk will materialise and whilst yields will inevitably rise, we feel the market is currently broadly pricing this in correctly. So how do MAC/ARB funds remove the interest rate risk associated with credit investments? Again, this varies significantly from fund to fund so trustees will need to understand the mechanics of the fund they are investing in. Common approaches include: Use derivatives, for example short Gilts, to remove the interest rate risk from a corporate bond also held in the portfolio. Investment in floating rate bonds, where the coupon payment is set relative to LIBOR. These will include secured loans, floating rate high yield bonds and ABS. The key point is that trustees need to be aware that this is a two-way risk, as central bankers seem to be trying to remind the market at the moment. In the event that yields rise, but more slowly than expected, a LIBOR-based credit fund is likely to underperform a market benchmarked credit fund. 5 of 66 a true partnership approach So is now a good time to invest in such a fund? If the reduction in yields and spreads on the current portfolio mean your overall portfolio is not expected to generate the returns needed under the funding strategy then trustees need to make their assets work harder or increase employer contributions. The former may mean potentially holding lower rated assets, the search for yield, or aiming for greater active manager returns. Which part of the market you select to invest in will largely depend upon your return requirements and any constraints over short-term performance. Some key questions that will need to be addressed are: Investment grade or sub-investment grade credit? Tolerance for potential short-term losses? Long term or short-term holding? Your belief in active management? Your views on certain sections of the credit market? Once these questions have been answered you can then decide the MAC/ARB fund to consider. Given spreads are currently low, return expectations need to be tempered for such a mandate. So what should trustees be doing? MAC/ARB investing is certainly not a one-size-fits-all approach that is suitable for all schemes. What trustees should be doing is re-examining their approach to managing credit risk. This assessment needs to be made in the context of the changing characteristics of the credit market; the deterioration in spreads back towards the lows seen pre-crisis in certain sectors and the falling levels of liquidity. They should be considering the dual role that credit plays within that portfolio and consider whether their existing approach remains the most efficient way of meeting its twin objectives; liability protection and return enhancement. We feel the existing approach can be improved upon in many cases. By separating out the dual roles of a traditional credit portfolio and giving the manager freedom to allocate across assets and securities, a more effective portfolio can be established. The key though is for trustees to first define their objectives and only then to start considering potential managers; although many funds have similar names, what goes on under the bonnet will be vastly different. Almost all areas of credit have provided exceptional returns over the past 5 years; this is extremely unlikely to be repeated over the next 5 years. Careful consideration therefore needs to be taken in deciding whether to increase the overall level of credit exposure at this time, however, it may be an Please contact your Barnett Waddingham consultant if you would like to discuss any of the above topics in more detail.
