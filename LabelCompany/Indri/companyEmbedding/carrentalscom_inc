      Find Your Way Around Fort Lauderdale Airport
 
    Fort Lauderdale is called “The Venice of America” for good reason: its numerous canals and year-round beautiful weather make this Florida city a spectacular place to visit. On your next trip, reserve a cheap Fort Lauderdale airport car rental so you can catch all the sights the instant you step off your plane.
  




      Pick Up Your Car
 
    When you leave your plane, pick up your luggage and head to the Rental Car Center, located on Terminal Drive just next to Terminal 1. If you’re arriving at Terminal 2, 3, or 4, simply follow the signs to the complimentary shuttle service to the Rental Car Center, where on-site car rental companies reside. Should you rent a car from an off-site rental company, you may need to take a shuttle or other transport to its location. While you can book a car upon arrival, we recommend using CarRentals.com to reserve a car ahead of time—why wait in line when sunny Florida is waiting for you? Once you have your car keys, you’ll be ready to start your sightseeing, as Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL) is located just 3 miles southwest of Fort Lauderdale.
  




      Out & About in Fort Lauderdale
 
    Steer your FL airport car rental to Las Olas Boulevard, located right near central Fort Lauderdale. Besides a 1-mile commercial strip featuring shops, cafes, and restaurants, Las Olas Boulevard also features beautiful homes set amidst numerous canals. Next, head inland; just west of I-95 you’ll find Thunderbird Swap Shop. Also called “The World’s Biggest Daily Flea Market,” this is the spot to land that ultimate bargain, whether you’re after electronics, clothing, jewelry, or just about anything else.
  




    Enjoy an outdoor adventure in the Everglades Wildlife Management Area. This wildlife reserve, located about 20 miles west of Fort Lauderdale off I-595, permits hiking and frogging in some areas. The reserve is located far from the city lights, so stargazing is a particularly stunning experience. You may also consider driving about 30 miles south on I-95 to Miami. A trip to “The Magic City” is punctuated by long days spent on the beach, as well as some excellent shopping. Even if you haven’t rented a car to get around Fort Lauderdale, you may want to obtain a one-way car rental to take you into and around Miami, followed by flying out of Miami International Airport (MIA).
  




      Returning Your Car & Relaxing in the Airport
 
    If you opt to fly home from Fort Lauderdale, return your car rental to the Rental Car Center at FLL. If you’re flying out of Terminal 1, you can cross the bridge to reach it; otherwise, the free shuttles will take you back to Terminals 2, 3, and 4. These shuttles run every 10 minutes, rain or shine, so you won’t need to wait long to get to your gate. If you’ve rented a car from an off-site agency, you may need to make other arrangements to return to the airport.
  




    If you have some time before your flight takes off, do a little shopping at a duty-free shop, or enjoy a meal at one of the sit-down restaurants or fast food counters throughout the four terminals. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL) is a sprawling facility, serving over 20 airlines, among them United and Southwest. While you wait, take a few minutes to listen to some of the live music offered through FLL Terminal Tunes. Local artists perform throughout the terminals, at varying times, giving you something to listen and tap your toes to.

How Turo works







Renting a car




Sign up
Sign up for Turo with Facebook, Google, or your email. We’ll confirm your identity and eligibility so you can become an approved driver.




Find the perfect car
Enter your travel dates and location and search our vast selection of unique, locally-owned cars.




Book it
Book the car of your dreams. The owner will confirm or decline your trip within eight hours, but typically it’s much sooner. Book cars instantly on listings with the “Book Instantly” badge.


                    Pickup
                



Pick up the car
Meet the car owner to pick up the car. Many owners offer delivery, so they may bring it right to you.
Walk around the car, show them your license, grab the keys, and drive off into the sunset.




Have the time of your life
Go explore! In the city or the woods, for a few days or a few weeks, rain or shine, grab your shades and go create something to write home about.


                    Return
                



Return the car
At the end of your trip, replace the gas you used and meet the owner to drop off the car. Walk around the car again, hand over the keys, give them a high five, and start planning your next adventure.




Listing your car




List your car
Create a free listing with a few clicks. Describe your car, upload some clean photos, and you’re ready to go.
Be sure to keep your calendar up to date so travelers know when your car is available.





Respond to requests
You’ll get notified when someone requests, or books your car instantly. Confirm or decline the trip as soon as possible, and contact the traveler if you have any questions.



Meet your guest
Coordinate where and when you’ll meet your guest. Check their license, walk around the car, check the fuel and mileage, and send them off on their adventure.



Kick back and earn
Rest easy, Turo covers your car with $1 million in liability insurance and 24/7 roadside assistance throughout the trip, so you can just watch the dollars roll in.*



Pick up your car
Meet your guest, make sure everything’s in order, give them a high five, and head on home. Don’t forget to rate and review them in the app to help keep our marketplace strong and honest.







Local hospitality drives
Car delivery



Imagine the feeling travelers will get when you drop off your car curbside, or pull up in front of a restaurant downtown. Once you greet them and hand over your keys, they’ll never want to go back to an agency counter again.



There are three options for meeting travelers:




Owners deliver to custom locations around town, within a set radius
                        



Owners deliver to nearby airports



Travelers pick up the car at the owner’s location
                        



Search cars with delivery
Offer delivery






* Liability insurance and roadside assistance only apply to car owners who enroll in a protection plan provided via Turo (where available). Owners who provide their own commercial rental insurance and offer insurance directly to their customers will not be covered by the above-mentioned protection. All owners outside of the USA and Ontario, Alberta, and Quebec in Canada must have commercial rental insurance for their customers.

Frequently Asked Questions


How old do I need to be to rent a car?
With many rental companies, you must be at least 21 years of age to rent a car, and any driver under 25 may have to pay a Young Driver Fee. Similarly, people aged 70+ may find some companies will charge a Senior Driver Fee, or may not rent   to them at all.
So car rental for the under-25s or over-70s can be more expensive – which is one more reason to book with Rentalcars.com, as we work with all the big brands. Just check each car’s terms and conditions to see if your age would make any difference.


Can I book a one-way car rental?
Yes. One-way car rental deals are quite common, as they give people even more freedom to explore and enjoy their rental. However, rental companies will often charge a One Way Fee (or ‘drop charge’) to cover the cost of returning the car   to its original location. As the world’s biggest online car rental service, we can help you find a one-way rental car with a low Fee – or no Fee at all.




Do I need rental car insurance – and what is ‘CDW’ anyway?
Before you buy any car rental insurance, you should find out what coverage is provided by your credit card company, your homeowner’s / renter’s policy, and your own car insurance. This will help you decide what cover you need to buy while   booking and picking up your car.
CDW means ‘Collision Damage Waiver’; a type of cover that limits your liability for damage to certain parts of a rental car.


How do I find the cheapest car rental deals?
As the world’s biggest online car rental service, we specialize in finding the cheapest car rental deals from major brands such as Hertz, Avis, Alamo and Budget. Daily, weekly or monthly car rentals… just fill in our search form to compare   deals from different companies – and find out how much you can save when you rent a car from us.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

                   3.

        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

We want to make sure that every customer knows when ordering "Quality" will reflect the brand of the item. All of our items our amazing products. We take great pride & care in all of our items making sure they are cleaned and sanitized when delivered no matter the brand. 
Example of "Quality" $30-60 Toddler Car Seats. $30 would be Even Flo or something like that type of quality car seat. $40-50 would be the Graco Contender 65 Convertible or something like it. $60 would be the Nautilus which is a very nice car seat but all of them are great clean products. 
For Full Cribs we do recommend Steel or Deluxe only because they are better quality but all do the job great and are amazing cribs. All our cribs are roughly the same size 26" H x 39.6" W x 36.25" D

Just wanted to drop you a quick note  thanking you for the great service you provided. The cribs we rented worked out well. Your delivery and pick-up was timely and it made our vacation more enjoyable, especially when traveling with twins under the age of 2.



Thanks again,



Mark I.
SouthElgin, IL


Just wanted to Thank you again for the outstanding toys and all the clean, working, up-to-date items provided for "The Twins" first visit with us. Both toddler packages worked out great. Mary and I were very impressed with the quality and condition of everything provided. The Twins loved all the toys and the fact that it all worked (batteries included) with bells, whistles, booms, wows, etc... is very impressive. My son and daughter-in-law said this is amazing, even the books provided were age appropriate. They were so happy about not having to drag the pack-n-play and strollers to the airport.
 
It really could not have worked out better unless of course they stayed longer.
Anyway, super job. See you next trip. Much thanks.
 
Kind regards,
 
Gpa & Gma Bruns

You made my granddaughter's trip special.  The toys were so clean and the high chair was a great suggestion! - Anna Marie Lisbon, Largo, FL

Dear VisitingBaby, Thank you so much for the wonderful supplies!  You really saved us when our other rental fell through.  I have already recommended you to some family who will be coming to Florida in March.  Many thanks!  The tub of toys was right on target!  Best, Meredith

Jody,

Just wanted to say thank you for all the toys and pram {jog stroller} you supplied.

Toys were a fantastic selection for her age some of which she was sad to leave and pram was great for running and trips to the beach. Both in excellent  and clean condition.

Also thanks for looking at recommendations for us and must admit we didn't need them in the end but thank you for the time you took finding them.

Thanks again

Charlotte


You make this sooo easy, I only wish you had branches everywhere we travel.  Let me know if you have any other questions and thank you in advance for already making my trip more enjoyable.
 
Jamie

Thank you so much for the baby equipment rental.  It was so convenient for us.  Everyone was so impressed with the idea of renting vs. bringing everything, and with the quality of the equipment.  The toys were great!!!!  Just had to let you know how great your service is!

Thanks again,

Dana Reiner

Thank you so much.  Your rentals and service have taken a huge stress off my vacation planning.
Sincerely,
Catherine Houlden
.
I cannot say thank you enough for the services you provided for us while staying in Florida.  The other great perk was it actually saved us money with all the extra baggage fees now at the airlines!  My daughter could not get enough of all of the toys that were included in the package as well.  You guys were a life saver and I will definitely keep you in mind next time we are in Florida!
Charlotte in Ohio

VisitingBaby made our packing so much simpler.  They provided exceptional service too: we have two young children so VisitingBaby thought to supply two of each kind of beach toy to avoid fighting; they also arranged delivery and pick up with the hotel so we could merely arrive and leave...no waiting.  Fantastic!   Everything was clean and the toys with batteries had lots of energy.  Thanks!
-Janet

      Find Your Way Around Fort Lauderdale Airport
 
    Fort Lauderdale is called “The Venice of America” for good reason: its numerous canals and year-round beautiful weather make this Florida city a spectacular place to visit. On your next trip, reserve a cheap Fort Lauderdale airport car rental so you can catch all the sights the instant you step off your plane.
  




      Pick Up Your Car
 
    When you leave your plane, pick up your luggage and head to the Rental Car Center, located on Terminal Drive just next to Terminal 1. If you’re arriving at Terminal 2, 3, or 4, simply follow the signs to the complimentary shuttle service to the Rental Car Center, where on-site car rental companies reside. Should you rent a car from an off-site rental company, you may need to take a shuttle or other transport to its location. While you can book a car upon arrival, we recommend using CarRentals.com to reserve a car ahead of time—why wait in line when sunny Florida is waiting for you? Once you have your car keys, you’ll be ready to start your sightseeing, as Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL) is located just 3 miles southwest of Fort Lauderdale.
  




      Out & About in Fort Lauderdale
 
    Steer your FL airport car rental to Las Olas Boulevard, located right near central Fort Lauderdale. Besides a 1-mile commercial strip featuring shops, cafes, and restaurants, Las Olas Boulevard also features beautiful homes set amidst numerous canals. Next, head inland; just west of I-95 you’ll find Thunderbird Swap Shop. Also called “The World’s Biggest Daily Flea Market,” this is the spot to land that ultimate bargain, whether you’re after electronics, clothing, jewelry, or just about anything else.
  




    Enjoy an outdoor adventure in the Everglades Wildlife Management Area. This wildlife reserve, located about 20 miles west of Fort Lauderdale off I-595, permits hiking and frogging in some areas. The reserve is located far from the city lights, so stargazing is a particularly stunning experience. You may also consider driving about 30 miles south on I-95 to Miami. A trip to “The Magic City” is punctuated by long days spent on the beach, as well as some excellent shopping. Even if you haven’t rented a car to get around Fort Lauderdale, you may want to obtain a one-way car rental to take you into and around Miami, followed by flying out of Miami International Airport (MIA).
  




      Returning Your Car & Relaxing in the Airport
 
    If you opt to fly home from Fort Lauderdale, return your car rental to the Rental Car Center at FLL. If you’re flying out of Terminal 1, you can cross the bridge to reach it; otherwise, the free shuttles will take you back to Terminals 2, 3, and 4. These shuttles run every 10 minutes, rain or shine, so you won’t need to wait long to get to your gate. If you’ve rented a car from an off-site agency, you may need to make other arrangements to return to the airport.
  




    If you have some time before your flight takes off, do a little shopping at a duty-free shop, or enjoy a meal at one of the sit-down restaurants or fast food counters throughout the four terminals. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL) is a sprawling facility, serving over 20 airlines, among them United and Southwest. While you wait, take a few minutes to listen to some of the live music offered through FLL Terminal Tunes. Local artists perform throughout the terminals, at varying times, giving you something to listen and tap your toes to.

    When you’re ready to start rent a car in Fort Lauderdale, CarRentals.com is here for you.

Accessibility

One of the best things about [Turo] is its app (iOS, Android), which can be a serious life saver if you find yourself in an airport without a car rental hub.



[Turo], a coast-to-coast network of private car owners who rent their vehicles, features occasional listings for Hummers and Maseratis among its more conventional rides.



Sharing economy companies like [Turo], Lyft and others are ... saving travelers money while also providing authentic “local” experiences on a global scale.

How Turo works







Renting a car




Sign up
Sign up for Turo with Facebook, Google, or your email. We’ll confirm your identity and eligibility so you can become an approved driver.




Find the perfect car
Enter your travel dates and location and search our vast selection of unique, locally-owned cars.




Book it
Book the car of your dreams. The owner will confirm or decline your trip within eight hours, but typically it’s much sooner. Book cars instantly on listings with the “Book Instantly” badge.


                    Pickup
                



Pick up the car
Meet the car owner to pick up the car. Many owners offer delivery, so they may bring it right to you.
Walk around the car, show them your license, grab the keys, and drive off into the sunset.




Have the time of your life
Go explore! In the city or the woods, for a few days or a few weeks, rain or shine, grab your shades and go create something to write home about.


                    Return
                



Return the car
At the end of your trip, replace the gas you used and meet the owner to drop off the car. Walk around the car again, hand over the keys, give them a high five, and start planning your next adventure.




Listing your car




List your car
Create a free listing with a few clicks. Describe your car, upload some clean photos, and you’re ready to go.
Be sure to keep your calendar up to date so travelers know when your car is available.





Respond to requests
You’ll get notified when someone requests, or books your car instantly. Confirm or decline the trip as soon as possible, and contact the traveler if you have any questions.



Meet your guest
Coordinate where and when you’ll meet your guest. Check their license, walk around the car, check the fuel and mileage, and send them off on their adventure.



Kick back and earn
Rest easy, Turo covers your car with $1 million in liability insurance and 24/7 roadside assistance throughout the trip, so you can just watch the dollars roll in.*



Pick up your car
Meet your guest, make sure everything’s in order, give them a high five, and head on home. Don’t forget to rate and review them in the app to help keep our marketplace strong and honest.







Local hospitality drives
Car delivery



Imagine the feeling travelers will get when you drop off your car curbside, or pull up in front of a restaurant downtown. Once you greet them and hand over your keys, they’ll never want to go back to an agency counter again.



There are three options for meeting travelers:




Owners deliver to custom locations around town, within a set radius
                        



Owners deliver to nearby airports



Travelers pick up the car at the owner’s location
                        



Search cars with delivery
Offer delivery






* Liability insurance and roadside assistance only apply to car owners who enroll in a protection plan provided via Turo (where available). Owners who provide their own commercial rental insurance and offer insurance directly to their customers will not be covered by the above-mentioned protection. All owners outside of the USA and Ontario, Alberta, and Quebec in Canada must have commercial rental insurance for their customers.

The Best Travel Apps of 2015


More





Kayak 

Free
Travel search website Kayak.com is one of my favorite sites for finding the best deals on flights, especially when I'm picky about the details: what time to leave, number of layovers, and which airlines I can use. In its early days, Kayak only handled search (although it was one of the best at that end of the game), but now you can prepay for flights, hotel reservations, and even car rentals. Additionally, Kayak includes in its searches other aggregation services, like Orbitz and Priceline, to truly make sure you find the best deal.
Available on: Android, iOS, Kindle Fire, Windows Phone, Web

  

Maps.Me
Free
The Maps.Me mobile app lets you browse around the globe, zoom in on any region or city, and download a detailed map of that area to use offline. You'll see an option to download just the map or the map with directions enabled to get you from point A to B without an Internet connection. What I like about Maps.Me is the great level of detail on maps for lesser traveled places, such as Freetown, Sierra Leone (shown), which isn't well mapped by Google Maps. It's a must-have travel app for those who wander off the beaten path.
 Available on: Android, Amazon Fire, BlackBerry, iOS

  

MenuPages
Free
When on road trips, you can often find restaurants nearby using Google Maps or Yelp, but you can't always see how much the food costs or what's on the menu. MenuPages fills in those gaps, telling you whether a cup of coffee is going to run you a dollar or an arm and a leg. Even when menus are rotating, MenuPages gives you a sample menu from a previous day. It's a great travel tool, currently covering New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, South Florida, and Washington, D.C.
Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

OpenTable
Free
Snag a dinner reservation in less than a minute with the OpenTable app. OpenTable is pretty widely used in major cities in the U.S. and Canada, as well as in London. It lets you find restaurants that meet your criteria, see opening times, read reviews, and make reservations online at no charge. It's a great restaurant resource when you're in any city, but especially while traveling.
Available on: Android, Amazon Fire, BlackBerry, iOS, Web, Windows Phone

  

Orbitz Flights, Hotels, Cars

Free
Orbitz Flights, Hotels, Cars searches for the best travel deals, lets you book them, and offers a price guarantee if another user books the same travel as you for less. Orbitz's app is the kind that anyone would want for planning a trip ahead of time to find low prices, as well as last-minute bookings from the road.
Available on: Android, iOS, Kindle Fire, Web

  

Packing Pro

$2.99
Packing Pro is a mobile app made for list makers. It helps you remember what to pack and can also serve as evidence of what you packed if your luggage were ever lost. It has plenty of sample lists of items to pack for different types of travel, or you can create your own and tick off items as they go into your luggage. The $3 app may seem like overkill to those who have packing down to a science already, but it can be an excellent tool for parents who are packing for multiple family members before leaving on vacation.
Available on: iOS

  

Roadtrippers
Free
Tell Roadtrippers your starting location and destination, dates of travel, and what kinds of things you're interested in finding along the way, and this app will plot your journey for you. Roadtrippers can find offbeat attractions, restaurants, museums, amusement parks, camp sites, and more. When you find a site you like, just add it to your trip, and Roadtrippers will redraw your travel map accordingly.
Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

Roomer Travel
Free
We all know we can save a good deal of money by booking hotels in advance. The problem, especially on road trips, is that we don't always get to the destination in time for the reservation, and if you've paid ahead, you're out of luck. Not so if you use Roomer. This app and website (roomertravel.com) helps travelers sell their prepaid reservations to people who can use them to recoup some of that otherwise lost cost. If you need a hotel in a pinch, you can also see if anyone on Roomer is trying to offload a hotel room in your desired location. Everyone wins.
Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

SkyScanner
SkyScanner's mobile app has such a Free
wonderful search interface for finding cheap flights. I love that you can look for a flight on certain dates from your home airport to anywhere in the world based on where it might be inexpensive to fly during that time. You can then adjust your search using a wonderfully intuitive and interactive graph to find the cheapest surrounding dates to travel. SkyScanner partners with a site called ebookers.com for the actual sale, and note that SkyScanner's prices appeared for me in U.S. dollars while ebookers' showed up in GBP. The company makes separate apps for hotel and car rentals.
Available on: Android, BlackBerry, iOS, Windows 8, Windows Phone, Web

  

TripAdvisor
Free
TripAdvisor is one of the most best online sources for travelers, particularly because it has in-depth reviews of hotels, restaurants, and sites to see. Photos uploaded by other users are also helpful for getting a glimpse of a place from an unbiased point of view. TripAdvisor is one of the richest resources you'll find because it has a huge and active community.
Available on: Android, iOS, Nokia, Windows Phone, Web

  

TripCase

Free
TripCase is a free app that helps you organize your itineraries. You use the app by forwarding confirmation emails from travel services to a special address. TripCase then pulls the most important information from those confirmation emails and arranges them into a day-by-day or even hour-by-hour summary of your trip. It's very similar to the next app in this list (TripIt), except that TripIt pulls information directly from your email account while TripCase relies on you sending it along.
Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

TripIt

Free
TripIt is a mobile app for Android and iPhone that connects to your email accounts and automatically compiles your travel information based on confirmation emails you receive. TripIt finds the important details for flights, hotels, rental car reservations, and even restaurant bookings, then collates them in order into an itinerary. If you worry about not having all your details in one place, TripIt is a wonderful travel organizer.
Available on: Android, BlackBerry, iOS, Windows Phone

  

Tripomatic

Free
Tripomatic helps you plan what to do and see on your next trip, and on which days. You can use it in advance of your trip to put together a daily agenda, or use it on the spot to find sites to see, a cafe to have coffee, or restaurant in which to eat. Tripomatic has more than thousands of attractions listed in hundreds of destinations. The app syncs with the website Tripomatic.com, so you can tinker with your itineraries on a full sized screen if you prefer. Many of the top destinations have offline content, such as maps, photos, and visitors guides.
Available: Android, iOS

  

Triposo
Free
Driving through the desert or deep into mountains, you can't be sure you'll have Internet access. Triposo puts offline maps and travel guides onto your phone so you can use them even in dead zones. Before you download maps and guides for any destination, Triposo tells you how much space they will take up on your phone, too. When you pull up a destination on Triposo, it offers top sightseeing suggestions, a weather forecast, and more ways to explore the destination.
Available on: Android, iOS

  

TV Food Maps
Free
A friend turned me onto TV Food Maps after she raved about its value on her last big U.S. road trip. This interactive app and website finds restaurants and eateries that have appeared on various television food shows, such as Bizarre Foods American, Top Chef, $40 a Day, Restaurant Impossible and (groan) Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. What could be more American than eating your way through a road trip?
 Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

Uber
Free
Getting around a foreign city can be a royal pain, especially if you don't speak the language, don't have any currency, or don't know the etiquette rules for tipping or haggling. Uber eases all these pains and others. With this car service app, you can request a car and tell the driver where to pick you up by dropping a pin on a map. The app gives you a fare estimate for a ride to your destination, and the driver can see it on the map, too. When your ride is over, Uber charges your credit card the right amount, and you don't have to tip. Uber is worldwide, with service more than 50 countries.
Available on: Android, iOS, Web (mobile browser required)

  

 Viator
Free
Looking to save some money but still do some interesting site-seeing? Viator shows you deals and discounts either nearby or in the place you're going to visit next--provided that location is in Viator's list of potential cities, regions, and countries. It's great for ideas of what to see and do, especially when you're feeling clueless, although the quantity and quality of the deals varies dramatically by place.
Available on: Android, iOS

  

Wanderu
Free
If you don't drive but want to take a road trip, try Wanderu. This app and website is a search aggregator and price comparison tool for bus and train tickets. Enter the dates you want to travel, plus your beginning and ending point, and Wanderu will look for fares on Amtrak, Greyhound, MegaBus, Bolt Bus, TrailwaysNY, BestBus, and other bus and train carriers.
 Available on: Android, iOS, Web

  

Waze
Free
Waze is a community-driven app for traffic and other information about the road, including police speed traps, potholes, and accidents. While Google Maps tells you about major reported road problems, Waze knows the nitty-gritty. You can even see the speeds at which cars are traveling in congestion. In cities, it's popular among taxi and car service drivers, but it's equally useful on highways. Beware, though: Waze needs to use your location information all the time, even in the background, which will take a toll on your battery.
Available on: Android, iOS, Windows Phone

  

Yelp

Free
The beauty of Yelp, an app that offers user-generated recommendations for businesses, is that it's used widely by a lot of people. If you show up at a destination and want to find a decent cup of coffee within walking distance, Yelp will probably do the best job. While some other travel apps have plenty of recommendations from other travelers, Yelp is more likely to be used by locals. It's especially good with restaurants, but Yelp can also help you find auto repair shops, health clinics, and other places you might need to visit unexpectedly while on a trip.
Available on: Android, BlackBerry, iOS, Web, Windows Phone

All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by LBI that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and LBI, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.
Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to LBI should be sent to: Attn: Legal Department, 1930 Veterans Memorial Highway, Suite 12-436, Islandia, New York, 11749. After the Notice is received, you and LBI may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and LBI do not resolve the claim or dispute within 30 days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.
Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
Additional Rules for Non-appearance Based Arbitration: If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.
Time Limits. If you or LBI pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
Authority of Arbitrator. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and LBI, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and LBI.
Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and LBI in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND LADYBUG.COM, INC. WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This Paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
Severability. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or effect any other portion of this Agreement.
Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with LBI.
Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or LBI may bring an individual action in small claims court.
Emergency Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
Claims Not Subject to Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement.
Courts. In any circumstances where the foregoing Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within New York County, New York, for such purpose.

Governing Law and Jurisdiction
All matters relating to this Website and these Terms of Use and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction).
Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these Terms of Use or this Website shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of New York in each case located in the City of New York and County of New York.

Limitation on Time to File Claims
ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THIS WEBSITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
Waiver
No waiver by LBI of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of LBI to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
Miscellaneous
This Agreement (which hereby incorporates by reference any other provisions applicable to use of the Website, including, but not limited to, any supplemental terms governing the use of certain specific material contained in the Website and any operating rules for the Website established by LBI) constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. In addition, if any provision of the Agreement, for any reason, is declared to be unenforceable, the parties will substitute an enforceable provision that, to the maximum extent possible under applicable law, preserves the original intentions and economic positions of the parties. LBI does not make any claims concerning whether the Website may be accessed, viewed, or used outside the United States. End User acknowledges and agrees that all use of the Website from outside the United States is done solely at the risk of End User.

								You may be given the option to complete a form on the Website to request information online about your eligibility. 
								We may collect your Personal Information from websites of our partners that are powered by LBI and share this information with them. 
								Social Media (e.g., Facebook or Twitter): If you are logged into a third party account, such as Facebook, and you access but are not logged into the Site, we may receive information from that third party account to make it easier for you to create an account on the Site and show you relevant content from others.

								We may also share your Personal Information with other partners that are acting as our agents and are bound contractually to use or disclose your Personal Information only in accordance with this Policy.
							
We will not share the Personal Information you provide except (a) as permitted by applicable law; (b) where such disclosure has been described on the Website or in this Policy or you have otherwise consented to such disclosure; (c) as a result of our belief that the disclosure may be permitted or required by law or may be necessary to protect our company or others from injury (e.g., in response to a court order or subpoena or law enforcement agency request or when we believe that someone is causing or may cause injury or is interfering with the rights or property of another); or (d) with third parties with which we contract to carry out our business activities (e.g., sending out a promotional item that you have qualified for on the Website, contacting you to complete your pending applications or purchases, or sharing information with our business partners in connection with the site that is powered by LBI and operated under another brand).
Your Consent to Disclose Personal Information to a Third Party
Except as otherwise indicated in this Policy, we will only supply your Personal Information to a third party with your opt-in or opt-out consent. In these cases, you will be given the option to opt in or opt out based upon information disclosed at the time your information is collected. If you do not opt in, or you opt out, your information will not be disclosed.
Finally, please note that the Personal Information you provide to the Website is considered a company asset and may be included among transferred assets if LBI, any of its Related Companies or any of their assets are ever acquired by a third party.
Collection of Information by Others
Our Website may contain links to other websites operated by third parties (collectively, the Third-Party Sites). Such Third-Party Sites may have information practices that are different from those described in this Policy. You should check the other privacy notices made available on such Third-Party Sites.
On this Website, when you provide us with an email address for a referral, we may share your name and email address as well as the recipient’s email address with a third party as necessary in order to provide this referral service. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Website, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend an email inviting him or her to visit the Website. This third party stores this information for the sole purpose of sending communications and tracking the success of our referral program. You or your friend may contact us at privacy@ladybug.com or use the link provided in each email, to request that we remove this information from our database.
Supplemental Information
From time to time we may supplement the Personal Identifiable Information you provide through our Website with information from other sources, such as information validating your address. Thus, information we obtain through our Website may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than our Website, including both offline and online sources.
Security Notice
We maintain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to comply with federal guidance to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access to, maintain data security of and correctly use the Personal Identifiable Information collected through our Website. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from our Website may not be secure.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
