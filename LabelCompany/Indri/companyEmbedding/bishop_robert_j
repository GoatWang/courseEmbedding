He was ordained a priest on May 25, 1991 for the Diocese of Rockville Centre, N.Y. by Bishop John R. McGann at St. Agnes Cathedral.
Bishop Coyle was commissioned an ensign in the U.S. Navy on June 3, 1988 and served 24.5 years on Active and Reserve Duty before his retirement from the Naval Reserve on January 1, 2013.
As a Navy Reserve Chaplain, Bishop Coyle served as Associate Pastor at St. Dominic Church in Oyster Bay, N.Y. from 1991 to 1996 and St. Patrick’s Church in Glen Cove, N.Y. from 1996 to 1999.

He was assigned to the 3rd Marine Division on Okinawa, Japan from 1999 to 2000, during which time he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and deployed to Southeast Asia as Landing Force Chaplain. During a three year assignment aboard the USS Harry S. TRUMAN (CVN75) Aircraft Carrier from 2000 to 2003, he deployed to the Middle East from 2000-2001 and served in Operation Southern Watch and Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2002 to 2003. Assigned to the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y. from 2003 to 2007, Bishop Coyle reported first as Assistant Command Chaplain before assuming duties as Command Chaplain.
In April of 2005, Bishop Coyle was promoted to the rank of Commander, U.S. Navy. From 2007 to 2009, he served on the USS Dwight D. EISENHOWER (CVN69) Aircraft Carrier and deployed to the Middle East in 2009 for Operation Enduring Freedom.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Bishop, Robert J carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 
Bishop, Robert J currently holds license 2101033247 , which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Bishop, Robert J



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

                Biography - Bishop Robert J. Rose 
            

Page ContentBishop Rose is the son of Urban Rose and Maida Glerum Rose. His father was the youngest of eight in a Catholic family from Conklin, Michigan. His mother was a member of a Dutch Reformed family of eight from Grand Haven.  
 
Robert was born in Grand Rapids on February 28, 1930, as the Great Depression was just beginning. He was the youngest of three children, a girl and two boys. The family joined St. Francis Xavier Parish shortly after his birth. His father was a telegraph operator, and the family was doing quite well until he died in 1937 of heart trouble. Robert's mother and his sister, June, went to work to support the family. His brother, James, joined the army shortly after Pearl Harbor. 
 
Robert completed eight years of elementary school at St. Francis Xavier School. He began preparations for the priesthood at St. Joseph's Seminary, where he completed high school and junior college. He completed his college program with two years at the Seminaire de Philosophie in Montreal, Canada. He completed four years of theology at the Pontifical Urban College in Rome (the Church's missionary seminary). During his fourth year in Rome, on Dec. 21, 1955, he was ordained to the priesthood in the college chapel with 35 classmates by Cardinal Clemente Micara, the Holy Father's Vicar General.
 
Upon his return to the U.S. in 1956, Father Rose was assigned to the faculty of St. Joseph's Seminary, where he served for thirteen years teaching religion, Latin, Greek (classical and New Testament), French and music (chant). From 1969 to 1971, he served as the first director of Christopher House, a seminary residence near Aquinas College. In 1971 he was appointed rector of St. John’s Provincial Seminary in Plymouth, a position he held for six years. In 1977 he returned to the Diocese of Grand Rapids, and was appointed pastor of Sacred Heart Parish, Muskegon Heights where he served until 1981. 
 
In October 1981, Father Rose was named the second bishop of the Diocese of Gaylord, and was ordained and installed on December 6. In July, 1989, following the retirement of Bishop Joseph Breitenbeck, he was appointed the ninth bishop of the Diocese of Grand Rapids, and returned to Grand Rapids to be installed on August 30. After 22 years of episcopal ministry, Bishop Rose retired in October 2003, and went to live with fellow priests at St. Camillus Woods in Byron Township. He remains connected to the diocese and clergy members by attending clergy events and special liturgies, and through many personal friendships.

The Apostolic Nuncio, Carlo Maria Viganò and AMS Auxiliary Bishops Richard B. Higgins, Episcopal Vicar for Veterans Affairs; F. Richard Spencer, Episcopal Vicar for Europe and Asia; and Neal J.

Bishop-elect Coyle was commissioned an ensign in the U.S. Navy on June 3, 1988 and served 24.5 years on Active and Reserve Duty before his retirement from the Naval Reserve on January 1, 2013. As a Navy Reserve Chaplain, Bishop-elect Coyle served as Associate Pastor at St. Dominic Church in Oyster Bay, N.Y. from 1991 to 1996 and St. Patrick’s Church in Glen Cove, N.Y. from 1996 to 1999.

During a three year assignment aboard the USS Harry S. TRUMAN (CVN75) Aircraft Carrier from 2000 to 2003, he deployed to the Middle East from 2000-2001 and served in Operation Southern Watch and Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2002 to 2003. Assigned to the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y. from 2003 to 2007, Bishop-elect Coyle reported first as Assistant Command Chaplain before assuming duties as Command Chaplain.

In August of 2009, Bishop-elect Coyle separated from Active Duty, returned to Reserve status and began his current ministry as Pastor of Corpus Christi Parish in Mineola, N.Y. In 2008, he was named by Pope Benedict XVI a Chaplain to His Holiness, a recognition that carries the honorary title, “Monsignor.” Bishop-elect Coyle is a 4th Degree Knight of Columbus.

————
The AMS was created as an independent archdiocese by Pope John Paul II in 1985 as the only Catholic jurisdiction responsible for endorsing and granting faculties for priests to serve as chaplains in the U.S. military and VA Medical Centers.
AMS-endorsed priests serve at more than 220 U.S. military installations in 29 countries, making the AMS the nation’s only global archdiocese. AMS-endorsed chaplains also serve at 153 VA Medical Centers throughout the U.S.
The AMS service population also includes American Catholic civilians working for the federal government in 134 countries, but currently, due to limited resources, the AMS cannot adequately serve this population.
Worldwide, an estimated 1.8 million Catholics depend on the AMS to meet their spiritual and sacramental needs.
For more information on the Archdiocese for the Military Services, visit www.milarch.org, the only official Web site for Catholics in the military and for the Cause of Father Vincent Capodanno, M.M.
