About DeSantis

          "We didn't invent concealment. We just perfected it."
        And perfected it we did.
        Welcome to DeSantis Gunhide, where the world's best gun holsters are manufactured right here in the U.S. of A.!
        You've probably heard that cliché success story about the American business started by one man, a set of hand tools and a garage. DeSantis Gunhide IS that story  without the starry-eyed hype. The rise of DeSantis from one-man operation 40 years ago, to global manufacturer of concealed carry holsters today, is a testament to the American entrepreneurial spirit and dedicated hand-craftsmanship.
        Company founder Gene DeSantis built his first gun holster at his kitchen table; with his own two hands and simple tools. Today, DeSantis employs the latest technologies and skilled craftspeople to outfit elite law enforcement agencies and the U.S. military with superior quality holsters. And for enthusiasts seeking the finest concealed holsters for personal protection, DeSantis is THE product of choice. Best of all, DeSantis Gunhide is a family-owned and run business that proudly builds and hand-finishes their holsters right here in America.
        Whatever type of concealed holster best suits your needs -belt holster, IWB holster, thigh holster, ankle or shoulder rig- our leading-edge fitting technologies ensure that your weapon is safe, secure and ready at moment's notice when you need it.  Whether you prefer leather or Kydex®, DeSantis is the first, middle and last name in concealment holsters and accessories.

Wayne Huizenga School of Business and Entrepreneurship’s Distinguished Lecture Series welcomed Carl DeSantis, former Chairman of the Board of Rexall Sundown, Inc. and namesake of the building that houses the business school, to the University’s Davie campus for a lecture titled “Life After Sundown.” Speaking in front of a full house, DeSantis addressed students, faculty and staff in the Miniaci Performing Arts Center on Tuesday, Sept. 25.
DeSantis handed out copies of his book, Vitamin EnRICHed, as well as an offer to receive a  free DVD copy of “The Art of Tying The Knot” from his DeSantis Collection of clothing as his gift to audience members.
DeSantis regaled the audience with accounts of his entrepreneurial endeavors while imparting business advice, such as:
Look for voids in life.
 DeSantis told attendees to create a business based on voids in life – in other words, to look for where there are consumer needs/demands, and fill them. He told about how after his dogs passed away it was difficult to locate a service provider to remove the animal carcasses. See a need, and fill it! 

 Don’t ever put the brakes on.
 DeSantis insists that it takes persistence, dedication, and hard work to get the job done. While at Rexall Sundown, he had no set working hours, but instead stayed at work until everything that needed to be done was done.
Know what you are capable of.
 Knowing one’s strengths and skill sets is imperative, as well as knowing what you will need to achieve your goals, such as surrounding yourself with good people. DeSantis’ right hand man, Jim Steinhauser, has worked with him for more than 25 years; Bill Milmoe, president of CDS International Holdings, Inc., has worked with Carl for 15 years.
DeSantis’ entrepreneurial spirit dates back to his working-class boyhood, when he sold newspapers and raised parakeets to help his family. He entered the health industry as a stock boy at Walgreens and soon became one of the chain’s top store managers. In response to consumer demand, DeSantis created Sundown, an effective but inexpensive sunburn treatment.
Recognizing the increasing interest in nutrition and health products, he started the successful company Rexall Sundown, Inc., which was the leading developer, manufacturer, and marketer of vitamins, nutritional supplements, and other consumer health products. Since his days at Rexall Sundown, Inc., DeSantis authored the best-selling book, Vitamin Enriched.
DeSantis, ever the entrepreneur, is currently running eight separate businesses including:
•    Tabañero – Tabañero sauce is 100% all natural and like no other hot sauce. The unique blend of ingredients gives Tabañero a tangy flavor with a hint of sweetness from the agave nectar. Along with other natural ingredients and mixed with the perfect amount of ‘heat’, it spices up any dish without over powering it.
•    CELSIUS is a great tasting drink that burns calories, reduces body fat, increases endurance and provides greater resistance to fatigue. Celsius comes in a variety of flavors and one 12 ounce can burns up to 100 calories – a powerful benefit unique to Celsius. Also loaded with vitamins and “good-for-you” ingredients like Green Tea with EGCG, Ginger, Calcium, Chromium, B vitamins, and vitamin C, the blend works together to raise metabolism leading to sustained calorie burn.

About DeSantis

          "We didn't invent concealment. We just perfected it."
        And perfected it we did.
        Welcome to DeSantis Gunhide, where the world's best gun holsters are manufactured right here in the U.S. of A.!
        You've probably heard that cliché success story about the American business started by one man, a set of hand tools and a garage. DeSantis Gunhide IS that story  without the starry-eyed hype. The rise of DeSantis from one-man operation 40 years ago, to global manufacturer of concealed carry holsters today, is a testament to the American entrepreneurial spirit and dedicated hand-craftsmanship.
        Company founder Gene DeSantis built his first gun holster at his kitchen table; with his own two hands and simple tools. Today, DeSantis employs the latest technologies and skilled craftspeople to outfit elite law enforcement agencies and the U.S. military with superior quality holsters. And for enthusiasts seeking the finest concealed holsters for personal protection, DeSantis is THE product of choice. Best of all, DeSantis Gunhide is a family-owned and run business that proudly builds and hand-finishes their holsters right here in America.
        Whatever type of concealed holster best suits your needs -belt holster, IWB holster, thigh holster, ankle or shoulder rig- our leading-edge fitting technologies ensure that your weapon is safe, secure and ready at moment's notice when you need it.  Whether you prefer leather or Kydex®, DeSantis is the first, middle and last name in concealment holsters and accessories.

Make check payable to “IT Pro Camp, Inc.” (preferred, no pay pal fees)
Use PayPal Donate button on code camp site.

Day of event:

Best to arrive early and be setup by 7:15 or earlier.
Most of the tables are first come first serve. People have different opinions of which location is the best. They are all good and will give you direct access to a flow of developers.
There is no provision by us or the university to ship items after the event. My advice is to figure this out in advance.
There should be power available at all sponsor tables. We have a lot of extension cords and power has never been a problem.
We will have some mechanism for a raffle and usually give away a few things. You are welcome to use our methodology for picking winners or collect names or whatever method you want. Note that many people only come for part of the day so someone you see in the morning may not be present at the closing ceremonies.
Very casual dress… most of the volunteers wear shorts.
The targeted end time is 5:30 to start ceremonies and we try to be done and out the door by 6:30 pm. This can shift one way or the other for whatever reason.

About DeSantis

          "We didn't invent concealment. We just perfected it."
        And perfected it we did.
        Welcome to DeSantis Gunhide, where the world's best gun holsters are manufactured right here in the U.S. of A.!
        You've probably heard that cliché success story about the American business started by one man, a set of hand tools and a garage. DeSantis Gunhide IS that story  without the starry-eyed hype. The rise of DeSantis from one-man operation 40 years ago, to global manufacturer of concealed carry holsters today, is a testament to the American entrepreneurial spirit and dedicated hand-craftsmanship.
        Company founder Gene DeSantis built his first gun holster at his kitchen table; with his own two hands and simple tools. Today, DeSantis employs the latest technologies and skilled craftspeople to outfit elite law enforcement agencies and the U.S. military with superior quality holsters. And for enthusiasts seeking the finest concealed holsters for personal protection, DeSantis is THE product of choice. Best of all, DeSantis Gunhide is a family-owned and run business that proudly builds and hand-finishes their holsters right here in America.
        Whatever type of concealed holster best suits your needs -belt holster, IWB holster, thigh holster, ankle or shoulder rig- our leading-edge fitting technologies ensure that your weapon is safe, secure and ready at moment's notice when you need it.  Whether you prefer leather or Kydex®, DeSantis is the first, middle and last name in concealment holsters and accessories.

About DeSantis

          "We didn't invent concealment. We just perfected it."
        And perfected it we did.
        Welcome to DeSantis Gunhide, where the world's best gun holsters are manufactured right here in the U.S. of A.!
        You've probably heard that cliché success story about the American business started by one man, a set of hand tools and a garage. DeSantis Gunhide IS that story  without the starry-eyed hype. The rise of DeSantis from one-man operation 40 years ago, to global manufacturer of concealed carry holsters today, is a testament to the American entrepreneurial spirit and dedicated hand-craftsmanship.
        Company founder Gene DeSantis built his first gun holster at his kitchen table; with his own two hands and simple tools. Today, DeSantis employs the latest technologies and skilled craftspeople to outfit elite law enforcement agencies and the U.S. military with superior quality holsters. And for enthusiasts seeking the finest concealed holsters for personal protection, DeSantis is THE product of choice. Best of all, DeSantis Gunhide is a family-owned and run business that proudly builds and hand-finishes their holsters right here in America.
        Whatever type of concealed holster best suits your needs -belt holster, IWB holster, thigh holster, ankle or shoulder rig- our leading-edge fitting technologies ensure that your weapon is safe, secure and ready at moment's notice when you need it.  Whether you prefer leather or Kydex®, DeSantis is the first, middle and last name in concealment holsters and accessories.

It helps you to dig deep down and find your passion. It helps you to see that "hard work can beat talent when talent fails to work hard."  In 2013, as a graduate student at Nova Southeastern University, Carl DeSantis gave me this book after a lecture. I read it and thought, huh, two people really do think alike.  The book reflects similar thoughts I had prior to reading, I was awakened and strengthened by his stories.Emmanuel BlimieAuthorIdeal Recipe for Striking It RichRead more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsListen to your instincts!ByD.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
