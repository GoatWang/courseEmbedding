CPSC, Michael Friedman Corp. Announce Recall of Rattles

































FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


 




June 28, 1998


 




Release # 98-134





WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Michael Friedman Corp. of Brooklyn, N.Y. is recalling about 2,000 rattles. Small parts can break off of the rattles, presenting choking and aspiration hazards to infants. CPSC has received one report of a rattle separating and releasing small plastic balls from inside. No injury was reported. The recalled rattles are sold under the "Hobby Horse" brand name. The rattles, measuring 5.25 inches high, look like roses. A green stem-like handle extends from the bottom of the pink or purple "rose" and bends upon itself in a somewhat circular fashion to form a handle. The words "Hong Kong" are embossed on the lower portion of the "rose." The rattles were packaged in clear plastic shrink wrap attached to a purple polka dotted bluish cardboard header, labeled "Hobby Horse...Baby Rattle." Small children's clothing and discount stores nationwide sold the rattles from March 1997 to May 1998 for about $1 to $2.Consumers should take the rattles away from infants immediately and discard or destroy them, or if possible, return the rattles to the store where purchased for a refund. However, the firm, Michael Friedman Corp., is out of business and cannot be contacted. 



The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing
          to CPSC's free e-mail newsletters.

New York – August 3, 2015 – Friedman LLP announced today that Michael Sacco has joined the firm as Partner.

“Friedman offers one of the oldest and most established fashion practices for accounting firms,” Sacco said. “The long-standing reputation of the fashion and apparel practice at Friedman and my drive to offer best in class consulting to privately-held businesses, made my decision to join Friedman an obvious choice.”

Michael graduated from Hofstra University with a degree in Business in Accounting. He is a Certified Public Accountant in New York and a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants. He is also a board member of the New York Banking and Finance Group and a member of the Contemporary Credit Club.

Never waited more than 15 mins for prescriptions even when busy. Know all my kids names and will truly help you in any way possibel. My daughter was sick, hospitalized came home on a friday the prescriptions needed a prior auth(govt scam) to cover medicine. These kind people filled it for me and when the Auth got done which was 3 full days+weekend don't count so my sick child would of been without medicine right out the hospital for 5 days minimum. You think cvs or rite Aid would ever do anything remotely close to that? I'd drive hrs to give them my business if need be. I love going in there because it reminds me of how America use to be when i was younger, they even have an aisle of candies ranging from 5$ to 1.00 Just try them for a month or 2,i used to drive for hrs. To different main chain pharmacies who ever had anything in. These guys, 90% of the time have it or next day get it. Id give them 10 star's if i could. You won't be disappointed. Nova Star PharmacyGwynne F. ratedAmazing Amazing Amazing Andrea is the most caring kind hearted knowledgeable pharmacist I've ever had the pleasure of meeting.... This man continuously goes out of his way to make sure his patrons are 100% satisfied. He does everything for everyone because he loves his job.... He loves  what he does... He loves to help people.... I will never ever go anywhere else ever.... This man is truly a diamond in the ruff... If anyone is looking for a pharmacist he's your man.... He has the most competitive prices around... He fights your medical insurance for you... Makes house calls... Delivers after hours.... Informs you thru text as soon as your medicine is ready for pick up... Again this man is the best I only wish the rest of Fishtown and surrounding neighborhoods knew of this pharmacy.... Thanks again Andrea for everything you do for me and the family... You are truly appreciated.. Penn Ellis IncJames S. ratedI hired Ellis Penn & O'Connor to deal with my issues with the IRS. All of the actions taken by the IRS was getting to be a little too much on my business, but they just requested some simple documents from me and from there got my penalties released and the interest drastically lowered. All of the letters and threats from the IRS stopped. I was then put into a payment plan that was affordable for my business when the IRS wouldn't even consider that low of a payment before. The staff I had contact with were extremely professional and thorough in everything they did. I really appreciate everything you guys have done for me. Because of you guys I can get back to work and not have to worry about losing my business. Thanks.Nova Star PharmacyDani D. ratedbest pharmacy out thereAndrea is the absolute BEST pharmacist out there. he cares so deeply about his customers and his number one goal is to have you leave 100% satisfied. on numerous occasions he has ordered-in items that he didn't already have in stock! (aquafor and oil of oregano). his shelves are stocked with amazing products and he's always eager to show you something new he got in that he thinks you'll enjoy. Andrea is a huge asset to the neighborhood... this is the kind of "when I was young..." type of customer service you parents/grandparents talk about.I'm sad to leave philly and not see Andrea's friendly face every morning when I pass Nova Star!Parish Jennifer L Doctor of Medicinephillyguy10 ratedI saw Dr. Jennifer today.  She is not all warm and fuzzy but who cares?  She is not rude or mean, just very down to business.  That is her personality.  Give the lady a break.  Check out her educationally background, that is what matters.  Her background is very impressive.  I did not go to see her for a social visit.  I had very little wait, much less than I expected.  The young lady at the front desk was very pleasant.  I did not know what to expect and I was impressed.Tang Pharmacy IIIdblyweiss ratedThis is the best pharmacy I have ever gone to.  The staff is exceptionally friendly, and the pharmacists and their technicians are knowledgeable, patient, and eager to help.  It is evident that they appreciate our business, and they go out of their way to make your visit there a pleasant experience.  Never again would I go elsewhere for any of my prescriptions other than Tang Pharmacy.                                               David BlyweissNova Star PharmacyBrooke H. ratedNova Star provides high quality, personal pharmacy service. I especially recommend Nova Star because it is a business that invests in local schools, especially Penn Treaty School. Nova Star actively supports the teachers (by donating to teacher appreciation breakfasts w/ prize drawing), the athletes (by donating to the sports teams), and Friends of Penn Treaty School (by participating in our annual flea market). Thank you, Nova Star Pharmacy!Holmesburg PharmacyMichelle G. ratedThis is the best Pharmacy, Bob and Pat  and Lauren take such good care of my mom , I cannot say enough good things about this  store and their employees , her meds are always ready before she gets there, she never has to wait,and if she cannot drive they will deliver it right to her house, THE BEST PEOPLE  EVER, THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHINGAmigos PharmacyMargie M. ratedI have been with Amigos Pharmacy since the opening.  The service is excellent, the pharmacist is well informed and always eager to help with any questions or needs.  Is good to find someone who is caring to the needs of their customers.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  I would recommend anyone and everyone to Amigos Pharmacy.CVS Pharmacyloganess1 ratedCount you pillsWhen you get a prescription filled at this location count your pills our better yet ask for the original packaging to insure that you are getting all of the medication that you are paying for.   I've been shorted twice but I have since learned that they make mistakes in counting your pills.
