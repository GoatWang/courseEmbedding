BAKERCORP INTERNATIONAL, INC. ACQUIRES ASSETS OF KASELCO LLC





Seal Beach, CA- BakerCorp, an industry leader in containment, pumping, filtration and shoring equipment rental solutions, today announced that it has acquired substantially all of the assets of privately held Kaselco LLC, a manufacturer and provider of Water Treatment Solution Systems.
We are excited to add Kaselco's industry-leading technology and people to our portfolio of Water Treatment Solutions," said Bob Craycraft, President and CEO of BakerCorp. "Kaselco's technology and expertise combined with Baker's global footprint and broad product line will allow us to meet our customer's growing demands for water filtration and recycling."
BakerCorp's new filtration systems will have the capability to treat water across a broad range of applications more cost effectively than other solutions using patented technology. This technology also reduces the complexity and amount of costly chemicals often related to onsite water treatment.
"The acquisition of Kaselco is strongly aligned with our filtration growth strategy. The acquisition brings the critical technical knowledge and experience to supplement BakerCorp's strong market presence in water treatment solution offerings," said Mehrzad Emanuel, Vice President of Filtration for BakerCorp. 
Doug Herber, the former president of Kaselco, will join BakerCorp as its new Vice President of Water Treatment Technologies, to help lead the expansion of BakerCorp's water recycle and treatment business going forward. "These are exciting times for BakerCorp given the strong growth in both our traditional filtration business and in the new products and solutions. This acquisition serves as another key step in our continued efforts to expand our water service offerings," added Emanuel.
BakerCorp's new mobile filtration systems will serve a critical need for oil and gas customers by reducing the need for sourcing, hauling, and disposal of water from fracking operations.
"This technology is another piece of the puzzle for Baker to help our oil and gas customers realize their goals of a closed loop water system that eliminates disposal of contaminated water into disposal wells. In addition, our new solution reduces their overall water cycle costs and risks related to sourcing, hauling, and disposal," said Raymond Aronoff, Executive Vice President of Oil & Gas for BakerCorp. "We are focused on continuing to bring solutions to our customers that allow us to partner with them on ways to drive sustainability, efficiency and productivity", added Aronoff.
The acquisition was completed December 9, 2013. Financial terms of the transaction will not be disclosed. For more information about BakerCorp, please visit www.bakercorp.com

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

ACQUIRES ASSETS OF KASELCO LLCThomson Reuters ONE•December 9, 2013ReblogShareTweetShare          Seal Beach, CA-   BakerCorp, an industry leader in containment, pumping, filtration and shoring equipment rental solutions, today announced that it has acquired substantially all of the assets of privately held Kaselco LLC, a manufacturer and provider of Water Treatment Solution Systems."We are excited to add Kaselco`s industry-leading technology and people to our portfolio of Water Treatment Solutions," said Bob Craycraft, President and CEO of BakerCorp.  "Kaselco`s technology and expertise combined with Baker`s global footprint and broad product line will allow us to meet our customer`s growing demands for water filtration and recycling."BakerCorp`s new filtration systems will have the capability to treat water across a broad range of applications more cost effectively than other solutions using patented technology.  This technology also reduces the complexity and amount of costly chemicals often related to onsite water treatment."The acquisition of Kaselco is strongly aligned with our filtration growth strategy.  The acquisition brings the critical technical knowledge and experience to supplement BakerCorp`s strong market presence in water treatment solution offerings," said Mehrzad Emanuel, Vice President of Filtration for BakerCorp.  Doug Herber, the former president of Kaselco, will join BakerCorp as its new Vice President of Water Treatment Technologies, to help lead the expansion of BakerCorp`s water recycle and treatment business going forward. "These are exciting times for BakerCorp given the strong growth in both our traditional filtration business and in the new products and solutions. This acquisition serves as another key step in our continued efforts to expand our water service offerings," added Emanuel.BakerCorp`s new mobile filtration systems will serve a critical need for oil and gas customers by reducing the need for sourcing, hauling, and disposal of water from fracking operations."This technology is another piece of the puzzle for Baker to help our oil and gas customers realize their goals of a closed loop water system that eliminates disposal of contaminated water into disposal wells.  In addition, our new solution reduces   their overall water cycle costs and risks related to sourcing, hauling, and disposal," said Raymond Aronoff, Executive Vice President of Oil & Gas for BakerCorp.  "We are focused on continuing to bring solutions to our customers that allow us to partner with them on ways to drive sustainability, efficiency and productivity", added Aronoff.The acquisition was completed December 9, 2013.  Financial terms of the transaction will not be disclosed.  For more information about BakerCorp, please visit www.bakercorp.comInvestor Relations Contact:Jim LeonettiChief Financial OfficerJoy BanducciTreasurerTelephone #: (888) 882-4895Facsimile #: (562) 430-7231BondInvestorEmail@bakercorp.comAbout BakerCorpBakerCorp is a market leader in tank, pump, filtration and shoring equipment rentals, with a network of locations including operations in North America, Europe, Canada and Mexico.
