Purdue University[edit]




Purdue's Martin C. Jischke Hall of Biomedical Engineering opened in 2006 and was named for Jischke in 2008.[6]


On August 14, 2000, Jischke became the tenth president of Purdue University, succeeding Steven C. Beering, who stepped down after 17 years as Purdue's president. From the beginning of his administration, Jischke established the goal of "making a great university into a preeminent university."
To accomplish this goal, Jischke and the Purdue University Board of Trustees developed a strategic plan for the university, proposed sweeping changes, and introduced ambitious fundraising and construction agendas. The scope of the plan extended beyond the university campus, to the state of Indiana at large. Jischke and the trustees saw a stronger Purdue leading an economic resurgence for the entire state.
The five-year strategic plan was adopted in November 2001. The plan called for data-driven decision making, focusing on collecting data on various performance benchmarks for comparison with peer institutions. Jischke also advocated steps to improve diversity, expand interdisciplinary research, add 300 new faculty positions, and engage government and business leaders to advance economic development. One of the most visible expressions of his vision is Discovery Park, a $100 million multidisciplinary research and entrepreneurial complex on Purdue's West Lafayette campus.
Jischke also led the way in the "Campaign for Purdue," a $1.5 billion fund-raising operation, launched in September 2002 in support of the strategic plan. The campaign designated $200 million for student scholarships and fellowships, $200 million to attract and retain a quality faculty, $200 million for programs and centers, $600 million for facilities and equipment and $100 million in unrestricted funds. The plan was the largest such fundraising campaign in the history of higher education in Indiana. Jischke also focused on building alumni support and creating educational partnerships within the state.
On August 4, 2006, Jischke announced he would be stepping down from the president's post at the end of the 2006-07 fiscal year. He stated he would be taking a year off from public life at that time.[7]
On May 7, 2007, the Purdue University Board of Trustees announced the appointment of France A. Córdova to succeed Jischke as the university's 11th president effective July 16, 2007.
On May 12, 2007, Jischke was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Purdue University's College of Engineering.[8]

 American Dream

  "Hard work, honesty, risk, and competition all must happen for the American Dream of wealth, marriage and family, home and... prosperity, and social mobility to become reality." This is what we as Americans have ingrained in our heads as how to become happy.  The American Dream is not a set rule of guidelines that guarantees success when attempted. It is not 2+2=4. There are numerous books in the world today "spilling the secret to success". They are however just a regurgitation of how one person...

The Unattainable Dream
	The American Dream is known as a life of personal happiness and material comfort as... traditionally sought by individuals in the United States. It’s the overall thought that one can self invent themself, being able to construct their own life by starting over and setting the past aside.  In today’s society, the American Dream is categorized as either being something that is attainable or unattainable, but the three sources that I have chosen being Jay Gatsby from The Great...

Purdue
University
On August 14, 2000 Dr. Jischke became the tenth president of Purdue
University, succeeding Steven C. Beering, who stepped down
after 17 years as Purdue's president. From the beginning of his
administration, Dr. Jischke established the goal of "making a great
university into a preeminent university."
To accomplish this goal, Dr. Jischke and the Purdue University
Board of Trustees developed a strategic plan for the university,
proposed sweeping changes, and introduced ambitious fundraising and
construction agendas. The scope of the plan extends beyond the
university campus, to the state of Indiana at large. Dr. Jischke and the trustees
see a stronger Purdue leading an economic resurgence for the entire
state.
The five-year strategic plan was adopted in November 2001. The
plan calls for data-driven decision making, focusing on collecting
data on various performance benchmarks for
comparison with peer institutions. Dr. Jischke has also advocated
steps to improve diversity, expand interdisciplinary
research, add 300 new faculty positions, and engage
government and business leaders to advance economic
development. One of the most visible expressions of his vision
is Discovery Park, a $100 million multidisciplinary research and entrepreneurial complex being constructed
on Purdue's West Lafayette campus.
Dr. Jischke has also lead the way in the "Campaign for Purdue,"
a $1.5 billion fund-raising operation, launched in September 2002
in support of the strategic plan. The campaign designates $200
million for student scholarships and fellowships, $200 million to
attract and retain a quality faculty, $200 million for programs and
centers, $600 million for facilities and equipment and $100 million
in unrestricted funds. The plan is the largest such fundraising
campaign in the history of higher education in Indiana. Dr. Jischke
is also focusing on building alumni support and creating educational
partnerships within the state.
On August 4, 2006, Dr. Jischke announced he would be stepping
down from the president's post at the end of the 2006-07 fiscal
year. He stated he would be taking a year off from public life at
that time. [2]
On May 7, 2007, the Purdue University Board of Trustees
announced the appointment of France A. Córdova to succeed Dr.
Jischke as the university's 11th president effective July 16,
2007.
On May 12th, 2007, Dr. Jischke was awarded an honorary doctorate
degree from Purdue University's College of Engineering. [3]

A monthly letter from President Martin C. Jischke


  Letter from the President












May 2004
A monthly letter from President Martin C. Jischke
One of the happy by-products of higher education is that people with college degrees tend to become more involved in public service. They are more likely to take on civic responsibilities and to lead or contribute to charitable efforts. At Purdue, we try to encourage this tendency by integrating  whenever possible  public service with our students' academic pursuits.
Service-learning opportunities allow our students to help others and improve communities, and the effort also can provide practical, real-world experience that enhances education. At the same time, service-learning gives young people an appreciation of the great satisfaction that comes from using their talents to make life better for others.
There are many examples of these kinds of activities at Purdue, but one of the most remarkable is Engineering Projects in Community Service. Begun at Purdue in 1995, EPICS has become a national movement with chapters at 15 universities throughout the country. Last month five more institutions established programs.
 
The newest members are Columbia University, San Jose State University, the University of California-San Diego, the University of California-Merced and the Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 
In EPICS, teams of undergraduates earn academic credit for multiyear, multidisciplinary projects that solve engineering- and technology-based problems for community service and education organizations. Teams are made up of 10-20 students ranging from freshmen to seniors studying engineering disciplines and other fields that can include communication, computer science, management and child development. 
The director of Purdue's program is Leah H. Jamieson, the Ransburg Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and associate dean of engineering for undergraduate education. Here's what Leah said recently about EPICS:
"Educators have increasingly realized the importance of developing not just good engineers, but also good citizens. While giving students the opportunity for extensive design work, we can also show them needs that exist and the impact their work can have on their communities. I hope that each of our EPICS students takes a sense of responsibility to service with them when they leave their universities." 
In 1995, Dr. Jamieson and Edward J. Coyle, also a professor of electrical and computer engineering, established EPICS as the nation's first engineering service-learning program built around long-term university and community partnerships. Coyle now serves as Purdue's assistant vice president for research in computing and communication. 
Purdue's EPICS teams work with community groups in four major areas: human services, access and abilities, education, and the environment. Project goals have included homeless prevention, environmental protection, and the creation of toys and adaptive devices for children with disabilities. Other universities emphasize the types of projects that are most appropriate for their communities. 
The most recent expansion of EPICS is funded in part by a $2.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation awarded to Purdue last year. Purdue will provide a portion of those funds to the new members to supplement the cost of their programs for four years. The five new universities were chosen through a competitive process similar to that used by the NSF. 
EPICS is an example of a wonderful idea that blossomed into a major national initiative. It has the potential to affect the way we educate future engineers, and it already is allowing students to make life better for others while improving their own skills. It's only one example of service-learning initiatives at Purdue, but it's one of which we are very proud.
          
At the end of June, one of Purdue's most effective administrators will retire from his full-time duties. Don Gentry has made great contributions to our state as vice provost for engagement. Don earlier served as director of Purdue Statewide Technology and then as dean of the School of Technology, firmly establishing the school as both the largest and the best in the country. Fortunately, Don will continue to handle some special assignments on a part-time basis, but now is the time to thank him for a brilliant career that made Purdue a better university.

Dr. Jischke is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. On Tuesday, February 28, 2006, Martin Jischke was appointed to President Bush's President's Council on Science and Technology|Council of Advisers on Science and Technology.
Administration[edit]
Dr. Jischke was a member the faculty of the University of Oklahoma's School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering for 17 years, and also served as director of the school. During his time at the university, he was the principal advisor to 21 thesis students. He served as Chair of the Faculty Senate during the 1974-75 academic year,[4] dean of the College of Engineering from 1981 to 1986, and in 1985 Dr. Jischke was named the university's interim president.
In 1986 Dr. Jischke was named chancellor of the University of Missouri–Rolla. Success in that role led him to the presidency of Iowa State University in 1991. He raised money for scholarships. Dr. Jischke also set records for private fundraising at the university each year he was there, surpassing $100 million annually. The Martin C. Jischke Honors Building at Iowa State is named after him.[5]
Awards[edit]
Dr. Jischke has received a number of prestigious awards for his accomplishments in science and education. His is a recipient of the American Society for Engineering Education Centennial Medallion and the Illinois Institute of Technology Professional Achievement Award.

The Illinois Institute of Technology and the National Agricultural University of Ukraine have both awarded him honorary doctoral degrees.
He is an honorary member of Mortar Board National College Senior Honor Society, having been tapped by the Barbara Cook chapter at Purdue University in 2006.
Purdue University[edit]




Purdue's Martin C. Jischke Hall of Biomedical Engineering opened in 2006 and was named for Jischke in 2008.[6]


On August 14, 2000, Jischke became the tenth president of Purdue University, succeeding Steven C. Beering, who stepped down after 17 years as Purdue's president. From the beginning of his administration, Jischke established the goal of "making a great university into a preeminent university."
To accomplish this goal, Jischke and the Purdue University Board of Trustees developed a strategic plan for the university, proposed sweeping changes, and introduced ambitious fundraising and construction agendas. The scope of the plan extended beyond the university campus, to the state of Indiana at large. Jischke and the trustees saw a stronger Purdue leading an economic resurgence for the entire state.
The five-year strategic plan was adopted in November 2001. The plan called for data-driven decision making, focusing on collecting data on various performance benchmarks for comparison with peer institutions. Jischke also advocated steps to improve diversity, expand interdisciplinary research, add 300 new faculty positions, and engage government and business leaders to advance economic development. One of the most visible expressions of his vision is Discovery Park, a $100 million multidisciplinary research and entrepreneurial complex on Purdue's West Lafayette campus.
Jischke also led the way in the "Campaign for Purdue," a $1.5 billion fund-raising operation, launched in September 2002 in support of the strategic plan. The campaign designated $200 million for student scholarships and fellowships, $200 million to attract and retain a quality faculty, $200 million for programs and centers, $600 million for facilities and equipment and $100 million in unrestricted funds. The plan was the largest such fundraising campaign in the history of higher education in Indiana. Jischke also focused on building alumni support and creating educational partnerships within the state.
On August 4, 2006, Jischke announced he would be stepping down from the president's post at the end of the 2006-07 fiscal year. He stated he would be taking a year off from public life at that time.[7]
On May 7, 2007, the Purdue University Board of Trustees announced the appointment of France A. Córdova to succeed Jischke as the university's 11th president effective July 16, 2007.
On May 12, 2007, Jischke was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Purdue University's College of Engineering.[8]

To accomplish this goal, Jischke and the Purdue University Board of Trustees developed a strategic plan for the university, proposed sweeping changes, and introduced ambitious fundraising and construction agendas. The scope of the plan extended beyond the university campus, to the state of Indiana at large. Jischke and the trustees saw a stronger Purdue leading an economic resurgence for the entire state.
The five-year strategic plan was adopted in November 2001. The plan called for data-driven decision making, focusing on collecting data on various performance benchmarks for comparison with peer institutions. Jischke also advocated steps to improve diversity, expand interdisciplinary research, add 300 new faculty positions, and engage government and business leaders to advance economic development. One of the most visible expressions of his vision is Discovery Park, a $100 million multidisciplinary research and entrepreneurial complex on Purdue's West Lafayette campus.
Jischke also led the way in the "Campaign for Purdue," a $1.5 billion fund-raising operation, launched in September 2002 in support of the strategic plan. The campaign designated $200 million for student scholarships and fellowships, $200 million to attract and retain a quality faculty, $200 million for programs and centers, $600 million for facilities and equipment and $100 million in unrestricted funds. The plan was the largest such fundraising campaign in the history of higher education in Indiana. Jischke also focused on building alumni support and creating educational partnerships within the state.
On August 4, 2006, Jischke announced he would be stepping down from the president's post at the end of the 2006-07 fiscal year. He stated he would be taking a year off from public life at that time.[7]
On May 7, 2007, the Purdue University Board of Trustees announced the appointment of France A. Córdova to succeed Jischke as the university's 11th president effective July 16, 2007.
On May 12, 2007, Jischke was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Purdue University's College of Engineering.[8]

The five-year strategic plan was adopted in November 2001. The plan called for data-driven decision making, focusing on collecting data on various performance benchmarks for comparison with peer institutions. Jischke also advocated steps to improve diversity, expand interdisciplinary research, add 300 new faculty positions, and engage government and business leaders to advance economic development. One of the most visible expressions of his vision is Discovery Park, a $100 million multidisciplinary research and entrepreneurial complex on Purdue's West Lafayette campus.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
