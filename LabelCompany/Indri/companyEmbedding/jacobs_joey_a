Joey A. Jacobs
Director


 

Mr. Jacobs joined Cumberland’s Board of Directors in 2011 and is a member of the Nominating Committee. A healthcare veteran with more than 35 years of industry experience, Mr. Jacobs is currently the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Acadia Healthcare, a rapidly growing behavioral health company. Mr. Jacobs is the former Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nashville-based Psychiatric Solutions, Inc. (PSI), which he co-founded in 1997 and grew into a $2 billion behavioral healthcare system before the company’s sale to Universal Health Services in 2010. Prior to founding PSI, Mr. Jacobs spent 21 years at Hospital Corporation of America, or HCA, where he served in various capacities, including President of HCA’s Tennessee Division. Mr. Jacobs’ background at HCA also includes serving as President of HCA’s Central Group, Vice President of the Western Group, Assistant Vice President of the Central Group and Assistant Vice President of the Salt Lake City Division. In addition to serving as the former Chairman of the Nashville Health Care Council, he is also the past director of the Federation of American Hospitals and the National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems. He is currently a board member of the Monroe Carell, Jr. Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt and Mental Health Management. Mr. Jacobs holds a B.S. degree from Middle Tennessee State University. The Board believes Mr. Jacobs’ extensive hospital industry experience as well as his prior experience as chairman and CEO of a publicly traded healthcare company will be critical as the Company continues to develop its hospital acute care product line and navigate the responsibilities associated with being a public company.
