The Prophets

of Psalms. After he anointed king over Israel and Judah, David conquers the Jebusite fortress of Jerusalem, and makes it his capital. Tree of Jesse
(David father) family branches demonstrating how divine kingship descen-ded from Jesse, through his son David, to Jesus.

Dispense a few drops of King David’s Beard Oil into the palm of your hand. Rub hands together and massage into beard and skin. Keeps your beard looking groomed, tamed and healthy. For best results, use after shower.
King David was anointed as king:
1 Sam 16:11-13
”Then Samuel said to Jesse, Are all your sons here And he said, There remains yet the youngest,[a] but behold, he is keeping the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and get him, for we will not sit down till he comes here. And he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy and had beautiful eyes and was handsome. And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him, for this is he. Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the Spirit of the G-d rushed upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.”
We believe that a proper beard may define who you are as a person and as a leader. It is how you present yourself to the world. King David was humble, but strong and beautiful. Even though he was a Shepard he was a pleasant and kind man and was well groomed even with his rough edges as a outdoors man. G-d said that King “David was a man after his own heart” which was fitting to be King of Israel.
1 Samuel 13:14
‘But now your kingdom shall not continue. The L-rd has sought out a man after his own heart, and the L-rd has commanded him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept what the L-rd commanded you.

 Biblical Harps
Micah Harrari, a Levite and master craftsman, originally built the first harp in the land of Israel in 2000 years, for his wife Shoshanna as a birthday gift. Basing his designs on the information found in the Bible, Talmud, and archeology, this first harp opened the way for many more to follow spreading the mystical sounds of David's harp from the streets of Jerusalem to the four corners of the world.

When David became king of Israel, he was finally able to take on the role he had been promised years earlier. But in doing so, he left us an example as to how we should act when we also experience victory. Rather than forgetting the past and wielding power in triumph, David sought the Lord, kept his promises, and put his faith in God. 2 Samuel 2-5
