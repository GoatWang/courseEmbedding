Featured Project
Located in downtown Smyrna, The Twentieth Century Veterans Memorial was constructed in 2000 to commemorate those who served in the United States Armed Forces. The Memorial is the designated site for the annual Memorial Day and Veterans Day ceremonies in Smyrna. It features a 60-foot flagpole surrounded by six smaller flagpoles representing each military branch, a Garden Wall with a timeline of wars and battles, and a Memorial Grove inscribed with the names of Cobb County citizens who died in service.

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
