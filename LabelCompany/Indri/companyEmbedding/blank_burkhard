 ARDSLEY, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:ACOR)
      today announced that Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Enrique Carrazana, M.D.
      is leaving the Company effective January 4, 2016. Burkhard Blank, M.D.,
      who has served as CMO for several biopharmaceutical companies including

      interim basis. Dr. Carrazana is expected to serve as a consultant to the
      Company following his departure.
    

      “We thank Enrique for his significant contributions to Acorda during the
      last four years, as we grew from having a single product to a robust
      pipeline of six clinical-stage compounds, including three Phase 3
      programs,” said Ron Cohen, M.D., President and CEO of Acorda
      Therapeutics. “We anticipate that Burkhard, who has led multiple

      substantially to Acorda’s programs going forward."
    

      Dr. Blank has more than 25 years of industry experience, holding senior
      leadership positions with responsibility for managing international
      clinical trial programs, as well as heading regulatory affairs,
      statistics, drug safety and related departments. As CMO of Boehringer
      Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Dr. Blank oversaw the submission of
      five New Drug Applications (NDAs) and had direct responsibility for all
      aspects of presenting at two U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      Advisory Committee Meetings; all five NDAs received FDA approval.
    

      Dr. Blank has also served as a strategic advisor to several
      biotechnology companies, leading the submission process for multiple
      Investigational Drug Applications (INDs), successfully developing
      protocols for clinical trial programs, and overseeing communications
      with regulatory agencies. Dr. Blank is a Board-certified internist and
      received his medical degree from Universitaet Marburg, Germany.
    

      Prior to his appointment as interim CMO, Dr. Blank served as a
      consultant to the Company’s commercial and business development
      departments.

Acorda Appoints Burkhard Blank, M.D., as Chief Medical Officer (CMO)




Named to Position After Serving as Interim CMO Since January 2016






July 01, 2016 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



ARDSLEY, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:ACOR) 
      today announced that Burkhard Blank, M.D. has assumed the role of Chief 
      Medical Officer (CMO) effective immediately. Dr. Blank was appointed as 
      Acorda’s interim CMO in January 2016, and previously served as CMO for 
      several biopharmaceutical companies, including Boehringer Ingelheim.
    


      “I am delighted that Burkhard has joined Acorda as our CMO,” said Ron 
      Cohen, M.D., President and CEO of Acorda Therapeutics. “Burkhard brings 
      to Acorda an impressive record of successful drug development and 
      approved NDAs. This will benefit Acorda’s entire pipeline, including our 
      late-stage development programs, CVT-301 and tozadenant for Parkinson’s 
      disease."
    

      Dr. Blank’s primary responsibilities include: setting strategy for and 
      execution of development programs from clinical trials through 
      regulatory filings; oversight of post-marketing studies for approved 
      products; and management of the Company’s medical affairs, clinical 
      operations, regulatory affairs, drug safety and biostatistics 
      departments.
    

      “Acorda has a very exciting neurology pipeline with the potential to 
      address significant needs in Parkinson’s disease, post-stroke, migraine 
      and multiple sclerosis. With three separate clinical-stage programs that 
      may advance care for people with Parkinson’s disease, we are positioned 
      as a leader in PD therapeutic development,” said Burkhard Blank, M.D., 
      Chief Medical Officer of Acorda. “My top priorities are to focus on 
      moving our late-stage programs CVT-301 and tozadenant for PD toward 
      regulatory submissions, and to advance once-daily dalfampridine into 
      Phase 3 clinical trials in post-stroke walking difficulty.”
    

      Dr. Blank has more than 25 years of industry experience, holding senior 
      leadership positions with responsibility for managing international 
      clinical trial programs, as well as heading regulatory affairs, 
      statistics, drug safety and related departments. As CMO of Boehringer 
      Ingelheim, Dr. Blank oversaw the submission of five New Drug 
      Applications (NDAs) and had direct responsibility for all aspects of 
      presenting at two U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Advisory 
      Committee Meetings; subsequently, all five NDAs received FDA approval.
    

      Dr. Blank has also served as a strategic advisor to several 
      biotechnology companies, leading the submission process for multiple 
      Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs), successfully developing 
      protocols for clinical trial programs, and overseeing communications 
      with regulatory agencies. Dr. Blank received his medical degree from 
      Universitaet Marburg, Germany.
    

      Dr. Blank has collaborated with Acorda since 2014, first as consultant 
      to the Company’s commercial and business development departments, and 
      then as interim CMO beginning in January 2016.

      forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties 
      that could cause actual results to differ materially, including: the 
      ability to complete the Biotie transaction on a timely basis; the 
      ability to realize the benefits anticipated from the Biotie and Civitas 
      transactions, among other reasons because acquired development programs 
      are generally subject to all the risks inherent in the drug development 
      process and our knowledge of the risks specifically relevant to acquired 
      programs generally improves over time; the ability to successfully 
      integrate Biotie’s operations and Civitas’ operations, respectively, 
      into our operations; we may need to raise additional funds to finance 
      our expanded operations and may not be able to do so on acceptable 
      terms; our ability to successfully market and sell Ampyra

      able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval for, or 
      successfully market CVT-301, any other products under development, or 
      the products that we will acquire when we complete the Biotie 
      transaction; the occurrence of adverse safety events with our products; 
      delays in obtaining or failure to obtain and maintain regulatory 
      approval of or to successfully market Fampyra outside of the U.S. and 
      our dependence on our collaborator Biogen in connection therewith; 
      competition; failure to protect our intellectual property, to defend 
      against the intellectual property claims of others or to obtain third 
      party intellectual property licenses needed for the commercialization of 
      our products; and failure to comply with regulatory requirements could 
      result in adverse action by regulatory agencies.

      address significant needs in Parkinson’s disease, post-stroke, migraine
      and multiple sclerosis. With three separate clinical-stage programs that
      may advance care for people with Parkinson’s disease, we are positioned
      as a leader in PD therapeutic development,” said Burkhard Blank, M.D.,
      Chief Medical Officer of Acorda. “My top priorities are to focus on
      moving our late-stage programs CVT-301 and tozadenant for PD toward
      regulatory submissions, and to advance once-daily dalfampridine into
      Phase 3 clinical trials in post-stroke walking difficulty.”
    

      Dr. Blank has more than 25 years of industry experience, holding senior
      leadership positions with responsibility for managing international
      clinical trial programs, as well as heading regulatory affairs,
      statistics, drug safety and related departments. As CMO of Boehringer
      Ingelheim, Dr. Blank oversaw the submission of five New Drug
      Applications (NDAs) and had direct responsibility for all aspects of
      presenting at two U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Advisory
      Committee Meetings; subsequently, all five NDAs received FDA approval.
    

      Dr. Blank has also served as a strategic advisor to several
      biotechnology companies, leading the submission process for multiple
      Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs), successfully developing
      protocols for clinical trial programs, and overseeing communications
      with regulatory agencies. Dr. Blank received his medical degree from
      Universitaet Marburg, Germany.
    

      Dr. Blank has collaborated with Acorda since 2014, first as consultant
      to the Company’s commercial and business development departments, and
      then as interim CMO beginning in January 2016.

Forward-Looking Statement


      This press release includes forward-looking statements. All statements,
      other than statements of historical facts, regarding management's
      expectations, beliefs, goals, plans or prospects should be considered
      forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties
      that could cause actual results to differ materially, including: the
      ability to complete the Biotie transaction on a timely basis; the
      ability to realize the benefits anticipated from the Biotie and Civitas
      transactions, among other reasons because acquired development programs
      are generally subject to all the risks inherent in the drug development
      process and our knowledge of the risks specifically relevant to acquired
      programs generally improves over time; the ability to successfully
      integrate Biotie’s operations and Civitas’ operations, respectively,
      into our operations; we may need to raise additional funds to finance
      our expanded operations and may not be able to do so on acceptable
      terms; our ability to successfully market and sell Ampyra
      (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg in the U.S.; third party
      payers (including governmental agencies) may not reimburse for the use
      of Ampyra or our other products at acceptable rates or at all and may
      impose restrictive prior authorization requirements that limit or block
      prescriptions; the risk of unfavorable results from future studies of
      Ampyra or from our other research and development programs, including
      CVT-301 or any other acquired or in-licensed programs; we may not be
      able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval for, or
      successfully market CVT-301, any other products under development, or
      the products that we will acquire when we complete the Biotie
      transaction; the occurrence of adverse safety events with our products;
      delays in obtaining or failure to obtain and maintain regulatory
      approval of or to successfully market Fampyra outside of the U.S. and
      our dependence on our collaborator Biogen in connection therewith;
      competition; failure to protect our intellectual property, to defend
      against the intellectual property claims of others or to obtain third
      party intellectual property licenses needed for the commercialization of
      our products; and failure to comply with regulatory requirements could
      result in adverse action by regulatory agencies.
    

      These and other risks are described in greater detail in our filings
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We may not actually achieve
      the goals or plans described in our forward-looking statements, and
      investors should not place undue reliance on these statements.
      Forward-looking statements made in this press release are made only as
      of the date hereof, and we disclaim any intent or obligation to update
      any forward-looking statements as a result of developments occurring
      after the date of this press release.
