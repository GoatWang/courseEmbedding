NEW YORK, Aug. 31, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- BNY Mellon, the global leader in investment management and investment services, today announced that Gerald L. Hassell, BNY Mellon's president and a board member since 1998, has been appointed chairman and chief executive officer of the company, effective immediately.  Hassell also continues as BNY Mellon's president.  Robert P. Kelly has stepped down as chairman, chief executive officer and director by mutual agreement with the board of directors, due to differences in approach to managing the company.
"Gerald is ideally positioned to guide BNY Mellon through the next phase of its growth and to bring it to its full potential," said Wesley W. von Schack, lead director of BNY Mellon.  "Over the course of his more than three-decade tenure with BNY Mellon and its predecessor company, The Bank of New York, Gerald has led nearly every major division of the company, has been a key decision maker on every major business action, executive hire and promotion in the merged company, and has served on its board of directors.  He brings a broad and deep knowledge of our operations, our clients, our industry and our culture to his new roles.  As the executive currently overseeing our investment services business and our global client management function, and given his extensive and long-standing relationships with investment management clients, Gerald is exceptionally well-suited to ensure BNY Mellon maintains and strengthens its role as a global market leader," von Schack continued.  
"I am pleased to accept these new roles and am excited about the strong growth prospects for our company," said Hassell. "When we help clients succeed, we drive value for our shareholders. I look forward to working with our outstanding management team and employees to capitalize on BNY Mellon's extensive opportunities." 
"We are grateful to Bob Kelly for his leadership and the contributions he made to the company during his tenure as CEO," said von Schack.  "He played a key role in the integration of The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial following the merger and helped navigate the company through the financial crisis, securing its position as the world's leading provider of investment management and investment services. Bob Kelly is a person of the highest integrity and we wish him the best in his future pursuits." 
"It has been an honor to serve BNY Mellon, its management team and its employees during the past four years," said Kelly.  "We have navigated tremendously difficult markets and built one of the world's premier financial institutions.  I am confident that under Gerald's leadership of the firm's strong management team, BNY Mellon will continue to flourish going forward."   
Background on Gerald L. Hassell
Since joining The Bank of New York's management development program more than three decades ago, Gerald Hassell has had direct management responsibility for the company's broad range of investment services businesses, including asset servicing and issuer, broker-dealer, treasury and clearing services. He also oversees client management across the company's global businesses, as well as operations and technology. He was named to The Bank of New York's executive committee in 1994, and named president and elected to its Board of Directors in 1998.  
Mr. Hassell holds an MBA in finance from the New York University Stern School of Business and a BA in economics from Duke University.
Mr. Hassell is also on the Board of Directors of Comcast Corporation. Until recently he chaired the Board of Visitors of The Fuqua School of Business at Duke University and now serves on the Board of Trustees of Duke University. In addition he is on the Board of Visitors of Columbia University Medical Center and the boards of the New York Philharmonic, the Economic Club of New York and the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. He is also a member of The Financial Services Roundtable and Financial Services Forum and is Vice Chairman of Big Brothers Big Sisters of New York.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
