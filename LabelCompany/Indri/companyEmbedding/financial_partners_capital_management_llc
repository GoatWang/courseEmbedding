Financial Partners Capital Management |   Why Us


































































Why investors engage us as their advisors, and recommend us to others. 







Deep, long-term relationships
The depth, longevity and candor of our client relationships – with individuals, families, multiple generations, family businesses. Many here for decades. Deep experience advising offshore and in-transition investors; knowing how to navigate their unique circumstances, complexities.




Loyal, seasoned guides
Highly loyal, seasoned and unbiased guides sensibly preserving and growing wealth; acting as fiduciaries; managing risk; finding fresh opportunities; helping clients sustain their well-being.




A proven process
An integrated, flexible and time-tested investment process; top-down and bottom-up. A disciplined yet opportunistic style open to searching for value everywhere, across all asset classes.




Independent, unbiased advice
Independent fee-only advisors, completely aligned with clients’ interests; free from bias. 




Sensible, longer horizon growth
A flexibly conservative approach, long-term view; sound investment and risk management strategies; growth orientation. Also, very realistic attitudes and goal-setting; never overly ambitious or over-promising.





































“Markets are probabilistic, so in the short-term, as with gambling, it is certainly possible to make money from an advisor’s poor process — or incur a loss in spite of a perfect one. However, in the long-term, only consistent, robust and thoughtful investment processes can yield long-term results. Smart investors recognize these differences before they commit wealth.” 
 
— Aaron Cohen, President

DONOR ADVISED FUNDS: A SOLUTION FOR TAX-EFFICIENT GIVING
 VINCE MARSDEN, Partner, SVP of Financial Planning
 
The standard method of supporting our favored charities is to simply write a check, and then take the income tax deduction on our tax return. . However, a more tax-efficient approach for the donor, is to donate appreciated investment holdings (usually stocks), where you can use the current fair-market value of the investment as an income tax deduction, yet not have to pay capital gains taxes on the unrealized gain (the amount the investment has appreciated since you originally purchased it).








Those capital gains taxes can be as high as 23.6%. The illustration below assumes that a married couple, filing jointly, with an adjusted gross income in excess of $500,000 (federal income tax bracket = 39.6%), wants to make a significant charitable donation. They plan to use $50,000 of appreciated stock they own (that has a cost basis of $20,000) to fund the donation. The table below compares the results of the couple selling the stock in order to donate the cash proceeds to the charity, versus donating the securities directly to the charity instead.

GET IN TOUCH






























Financial Partners Capital Management |   Our Approach


































































We invest with a long-term perspective. Sensibly. Strategically. 







Central to our philosophy is preserving & enhancing clients’ purchasing power.
Without exposing their assets to unnecessary risk. 
Change in the markets is inevitable and can be powerful. So we invest proactively. Flexibly. Opportunistically. With an eye to continuously generating positive long-term, after-tax returns.



























We invest over the long-term and maintain steady hands.
Meaning over at least three-to-five years.
We don’t invest in what’s hot, nor jump from trend to trend. Because markets are inefficient over the short-term. Likewise, some companies may underperform in the short-run, but be capable of creating and compounding economic value over an extended period of time. We actively seek out those companies.









Fixed income investments must also meet our extensive analytical criteria.
Predominantly to protect capital and control credit risk.
We manage taxable and non-taxable fixed income securities to produce positive real rates of return over time. Our expertise allows us to invest across the opportunities within the taxable and tax-exempt landscape.



























Our process is top-down, bottom-up. Balanced. Value-driven.
Our search for value is broad. Not defined by a single measure.
We do our own detailed, fundamental research: macro- and micro-analysis of companies, securities, economic forces, market cycles, and expected rates of return for different asset classes, all to achieve a more complete and balanced view, and to moderate over-optimism and over-pessimism.

Financial Partners Capital Management |   Services


































































Our approach to your financial life is comprehensive and integrated. 











A customized mix of planning and investing services that help support and sustain your life and lifestyle. To identify and achieve your financial objectives, and to manage your financial risks.

















DIRECT INVESTMENT PROGRAM
Discretionary managed equity, fixed income and balanced portfolios constructed predominantly using individual equity and fixed income securities. Balanced portfolio allocations are based upon the needs and constraints of each client, and adjusted in response to capital market developments, and our valuation work.




PROGRAM DETAILS

DIRECT INVESTMENT PROGRAM

From its inception in 1988, FPCM has managed customized, separate-account investment portfolios for clients on a discretionary basis.  We manage equity, balanced and fixed-income portfolios for our clients, utilizing individual equities and bonds.  Our portfolio managers customize investment portfolios to reflect each client’s unique investment objectives, risk tolerance, and tax sensitivity. We construct portfolios to preserve and enhance each client’s purchasing power, without exposing them to unnecessary risk.  We are long-term investors, and our low portfolio turnover allows us to reduce our clients’ transaction costs and associated taxes.

We search anywhere for ‘value’, which we define in a broad sense, combining asset valuation, earnings, return on invested capital, and free-cash flow growth.  Our investment approach recognizes that change is inevitable, and that the economy and capital markets are cyclical and, at times, volatile. We are proactive in managing our clients’ portfolios, utilizing different strategies to achieve superior long-term investment returns, and taking a combined top-down/bottom-up approach to the investment process.  Our investment professionals are both analysts and portfolio managers, and we are constantly looking for investments that will generate risk-adjusted, excess returns.  Fundamental research, in-depth analysis, and a focus on the long-term are hallmarks of FPCM’s “Direct” investment process.


















OPEN ARCHITECTURE PROGRAM
Wrap-fee, discretionary managed portfolios principally constructed using mutual funds and ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) securities.




PROGRAM DETAILS

OPEN ARCHITECTURE PROGRAM

Similar to the “Direct” investment program approach utilizing separate-accounts, FPCM also offers a range of specifically-defined and targeted investment approaches that reflect each of our client’s unique investment horizon and return objectives..  We manage  “Conservative”, “Moderate”, “Growth” and “Growth Plus” portfolios using a mix of mutual funds and ETF securities.  These accounts are subject to an all-inclusive wrap-fee, so the account is not subject to transaction fees.  “Open Architecture” complements our “Direct Investment” program, allowing our clients to choose from two different investing approaches, to meet their individual risk tolerance and return expectations. 



















REAL ESTATE PROGRAM
FPCM offers a non-discretionary real estate investment program that allows clients, who qualify as “accredited investors”, to establish a diversified, professionally-managed real estate portfolio, in partnership with companies specialized in real estate.




PROGRAM DETAILS

REAL ESTATE PROGRAM

FPCM offers a non-discretionary real estate investment program that allows clients, who qualify as “accredited investors”, to establish a diversified, professionally managed real estate portfolio. The portfolio is structured such that over-time, our clients build investment exposure to real estate that is diversified by vintage year, geography, and property type (such as multi-family apartments and commercial office buildings). We conduct an in-depth evaluation of each potential investment opportunity and recommend specific investments. Each client makes the final decision of whether or not to invest.

We tend to focus our real estate investments on income-producing assets, with long-term capital appreciation as a secondary objective.  Each real estate investment opportunity is structured within its own Limited Liability Corporation (LLC); allowing each client to be a “member” of the LLC, to directly accrue the tax benefits of owning real estate individually, and to invest in a transparent manner as opposed to within a fund structure.  It is important to note that these investments are illiquid in nature, with no secondary market until the investment is sold.


















FINANCIAL PLANNING ADVISORY
A stand-alone, fee-based financial planning service that helps you evaluate, integrate, facilitate and optimize your financial life.




PROGRAM DETAILS

FINANCIAL PLANNING ADVISORY

In today’s fast-paced world, managing our personal finances can be a complex and time consuming task.  At FPCM our financial planning professionals function at the center of our  clients’ financial world.  We are trusted advisors who guide you through the development of a comprehensive, long-term, personal financial plan.  We partner with you to evaluate your spending requirements, education and retirement goals, insurance and asset protection needs, inflation and tax planning, gifting strategies, and trust and estate plans. Our commitment to you extends to plan execution as well.  We coordinate the efforts of your other professional advisers (such as your accountant, insurance agent, and estate attorney) to ensure that appropriate solutions are crafted and implemented for you.  Establishing this collaborative working relationship ensures the various pieces of your financial life complement and strengthen one another, and allows us to effectively monitor and adjust your financial plans as your needs change over time.

At FPCM we generate customized plans, not generic templates.  And, we don’t attempt to ‘predict’ an unknowable future.  Instead, we conduct a probabilistic assessment of various potential economic trends and changes, and analyze their impact on your portfolio of assets and liabilities.  With this assessment, the plans we help you develop are comprehensive and robust, taking in to account a wide range of variables, from spending and savings, to taxes, inflation, key legislation, shifting market trends, and your specific risk tolerance and portfolio mix. 















What we look for in an investment?

 


Return > Risk. Investing entails risk – we strive to find investment opportunities where the expected return outweighs the risk.There is no certainty in investing. By investing, we are buying into a set of probabilities. A good investment should give a robust expected return.An investment thesis that is built upon strong logic, research and financial analysis.




Business models that generate or have the potential to generate free cash flow and long-term returns.Disciplined management teams with long and strong capital discipline and value-creation records.Thinking beyond the consensus – are there valuable intangibles; what is the consensus missing; an “investment horizon” that incorporates the return potential.

Comprehensive Wealth Management
 
Financial planning is an ongoing process, not a one-time set of circumstances. The advisors at Capital Management, LLC combine an in-depth understanding of their clients’ needs with complex planning techniques for successful wealth management.
 
Capital Management provides expert financial advice from start to finish. We work closely with each client to identify his or her goals and tolerance for risk. Our advisors then prepare a comprehensive plan, which they closely manage. We even help our senior clients with bill paying, cash-flow analysis and the preparation of tax documents. 
 

We have been proactively managing our clients’ financial futures for three decades. Our team has over 150 years of combined experience. We use the same principles with our own investments. We focus on managing your risk – not protecting some large financial institution.

We are an independent wealth management firm with no ties to any financial institution or fund. We choose the best financial products to meet your needs and risk tolerance.
We rely on personal referrals to conduct our business, so we are motivated to please every client we serve.
Developing and managing your comprehensive financial strategy is our entire focus.
We are committed to supporting you in your efforts to achieve your goals.

A Proactive Approach
 
Balancing the competing investment objectives of preservation of capital (less risk) and growth of capital (more risk) requires a proactive approach. Managing investment risk through changing economic conditions requires an advisor with a flexible approach and the experience to implement a variety of strategies using all of the tools available in today’s marketplace.
 
Rigid adherence to a single investing strategy or style of portfolio management often results in unnecessary risk. Our flexible approach to portfolio strategy and portfolio construction allows us to balance capital preservation with capital growth. At Capital Management, LLC, we manage our clients’ money the same way we manage our own.
 
The stock and bond markets have valuation cycles that can be exploited to both manage investment risk (protect capital) and enhance return (grow capital). Earning reasonable returns over time in stocks, for instance, requires buying stocks when their valuations are low. When stock valuations are high, investors’ realized returns are low.
 
Through each market cycle, each client’s portfolio is:

 

Customized to his or her unique objectives and risk tolerances. 
Designed to express our best thinking for the right kind of diversification to manage investing risks. 
Composed of the managers, strategies and ideas about which we have the highest conviction. 
Adjusted proactively as economic and financial market conditions warrant. 

Contact Capital Management to learn how you can benefit from a proactive investing strategy.

The firm is listed as an Investment consultant and aims at providing discretionary investment management services to a different group of customers in the United States and other international individuals, trusts, endowments, foundations and retirement plans. FCPM has successfully combined disciplined wealth management with a commitment to client services. The firm is dedicated to each client's financial well-being inconsistent with investment strategies and impressive long-term returns.The investment industry is among the leading fastest growing industries across the globe. The industry is quite tricky as many have tried and failed to make huge losses. Understanding the global market is quite daunting since markets change with time henceforth investors have to be careful in portfolio management. Following the global financial crisis, it became very difficult for individuals and companies to invest due to the fear of losing their capital. It also became difficult for investors to identify portfolios that would bring favorable returns.FCPM has established the following philosophies to assist in making the firm a global success. [...] Financial Partners Capital Management LLC Background Financial Partners Capital Management is an employee-owned Investment Company. The firm is listed as an Investment consultant and aims at providing discretionary investment management services to a different group of customers in the United States and other international individuals, trusts, endowments, foundations and retirement plans. FCPM has successfully combined disciplined wealth management with a commitment to client services. The firm is dedicated to each client's financial well-being inconsistent with investment strategies and impressive long-term returns. [...]    [...] The top-down macro-analysis, used in conjunction with a bottom-up micro-approach, helps the company align the purely analytical view with that of the markets, thus tempering overly optimistic or pessimistic tendencies. The unpredictability of the capital markets has positioned a premium on flexibility. The principals believe that neither a traditional top-down nor a bottom-up approach to portfolio management is solely adequate. The company's decision-making process allows the company to search for a combination of asset valuation, growth in earnings and free-cash flow. In the current volatile capital market, the decision to sell is difficult as compared to the decision to buy. [...]    [...] The company also seeks external assistance from company and industrial analysts, customers and competitors. Though the process does not eliminate all the risks, it reduces risks and allows clients to be proactive rather than reactive to market volatility. Bibliography FCPM INC. (2013, May 7).

The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.

Happiness & Planning: A Comprehensive Look











Happiness & Planning: A Comprehensive Look

Wealth Management

Most people think of estate planning as the process of arranging their affairs in anticipation of death. And that obviously is the main focus of estate planning. But, done properly, estate planning can help increase our own happiness.

We all want to be happy. That seems to be why we do everything, isn't it? It's especially true with respect to our financial lives. And yet, some of us can't figure out how to get there. There have been many books published on the science of happiness, particularly in the last 10 to 15 years. And, although none of them answer the question definitively, the findings they cite give us some signposts about financial happiness.
What Impacts Our Happiness?
Many factors contribute to our lack of financial happiness. To begin with, our perception of what we need to be happy dictates how we behave and how we pursue our goals. However, it turns out that our perceptions are often faulty.We think we have far more control over future events than we do. Our memories tend to be faulty; our brains, after having experienced something, will fill in “facts” that didn't actually exist, with the result that we build a past that never happened.Lack of true imagination is common: We find it particularly difficult to imagine that we will ever think, want, or feel differently than we do now.We treasure our own uniqueness. We see ourselves as better (more intelligent, more effective in business) or even worse (more selfish), but never average. As a result, we    fail to learn from the experiences of others.
Money and happiness
We have a difficult relationship with money. We have been told that money alone does not equal happiness. However, it is possible that, in some cases, money can add to happiness.The National Academy of Sciences reported that people's emotional well-being increases along with their income, but only up to about $75,000 per year. On the other hand, it also seems that incremental increases in income once a person is safely above the poverty level (or perhaps above the annual $75,000 level) do not result in incremental increases in happiness. Studies of other countries' levels of happiness bear this out. People in Latin American countries, for instance, where average income levels are much lower, are more or less on par in the happiness department with Americans, who have the highest per capita income.It may be that Americans are not as happy as their income level would suggest because we live in a culture of stress: We are overworked and our consumer culture (like our biology) posits that feeling good is the main purpose in life, rather than a byproduct of living right.
Planning Our Way to Happiness
So what can we do with this information? Because self-control is so critical for happiness, it would seem that in-depth planning for your financial life is an important component to happiness. If you have adequate information about your financial situation and can use that information to formulate a road map for where you want to go, then you are likely to have greater autonomy, or control, and therefore may have a greater potential to be happier.Good planning is not merely “financial” planning. This is true because money alone does not make a person happier. Rather, solid planning is built on a basis of solid discovery. That is, to formulate a plan that may truly improve your life, you must first discover those key goals and issues that really motivate you, and then compare your existing financial situation against these goals to see how prepared you are to meet those goals. Once you've uncovered what is most important to you, you can begin to formulate a plan that really makes sense and that can potentially lead you to greater happiness.This kind of planning can't be done on a website or with software. It requires soul-searching and possibly some help from professionals who know how to ask the right questions and interpret the answers. But the reward for doing it the right way just might be a greater degree of happiness!
Ready, Set, Plan
Put in more tangible terms, we strongly recommend planning that proceeds in the following steps. Note that the first four steps aren't really planning at all, but rather discovery steps that are necessary before any meaningful planning can take place:Identify your key goals and issues. Make them specific and start with the nonfinancial ones. One author identified seven factors that included things like family and personal relationships, meaningful work, friends, and values as being key drivers of happiness. Think of those kinds of goals first. What might retirement look like to you? Will you be the kind of person who will always have to work — not for the money but to keep you from going crazy? If maintaining community and personal relationships is important to you, do you really need that second house? Let personal, values-based decisions drive the financial ones. Complete your own personal balance sheet. Having a personal and  detailed balance sheet lets you see at a glance what your total financial picture looks like, including assets that you might not otherwise consider, like life insurance and real estate.Identify your risk sensitivity. We've now endured the Great Recession and we know viscerally how that feels. In light of that experience, what is your emotional reaction to risk? This is less about how a financial professional might describe it and more about your reaction to it.Assemble a list of your estate planning documents.Begin the planning process with all this information at hand. Only after you've assembled all the information just described should you start the planning process.

Don't let your focus on building and preserving wealth negatively impact your family relationships and personal health.

If you're in your prime earning years, your focus is likely on building the wealth you will need to live well in retirement. Americans are living longer and health care costs are rising. Investing enough money to provide sufficient income to sustain your current lifestyle can help pave the way for a more secure retirement. But too much focus on meeting future income needs can be stressful particularly when you are in your 30s, 40s and 50s and may be facing many family commitments. How do you find a balance?Start by realizing that it's normal to feel a nerve-wracking pull between enjoying your life today and accumulating sufficient wealth to cover all your expenses in retirement. “Thinking about how much income you will need in retirement can be very daunting,” says Tracie McMillion, CFA, Head of Global Asset Allocation at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.For most people, prime working years are also prime family years — the time when children are growing up and older family members may begin to need medical care. Having a single-minded focus on wealth-building at the expense of family priorities can cause major stress, which can even impact your health. More than just an annoyance, chronic stress raises the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, anxiety disorder, and other illnesses.Burying your head in the sand isn't the answer, either. “People tend to focus more on the present than the future,” says Margie E. Lachman, Ph.D., professor of psychology and director of the Lifespan Initiative on Healthy Aging and Lifespan Lab at Brandeis University.While it can be fun to live in the moment, the secret to building wealth without damaging your health lies in taking a balanced approach. Here are six ways to find a work-life balance that allows you to enjoy today while saving for tomorrow.
1) Don't wait
If you don’t think that you will be able to meet your income needs in retirement, don't waste time beating yourself up about it. Meet with your financial team now to take immediate action. You may want to consider whether you are accumulating wealth in the most tax-efficient accounts and also revisit your regular expenditures. Having a clear plan in place can help you increase opportunities available to you when you retire.
2) Rethink retirement income
When interest rates are high, many retired investors look to bond portfolios for income. But with sustained low interest rates, those accumulating wealth for retirement as well as those already in retirement may need to consider other avenues to generate their income.“Sometimes, fear of risk makes people too conservative with retirement savings. They don't want to lose what they've worked so hard for,” McMillion says. “But you do want to get a good return on your money.&rdquo Because people are living longer in retirement, you may want to keep exposure to equities and other growth investments even as you get closer to retirement. A portfolio that relies solely on fixed income may not be able to keep up with inflation. “Talk to your investment specialist to determine which strategies align with your specific needs,” offers McMillion.
3) Involve your family
Take advantage of opportunities to talk with your family about finances. When your children are young, it can help to explain why it's so important for you to save for the future and that sometimes short-term sacrifices are necessary to make that happen. Understanding the family's financial realities may help lower everyone's stress levels when you occasionally have to make the choice to skip a Little League game or gymnastics meet in order to put in some extra hours at work. By having regular conversations about budgeting and investing, your children will be well informed as they mature and more prepared for their own financial futures.
4) Take care of your health
Neglecting self-care not only interferes with your quality of life but can also make your post-retirement health care costs skyrocket. Protect your health and your nest egg by eating a healthy diet, exercising most days of the week, maintaining a healthy weight, getting regular health checkups, and staying up to date on vaccinations. These things do take time and effort, but they can have big payoffs later in life.
5) Make your money work as hard as you do
Business owners often have their company’s balance sheet top of mind as they build their business. But once the business is passed along, their personal balance sheet will need to be structured to sustain them. As always, diversification and asset placement are key strategies to help plan for growth and income in a portfolio. Your investment professional can help you evaluate your current allocation against your anticipated needs and recommend adjustments to help keep you on track.
6) Think beyond dollars
Investing cash during your prime earning years is important, of course. But it's also essential to plan in a more holistic way as well. “Make investments in the future — not just monetary ones, but also in relationships, health, career, and education,” Lachman says. “They all can pay big dividends in the long run.”Alice Lesch Kelly is a freelance writer based in the Boston area.

Five ways you may want to adjust your retirement plan as people live longer, more active years.

Thanks to medical advances, more people are living longer and with an eye on a healthy lifestyle. That's terrific news for everyone. But a longer, more active life also means rethinking traditional views of your needs for retirement, and that should include a critical look at how your portfolio is put together.It used to be that as individuals and investors got close to and entered retirement, they changed their portfolios to have less exposure to equities and more to fixed income in order to protect what was built over the years. Drew Denning, Retirement Strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors, notes that now, however, you may need retirement income for 30 or more years. And he adds that with an inflation assumption of 3%, your costs will double in 24 years.So how do you help ensure you stay as financially healthy as you are physically fit for all those wonderful years of retirement? Denning outlines five suggestions to rethink the way you invest in retirement.
1) Reconsider your risk
For starters, Denning advises that you revisit your risk tolerance. For those transitioning from working to retirement, this advice is even more important. “The loss of a regular paycheck can cause more aggressive investors to become even more nervous when a market correction occurs. If you cannot either emotionally or financially withstand a market correction without withdrawing from the market, then your portfolio is too risky,” says Denning.This doesn't mean, however, that you should move to 100% bonds. “Keeping a healthy dose of exposure to stocks and/or equities can help a portfolio keep pace with inflation,” he adds.
2) Keep a cash reserve
Most people know the importance of keeping an emergency fund during your working years, but what about when you're drawing down on existing funds? Conventional advice about establishing a cash reserve bears repeating, according to Denning. When a market decline occurs or when you have an emergency expense, your cash reserve can be a resource not only financially but also emotionally. Denning points out that analysis shows that this reserve should cover anywhere from one to three years of essential expenses.
3) Adjust your habits for market conditions
“Consider using adaptable spending if your budget allows,” counsels Denning. “When your portfolio declines in value, reduce your planned withdrawals; and when the market increases, increase your withdrawals or spending.” This approach, he adds, “can dramatically increase the long-term sustainability of your portfolio.”
4) Focus on fixed income
Although it's important to maintain an allocation of stocks, bonds, and cash in your portfolio, pay special attention to your bond allocation, Denning advises. In today's low-interest-rate environment, many analysts are predicting a slow and steady increase in rates during the next five to 10 years. While increasing rates are desirable to retirees, it can also have a negative impact on the value of your bond portfolio.“For instance, if interest rates rise by 1%, a bond portfolio with a 10-year duration will decrease in value by 10%,” Denning says. A possible solution: “I would suggest selecting a bond portfolio with a two-to-three-year duration, where a 1% increase in rates would only result in a 2% to 3% decline in the value of the portfolio.”
5) Build your health care plan
As life spans and the number of years you spend in retirement increase, you likely will be subject to a corresponding increase in health care expenses. According to a 2015 report from HealthView Insights, the average lifetime health care expenses for a 65-year-old healthy couple retiring in 2015 and covered by Medicare parts B, D, and a supplemental insurance policy will be more than $400,000 once out-of-pocket medical expenses are added into the equation.Regarding this somewhat sobering statistic, Denning advises to pay attention to your health and address any medical issues before they have a chance to become major concerns.It's not your parents' retirement — the same strategies that worked for them may not be right for you if you're looking at spending 25 or more active years as a retiree. Taking a thorough look at your investment strategy may help ensure you'll be enjoying every one of those years.
