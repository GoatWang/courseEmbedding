This information is for borrowers attending degree-granting institutions only. You must be attending or have attended a participating school located in the U.S. during an eligible prior enrollment period. You must be a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident or a Non-U.S. citizen borrower with a creditworthy cosigner (who must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident) and required U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) documentation.

You can try again later, or call us at 877-279-7172.


When savings, scholarships, and federal aid aren’t enough, get the money you need to help pay for graduate school. The “option” in the Smart Option Student Loan name means you can choose the type of interest rate and repayment option that work best for you.


Choose a variable or fixed interest rate


Variable interest rate:   3.25% - 8.21% APR*
Graphs
Benefit
Your starting interest rate may be less than a fixed interest rate, which could result in a lower total student loan cost. 
Consideration
Your interest rate can rise or fall as the market index changes, so your graduate student loan payments may vary over time. 


Fixed interest rate:   5.74% - 8.56% APR*

Benefit
Get predictable monthly payments with an interest rate that doesn’t change over time.
Considerations
You may pay more for your total loan cost because a fixed interest rate is usually higher than a starting variable interest rate.





If you’re highly qualified, you may receive a lower interest rate than with a Federal PLUS Loan for Graduates.
Compare graduate student loan options




Pay it back now or later


Deferred repayment option



In school
In grace


After school






No payments
Principal & interest

Make no scheduled graduate student loan payments while you’re in school and in grace (six months after leaving school).*
With this graduate student loan repayment option, you'll likely pay more for your total student loan cost, since the interest rate may be higher and unpaid interest will continue to be added to your principal amount at the end of your grace period.

Fixed repayment option



In school
In grace


After school






$25 a month**
Principal & interest

Pay $25 every month** you're in school and in grace, and you can save an average of more than 9%*** on your total graduate student loan cost when compared to our deferred repayment option.*
While your total loan cost will be less than with our deferred repayment option, unpaid interest will be added to your principal amount at the end of your grace period.

Interest repayment option



In school
In grace


After school






Pay interest monthly
Principal & interest

Pay your interest every month you're in school and in grace. Your interest rate will be 0.50 percentage points lower than with the deferred repayment option* and you can save an average of more than 10%*** on your total graduate student loan cost, compared to our deferred repayment option.
Your total loan cost will likely be lower than with the other repayment options, but your graduate student loan payments will likely be larger while you’re in school and in grace.





*














Interest rates for Fixed and Deferred Repayment Options are higher than interest rates for the Interest Repayment Option. You're charged interest starting at disbursement, while in school and during your six-month separation or grace period. When you enter principal and interest repayment, Unpaid Interest will be added to your loan's Current Principal. Variable rates may increase over the life of the loan.  Advertised APRs assume a $10,000 loan to a first-year graduate with no other Sallie Mae loans. Graduate student pricing for this loan is limited to students enrolling in a Masters/Doctorate level degree program. Graduate Certificate/Continuing Education course work is not eligible. 
**


This repayment example is based on a typical loan to a first-year graduate borrower who chooses a variable rate and the Fixed Repayment Option for a $10,000 loan, with two disbursements, and a 7.12% variable APR. It works out to 27 payments of $25.00, 59 payments of $216.41 and one payment of $200.56, for a Total Loan Cost of $13,643.75. Variable rates may increase over the life of the loan.

A cosigner may be a good option

Consider a cosigner

Parents can choose how to help you
A parent or another creditworthy individual can help you pay for college by cosigning your Smart Option Student Loan or taking out a Sallie Mae Parent LoanSM.

Explore federal loans and compare to ensure you understand the terms and features. Smart Option Student Loans that have variable rates can go up over the life of the loan. Federal student loans are required by law to provide a range of flexible repayment options, including, but not limited to, income-based repayment and income-contingent repayment plans / Graduated Repayment and Extended Repayment plans, and loan forgiveness and deferment benefits, which other student loans are not required to provide.  Federal loans generally have origination fees, but are available to students regardless of income.

Borrower or cosigner must enroll in auto debit through Sallie Mae. The rate reduction benefit applies only during active repayment for as long as the Current Amount Due or Designated Amount is successfully withdrawn from the authorized bank account each month, and may therefore be suspended during a forbearance  or deferment period. 


Sallie Mae reserves the right to approve a lower loan amount than the school-certified amount.


Borrowers and cosigners may receive their FICO® Score quarterly after the first disbursement of their loan.

Types of private student loans
There are private student loans for undergraduates, graduates, students pursuing certificates, dental, medical, and health professions students, as well as loans for graduates studying for the bar exam, or relocating for medical or dental residencies. There are also parent loans, taken out by a parent, relative, or another creditworthy individual (not the student) that can help you pay for college.
Private student loans are issued by a bank or financial institution, (as opposed to federal student loans, which are offered by the government). 
What a private student loan can be used for
Private student loans—as well as federal student loans—should be used to pay for your education expenses: 

Tuition  
Room and board
Fees
Books
Supplies and equipment
Computers and electronics for school
Transportation
Personal needs at school

Don’t borrow more than you need. Your federal or private student loans shouldn’t be used for vacations, entertainment, or items that aren’t directly needed for your education. Only borrow what you can afford to pay back later.
Eligibility for private student loans
Federal and private student loans use different eligibility criteria. 
Federal student loans, offered by the government, are based on your financial and family situation, as provided in your FAFSA. 

For Subsidized Loans, the US Department of Education pays the interest while the student is in school at least half time, grace (if offered) and authorized deferment periods. 
For Unsubsidized Loans, the borrower is responsible for paying interest during the in-school or grace periods, or a post-school deferment.

Private student loans, offered by banks and financial institutions, are based on your credit profile. Your credit—and your cosigner’s credit—are evaluated, along with other information provided on your application. 
Federal student loans usually have lower interest rates than private student loans and can offer different benefits. You should generally consider them first, and then take out a private student loan if you still need money for college.



How to look for private student loans
There are differences between private student loans. It’s important to find a reputable lender; here are some ways to find the right one: 

Start with your school to see if they offer a lender list.
Confirm that the lender works with your school of choice. 
Ask others for recommendations on lenders.
Make sure you’re looking at the right loan for your education. There may be different loans for undergraduate, graduate, continuing education, or certificate courses.

How to compare private student loans
Once you’ve found a couple of lenders, you can compare their private student loan options to see what each offers:

What is the interest rate range? 
Can you choose a variable or fixed interest rate?
Are there hidden student loan fees, like an origination fee?
Is there a choice of in-school repayment options (fixed, interest only, or deferred)?
Are there benefits that help you lower your interest rate?
Is there a program that lets you make more manageable payments (like interest only) for a period of time after you graduate?
Do you have access to your FICO® Credit Score?
Are there other benefits that make the loan valuable?
Is the company reputable, with many years of experience?




Applying for private student loans
You can apply for private student loans directly from each lender’s website. You should apply after you’ve made your school decision and once you know how much you need to borrow, so you won’t have to submit separate student loan applications for schools you’re considering.  
There’s no cost to apply for private student loans. 

You’ll fill out basic personal information and financial information.
You’ll be asked to choose the interest rate type and repayment option for your loan.
You generally can apply with a creditworthy cosigner during the application process. If your parent is a cosigner, they’ll have to supply their financial information in the student loan application.

Our private student loan application process only takes about 15 minutes to receive a credit result.
Understand the student loan application process
How much should you borrow
In terms of how much you should take out for college, borrow only what you think you can afford to pay back later. Think about your future career and how much you may make in your chosen field. The College Board® suggests that your monthly payments should be no more than 10 – 15% of your starting monthly salary. To help estimate your future income potential, you can visit the US Department of Labor at bls.gov/oco/.
The amount of money you can receive from a private student loan varies by lender. If your lender requires “school certification,” your school verifies your enrollment and ensures that you’re not borrowing more than the cost of attendance (including your federal student loans, scholarships, and grants).
The role of credit in private student loans
Private student loans are credit-based. That means that a lender will look at your history of borrowing money and paying it back. Federal student loans, on the other hand, are generally based on financial situation and federal guidelines rather than credit. (Note: The Federal Parent PLUS Loan is credit-based.)
If you don’t have a credit history, you’ll need a cosigner. A cosigner can be a parent, relative, or any other creditworthy individual. Their good credit history can help you get a loan (and sometimes, a better interest rate).
Along with you, a cosigner accepts responsibility for repaying your private student loan. If you keep your loan in good standing, making on-time payments, it can be a great way to build your own credit. If you fall behind or don’t pay back your loan, your cosigner’s credit can suffer if they don’t make payments.
What happens after applying for a private student loan
After you apply for our private student loans, you’ll typically get a credit approval within 15 minutes of applying. You’ll also get notices to review, accept, and e-sign your loan terms.
Your school will have to certify your loan amount before it can be disbursed (paid to the school). Then you’ll get a Final Disclosure spelling out the details. 
You have the right to cancel your loan before it’s disbursed (sent) to your school.

Managing your private student loans
Starting with your first semester, it’ll be helpful to keep track of both your federal and private student loans. Here are some tips for managing them:

You need to apply for a new loan every year you’re in college.  
You must be enrolled in school at least half-time. 
Interest accrues on your student loan throughout the life of the loan. Making in-school payments can lower the total cost of your loan.
Once you leave school, whether you graduate or not, you’ll generally have a grace period of six months before you begin to make principal and interest payments.
As you continue to take out federal or private student loans throughout your years in college, keep a list of the lenders, how much you’re borrowing—and don’t forget to borrow responsibly.

1Any applicant who applies for the loan the month of, the month prior to, or the month after their graduation date, as stated on the application or certified by the school, will only be offered the immediate repayment option.
2Make interest only payments while the student is enrolled at least half time in a Title IV eligible school. Principal payments will begin the earlier of six months from the date on which the student graduates or falls below half time at a Title IV eligible school, but no later than 66 months from the first disbursement date.  Interest will begin to accrue as of the first disbursement date. 
3The variable interest rate currently ranges from % – % (APR % – %). The variable interest rate for each calendar month is calculated by adding the current One-month LIBOR index (published on the 25th day, or the next business day thereafter, of the month immediately preceding such calendar month, and rounded up to the nearest 1/8th of one percent) to your margin. Margins currently range from %-%. The current One-month LIBOR index is % on . LIBOR stands for London Interbank Offered Rate. The One-month LIBOR is published in the "Money Rates" section of the Wall Street Journal (Eastern Edition). The interest rate will be determined after you apply. The variable interest rate and Annual Percentage Rate (APR) depend upon (1) the student’s and cosigner’s (if applicable) credit histories, (2) the repayment option and loan term selected, and (3) the requested loan amount and other information provided on the online loan application. If approved, applicants will be notified of the rate qualified for within the stated range. The variable interest rate will increase or decrease if the One-month LIBOR index changes, but will never exceed 16%. Rates and terms effective for applications received on or after .  Interest will begin to accrue as of the first disbursement date.

In finance, a loan is the lending of money from one individual, organization or entity to another individual, organization or entity. A loan is a debt provided by an entity (organization or individual) to another entity at an interest rate, and evidenced by a promissory note which specifies, among other things, the principal amount of money borrowed, the interest rate the lender is charging, and date of repayment. A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower.
In a loan, the borrower initially receives or borrows an amount of money, called the principal, from the lender, and is obligated to pay back or repay an equal amount of money to the lender at a later time.
The loan is generally provided at a cost, referred to as interest on the debt, which provides an incentive for the lender to engage in the loan. In a legal loan, each of these obligations and restrictions is enforced by contract, which can also place the borrower under additional restrictions known as loan covenants. Although this article focuses on monetary loans, in practice any material object might be lent.
Acting as a provider of loans is one of the principal tasks for financial institutions such as banks and credit card companies. For other institutions, issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a typical source of funding.

Types[edit]
Secured[edit]
See also: Loan guarantee
A secured loan is a loan in which the borrower pledges some asset (e.g. a car or property) as collateral.
A mortgage loan is a very common type of loan, used by many individuals to purchase things. In this arrangement, the money is used to purchase the property. The financial institution, however, is given security –  a lien on the title to the house –  until the mortgage is paid off in full. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the bank would have the legal right to repossess the house and sell it, to recover sums owing to it.
In some instances, a loan taken out to purchase a new or used car may be secured by the car, in much the same way as a mortgage is secured by housing. The duration of the loan period is considerably shorter –  often corresponding to the useful life of the car. There are two types of auto loans, direct and indirect. A direct auto loan is where a bank gives the loan directly to a consumer. An indirect auto loan is where a car dealership acts as an intermediary between the bank or financial institution and the consumer.
Unsecured[edit]
Unsecured loans are monetary loans that are not secured against the borrower's assets. These may be available from financial institutions under many different guises or marketing packages:

credit card debt
personal loans
bank overdrafts
credit facilities or lines of credit
corporate bonds (may be secured or unsecured)
peer-to-peer lending

The interest rates applicable to these different forms may vary depending on the lender and the borrower. These may or may not be regulated by law. In the United Kingdom, when applied to individuals, these may come under the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
Interest rates on unsecured loans are nearly always higher than for secured loans, because an unsecured lender's options for recourse against the borrower in the event of default are severely limited. An unsecured lender must sue the borrower, obtain a money judgment for breach of contract, and then pursue execution of the judgment against the borrower's unencumbered assets (that is, the ones not already pledged to secured lenders). In insolvency proceedings, secured lenders traditionally have priority over unsecured lenders when a court divides up the borrower's assets. Thus, a higher interest rate reflects the additional risk that in the event of insolvency, the debt may be uncollectible.
Demand[edit]
Demand loans are short term loans[1] that are typically in that they do not have fixed dates for repayment and carry a floating interest rate which varies according to the prime lending rate. They can be "called" for repayment by the lending institution at any time. Demand loans may be unsecured or secured.
Subsidized[edit]
A subsidized loan is a loan on which the interest is reduced by an explicit or hidden subsidy. In the context of college loans in the United States, it refers to a loan on which no interest is accrued while a student remains enrolled in education.[2]
Concessional[edit]
A concessional loan, sometimes called a "soft loan", is granted on terms substantially more generous than market loans either through below-market interest rates, by grace periods or a combination of both.[3] Such loans may be made by foreign governments to developing countries or may be offered to employees of lending institutions as an employee benefit.
Target markets[edit]
Personal[edit]
See also: Credit (finance) § Consumer credit
Loans can also be subcategorized according to whether the debtor is an individual person (consumer) or a business. Common personal loans include mortgage loans, car loans, home equity lines of credit, credit cards, installment loans and payday loans. The credit score of the borrower is a major component in and underwriting and interest rates (APR) of these loans. The monthly payments of personal loans can be decreased by selecting longer payment terms, but overall interest paid increases as well. For car loans in the U.S., the average term was about 60 months in 2009.[citation needed]
Commercial[edit]
Main article: Business loan
Loans to businesses are similar to the above, but also include commercial mortgages and corporate bonds. Underwriting is not based upon credit score but rather credit rating.
Loan payment[edit]
The most typical loan payment type is the fully amortizing payment in which each monthly rate has the same value over time.[4]
The fixed monthly payment P for a loan of L for n months and a monthly interest rate c is:





P
=
L
⋅



c

{\displaystyle P=L\cdot {\frac {c\,(1+c)^{n}}{(1+c)^{n}-1}}}



For more information see "Monthly loan or mortgage payments" under compound interest.
Abuses in lending[edit]
Predatory lending is one form of abuse in the granting of loans. It usually involves granting a loan in order to put the borrower in a position that one can gain advantage over him or her. Where the moneylender is not authorized, they could be considered a loan shark.
Usury is a different form of abuse, where the lender charges excessive interest. In different time periods and cultures the acceptable interest rate has varied, from no interest at all to unlimited interest rates. Credit card companies in some countries have been accused by consumer organizations of lending at usurious interest rates and making money out of frivolous "extra charges".[5]
Abuses can also take place in the form of the customer abusing the lender by not repaying the loan or with an intent to defraud the lender.
United States taxes[edit]
Most of the basic rules governing how loans are handled for tax purposes in the United States are codified by both Congress (the Internal Revenue Code) and the Treasury Department (Treasury Regulations –  another set of rules that interpret the Internal Revenue Code).[6]:111
1. A loan is not gross income to the borrower.[6]:111 Since the borrower has the obligation to repay the loan, the borrower has no accession to wealth.[6]:111[7]
2. The lender may not deduct (from own gross income) the amount of the loan.[6]:111 The rationale here is that one asset (the cash) has been converted into a different asset (a promise of repayment).[6]:111 Deductions are not typically available when an outlay serves to create a new or different asset.[6]:111
3. The amount paid to satisfy the loan obligation is not deductible (from own gross income) by the borrower.[6]:111
4. Repayment of the loan is not gross income to the lender.[6]:111 In effect, the promise of repayment is converted back to cash, with no accession to wealth by the lender.[6]:111
5. Interest paid to the lender is included in the lender’s gross income.[6]:111[8] Interest paid represents compensation for the use of the lender’s money or property and thus represents profit or an accession to wealth to the lender.[6]:111 Interest income can be attributed to lenders even if the lender doesn’t charge a minimum amount of interest.[6]:112
6. Interest paid to the lender may be deductible by the borrower.[6]:111 In general, interest paid in connection with the borrower’s business activity is deductible, while interest paid on personal loans are not deductible.[6]:111The major exception here is interest paid on a home mortgage.[6]:111
Income from discharge of indebtedness[edit]
Although a loan does not start out as income to the borrower, it becomes income to the borrower if the borrower is discharged of indebtedness.[6]:111[9] Thus, if a debt is discharged, then the borrower essentially has received income equal to the amount of the indebtedness. The Internal Revenue Code lists "Income from Discharge of Indebtedness" in Section 61(a)(12) as a source of gross income.
Example: X owes Y $50,000. If Y discharges the indebtedness, then X no longer owes Y $50,000. For purposes of calculating income, this is treated the same way as if Y gave X $50,000.
For a more detailed description of the "discharge of indebtedness", look at Section 108 (Cancellation of Debt (COD) Income) of the Internal Revenue Code.[10][11]

A concessional loan, sometimes called a "soft loan", is granted on terms substantially more generous than market loans either through below-market interest rates, by grace periods or a combination of both.[3] Such loans may be made by foreign governments to developing countries or may be offered to employees of lending institutions as an employee benefit.
Target markets[edit]
Personal[edit]
See also: Credit (finance) § Consumer credit
Loans can also be subcategorized according to whether the debtor is an individual person (consumer) or a business. Common personal loans include mortgage loans, car loans, home equity lines of credit, credit cards, installment loans and payday loans. The credit score of the borrower is a major component in and underwriting and interest rates (APR) of these loans. The monthly payments of personal loans can be decreased by selecting longer payment terms, but overall interest paid increases as well. For car loans in the U.S., the average term was about 60 months in 2009.[citation needed]
Commercial[edit]
Main article: Business loan
Loans to businesses are similar to the above, but also include commercial mortgages and corporate bonds. Underwriting is not based upon credit score but rather credit rating.
Loan payment[edit]
The most typical loan payment type is the fully amortizing payment in which each monthly rate has the same value over time.[4]
The fixed monthly payment P for a loan of L for n months and a monthly interest rate c is:





P
=
L
⋅

{\displaystyle P=L\cdot {\frac {c\,(1+c)^{n}}{(1+c)^{n}-1}}}

Abuses in lending[edit]
Predatory lending is one form of abuse in the granting of loans. It usually involves granting a loan in order to put the borrower in a position that one can gain advantage over him or her. Where the moneylender is not authorized, they could be considered a loan shark.
Usury is a different form of abuse, where the lender charges excessive interest. In different time periods and cultures the acceptable interest rate has varied, from no interest at all to unlimited interest rates. Credit card companies in some countries have been accused by consumer organizations of lending at usurious interest rates and making money out of frivolous "extra charges".[5]
Abuses can also take place in the form of the customer abusing the lender by not repaying the loan or with an intent to defraud the lender.
United States taxes[edit]
Most of the basic rules governing how loans are handled for tax purposes in the United States are codified by both Congress (the Internal Revenue Code) and the Treasury Department (Treasury Regulations –  another set of rules that interpret the Internal Revenue Code).[6]:111
1. A loan is not gross income to the borrower.[6]:111 Since the borrower has the obligation to repay the loan, the borrower has no accession to wealth.[6]:111[7]
2. The lender may not deduct (from own gross income) the amount of the loan.[6]:111 The rationale here is that one asset (the cash) has been converted into a different asset (a promise of repayment).[6]:111 Deductions are not typically available when an outlay serves to create a new or different asset.[6]:111
3. The amount paid to satisfy the loan obligation is not deductible (from own gross income) by the borrower.[6]:111
4. Repayment of the loan is not gross income to the lender.[6]:111 In effect, the promise of repayment is converted back to cash, with no accession to wealth by the lender.[6]:111
5. Interest paid to the lender is included in the lender’s gross income.[6]:111[8] Interest paid represents compensation for the use of the lender’s money or property and thus represents profit or an accession to wealth to the lender.[6]:111 Interest income can be attributed to lenders even if the lender doesn’t charge a minimum amount of interest.[6]:112
6. Interest paid to the lender may be deductible by the borrower.[6]:111 In general, interest paid in connection with the borrower’s business activity is deductible, while interest paid on personal loans are not deductible.[6]:111The major exception here is interest paid on a home mortgage.[6]:111
Income from discharge of indebtedness[edit]
Although a loan does not start out as income to the borrower, it becomes income to the borrower if the borrower is discharged of indebtedness.[6]:111[9] Thus, if a debt is discharged, then the borrower essentially has received income equal to the amount of the indebtedness. The Internal Revenue Code lists "Income from Discharge of Indebtedness" in Section 61(a)(12) as a source of gross income.
Example: X owes Y $50,000. If Y discharges the indebtedness, then X no longer owes Y $50,000. For purposes of calculating income, this is treated the same way as if Y gave X $50,000.
For a more detailed description of the "discharge of indebtedness", look at Section 108 (Cancellation of Debt (COD) Income) of the Internal Revenue Code.[10][11]

In finance, a loan is the lending of money from one individual, organization or entity to another individual, organization or entity. A loan is a debt provided by an entity (organization or individual) to another entity at an interest rate, and evidenced by a promissory note which specifies, among other things, the principal amount of money borrowed, the interest rate the lender is charging, and date of repayment. A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower.
In a loan, the borrower initially receives or borrows an amount of money, called the principal, from the lender, and is obligated to pay back or repay an equal amount of money to the lender at a later time.
The loan is generally provided at a cost, referred to as interest on the debt, which provides an incentive for the lender to engage in the loan. In a legal loan, each of these obligations and restrictions is enforced by contract, which can also place the borrower under additional restrictions known as loan covenants. Although this article focuses on monetary loans, in practice any material object might be lent.
Acting as a provider of loans is one of the principal tasks for financial institutions such as banks and credit card companies. For other institutions, issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a typical source of funding.

Types[edit]
Secured[edit]
See also: Loan guarantee
A secured loan is a loan in which the borrower pledges some asset (e.g. a car or property) as collateral.
A mortgage loan is a very common type of loan, used by many individuals to purchase things. In this arrangement, the money is used to purchase the property. The financial institution, however, is given security –  a lien on the title to the house –  until the mortgage is paid off in full. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the bank would have the legal right to repossess the house and sell it, to recover sums owing to it.
In some instances, a loan taken out to purchase a new or used car may be secured by the car, in much the same way as a mortgage is secured by housing. The duration of the loan period is considerably shorter –  often corresponding to the useful life of the car. There are two types of auto loans, direct and indirect. A direct auto loan is where a bank gives the loan directly to a consumer. An indirect auto loan is where a car dealership acts as an intermediary between the bank or financial institution and the consumer.
Unsecured[edit]
Unsecured loans are monetary loans that are not secured against the borrower's assets. These may be available from financial institutions under many different guises or marketing packages:

credit card debt
personal loans
bank overdrafts
credit facilities or lines of credit
corporate bonds (may be secured or unsecured)
peer-to-peer lending

The interest rates applicable to these different forms may vary depending on the lender and the borrower. These may or may not be regulated by law. In the United Kingdom, when applied to individuals, these may come under the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
Interest rates on unsecured loans are nearly always higher than for secured loans, because an unsecured lender's options for recourse against the borrower in the event of default are severely limited. An unsecured lender must sue the borrower, obtain a money judgment for breach of contract, and then pursue execution of the judgment against the borrower's unencumbered assets (that is, the ones not already pledged to secured lenders). In insolvency proceedings, secured lenders traditionally have priority over unsecured lenders when a court divides up the borrower's assets. Thus, a higher interest rate reflects the additional risk that in the event of insolvency, the debt may be uncollectible.
Demand[edit]
Demand loans are short term loans[1] that are typically in that they do not have fixed dates for repayment and carry a floating interest rate which varies according to the prime lending rate. They can be "called" for repayment by the lending institution at any time. Demand loans may be unsecured or secured.
Subsidized[edit]
A subsidized loan is a loan on which the interest is reduced by an explicit or hidden subsidy. In the context of college loans in the United States, it refers to a loan on which no interest is accrued while a student remains enrolled in education.[2]
Concessional[edit]
A concessional loan, sometimes called a "soft loan", is granted on terms substantially more generous than market loans either through below-market interest rates, by grace periods or a combination of both.[3] Such loans may be made by foreign governments to developing countries or may be offered to employees of lending institutions as an employee benefit.

Personal[edit]
See also: Credit (finance) § Consumer credit
Loans can also be subcategorized according to whether the debtor is an individual person (consumer) or a business. Common personal loans include mortgage loans, car loans, home equity lines of credit, credit cards, installment loans and payday loans. The credit score of the borrower is a major component in and underwriting and interest rates (APR) of these loans. The monthly payments of personal loans can be decreased by selecting longer payment terms, but overall interest paid increases as well. For car loans in the U.S., the average term was about 60 months in 2009.[citation needed]
Commercial[edit]
Main article: Business loan
Loans to businesses are similar to the above, but also include commercial mortgages and corporate bonds. Underwriting is not based upon credit score but rather credit rating.
Loan payment[edit]
The most typical loan payment type is the fully amortizing payment in which each monthly rate has the same value over time.[4]
The fixed monthly payment P for a loan of L for n months and a monthly interest rate c is:





P
=
L
⋅

{\displaystyle P=L\cdot {\frac {c\,(1+c)^{n}}{(1+c)^{n}-1}}}

Abuses in lending[edit]
Predatory lending is one form of abuse in the granting of loans. It usually involves granting a loan in order to put the borrower in a position that one can gain advantage over him or her. Where the moneylender is not authorized, they could be considered a loan shark.
Usury is a different form of abuse, where the lender charges excessive interest. In different time periods and cultures the acceptable interest rate has varied, from no interest at all to unlimited interest rates. Credit card companies in some countries have been accused by consumer organizations of lending at usurious interest rates and making money out of frivolous "extra charges".[5]
Abuses can also take place in the form of the customer abusing the lender by not repaying the loan or with an intent to defraud the lender.
United States taxes[edit]
Most of the basic rules governing how loans are handled for tax purposes in the United States are codified by both Congress (the Internal Revenue Code) and the Treasury Department (Treasury Regulations –  another set of rules that interpret the Internal Revenue Code).[6]:111
1. A loan is not gross income to the borrower.[6]:111 Since the borrower has the obligation to repay the loan, the borrower has no accession to wealth.[6]:111[7]
2. The lender may not deduct (from own gross income) the amount of the loan.[6]:111 The rationale here is that one asset (the cash) has been converted into a different asset (a promise of repayment).[6]:111 Deductions are not typically available when an outlay serves to create a new or different asset.[6]:111
3. The amount paid to satisfy the loan obligation is not deductible (from own gross income) by the borrower.[6]:111
4. Repayment of the loan is not gross income to the lender.[6]:111 In effect, the promise of repayment is converted back to cash, with no accession to wealth by the lender.[6]:111
5. Interest paid to the lender is included in the lender’s gross income.[6]:111[8] Interest paid represents compensation for the use of the lender’s money or property and thus represents profit or an accession to wealth to the lender.[6]:111 Interest income can be attributed to lenders even if the lender doesn’t charge a minimum amount of interest.[6]:112
6. Interest paid to the lender may be deductible by the borrower.[6]:111 In general, interest paid in connection with the borrower’s business activity is deductible, while interest paid on personal loans are not deductible.[6]:111The major exception here is interest paid on a home mortgage.[6]:111
Income from discharge of indebtedness[edit]
Although a loan does not start out as income to the borrower, it becomes income to the borrower if the borrower is discharged of indebtedness.[6]:111[9] Thus, if a debt is discharged, then the borrower essentially has received income equal to the amount of the indebtedness. The Internal Revenue Code lists "Income from Discharge of Indebtedness" in Section 61(a)(12) as a source of gross income.
Example: X owes Y $50,000. If Y discharges the indebtedness, then X no longer owes Y $50,000. For purposes of calculating income, this is treated the same way as if Y gave X $50,000.
For a more detailed description of the "discharge of indebtedness", look at Section 108 (Cancellation of Debt (COD) Income) of the Internal Revenue Code.[10][11]

In finance, a loan is the lending of money from one individual, organization or entity to another individual, organization or entity. A loan is a debt provided by an entity (organization or individual) to another entity at an interest rate, and evidenced by a promissory note which specifies, among other things, the principal amount of money borrowed, the interest rate the lender is charging, and date of repayment. A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower.
In a loan, the borrower initially receives or borrows an amount of money, called the principal, from the lender, and is obligated to pay back or repay an equal amount of money to the lender at a later time.
The loan is generally provided at a cost, referred to as interest on the debt, which provides an incentive for the lender to engage in the loan. In a legal loan, each of these obligations and restrictions is enforced by contract, which can also place the borrower under additional restrictions known as loan covenants. Although this article focuses on monetary loans, in practice any material object might be lent.
Acting as a provider of loans is one of the principal tasks for financial institutions such as banks and credit card companies. For other institutions, issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a typical source of funding.

Types[edit]
Secured[edit]
See also: Loan guarantee
A secured loan is a loan in which the borrower pledges some asset (e.g. a car or property) as collateral.
A mortgage loan is a very common type of loan, used by many individuals to purchase things. In this arrangement, the money is used to purchase the property. The financial institution, however, is given security –  a lien on the title to the house –  until the mortgage is paid off in full. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the bank would have the legal right to repossess the house and sell it, to recover sums owing to it.
In some instances, a loan taken out to purchase a new or used car may be secured by the car, in much the same way as a mortgage is secured by housing. The duration of the loan period is considerably shorter –  often corresponding to the useful life of the car. There are two types of auto loans, direct and indirect. A direct auto loan is where a bank gives the loan directly to a consumer. An indirect auto loan is where a car dealership acts as an intermediary between the bank or financial institution and the consumer.
Unsecured[edit]
Unsecured loans are monetary loans that are not secured against the borrower's assets. These may be available from financial institutions under many different guises or marketing packages:

credit card debt
personal loans
bank overdrafts
credit facilities or lines of credit
corporate bonds (may be secured or unsecured)
peer-to-peer lending

The interest rates applicable to these different forms may vary depending on the lender and the borrower. These may or may not be regulated by law. In the United Kingdom, when applied to individuals, these may come under the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
Interest rates on unsecured loans are nearly always higher than for secured loans, because an unsecured lender's options for recourse against the borrower in the event of default are severely limited. An unsecured lender must sue the borrower, obtain a money judgment for breach of contract, and then pursue execution of the judgment against the borrower's unencumbered assets (that is, the ones not already pledged to secured lenders). In insolvency proceedings, secured lenders traditionally have priority over unsecured lenders when a court divides up the borrower's assets. Thus, a higher interest rate reflects the additional risk that in the event of insolvency, the debt may be uncollectible.
Demand[edit]
Demand loans are short term loans[1] that are typically in that they do not have fixed dates for repayment and carry a floating interest rate which varies according to the prime lending rate. They can be "called" for repayment by the lending institution at any time. Demand loans may be unsecured or secured.
Subsidized[edit]
A subsidized loan is a loan on which the interest is reduced by an explicit or hidden subsidy. In the context of college loans in the United States, it refers to a loan on which no interest is accrued while a student remains enrolled in education.[2]
Concessional[edit]
A concessional loan, sometimes called a "soft loan", is granted on terms substantially more generous than market loans either through below-market interest rates, by grace periods or a combination of both.[3] Such loans may be made by foreign governments to developing countries or may be offered to employees of lending institutions as an employee benefit.

Common personal loans include mortgage loans, car loans, home equity lines of credit, credit cards, installment loans and payday loans. The credit score of the borrower is a major component in and underwriting and interest rates (APR) of these loans. The monthly payments of personal loans can be decreased by selecting longer payment terms, but overall interest paid increases as well. For car loans in the U.S., the average term was about 60 months in 2009.[citation needed]
Commercial[edit]
Main article: Business loan
Loans to businesses are similar to the above, but also include commercial mortgages and corporate bonds. Underwriting is not based upon credit score but rather credit rating.
Loan payment[edit]
The most typical loan payment type is the fully amortizing payment in which each monthly rate has the same value over time.[4]
The fixed monthly payment P for a loan of L for n months and a monthly interest rate c is:





P
=
L
⋅

{\displaystyle P=L\cdot {\frac {c\,(1+c)^{n}}{(1+c)^{n}-1}}}

Abuses in lending[edit]
Predatory lending is one form of abuse in the granting of loans. It usually involves granting a loan in order to put the borrower in a position that one can gain advantage over him or her. Where the moneylender is not authorized, they could be considered a loan shark.
Usury is a different form of abuse, where the lender charges excessive interest. In different time periods and cultures the acceptable interest rate has varied, from no interest at all to unlimited interest rates. Credit card companies in some countries have been accused by consumer organizations of lending at usurious interest rates and making money out of frivolous "extra charges".[5]
Abuses can also take place in the form of the customer abusing the lender by not repaying the loan or with an intent to defraud the lender.
United States taxes[edit]
Most of the basic rules governing how loans are handled for tax purposes in the United States are codified by both Congress (the Internal Revenue Code) and the Treasury Department (Treasury Regulations –  another set of rules that interpret the Internal Revenue Code).[6]:111
1. A loan is not gross income to the borrower.[6]:111 Since the borrower has the obligation to repay the loan, the borrower has no accession to wealth.[6]:111[7]
2. The lender may not deduct (from own gross income) the amount of the loan.[6]:111 The rationale here is that one asset (the cash) has been converted into a different asset (a promise of repayment).[6]:111 Deductions are not typically available when an outlay serves to create a new or different asset.[6]:111
3. The amount paid to satisfy the loan obligation is not deductible (from own gross income) by the borrower.[6]:111
4. Repayment of the loan is not gross income to the lender.[6]:111 In effect, the promise of repayment is converted back to cash, with no accession to wealth by the lender.[6]:111
5. Interest paid to the lender is included in the lender’s gross income.[6]:111[8] Interest paid represents compensation for the use of the lender’s money or property and thus represents profit or an accession to wealth to the lender.[6]:111 Interest income can be attributed to lenders even if the lender doesn’t charge a minimum amount of interest.[6]:112
6. Interest paid to the lender may be deductible by the borrower.[6]:111 In general, interest paid in connection with the borrower’s business activity is deductible, while interest paid on personal loans are not deductible.[6]:111The major exception here is interest paid on a home mortgage.[6]:111
Income from discharge of indebtedness[edit]
Although a loan does not start out as income to the borrower, it becomes income to the borrower if the borrower is discharged of indebtedness.[6]:111[9] Thus, if a debt is discharged, then the borrower essentially has received income equal to the amount of the indebtedness. The Internal Revenue Code lists "Income from Discharge of Indebtedness" in Section 61(a)(12) as a source of gross income.
Example: X owes Y $50,000. If Y discharges the indebtedness, then X no longer owes Y $50,000. For purposes of calculating income, this is treated the same way as if Y gave X $50,000.
For a more detailed description of the "discharge of indebtedness", look at Section 108 (Cancellation of Debt (COD) Income) of the Internal Revenue Code.[10][11]

Borrow Responsibly
We encourage students and families to start with savings, grants, scholarships, and federal student loans to pay for college. Students and families should evaluate all anticipated monthly loan payments, and how much the student expects to earn in the future, before considering a private student loan.


This information is for borrowers attending degree-granting institutions only. You must be attending or have attended a participating school located in the U.S. during an eligible prior enrollment period. You must be a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident or a Non-U.S. citizen borrower with a creditworthy cosigner (who must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident) and required U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) documentation.  U.S. citizens and permanent residents enrolled in eligible study abroad programs or who are attending or have attended schools located outside the U.S. are also eligible.  Applications are subject to a requested minimum loan amount of $1,000.  Current credit and other eligibility criteria apply.


Interest rates for Fixed and Deferred Repayment Options are higher than interest rates for the Interest Repayment Option. You're charged interest starting at disbursement, while in school and during your six-month separation or grace period. When you enter principal and interest repayment, Unpaid Interest will be added to your loan's Current Principal. Variable rates may increase over the life of the loan.  Advertised APRs assume a $10,000 loan to a freshman with no other Sallie Mae loans.  


Sallie Mae reserves the right to approve a lower loan amount than the school-certified amount.

Our free college planning resources may help you find more ways to pay for college. Your school's financial aid office may also be able to help.

You can try again later, or call us at 877-279-7172.


When savings, scholarships, and federal aid aren’t enough, your good credit lets you give the gift of education, so you can reduce the financial pressure on your student. Get a loan in your own name that lets you choose the type of interest rate and repayment option that work best for you. 
 



Choose a variable or fixed interest rate


Variable interest rate:   4.75% - 11.12% APR*
Graphs
Benefit
Your starting interest rate may be less than a fixed interest rate, which could result in a lower total loan cost.
Consideration
Your interest rate can rise or fall as the market index changes, so your Parent Loan payments may vary over time.


Fixed interest rate:   5.74% - 12.87% APR*

Benefit
Get predictable monthly payments with an interest rate that doesn't change over time.
Consideration
You may pay more for your total loan cost because a fixed interest rate is usually higher than a starting variable interest rate.




Choose how you want to pay it back



Interest repayment option



In school


After school






Pay interest monthly(up to 48 months)
Principal & interest

Get budget flexibility—make interest-only payments while your student is in school for up to 48 months, and then principal and interest payments for 10 years.**
It will take longer to pay off your Parent Loan than with the principal and interest repayment option.

Principal and interest repayment option



In school


After school






Principal & interest
Principal & interest

You can pay off your loan faster by making principal and interest payments while your student is in school and your total Parent Loan cost will likely be lower, compared to the interest repayment option.
Your monthly Parent Loan payments will likely be higher while your student is in school, compared to the interest repayment option.




Note on loan refunds: The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed directly to the school on behalf of the student. Refunds will be handled within your school’s current process and in some cases, your school may refund loan funds directly to the student. If that occurs, the borrower and cosigner (if applicable) would still be responsible for repaying that amount to Sallie Mae. 






*



APRs for the Principal and Interest Repayment Option are higher than APRs for the Interest Repayment Option. Variable rates may increase over the life of the loan.  Advertised APRs assume a $10,000 loan to a borrower (on behalf of a freshman student) with no other Sallie Mae loans. 
**


This repayment example is based on a typical loan to a borrower (on behalf of a student) who chooses a variable rate and the Interest Repayment Option for a $10,000 loan, with two disbursements, and a 8.99% variable APR. It works out to 4 payments of $37.50, 44 payments of $75.00, 119 payments of $127.14 and one payment of $94.31, for a Total Loan Cost of $18,673.97. Variable rates may increase over the life of the loan.





Benefit from these Sallie Mae Parent Loan features





Apply for this loan as a parent, spouse, or any creditworthy individual. (Students may not apply themselves.) 






Lower your total loan cost—get a 0.25 percentage point interest rate reduction when you enroll in and make monthly payments by auto debit.






Pay no origination fee or penalty for paying off your Parent Loan before its due date.






Borrow from $1,000 up to 100% of your student’s school-certified cost of attendance.






Track your credit health with quarterly FICO® Credit Scores available online for free to you.






May qualify to receive a tax deduction on the interest you pay.





You have a choice when it comes to helping your student
Whether you want to take out a loan yourself or cosign one with your student, it's important to explore your options. The Sallie Mae Parent Loan and the Smart Option Student Loan® are separate products with different features and available interest rates.

This information is for borrowers with students attending degree-granting institutions only.

When savings, scholarships, and federal aid aren’t enough, get the money you need to help pay for graduate school. The “option” in the Smart Option Student Loan name means you can choose the type of interest rate and repayment option that work best for you.


Choose a variable or fixed interest rate


Variable interest rate:   3.25% - 8.21% APR*
Graphs
Benefit
Your starting interest rate may be less than a fixed interest rate, which could result in a lower total student loan cost.

Fixed interest rate:   5.74% - 8.56% APR*

Benefit
Get predictable monthly payments with an interest rate that doesn’t change over time.
Considerations
You may pay more for your total loan cost because a fixed interest rate is usually higher than a starting variable interest rate.

Deferred repayment option



In school
In grace


After school






No payments
Principal & interest

Make no scheduled graduate student loan payments while you’re in school and in grace (six months after leaving school).*
With this graduate student loan repayment option, you'll likely pay more for your total student loan cost, since the interest rate may be higher and unpaid interest will continue to be added to your principal amount at the end of your grace period.

Fixed repayment option



In school
In grace


After school






$25 a month**
Principal & interest

Pay $25 every month** you're in school and in grace, and you can save an average of more than 9%*** on your total graduate student loan cost when compared to our deferred repayment option.*
While your total loan cost will be less than with our deferred repayment option, unpaid interest will be added to your principal amount at the end of your grace period.

Interest repayment option



In school
In grace


After school






Pay interest monthly
Principal & interest

Pay your interest every month you're in school and in grace. Your interest rate will be 0.50 percentage points lower than with the deferred repayment option* and you can save an average of more than 10%*** on your total graduate student loan cost, compared to our deferred repayment option.
Your total loan cost will likely be lower than with the other repayment options, but your graduate student loan payments will likely be larger while you’re in school and in grace.





*














Interest rates for Fixed and Deferred Repayment Options are higher than interest rates for the Interest Repayment Option. You're charged interest starting at disbursement, while in school and during your six-month separation or grace period. When you enter principal and interest repayment, Unpaid Interest will be added to your loan's Current Principal. Variable rates may increase over the life of the loan.  Advertised APRs assume a $10,000 loan to a first-year graduate with no other Sallie Mae loans. Graduate student pricing for this loan is limited to students enrolling in a Masters/Doctorate level degree program. Graduate Certificate/Continuing Education course work is not eligible.

This repayment example is based on a typical loan to a first-year graduate borrower who chooses a variable rate and the Fixed Repayment Option for a $10,000 loan, with two disbursements, and a 7.12% variable APR. It works out to 27 payments of $25.00, 59 payments of $216.41 and one payment of $200.56, for a Total Loan Cost of $13,643.75. Variable rates may increase over the life of the loan.

A cosigner may be a good option

Consider a cosigner

Parents can choose how to help you
A parent or another creditworthy individual can help you pay for college by cosigning your Smart Option Student Loan or taking out a Sallie Mae Parent LoanSM.
