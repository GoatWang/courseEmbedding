Barings Real Estate Advisers LLC

                    Barings Real Estate Advisers (BREA) offers investment services through open and closed end private funds, separate accounts, co-investment programs, joint ventures, and mutual funds. BREA's equity investment strategy is based on the premise that real estate is cyclical in nature, and as a result, different property types and economic regions respond independently to market dynamics. All of the firm's strategies are infused with a barrier market approach, as barrier markets have the potential for higher income growth over time that is not always reflected in current pricing. The firm's private equity investment philosophy is a value-based approach based on well informed purchases of undervalued real estate, analyzing investment fundamentals and with a focused strategy supported by research and hands-on market knowledge. Their debt investment strategy has a fundamental value orientation and seeks to determine where value exists within and between markets, based on bottom up analysis of individual investments and how they compare to alternatives in a risk/reward framework. BREA seeks to capitalize on market inefficiencies that may affect individual investments, and attempts to capture incremental return advantages to provide more consistent long-term investment results. Prudent diversification is employed to safeguard against unforeseen adverse events.Brea offers advisory services in the following real estate-related investment sectors: Public Real Estate Securities; Model Portfolios; Equity Investments in Real Estate; Real Estate Debt and Alternative Investments; Mortgage Loan Servicing; and Private Investment Funds. The firm has affiliate and/or sub-advisory relationships with OppenheimerFunds, Inc., Barings Capital Real Estate Asia Ltd. (formerly known as Babson Capital Cornerstone Asia Ltd.), and Barings Real Estate Advisers Europe Finance LLP.
