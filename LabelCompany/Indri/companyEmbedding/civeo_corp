	Civeo Corporation (“Civeo” and “Company”), through its subsidiaries, manufactures for its own use and contracts to manufacture for sale modular buildings that contain gold, tantalum, tin, tungsten (collectively “3TG”).

	b)






	As such, Civeo performed a reasonable country of origin inquiry (“RCOI”) and subsequent due diligence in an effort to determine whether its sourcing practices directly or indirectly funded armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo (“DRC”) or an adjoining country (“Covered Countries”).







	 




	In accordance with Rule 13p-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Rule 13p-1”), Civeo has filed this Specialized Disclosure Form (“Form SD”) and the associated Conflict Minerals Report. Both reports are posted to a publicly available Internet site at

	Conflict Minerals Report of Civeo Corporation






	In accordance with Rule 13p-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934





	 




	This is the Conflict Minerals Report (“CMR”) of Civeo Corporation (“Civeo” or “Company”) for the reporting period ended December 31, 2015 (the “Reporting Period”) in accordance with Rule 13p-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Rule 13p-1”).




	 








	1.







	Introduction






	 




	The intent of this CMR is to summarize the results of Civeo’s good faith Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry (“RCOI”) and describe Civeo’s due diligence process in accordance with Rule 13p-1 requirements.




	 








	2.












	Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry Description








	 




	To implement the RCOI, Civeo’s Tier 1 suppliers, representing 80% of spend in Conflict Mineral supplier categories as defined by the Company, were engaged to collect information regarding the presence and sourcing of gold, tantalum, tin and tungsten (collectively “3TG”) used in the products supplied to Civeo. Information was collected and stored within Civeo’s internal record keeping systems.




	 




	Civeo’s supplier engagement efforts followed these steps:




	 





	 




	●










	An introduction was presented and discussed with Tier 1 suppliers describing the Conflict Minerals Compliance Program (“CMCP”) requirements.







	 







	 




	●










	Following the introduction, information was solicited from suppliers on the presence of 3TG in the products supplied to Civeo.







	 





	 




	●










	Throughout the process, suppliers were supported and offered assistance to ensure timely survey completion and submission compliance.







	 





	 




	●










	Civeo performed a series of follow ups with non-responsive suppliers.







	 





	 




	●










	Civeo escalated the request to senior management within the supplier organization where appropriate to ensure supplier participation in CMCP requirements.







	 




	Civeo utilized the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (“EICC”) and Global e-Sustainability Initiative (“GeSI”) Conflict Minerals Due Diligence Template (“EICC-GeSI Template”) for data collection.




	 




	Suppliers were asked to provide information regarding the sourcing of their materials with the ultimate goal of identifying the 3TG smelters or refiners (“SORs”) and associated mine countries of origin. To facilitate reporting at the product-level, the products indicated by Civeo as being sourced from a given supplier were communicated to that supplier as part of the data request. Suppliers were able to submit multiple Conflict Minerals Reporting Templates (“CMRT”) as needed to address all indicated products. In many cases, however, the supplier response defaulted to a company level CMRT and was not specifically related to products supplied to Civeo.




	 




	 


	 




	 




	 




	Supplier responses were evaluated for plausibility, consistency, and to ensure completion of the necessary detail. Additional contact with suppliers was conducted to address issues of incomplete data on EICC-GeSI Templates.

	RCOI Results








	 




	Twenty-Eight (28) suppliers were identified as having supplied materials containing 3TG to be used in Civeo’s manufacturing processes. They were considered in-scope for conflict mineral regulatory purposes and contacted as part of the RCOI process.




	 




	A total of 370 Smelters or Refiners (SORs) spanning 43 countries of origin were identified as potential 3TG SORs used by our suppliers. Below is a summary of verified smelters.

	As a result of the inquiry process, Civeo was able to identify 1SOR of 3TG with an indication of Democratic Republic of Congo/Covered Country (“DRC/CC”) sourcing.

	SOR Facility Description








	 




	Below is a summary of SORs with indications of DRC/CC sourcing and their certification status.

	Phoenix Metal Ltd.




	 




	“

	Active

	”




	 




	Committed to undergo a Conflict Free Smelter Program (CFSP) audit and have submitted signed Agreement for the Exchange of Confidential Information (AECI) and Auditee Agreement contracts.




	 




	Rwanda








	 




	 




	For those declaration responses provided at the company and user-defined level and non-specific to Civeo’s products, the presence of any particular smelter is not necessarily linked to the products that Civeo purchases and uses in its products, as


	thus,


	the information provided in such supplier responses was not at a product-level specific to the materials and components we use. As such, the identified SORs and countries of origin identified above have not been confirmed to be present in Civeo’s supply chain.




	 




	 








	5.












	Design of Due Diligence Framework








	 




	Civeo’s due diligence process is designed in accordance with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas and accompanying Supplements



	http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/GuidanceEdition2.pdf




	2



	(collectively, the “OECD Guidance”). It is important to note that the OECD Guidance was written for both upstream



	3



	and downstream



	4



	companies in the supply chain. As Civeo is a downstream company in the supply chain, our due diligence practices were tailored accordingly.

	OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, Supplement on Tin, Tantalum and Tungsten and Supplement on Gold, 2013; http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/GuidanceEdition2.pdf.

	Upstream companies refer to those between the mine and SOR. As such, the companies typically include miners, local traders, or exporters from the country of mineral origin, international concentrate traders and SORs.





	4



	 


	Downstream companies refer to those entities between the SOR and retailer. As such, the companies typically include metal traders and exchanges, component manufacturers, product manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and retailers.

	Maintained current the Company’s Conflict Minerals Policy. The Conflict Minerals Policy is publicly available at https://www.civeo.com ;








	 




	●










	Assembled an internal team to support supply chain due diligence;








	 




	●










	Established a system of controls and transparency over the mineral supply chain;








	 




	●










	Implemented internal measures to strengthen company engagement with suppliers;








	 




	●










	Included an internal grievance mechanism in the Conflict Minerals Policy;








	 




	●










	Designed and implemented a strategy to respond to supply chain risks;








	 




	●










	Implemented a risk management plan, monitored and tracked risk mitigation, reported to Senior Civeo Supply Chain Management and evaluated supplier partnerships; and








	 




	●






	Reported Annually on Supply Chain Due Diligence. This CMR and the Form SD to which it is an exhibit are publicly available at

	http://ir.civeo.com/sec.cfm

	.







	 








	7.












	Steps to Improve Due Diligence








	 




	Civeo will endeavor to continuously improve upon supply chain due diligence efforts via the following measures:





	 




	●










	Continue to assess the presence of 3TG in the supply chain;








	 




	●










	Clearly communicate expectations with regard to supplier performance, transparency and sourcing;








	 




	●










	Increase supplier response rate for RCOI process;








	 




	●










	Increase supplier rate of product specificity for RCOI process;








	 




	●












	Increase the rate in which Civeo addresses issues including implausible statements regarding no presence of 3TG and incomplete data on EICC-GeSI Templates regarding scrap and recycled sources


	;








	 




	●










	Continue to compare RCOI results to information collected via independent conflict free smelter validation programs, such as the EICC/GeSI Conflict Free Smelter Program;








	 




	●










	Engage with SORs to obtain mine of origin and transit routes and assess whether SORs have carried out all elements of due diligence for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas;








	 




	●










	Undertake additional fact and risk assessments for risks requiring mitigation, or after a change of circumstances; and








	 




	●










	Provide continuing education to members of our Conflict Minerals Compliance team, as well as employees who are involved with supplier and customer contact related to Conflict Minerals compliance.







	 




	8.     Inherent Limitations




	 




	Because Civeo is a downstream user of 3TG, we must rely on the representations and information provided by our suppliers and other third parties within our supply chain. As a result, incomplete or inaccurate information provided by the suppliers or by a SOR could affect the accuracy or completeness of the information set forth below or other information contained in this CMR.




	 




	Note also that many suppliers provided responses with SOR information based on a company or divisional level, rather than a product-level specific to the materials and components we use. As such, Civeo is unable to confirm all SORs in its supply chain for the Reporting Period.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
