The El Capitan Property

 
 
 
 






 


The El Capitan property consists of 354 Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lode claims and four patented claims. The claim block is located in Lincoln County, New Mexico and occupies a total of approximately 3,000 acres in townships T 7 S, T 8 S and range R 14 E. The BLM lode claims were staked and recorded by consultants employed by El Capitan Precious Metals, Inc. and personnel of the company. The El Capitan property is owned by El Capitan Ltd., an Arizona corporation. El Capitan Precious Metals, Inc. purchased a 40% equity interest in El Capitan Ltd. from Gold and Minerals, Inc. in 2002. In 2011 the merger of Gold and Minerals and ECPN was complete. ECPN now retains a 100% equity interest in the property.

 
 
 
 




El Capitan Project Regional Geologic Setting
The El Capitan deposit is located at the most prominent structural intersection in New Mexico, within perhaps the greatest exposed concentration of Tertiary intrusions in New Mexico (Cather and others, 1991), and is apparently underlain by a large mafic or ultramafic intrusion. The structural intersection is formed by the north-south-trending axis of the Pedernal uplift-Mescalero arch and the east-west-trending Capitan lineament. In the south, the Pedernal-Mescalero axis closely parallels the Sacramento uplift, an east-tilted fault block with evidence of at least three periods of deformation (Precambrian to late Tertiary), and in the north it closely parallels a series of faults and folds in the Picuris-Pecos trend. The Pedernal-Mescalero structural zone coincides generally with a belt of crustal thickening and alkalic intrusions (Bird, 1984) that marks the boundary between the tectonically active Rio Grande Rift (a branch of the Basin and Range) and Rocky Mountains on the west and the tectonically stable Great Plains on the east. The Pedernal-Mescalero axis appears to be offset approximately 10 miles across the Capitan lineament (Cather and others, 1991). The Capitan lineament is a well- defined basement fracture and magmatic zone that may be traced for over 300 miles from Socorro, NM into western Texas; in the area of the El Capitan deposit the lineament is reflected by the Capitan pluton.

 
 






 
 





 




 
 





 
 
 
 
 




The Tertiary intrusions form the Lincoln County porphyry belt that includes at least 11 stocks and laccoliths. The east-west elongate, 20 mile-long Capitan pluton is a Miocene aplite (granitic) laccolith that plunges westerly and underlies the El Capitan deposit. Thompson (1991) concluded that magmas in the porphyry belt were generated from both lower crustal and upper mantle sources and McLemore (1991) concluded that a diversity of mineral deposit types in the El Capitan region resulted from several different complex magmatic fractionation and differentiation events. Roberts and others (1991), show a coincident steep-gradient aeromagnetic anomaly and a gravity anomaly. These anomalies cover an area of over 270 square miles, show northerly and easterly structural trends, and are interpreted as reflecting a large mafic or ultramafic intrusion that underlies the Lincoln County porphyry belt and the El Capitan deposit. It is possible that precious metals bearing hydrothermal fluids that formed the El Capitan deposit were differentiates from this buried mafic or ultramafic intrusion.

El Capitan Realizes First-Ever Revenue from Sale of Precious Metals | Business Wire
























































El Capitan Realizes First-Ever Revenue from Sale of Precious Metals






July 17, 2017 07:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In a historic milestone, El Capitan Precious Metals, Inc. (OTCQB: ECPN) 
      announced today that its first-ever payment on the sale of precious 
      metals recovered from its El Capitan mine site has been issued to the 
      Company. The payment is for the initial shipment of precious metals 
      pursuant to a recently-announced contract with a U.S.-based refinery.
    

      According to John F Stapleton, Chairman and CEO, this initial 
      transaction established the procedures and protocol for future shipments 
      and payments that will continue throughout the year. Revenue from the 
      initial shipment will be realized in the quarter ending June 30, 2017.
    

      The metal bar shipped to the refinery was found to contain the following 
      elements by weight:
    



          Gold
        

           
        

          65%
        



          Platinum
        



          15%
        



          Silver
        



          20%
        



      The Company also announced that, in addition to this first payment, it 
      has sent a second shipment of larger quantity in the form of precious 
      metals bars to the same refinery for processing. The Company will 
      continue to process precious metals concentrates from its ore and 
      expects each successive shipment to be larger in size until maximum 
      capacity for the pilot plant is reached.
    

      Stapleton reported that management is very enthusiastic about the 
      Company becoming a revenue-generating mining operation, having 
      transitioned from an exploration company less than one year ago.
    

      A description of the major steps in this process will be the focus of 
      the July 26, 2017 Shareholders’ Informational Meeting scheduled to begin 
      at 10:00 a.m. at the Gainey Ranch Golf Club in Scottsdale, Arizona.
    

About El Capitan Precious Metals, Inc.:


      El Capitan Precious Metals, Inc. is a mining company based in 
      Scottsdale, Arizona that is principally engaged in the mining of 
      precious metals and other minerals. The Company’s primary asset is its 
      wholly owned subsidiary El Capitan, Ltd., an Arizona corporation, which 
      holds the 100% equity interest in the El Capitan property located near 
      Capitan, New Mexico. www.elcapitanpmi.com


      Forward-Looking Safe Harbor Statement:
    

      The statements included in this press release concerning predictions of 
      economic performance and management’s plans and objectives constitute 
      forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions 
      of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and 
      Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Forward-looking 
      statements are statements that are not historical facts. Words such as 
      “expect(s),” “feel(s),” “believe(s),” “will,” “may,” “anticipate(s)” and 
      similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
      These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding 
      the expected completion, timing and results of metallurgical testing, 
      interpretation of drill results, the geology, grade and continuity of 
      mineral deposits, results of initial feasibility, pre-feasibility and 
      feasibility studies and expectations with respect to the engaging in 
      strategic transactions. All of such statements are subject to risks and 
      uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally 
      beyond the control of the Company, that could cause actual results to 
      differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, 
      the forward-looking information and statements. Specifically, there can 
      be no assurance regarding the timing and terms of any transaction 
      involving the Company or its El Capitan property, or that such a 
      transaction will be completed at all. In addition, there can be no 
      assurance that periodic updates to the
    

      Company’s geological technical reports will support the Company’s prior 
      claims regarding the metallurgical value and make-up of the ore on the 
      New Mexico property. Additional risks and uncertainties affecting the 
      Company include, but are not limited to, the possibility that future 
      exploration, development, testing or mining results will not be 
      consistent with past results and/or the Company’s expectations; 
      discrepancies between different types of testing methods, some or all of 
      which may not be industry standard; the ability to mine precious and 
      other minerals on a cost effective basis; the Company’s ability to 
      successfully complete contracts for the sale of its products; 
      fluctuations in world market prices for the Company’s products; the 
      Company’s ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals; the 
      Company’s ability to obtain financing for continued operations and/or 
      the commencement of mining activities on satisfactory terms; the 
      Company’s ability to enter into and meet all the conditions to 
      consummate contracts to sell its mining properties that it chooses to 
      list for sale; and other risks and uncertainties described in the 
      Company’s filings from time to time with the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these 
      forward-looking statements that speak only as of the date hereof, and we 
      do not undertake any obligation to revise and disseminate 
      forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the 
      date hereof, or to reflect the occurrence of or non-occurrence of any 
      events.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares.
