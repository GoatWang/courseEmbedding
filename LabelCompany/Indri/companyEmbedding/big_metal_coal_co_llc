What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Welcome to Big Metal Coal TM
Big Metal Coal Co. LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cloud Peak Energy Inc., established for the purpose of developing and mining high quality sub-bituminous coal on the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana. Big Metal and the Crow Tribe signed an Exploration Agreement and an Option to Lease Agreement on January 24, 2013 during a signing ceremony in Crow Agency. These agreements were approved by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and provide Big Metal the opportunity to explore and define up to 1.4 billion tons1 of in-place coal in the southwestern portion of the Reservation and to potentially exercise rights to lease all or portions of this coal for mining, subject to additional regulatory approvals.
If Big Metal exercises its options to lease, mining on the Reservation likely would be supported by the existing operations and rail loadout infrastructure at Cloud Peak Energy’s Spring Creek Mine, which is located in Montana just off the Reservation to the east. The high-quality, low-sulfur Crow coal could meet demand for electric generating stations in the U.S. or Asia, helping to provide a safe, reliable and affordable source of energy and significant economic opportunity for the Crow Tribe.
As a Cloud Peak Energy company, Big Metal is actively committed to health, safety, environmental and community values. For more information on our commitment, visit the Environmental and Cultural Resource Protection page on this site.

Project
Cloud Peak Energy’s Spring Creek Complex
Cloud Peak Energy is planning for the potential development of a large northern Powder River Basin (NPRB) surface coal mining complex, centered on its existing Spring Creek Mine and filled out by the Youngs Creek mining project to the south and potentially the Big Metal leases to the west.
In June 2012, Cloud Peak Energy acquired Youngs Creek Mining Co., LLC and the CX Ranch lands. Youngs Creek is a greenfield surface coal mining project located on the state border in Wyoming, seven miles south of Spring Creek Mine. The CX Ranch lands encompass 38,800 acres that abut Youngs Creek to the south and Spring Creek Mine to the north and lay over a substantial deposit of coal on the Crow Indian Reservation to the west.
On January 24, 2013, Big Metal and the Crow Tribe of Indians signed an Exploration Agreement and an Option to Lease Agreement for up to 1.4 billion tons1 of in-place coal on the Crow Indian Reservation west of Spring Creek Mine. These agreements have been approved by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and provide Big Metal the opportunity to explore and define mineable coal in the southwestern portion of the Reservation and to exercise rights to lease all or portions of this coal for mining, subject to additional regulatory approvals. The potential coal deposits are Squirrel Creek, Tanner Creek and Upper Youngs Creek, each subject to a separate option to lease.
Taken together, these elements of the proposed Spring Creek Complex cover several distinct political jurisdictions – Montana, Wyoming and Crow, each with federal overlaps – and feature up to 2 billion tons of in-place coal and 46,000 acres. Cloud Peak Energy is in the process of evaluating development and production options to potentially meet demand for both the domestic and export customers.
The Big Metal Agreements
Big Metal paid the Crow Tribe $2.25 million upon signing the Exploration Agreement and Option to Lease Agreement and paid an additional $1.5 million upon BIA approval of these agreements, plus annual option payments thereafter during the initial option term that could bring total option payments to $10 million. These payments are only for the right to enter into leases. Substantial multi-million dollar payments would be made to the Tribe upon the exercise of a lease or leases, and Big Metal would then pay production taxes and royalties on coal mined and sold. These tax and royalty payments would range from 21% – 30% of the price paid by Big Metal’s customers for coal.
The initial option period expires in June 2018. There are three coal deposits covered under three separate options to lease. If Big Metal does not exercise a lease during the initial option period, the agreement will expire. However, if a lease option is exercised, the Option to Lease Agreement will be extended to 2025 for any remaining unexercised additional leases and additional option payments will be made to the Tribe. Likewise, if Big Metal exercises another option to lease prior to the end of 2025, the option agreement will be extended a final time, to 2035. If no other options are exercised by the end of 2025, the option agreement will expire at that time.
Big Metal is committed to being a good corporate citizen on the Reservation. In addition to option, exercise, royalty and tax payments, the coal mineral leases with the Tribe – once effective – provide for preferential hiring, training and promotion of Indians and certain preferences for Indian-certified contractors. In addition, Big Metal has agreed to provide annual scholarships totaling $75,000 per year under the option agreement, starting with the 2013-2014 academic year, and $150,000 per year upon the exercise and approval of a lease(s). These amounts are in 2012 dollars and will be adjusted each year for inflation.

Caring for our Communities
The communities in the vicinity of Cloud Peak Energy projects, mines and office locations play a significant role in the company’s success. Cloud Peak Energy employees live there, a large portion of the company’s business activities occur there and the communities are our neighbors. These communities include Douglas, Wright, Gillette and Sheridan, Wyoming; The Crow Nation; Billings, Montana and Broomfield, Colorado.
Cloud Peak Energy supports the communities in which it operates in a number of ways. The company encourages volunteerism among its employees, maintains a matching contributions program, provides a mechanism for organizations to directly request support and funding and conducts and responds to Community Needs Assessments, which allow community leaders to identify key priorities.
Community leadership and involvement have become hallmark characteristics of our employees. Cloud Peak Energy employees serve on boards, volunteer as coaches for local sports teams and are actively involved in a wide range of other community and service organizations.
Cloud Peak Energy is proud to be involved in and provide sponsorships for community-specific projects in The Crow Nation, Montana, Wyoming and Colorado.
Sustainable Development Program
The World Commission on Environment and Development says Sustainable Development (SD) means “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Essentially, SD balances economics, social requirements and the environment.
SD in mining means responsible development of mining reserves. Examples include minimizing environmental impacts from operations, strongly supporting local communities and economies through incorporation of SD tenets in business plans and establishing a strong base as a sustainable coal provider.
The Big Metal SD program strongly supports these principals. Specific examples include wellness and home safety programs, community participation and contribution programs that focus on community sustainability, energy use and greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, among others. The Big Metal community approach includes active involvement in community and organization partnerships and helping communities in areas that go far beyond mining and reclamation.


CONTRIBUTION REQUEST FORM
In early 2014, Cloud Peak Energy honored the newly elected members of the Crow Tribal Legislative Branch with blankets. Pictured above from left to right: Valley of the Chiefs District Senator Tyson Gros Ventre, Mighty Few District Senator Brandon Good Luck, Center Lodge District Senators Paul Hill and Eric Birdinground, Cloud Peak Energy Land and Oil & Gas Analyst Kay French, Cloud Peak Energy Facilities and Grounds Technician Reuben Falls Down, Cloud Peak Energy Land and Oil & Gas Manager Alison Ochs Gee, Black Lodge District Senators Bryson “Jolly” Rogers and Greg Three Irons and Big Horn District Senator Paul Spotted Horse.

These agreements were approved by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and provide Big Metal the opportunity to explore and define up to 1.4 billion tons of in-place coal in the southwestern portion of the Reservation and to potentially exer...cise rights to lease all or portions of this coal for mining, subject to additional regulatory approvals.  If Big Metal exercises its options to lease, mining on the Reservation likely would be supported by the existing operations and rail loadout infrastructure at Cloud Peak Energy’s Spring Creek Mine, which is located in Montana just off the Reservation to the east. The high-quality, low-sulfur Crow coal could meet demand for electric generating stations in the U.S. or Asia, helping to provide a safe, reliable and affordable source of energy and significant economic opportunity for the Crow Tribe.

What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3

2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
