We have successfully brought down the cost of power from INR 17.91 /kWh in 2009 to INR 4.67 /kWh in 2016




Low Cost of  Energy
We have lowered our cost of energy through value engineering, operational performance monitoring and efficient financial strategy. This allows us to deliver cost-effective energy for our customers. Our in-house EPC expertise lowers system costs and our advanced in-house operations and maintenance capability allows us to increase power yields and monitor project performance near real-time. Coupled with our efficient financial strategy, we believe that we are able to offer low-cost solar power solutions at high efficiency yields.




Strong Value Proposition for Our Customers
We manage the entire development and operation process, providing customers with long  term fixed price PPAs, as a result of solar not being subject to variable commodity prices Our in-house focus on high engineering standards and asset quality ensures high levels  of availability and service to our customers. 





We have lowered our cost of energy through value engineering, operational performance monitoring and efficient financial strategy









Our integrated project development, EPC, financing and O&M services has allowed us to generate efficiencies of scale that further drive down system costs 




Integrated Profile
As opposed to relying on third-party providers, our integrated profile affords us greater control over project development, construction and operation, which provides us with greater insight and certainty on our construction costs and timeline. Coupled with our low cost profile, our greater insight supports competitive new project bids at prevailing market prices, not at our direct costs.




Strong Community Partnership
We hire from local communities and generally lease land with few alternative uses, providing local communities with a stream of discretionary cash flow without displacing alternative businesses. As a result we are able to build long-term community relationships, which allows us to improve our time of completion, further reducing project development risk.

About Us













About Company
Our mission is to be the lowest-cost power producer in the world. We sell solar power in India on long-term fixed price contracts to our customers, at prices which in many cases are at or below prevailing alternatives for these customers. Since inception, we have achieved a substantial reduction in total solar project cost, which includes a significant decrease in balance of systems costs due in part to our value engineering, design and procurement efforts.




SOLAR Delivered

We developed India's first utility scale solar power project in 2009. Since then, we lowered levelized cost of energy through value engineering, operational research and efficient financial strategy to deliver cost-efficient energy for our customers. Our electricity prices are insulated from the volatility of commodity prices. We also guarantee the electricity production of our solar power plants to our customers. 


 Market Leadership We have a first mover advantage from the construction of India's first private utility scale solar photovoltaic power plant in 2009 as well as the implementation of the first megawatt scale rooftop smart city initiative in 2013. Additionally, our strong track record in policy and project development across utility scale, commercial rooftop and micro-grids projects has helped us gain a leading market share in India. 


 Reliable and Scalable As the first developer and operator of utility scale solar assets in India, we believe that we are a well-established brand that has grown alongside the rapidly growing Indian solar market since 2009. We have proven to be a reliable developer with successful and expedient execution of our development pipeline. We believe we have become one of the largest solar developers and operators in India. 


 In-house EPC and O&M expertise Our in-house EPC capabilities enhance our ability to be flexible with our choice of technology, which allows us to choose high quality equipment while optimizing the combination of total solar project cost and yield. Our in-house O&M capabilities maximize project yield and performance through proprietary system monitoring and adjustments. With the continual innovation in our EPC and O&M capabilities, we are able to offer cost-efficient solutions to all our customers.


 Superior Technical and Execution Capabilities We have developed proprietary systems that significantly reduce the time it takes to design, finance, commission, operate and maintain projects. Our lean and efficient execution expertise facilitates completion of our plants ahead of contracted completion dates, enables us to easily scale our operations without significant increases to headcount, and allows us to construct several projects in parallel without compromising on efficiency.


 Long Term Community Support We partner with local communities when we embark on a new project. We hire from local communities and generally lease land that has few alternative uses, providing local communities with a stream of discretionary cash flow without displacing alternative businesses. As a result we are able to build long term community relationships, which allows us to improve our time of completion. Economic development also drives local power demand. 


 Strong Management Our strong management team has proven execution capabilities globally. Our senior leadership team and board of directors include widely recognized experts in solar energy, energy finance and public policy, with track records of building successful businesses.

Utilities








What We Provide
We sell energy to government utilities and independent industrial and commercial customers at predictable fixed prices. Since our energy generation does not rely on fossil fuels, our electricity prices are insulated from the volatility of commodity pricing. We also guarantee the electricity production of our solar power plants to our customers. We offer integrated project development, EPC, financing, O&M services without involving multiple third party services. This approach has allowed us to generate efficiencies of scale that further drive down system costs. 

Project Highlights

 Developed India’s private first utility scale solar project
30+ operational utility scale projects1
As on March 31st 2017 
 




Our Approach


Value Engineering
Our in-house EPC allows us to enhance our system design expertise with each successive project, be flexible with our choice of technology and source from top-tier suppliers that optimizes both the system cost and power yield of the total solar block. We are able to further negotiate pricing as we have built a well-recognized brand, strong supplier relationships and significant economies of scale. As a result of our value engineering, we have seen a significant reduction in balance of system costs.


Operational Performance Monitoring
As the operator of the first utility scale solar plant in India, we have been able to develop and improve on our operational expertise with each successive project to enhance output per watt. We have an advanced tracking system that allows us to manually track the sun’s seasonality by adjusting module angles multiple times per year specific to the location, thus increasing the power yield at lower costs. Further, we operate a National Operating Control Center, or NOCC, that allows us to monitor project performance in real-time and allows us to respond rapidly to potential generation anomalies. Feedback from our operating projects also serves to further enhance our project designs, resulting in enhancements for current and new plants and further reductions to our levelized cost of energy.


Financial Strategy
Our integrated business model also increases capital efficiency. We are able to offset project equity requirements through economic benefits generated by our EPC and O&M businesses. Coupled with our asset financing strategy we are able to optimize the overall cost of capital leading to enhanced economics for our customers and shareholders. To enable rapid operation of our projects, we use short term credit facilities that are refinanced with long term project finance facilities. Our strong track record and relationships with local banks offer us significant advantages when it comes to posting capital for bids.

Why Solar 




Peak power deficits and rising power prices
India continues to be plagued by a persistent demand/supply mismatch with a six-year average energy deficit of approximately 5% according to the Ministry of Power, which has resulted in upward pressure in power prices.





Strong regulatory support
In order to reduce dependence on energy imports and curtail the current trade deficit and the resulting impact on the rupee, the Indian government has taken a number of steps to incentivize the use of renewable sources of energy. To provide further impetus to solar growth, the Indian government launched the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, or the NSM, in 2010.





Solar positioned to win among alternatives
India ranks among the highest irradiation-receiving countries in the world with more than 300 days of sunshine per year in much of the country. Solar power generation is viable across most of India, unlike wind and hydro resources which are concentrated in specific regions. In addition, as solar plants can be built near the point of consumption, power produced generally does not incur expensive transmission charges or require infrastructure or transmission investments.





Solar approaching parity
State utilities have seen power costs rise as domestic coal shortages have caused thermal generators to increasingly rely on more expensive imported fuels. An analysis of current tariffs in India indicates that solar power is now competitive with wind, new thermal capacity fueled by imported coal and grid power tariffs for commercial users. Further, diesel power, the most common replacement power source for commercial and off-grid users in the country, is far more expensive than solar power.





Transparent solar auction process
Indian solar auctions are conducted in a transparent manner that ensures bids meet minimum technical and financial criteria. Bidders must meet requirements on project development and execution history in India or the regional market, including bidder experience in the development of similar utility scale power projects. Auctions are not winner-take-all; instead, they are constructed to ensure multiple high-quality developers are allotted portions of the total capacity block.








SOLAR Delivered 
Solar power is a cleaner, faster-to-build and cost-effective alternative energy solution to coal and diesel based power, the economic and climate costs of which continue to increase every year.

About Us













About Company
Our mission is to be the lowest-cost power producer in the world. We sell solar power in India on long-term fixed price contracts to our customers, at prices which in many cases are at or below prevailing alternatives for these customers. Since inception, we have achieved a substantial reduction in total solar project cost, which includes a significant decrease in balance of systems costs due in part to our value engineering, design and procurement efforts.




SOLAR Delivered

We developed India's first utility scale solar power project in 2009. Since then, we lowered levelized cost of energy through value engineering, operational research and efficient financial strategy to deliver cost-efficient energy for our customers. Our electricity prices are insulated from the volatility of commodity prices. We also guarantee the electricity production of our solar power plants to our customers. 


 Market Leadership We have a first mover advantage from the construction of India's first private utility scale solar photovoltaic power plant in 2009 as well as the implementation of the first megawatt scale rooftop smart city initiative in 2013. Additionally, our strong track record in policy and project development across utility scale, commercial rooftop and micro-grids projects has helped us gain a leading market share in India. 


 Reliable and Scalable As the first developer and operator of utility scale solar assets in India, we believe that we are a well-established brand that has grown alongside the rapidly growing Indian solar market since 2009. We have proven to be a reliable developer with successful and expedient execution of our development pipeline. We believe we have become one of the largest solar developers and operators in India. 


 In-house EPC and O&M expertise Our in-house EPC capabilities enhance our ability to be flexible with our choice of technology, which allows us to choose high quality equipment while optimizing the combination of total solar project cost and yield. Our in-house O&M capabilities maximize project yield and performance through proprietary system monitoring and adjustments. With the continual innovation in our EPC and O&M capabilities, we are able to offer cost-efficient solutions to all our customers.


 Superior Technical and Execution Capabilities We have developed proprietary systems that significantly reduce the time it takes to design, finance, commission, operate and maintain projects. Our lean and efficient execution expertise facilitates completion of our plants ahead of contracted completion dates, enables us to easily scale our operations without significant increases to headcount, and allows us to construct several projects in parallel without compromising on efficiency.


 Long Term Community Support We partner with local communities when we embark on a new project. We hire from local communities and generally lease land that has few alternative uses, providing local communities with a stream of discretionary cash flow without displacing alternative businesses. As a result we are able to build long term community relationships, which allows us to improve our time of completion. Economic development also drives local power demand. 


 Strong Management Our strong management team has proven execution capabilities globally. Our senior leadership team and board of directors include widely recognized experts in solar energy, energy finance and public policy, with track records of building successful businesses.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM)  $-51.35      Market Cap $417.52 M     Shares Outstanding 25.92 M     Public Float 7.25 M     Yield AZRE has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

India's first distributed MW scale rooftop solar project

Azure Power Solar Plant, Gandhinagar, Gujarat | 2.5 MW










We sell Solar Power on long term fixed price contracts
at prices which in many cases are at or below prevailing alternatives









We have successfully brought down the cost of power from INR 17.91 /kWh in 2009 to INR 4.67 /kWh in 2016




Low Cost of  Energy
We have lowered our cost of energy through value engineering, operational performance monitoring and efficient financial strategy. This allows us to deliver cost-effective energy for our customers. Our in-house EPC expertise lowers system costs and our advanced in-house operations and maintenance capability allows us to increase power yields and monitor project performance near real-time. Coupled with our efficient financial strategy, we believe that we are able to offer low-cost solar power solutions at high efficiency yields.




Strong Value Proposition for Our Customers
We manage the entire development and operation process, providing customers with long  term fixed price PPAs, as a result of solar not being subject to variable commodity prices Our in-house focus on high engineering standards and asset quality ensures high levels  of availability and service to our customers. 





We have lowered our cost of energy through value engineering, operational performance monitoring and efficient financial strategy









Our integrated project development, EPC, financing and O&M services has allowed us to generate efficiencies of scale that further drive down system costs 




Integrated Profile
As opposed to relying on third-party providers, our integrated profile affords us greater control over project development, construction and operation, which provides us with greater insight and certainty on our construction costs and timeline. Coupled with our low cost profile, our greater insight supports competitive new project bids at prevailing market prices, not at our direct costs.




Strong Community Partnership
We hire from local communities and generally lease land with few alternative uses, providing local communities with a stream of discretionary cash flow without displacing alternative businesses. As a result we are able to build long-term community relationships, which allows us to improve our time of completion, further reducing project development risk.
