At the start of 2011, investment in social networking site Facebook valued it at $50bn - more than eBay and Time Warner.
Within six years, Facebook has attracted 500 million members and was hailed the fastest growing company in the world.
Facebook now wants to share the innovations in one of its datacentres with the rest of the industry through its Open Compute Project. The project aims to showcase how Facebook scales its computing infrastructure in the most efficient and economical way possible.

Strong IT focus
As you would expect, at Facebook there is a strong focus on IT. It could be argued that CIO Tim Campos embodies the new approach to CIO-level management, having moved from techie through an MBA degree to drive IT innovation in one of the world's hottest IT businesses.








"The role of IT and how you do your job is usually operational and about efficiency and cost saving. Facebook is quite frugal, but there is so much more emphasis on innovation. It is not just about the squeeze," says Campos in an interview with Computer Weekly.
"The company became an enterprise in the cloud computing age so the architecture is different [from a traditional IT department]."
The difference, according to Campos, is that there is a greater emphasis on the application of technology rather than the set-up.
The economics of cloud computing are ever-present at Facebook. "We are a SaaS [software-as-a-service] environment with not much on-premise. The scaling is easier so I do not worry about having to double up," he says.
"We have social media embedded into the information system. Everything is integrated on Facebook. We even have a recruiting system based on profiles with integrated resumes. We also use Facebook groups and tools built on Facebook to help the team collaborate," he adds.
Campos looks after the social networking site's internal IT systems for over 2,000 employees. He manages a 65-strong IT team, which represents just 3% of the total workforce. He has worked for the social network since August 2010 and says managing Facebook's IT department is not without its challenges.
Around 65% of Facebook's IT environment is Apple Macintosh-based. "From an IT perspective, that is more of a challenge because it is a hybrid environment," he says. "[Microsoft] Exchange does not work very well with the Mac. But users love the Mac."
Career progression
Campos started his career in engineering and initially resisted accepting a CIO role. He did an electrical engineering and computer science degree course at the University of California in Berkeley and started his career at Sybase as an intern while still studying.
"The internship was fairly mundane, but paid three times more than my friends' jobs working in bars. I was able to make my mark. The job was auditing and writing bug fixes. I automated it and took it from a day's work down to two hours.
"It gave me some time to have fun, but when my boss figured out what I had done he gave me more to do until I was doing the work of a full-time engineer."
Campos moved to an engineering role at Silicon Graphics, before joining internet start-up Portera Systems. At the age of 32 he became the youngest CIO of a Fortune 500 company at KLA-Tencor. He believes his technical experience in engineering as well as general management have made him successful in his ability to make a business tie.
"The line between engineering and technology is blurry. When the CIO asked me to help out with problems, I initially resisted, but he gave me an offer I could not refuse so I said I would help until the end of the summer. I fell in love with it and the type of problems it involved," he says.
"I learned that IT is more business-focused than engineering. IT is not just how to make technology work, but how to do it to produce a business result and how to translate business into technical strategy."
After studying for a MBA, Campos looked to start-ups to continue his career. But when Facebook came up, he saw it as "a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity".
Future of the CIO role
For Campos, IT is evolving into a chief operating officer role. "The new type of leader must be more business-focused. The CIO is becoming like the COO. The CIO is becoming irrelevant in some organisations and more business-focused."
Facebook needs to evolve as the internet continues to grow. "The technology used for the internet is only starting. We are on the social wave, which is giving meaning to all the internet connections. We have several waves of innovation to come. Cloud computing is one of them."
The company is beginning to move to greater openness. This goes even as far as an open-plan office. The Facebook office culture is also in keeping with the openness of its infrastructure. "No-one has an office - and I mean, no-one. Mark Zuckerberg just has a desk. It is very open and very conducive for collaboration."

Given its global reach and the homage Hollywood has paid to Facebook in the film The Social Network, IT has never been so glamorous.
 
 



 Facebook launches project to 'open source' its datacentre


  In the spirit of open source software, Facebook says it wants to share the innovations in one of its datacentres with the rest of the industry in its Open Compute Project. The social networking company claims it has built its first datacentre from the ground up, which uses 38% less energy and costs 24% less than its other datacentres. "Opening the technology means the community will make advances that we wouldn't have discovered if we had kept it secret," said the company. Facebook is publishing specifications and mechanical designs for the hardware used in the datacentre, including motherboards, power supply, server chassis, server rack, and battery cabinets. In addition, it will share its electrical and mechanical construction specifications. Lanham Napier, CEO at Rackspace, says he enthusiastically supports the Open Compute Project. "The Rackspace team has visited and studied Facebook's next-generation datacentre, our engineers continue to collaborate, and we look forward to optimising Openstack for Open Compute," he said.

3 takeaways for CIOs from Facebook CIO Tim Campos

One of the initial projects Facebook CIO Tim Campos was tasked with when he joined the company was developing an email and knowledge management strategy. He felt pretty good about his plan, but after presenting it to cofounder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and others, he quickly realized he was the only one who really liked it.
“Everyone was pretty against my idea except for me,” Campos told attendees of the CIO 100 conference in Colorado Springs, CO, on Tuesday.
A couple of days after presenting the idea, Campos said he received an email from Zuckerberg with the subject line “Will you resign?” Campos, who had only been at the company for about two months at that point, said it took him a couple of hours to work up the courage to open the email. When he did, he quickly realized it wasn’t addressed to him personally.
It was an email to the entire company.
The email came after an employee leaked destructive information, Campos said. In the email, Zuckerberg asked for whoever leaked the information to please resign, Campos said, saying that Facebook would figure out who it was eventually. Zuckerberg went on to write that the employee obviously didn’t share the same values of openness and transparency because they shared the confidential information in a way they were asked not to do.
Campos used the email as an example to emphasize three takeaways from his time at Facebook that he hoped other CIOs could take back to their organizations. The email, he said, emphasized the power of culture: “It serves to reinforce the point: We’re not going to solve this problem by locking down all the information, we’re not going to solve this problem by instituting a lot of bureaucracy, we’re going to solve this problem by embedding it into the culture.”
The three takeaways Campos shared from his time at Facebook are:
1) The Power of Culture: “At Facebook, culture is everything and it’s an incredible timesaver,” Campos said. Culture allows Facebook to cut through bureaucracy, he said. Among the ways Facebook emphasizes its culture is through its now well-known posters that say things like: "Fail harder;" "Move fast and break things;" and, "What would you do if you weren’t afraid?"
Facebook also reinforces its culture through storytelling, like the “will you resign” email example he shared with the audience. “It was an incredibly powerful message,” Campos explained. “Everybody at the company read this email and had the exact same takeaway and perspective that I did, they all thought it was immediately addressed to them. And it was striking as a result of that. And they never forgot it. And we keep talking about it - we talk about how do we handle confidential information in the company. The ‘will you resign’ email is quite famous.” There are a ton of stories like this that Facebook uses to reinforce key culture points that prevent the creation of unnecessary steering committees and advisory boards, Campos said.
2) The Power of Innovation: Campos cited two key ingredients to innovation that he believes leaders can reinforce - the power to fail and whitespace.
On failure, Campos said: “When failure is not an option, you basically encourage the workforce to do the tried and true. And the tried and true by definition is not innovative.” But when you encourage employees to fail, when you tell them that it’s good and that they can learn from it, then you create an entirely different environment, he said. He emphasized that failure is too big if it puts the company at risk (with startups being an exception, he said). The key is to fail quickly and deliberately, and experiment in ways that are proportional to what you’re trying to accomplish.
On whitespace, Campos used Facebook’s famous hackathons as an example. Employees are basically given three days off to go build what they want, with no expectations on output and no required product focus that they must follow. “You never know how these things are going to evolve. And by giving people the ability to fail and giving them the time to fail then you have created the necessary ingredients for innovation,” he said.
3) The Power of Data: “We use data to make decisions on everything. If there’s a product modification that we need to make, if there’s a product launch that we do, you can bet that there is a ton of data behind it that reinforces that this is a good idea,” Campos said.
Just how powerful can data be? Campos used an example he thought CIOs would find particularly relevant, sharing a problem his IT organization helped solve with a data-driven decision. The problem: The sales organization was complaining about how long it took to fill out expense reports. The finance and IT organizations had two competing views on the problem. Finance thought sales was just complaining. IT thought it either needed to build a new solution or get sales to use the mobile version of the existing solution.
Who was right? Neither of them. The data told a different story.
The data found that there was actually a fair amount of mobile adoption of the expense tool. The reason why it was taking sales a long time to submit expense reports was because of a policy issue, Campos said. The policy was simply modified: “With almost no lines of code, we saved every sales person over an hour of time a week. And when we announced this at our sales conference at the beginning of the year, my organization got a giant standing ovation because of this one little policy change. Imagine if we hadn’t used data to make this decision.”
The message on the slide Campos showed as he told this story hit the point home: “Data wins arguments.” He emphasized these takeaways because he said over the next 10 years, CIOS will have a huge opportunity to create economic value on data that their organizations have been sitting on for decades. But to do so requires a change in mindset and a change in leadership.
The power of data-driven business models
“Data is a powerful model for technology organizations to create economic value,” Campos said. If you get it right, data can be a unique source of differentiation because you can’t easily replicate data.
So what are the ingredients of a successful data-based business model? Campos emphasized sourcing, processing capability, utility, and scarcity. In particular, he said to look for unique sourcing for your data.
The opportunities data open up include, cost optimization, user experience, and revenue models. The issues CIOs can expect to run into as they dig into their data are: Information security; privacy expectations and regulation; leadership and culture; pace of innovation.
Campos emphasized the importance of privacy: “There are implicit and explicit privacy expectations that users have, and they have to be honored and respected.”
He left the audience with this question: “What are your information assets?”

Hoping for a raise in 2017? Here’s the outlook for IT pay























 Name: Timothy Campos
Title: CIO
Company: KLA-Tencor Corp.
Age: 34 
Industry: Manufacturing
30-second biography: One of the youngest CIOs in the Fortune 1,000, Campos started his career 15 years ago as a software engineer at Sybase Inc., where he worked for four and a half years. He's had software engineering roles at both Sybase and Silicon Graphics Inc., and engineering management positions at Silicon Graphics and Portera Systems. Campos has been in IT management for more than four years at KLA-Tencor, where he is now responsible for IT strategy and delivery for all of the company's information services. He holds a degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California, Berkeley.
Current project: "We are in the midst of a business transformation program for our services organization. The project will incorporate a variety of technologies, including IP-based call center technology, BlackBerry endpoints, connected by SAP NetWeaver portal technology to SAP R/3. All of these technologies are being linked together to enable a new means of delivering service for the semiconductor industry."
Who in the technology industry most influenced your career? "Satish Menon, who was my manager at Silicon Graphics (and is now a chief architect at Yahoo). He taught me the power of passion and perseverance."  
Technology you can't live without: "There are too many to list. I am writing this on my laptop over an HSPDA 3G connection while talking on my IP phone using a Bluetooth headset while sitting in my wife's Toyota Prius Hybrid."
Most-critical technologies for IT this year: "Software-as-a-service-based solutions are continuing to evolve. I think this means of developing and distributing software will eventually overtake most enterprise software. This is due especially to the complexity and high cost of implementing and maintaining enterprise software."
The best thing about today's technology: "It works better. Things integrate better, and they are more fault-tolerant. They are easy to use." 
The worst thing about today's technology: "It still doesn't work well. It still is hard to integrate technologies, they still break, and they are still cumbersome."
Technology can... "Transform your business."

Why Facebook is betting on Office 365 and the Microsoft Cloud 
By Guest Author, on July 12, 2016July 25, 2017 |

Shares









































Today’s post was written by Tim Campos, CIO of Facebook.
At Facebook, our mission is clear. Give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. Over 13,000 Facebook employees wake up committed to making this mission a reality for the more than 1 billion people who use Facebook every day.
Our mission is enabled by our company culture and together, they shape how we work together. The IT organization at Facebook is focused on having the most productive workforce possible and the foundation for Facebook’s continual innovation is our ethic of collaboration that empowers everyone to bring their best ideas to the table. To enable our productivity, IT at Facebook provides our people with the best tools available. Tools that can mean the difference between just having an idea and bringing that idea to life.
The people who use Facebook are distributed around the world, and to support them, our people are globally distributed as well. We facilitate their productivity by letting them choose the device and platform that is most effective for them. We collaborate on everything online—no files, no fragmented information stores—and we provide our employees with the ability to work anywhere and in any way they want.
All of this means that our IT has to be flexible and available over the web, on mobile and across platforms—wherever our employees need it. Enabling this mobility requires a secure environment that defends against cyber attacks and protects mobile devices, especially if a device gets stolen or hacked.
My team is responsible for balancing these often competing pressures. Productivity is our most important charter, but security and efficiency are also paramount. We need the right technology to empower employees, while also ensuring our business is safe at all times.
This is why we’ve implemented Office 365. Not only is it a mature and comprehensive platform, it meets our stringent security standards, it complements how we work with intelligence, flexibility, and it is continually evolving. It is globally deployed, accessible on every mobile platform we support, and it is secure. Most of all, it enables our productivity with powerful new capabilities for employees, such as the ability to share and edit traditional Excel documents at the same time, across devices.
Office 365 also brings capabilities beyond Word, Excel and PowerPoint that are hard to replicate. Delve, using the Microsoft Graph, brings a new level of intelligence to collaboration by offering additional insights on how our employees work with each other. It tells individuals who they are collaborating with the most, and how much time is being spent where. These personal analytics, and other features like Focused Inbox, help create greater effectiveness at work. We’re also very excited about how we can leverage the Microsoft Graph within our own internal Facebook tools and services. This will help our employees sift through the noise by surfacing the information that is most relevant for them.
As Microsoft continues to innovate with Office 365, we will continue adding and rolling out more services that have value for Facebook. In that way, we’re not just buying the capabilities that Office 365 offers today. We are also buying capabilities that Microsoft will offer over time, and expect even greater things to come.
—Tim Campos
