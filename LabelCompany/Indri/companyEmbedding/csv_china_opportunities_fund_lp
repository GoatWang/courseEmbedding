CSV China Opportunities Fund, L.P. (the “Fund”) is a China-focused hedge fund managed by CSV Capital Partners (CSV)
      . The investment objective of the Fund is to seek superior long-term capital appreciation by investing in a concentrated portfolio of Chinese equities. Since market-oriented reforms were initiated in 1978, China has successfully transformed itself from an agriculture-based economy into a manufacturing-based economy and from an economy almost entirely composed of state owned enterprises to one with increasing private ownership and market-based incentives. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in China has exceeded 9% per annum on average since 1997. Although China's growth is not expected to continue at this level due to the current global financial crisis, CSV believes that the long-term growth prospects in Asia, particularly in China, far outstrip those in Europe and North America. CSV expects China to continue to increase its presence in global manufacturing and to further develop other industries, such as information technology, retail, tourism and financial services. The Fund will seek to purchase a long portfolio of high quality Chinese companies when they are available at prices CSV believes are undervalued. The Fund may also opportunistically sell short other Chinese equities it believes are overvalued. The Fund will seek to invest in companies that have more than one and preferably all of the following characteristics:
• Significant barriers to entry 
• Recurring revenue
• Pricing power and high margins
• High returns on equity and assets
• Revenue growth

iShares Europe ETF (IEV) – (Cash) – Daily
Near Term Trend: Bullish / NeutralFriday’s Close: 45.24 (- 0.59%)UPDATE: Last week, I suggested holding shorts until IEV approached $42.65 and covering / buying there. I suggested shorting if IEV bounced to $44.90.European stocks rallied past the $44.90 projected resistance – indicating the door is open to more upside. I’m thinking there will be a test of recent high near $46 and then a drop to $43.85.Short up near $46 and try buying near $43.85. Upside target will be $48 for buys made at $43.85.

Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus or summary prospectus. Index performance does not include any fees or expenses, are unmanaged and cannot be invested in directly.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
Single inverse ETFs are trading tools that allow investors to either seek profit or seek to apply a hedge for an existing portfolio position that they anticipate will experience negative returns, in the short term.

The fund allows investors a tactical trading alternative to selling out of an existing position and creating a taxable event.
Since it does not employ leverage, compounding is less magnified compared to leveraged inverse ETFs.

Inverse ETFs are designed to move in the opposite direction of their benchmarks on a daily basis, and should not be expected to track their underlying indexes over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand the consequences of seeking daily inverse investment results and intend to actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The CSI 300 Index (CSIN0301) is a modified free-float market capitalization weighted index comprised of the largest and most liquid stocks in the Chinese A-share market. Index constituent stocks must have been listed for more than three months (unless the stock’s average daily A-share market capitalization since its initial listing ranks among the top 30 of all A-shares) and must not be experiencing obvious abnormal fluctuations or market manipulations. One cannot invest directly in an Index.

CXSE - WisdomTree China ex-State-Owned Enterprises Fund
































































                        As China grows and transforms, investors are demanding more ways to gain access to this unique country.
                        Recently, some investors have expressed concern over state-owned enterprises,

                                    * Formerly WisdomTree China Dividend ex-Financials Fund (CHXF).
                                    


                                    Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund before investing.
                                    To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.WISE (9473) or visit wisdomtree.com.
                                    Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.
                                    


                                    There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal.
                                    Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or
                                    political or economic uncertainty. The Fund focuses its investments in China, thereby increasing
                                    the impact of events and developments associated with the region which can adversely affect performance.
                                    Investments in emerging or offshore markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments
                                    in developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation
                                    and intervention or political developments. The Fund’s exposure to certain sectors may increases its vulnerability
                                    to any single economic or regulatory development related to such sectors. As this Fund can have a high concentration
                                    in some issuers, the Fund can be adversely impacted by changes affecting those issuers. Please read the Fund’s prospectus
                                    for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.

Capture Growth In An Emerging Market Consumer Spending ETF









































































                        The emerging market consumer story may not be a new one, but it is certainly a compelling one. Would it surprise you to learn, however,
                        that some of the leading indexes focused on emerging market consumers do not typically incorporate valuation measures? We believe this may expose
                        investors to undue risk. The WisdomTree Emerging Markets Consumer Growth Fund, EMCG, seeks to help investors more fully capitalize on the
                        emerging market consumer growth trends, while maintaining a sensitivity to valuation.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 1-866-909-WISE (9473) or click here to download a prospectus online. Read the prospectus carefully before you invest.

                                    There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal.  Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty.  Funds focusing on a single sector and/or smaller companies generally experience greater price volatility.  Investments in emerging, offshore or frontier markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation, intervention and political developments.  Due to the investment strategy of this Fund it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs.  Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.
