How Can We Help?















Practice Areas: 

Mesothelioma & AsbestosTalcum PowderCatastrophic Personal InjuryProduct LiabilityEnvironmental Toxic Torts



Leading Florida Mesothelioma Lawyer
James L. Ferraro is an experienced and accomplished Florida mesothelioma
	 lawyer with a long list of accolades and case wins. Ferraro has fashioned
	 his law practice with a focus on cases involving personal injury, product
	 liability, wrongful death, environmental toxic torts, and mesothelioma
	 and asbestos cases. For over 20 years, he has focused his career on asbestos
	 / mass tort litigation, achieving major results in injury cases including
	 jury verdicts totaling multi-millions of dollars. Mr. Ferraro obtained
	 the highest compensatory recovery in a Florida mesothelioma lawsuit in
	 1995. He also achieved a nationally record-breaking compensatory jury
	 award for a benign asbestos case in 1997.
He was among just 10 finalists from around the country considered for 1997
	 Trial Lawyer of the Year after being the first to successfully prosecute
	 a case against a major chemical giant whose products led to birth defects.
	 In a nationally televised and recognized case, Mr. Ferraro held chemical
	 giant DuPont responsible after a woman's baby was born missing eyes
	 after she was exposed to a dangerous fungicide during her pregnancy. The
	 Supreme Court of Florida re-affirmed this verdict seven years later.

	Mr. Ferraro later wrote a book about this case called
	Blindsided. This book chronicles his experience taking on the industrial giants in
	 a real-life David and Goliath fashion. You can read this incredible courtroom
	 drama and get an insider’s perspective of Mr. Ferraro’s relentless
	 approach to litigation.

Education & Background
A native of Greenwich, Connecticut, Mr. Ferraro graduated from the University
	 of Miami with a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1978
	 and, in 1979, a Master of Science degree in accounting. The following
	 year, in 1980, he went on to become a certified public accountant (CPA).
	 He also instructed an accounting class in 1982 in the University of Miami.
	 Then he went to the University of Miami School of Law in 1983 to receive
	 his law degree.
Previous Experience
Mr. Ferraro founded The Ferraro Law Firm in Miami and is one of the two
	 founding partners behind the Cleveland, Ohio firm Kelley & Ferraro
	 LLP. His firms currently represent nearly 50,000 asbestos claimants. The
	 Ferraro Law Firm also has an office in Washington, D.C., which specializes
	 in corporate tax fraud and tax whistleblower cases.

Project Blindsided

Blindsided is the true story of Mr. Ferraro’s relentless fight against one of
	 the top industrial giants in the U.S., DuPont. Mr. Ferraro took on this
	 chemical corporation on behalf of a boy with no eye­­­s—a
	 boy who suffered after his mother was doused with dangerous chemical fungicide
	 outside a u-pick farm. It was this chemical fungicide that was believed
	 to have caused his birth defect, as well the birth defects of numerous
	 other children across the country. While everyone told Mr. Ferraro the
	 battle was unwinnable, he only saw a boy and his family who needed help.
	Blindsided details the courtroom drama that unfolded over a decade-long battle between
	 a real-life David and Goliath. It depicts how Mr. Ferraro, standing alone,
	 was able to secure justice for a hurting family and hold a negligent chemical
	 company accountable, despite the odds stacked against him.

James Pitaro to Lead Disney’s Consumer Products/Interactive as Leslie Ferraro Exits Company

UPDATED: James Pitaro has been promoted to chairman of Disney’s newly combined consumer products and interactive media division, as the group’s previous co-leader, Leslie Ferraro, leaves the company.
Pitaro moves up from his position as co-chair of consumer products and interactive media and president of the interactive operation, according to an announcement from the company’s chief operating officer, Tom Staggs.
The move supplants Ferraro, who had been co-chair of the division and whose promotion last year had been touted as making her one of the highest-ranking women in the history of the entertainment conglomerate. Disney said she is exiting “to pursue marketing and consumer engagement projects, with Disney as her first client.”







Ferraro had worked more than 20 years in consumer marketing, 17 of them with Disney, with much of her work focused on the company’s theme parks. The consumer products/interactive operation she co-led with Pitaro since last May centered on Disney’s myriad licensing agreements with other companies for an array of products.
An individual close to the company said Ferraro preferred to return to a role that was more creative and consumer-facing, as opposed to the business and deal-centric position she held as co-chair of the unit.
Staggs praised Pitaro for his “strong and successful leadership” and said he brought to his expanded role “his keen eye for technological innovation and deep familiarity with the brands and franchises that continue to drive the segment’s growth.” The Disney COO also thanked Ferraro for “creating many of our parks and resorts’ most successful marketing strategies and iconic campaigns.”
Ferraro also lent her imprimatur to the change, saying that the new consumer products and interactive boss “will continue to lead the team to new levels of success.”
In his role at Disney Interactive, Pitaro led the company’s multiplatform games business, and oversaw websites and apps that serve as the online and mobile gateways to Disney and its brands. He also led social-media efforts across all platforms and spearheaded digital video projects that extend Disney storylines. Prior to joining Disney Interactive in 2010, Pitaro served as vice president of Yahoo Media, where he was responsible for guiding the strategic growth and continued development of Yahoo’s media properties.

james ferraro – human story

a musing on hyper individualism and
the marketability of neotenous plastics 
We’ve seen the invention of the latte, yoga, cloud computing, we’ve seen our selves in a plethora of unnatural places and commercial simulacra, crisis and human achievement in perpetual twilight. where will the 21st century human story go next? 
Premise of Human Story 3 
Human Story 3 in its essence is a dialectic on the discord between technological advancement ,human folly and human progress. folly characterized by assessing the loss that occurs in the way technology is being integrated and applied to our lives. progress, in that technological aid on a 21st century scale is arguably humankind’s greatest intellectual achievement. From the back drop of such grand technological achievement spawn forth the distinctive qualities that make the hyper individualistic age. Visible in developments in marketing of products and its emphasis on the individual,advances in consumerism and market values, the smartphone as a marker of the fortified empire of individualism, and from which birthed more inconspicuous signs such as the selfie, a crude and seemingly benign tech age behavior,nothing more than a symptom of the age. 
however one could speculate that it might be one of many rudimentary tale-tale signs of the coming technological singularity taking shape. I wanted this work to consider the state of humanity as we set forth towards this age of cognizant machines and automation. In that light for me our behavior seems to be illuminated more clearly. humanities inability to live up to machines programmed to reflect human virtue. 
in contrast to cognitive machines that store all of human ability in its most practical and virtuous form, human beings seem riddled un-virtuous with folly.and it makes me wonder if the dispossession of human achievement,that seems to be occurring in our present day will be restored via our successors artificial super intelligence and perhaps this is the human story 
Human Story 3 actualizes this dilemma scenario placing humans at the crossroad of technological innovation and human dispossession in musical commentary.
a smart society of thinking machines, this scenario would show the limits of human nature while at the same time exhibit the infinite possibilities of human intellectual potential, wouldn’t it be a great tragedy if
that same human intellectual spirit that brought us thus far, from the stone age to industrial age to possible future automation age became paradoxically the double edged sword of our dispossession from ourselves? 
it is my hope that Human Story 3 weaves this dialectic for the listener.
it isn’t a treaty calling on the abandonment of our tech revolution, however it is a motivation to apply our technological tools in a way that services the higher purpose of human beings, a service to what is commonly embraced as human achievement.
Human Story 3 is at one hand in praise of the human journey and our intellectual triumphs while on the other hand presenting elements of a requiem, a musical exposition of human folly in the light of the everything hyper individual age.

remastered re-ish of a limited euro-cassette that came out last year on dreamtime taped sounds (the label run by lieven martens a.k.a. dolphins into the future) — featuring new cover art and extensive liner notes by mr. ferraro — this is one of my all-time fave jammers by ferraro and it is a super unique entry in his catalog with its lonesome high desert vibe and even a roadhouse boogie jam to close things out.

The exec shuffling comes eight months after Disney merged its interactive and consumer product divisions.

Walt Disney Co. has promoted James Pitaro to chairman of Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media following the departure of his DCPI co-chair Leslie Ferraro. 
The executive shuffling comes eight months after Disney merged its interactive and consumer product divisions and named Ferraro, then president of DCP, and Pitaro, then president of Disney Interactive, as co-chairs. 
Ferraro, who spent 17 years at Disney, is leaving the company for marketing and consumer engagement projects. Disney will be her first client. "I know that Jimmy will continue to lead the team to new levels of success, and I am excited to pursue my long-term passion for marketing, branding and creating winning consumer engagement strategies," said Ferraro. 
Pitaro has been with Disney since 2010 after leaving a long career at Yahoo. He will continue to report directly to Disney COO Thomas Staggs and CEO Robert Iger. 
"Jimmy's strong and successful leadership makes him the natural choice to run DCPI at this dynamic and exciting time," said Staggs. "He brings to this expanded position his keen eye for technological innovation and deep familiarity with the brands and franchises that continue to drive the segment's growth."
Added Pitaro: "I'm incredibly honored to lead such a talented team as we combine our technology-driven efforts and our more traditional product lines and retail operations to deliver amazing new merchandise and experiences that will build on Disney's record for consistently exceeding consumer expectations."
