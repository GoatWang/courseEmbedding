Item 1.Security and Issuer 
 
This Amendment No. 2 to Schedule 13D (this “Schedule
13D”) is filed by James J. Cotter, Jr. (“Mr. Cotter”) with respect to the Class A Nonvoting Common Stock, $0.01
par value per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and Class B Voting Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class
B Common Stock”), of Reading International, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”). The principal executive
offices of the Company are located at 5995 Sepulveda Blvd., Suite 300, Culver City, California 90230.
 
 

Item 2.Identity and Background
 

(a)The name of the person filing this Schedule 13D is James J. Cotter, Jr.
 

(b)Mr. Cotter is a citizen of the United States with a principal business address at c/o Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton
LLP, Attn: Adam F. Streisand, Esq., 1901 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1600, Los Angeles, CA 90067.
 

(c)On June 18, 2015, the Company disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K that, on June 12, 2015, the board of directors of the
Company terminated the employment of Mr. Cotter as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately.
Mr. Cotter disputes the legal efficacy of such termination and reserves all legal rights with respect thereto.
 

(d)Mr. Cotter has not been convicted during the last five years in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar
misdemeanors) of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject
to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal
or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.
 

(e)Mr. Cotter was not a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result
of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating
activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.
 

(f)United States of America.
 

Item 3.Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration 
 
Explanatory Note: The number of shares of Class A Common
Stock and Class B Common Stock over which the Trust (as defined below) and the Reading Voting Trust (as defined below) have beneficial
ownership reflects how the shares are presently held of record with the Company’s transfer agent, as set forth in the Company’s
2016 Proxy Statement. The ownership of these shares is subject to litigation, and Mr. Cotter asserts that (i) the Trust should
hold 326,800 shares of Class A Common Stock presently held by the Estate of James J. Cotter Sr (the “Estate”) and (ii)
the Reading Voting Trust should hold 696,080 shares of Class B Common Stock presently held by the Trust and 427,808 shares of Class B
Common Stock presently held by the Estate.
 
Mr. Cotter is Co-Trustee and beneficiary of the James
J. Cotter Living Trust, dated August 1, 2000, as amended (the “Trust”), which presently holds of record 1,897,649 shares
of Class A Common Stock and 696,080 shares of Class B Common Stock.
 
James J. Cotter, Sr. (Mr. Cotter’s father), the
original Trustor and Trustee of the Trust, passed away on September 13, 2014, at which time the Trust became irrevocable. The Trust
provided that, upon the death of James J. Cotter, Sr., 1,023,888 shares of Class B Common Stock would be held by the Reading Voting
Trust, primarily for the benefit of the grandchildren of James J. Cotter, Sr.
 
Pursuant to the 2014 Partial Amendment to Declaration
of Trust (the “2014 Amendment”), the Reading Voting Trust is to be held, administered and distributed by Mr. Cotter
and Ann Margaret Cotter (“Margaret Cotter”), as initial Co-Trustees, and provides that, if Mr. Cotter and Margaret
Cotter are unable to agree upon an important Trust decision, they will rotate the Trusteeship of the Reading Voting Trust between
them annually each January 1st, so that thereafter there will only be one Trustee acting at any given time.
 
 
 

 3 
 

 
The validity of the 2014 Amendment has been challenged
in the proceeding described as the “Trust Litigation” below. If the 2014 Amendment is invalidated in whole
or in part, then the 2013 Trust will control. The 2013 Trust provides that Margaret Cotter shall be the trustee of the Reading
Voting Trust. Mr. Cotter seeks in connection with the Trust Litigation, among other things, to have Margaret Cotter removed from
any fiduciary capacity in connection with the Reading Voting Trust, and has also initiated proceedings for the appointment of a
trustee ad litem, in the proceeding described under “Trust Litigation - Ex Parte Petition” in Item 4 below.
 
Additionally, the Company’s 2014 Proxy
Statement (the last proxy statement signed by James J. Cotter, Sr.) disclosed that the Trust held an option to purchase
100,000 shares of Class B Common Stock. However, Ellen and Margaret Cotter, acting as co-executors of the estate of James J.
Cotter, Sr. (the “Estate”), on September 21, 2015, took the position that such option was instead held by the
Estate and exercised such option in full, with the exercise price therefor being paid with 81,463 shares of Class A Common
Stock held by the Estate. Mr. Cotter has questioned the validity of this option exercise.
 
Mr. Cotter disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares
held by the Trust, the Reading Voting Trust, the Cotter grandchildren’s trust (defined below) or the Cotter Foundation (defined
below), except to the extent of his pecuniary interest, if any, in such shares.
 

Item 4.Purpose of Transaction 
 
Mr. Cotter is involved in four judicial proceedings which
pertain to disputes regarding, among other things, (i) whether certain shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock
should be held by the Estate, the Trust or the Reading Voting Trust, (ii) whether a trustee ad litem should be appointed
to negotiate on behalf of the Trust with Patton Vision (as defined below) with respect to Patton Vision’s offer to purchase
Company shares presently held by the Trust and the Estate, and (iii) the legal efficacy of Mr. Cotter’s termination as the
Chief Executive Officer of the Company on June 12, 2015, in each case as described in more detail below. The outcome of these proceedings
could, but will not necessarily, result in a disposition of securities of the Company, an extraordinary corporate transaction involving
the Company (such as a change of control) and/or a change in the present board of directors or management of the Company.
 
Probate Litigation
 
In the probate case entitled In re the Matter of the
Estate of James J. Cotter Sr. (Case No. P-14-082942) before the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Mr. Cotter, Ellen Cotter
and Margaret Cotter are disputing whether the Reading Voting Trust, the Trust or the Estate should now hold certain shares of Class
A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Among other things, Mr. Cotter asserts that (i) the Trust should hold 326,800 shares of
Class A Common Stock presently held by the Estate and (ii) the Reading Voting Trust should hold 696,080 shares of Class B Common
Stock presently held by the Trust and 427,808 shares of Class B Common Stock presently held by the Estate. The Court has yet
to approve the inventory of assets to be included in the Estate.
 
Trust Litigation
 
On February 6, 2015, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter
filed a Petition in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, captioned In re James J. Cotter Living
Trust, dated August 1, 2000 (Case No. BP159755). The Petition, among other things, seeks relief that could determine the validity
of the 2014 Amendment and who between Margaret Cotter and James J. Cotter Jr. will have authority as Trustee or Co-Trustees of
the Reading Voting Trust to vote the shares of Class B Common Stock held by the Reading Voting Trust (in whole or in part) and
the scope and extent of such authority. On June 1, 2016, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter filed an Amended Petition. On June 17,
2016, Mr. Cotter filed an Answer and Cross-Claim to the Amended Petition, wherein, among other things, Mr. Cotter seeks to have
Margaret Cotter and Ellen Cotter treated as having predeceased their father under California Probate Code Section 259 and to disqualify
each of them from serving as a fiduciary, including with respect to the Reading Voting Trust. On October 5, 2016, Ellen Cotter
and Margaret Cotter responded to Mr. Cotter’s Answer and Cross-Claim and filed their own Cross-Claim against him seeking
essentially the same relief against Mr. Cotter.
 
 
 

 4 
 

 
 
On August 18, 2015, Mr. Cotter filed a Petition in the
same court to, among other things, (i) remove Margaret Cotter and Ellen Cotter as Co-Trustees of the Trust due to abuse of power
and multiple conflicts of interest, (ii) suspend the powers of Margaret Cotter and Ellen Cotter and appoint a temporary trustee,
(iii) seek relief for breach of trust under the California Probate Code and (iv) compel an accounting and surcharge.
 
Trial on the validity of the 2014 Amendment commenced
on July 12, 2016, and closing arguments are scheduled for August 1, 2017. Mr. Cotter’s Petition to remove Margaret Cotter
and Ellen Cotter as trustees has not yet been set for trial, but the issues of Mr. Cotter’s, Ellen Cotter’s and/or
Margaret Cotter’s suitability to serve as trustees have also been raised in connection with the trial on the validity of
the 2014 Amendment.
 
Ex Parte Petition 
 
On January 23, 2017, Patton Vision LLC (“Patton
Vision”) communicated to Margaret Cotter, Ellen Cotter, and Mr. James J. Cotter, as co-trustees of the Trust under the 2014
Amendment, an offer to buy the Trust’s shares of RDI for $18.50 a share.  Patton Vision made the same offer to Margaret
Cotter and Ellen Cotter as the sole co-executors of James J. Cotter, Sr.’s Will. On February 9, 2017, Mr. Cotter filed
an ex parte petition in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, seeking an order from the Court:
 

(i)to appoint a trustee ad litem for the Trust;
 

(ii)to grant the trustee ad litem with full power, authority and protections under the Trust to evaluate the offer from
Patton Vision, conduct due diligence, negotiate with Patton Vision or any other potential offerors, and take all actions necessary
or appropriate to consummate the sale of the shares held by the Trust, including but not limited to:
 

(a)communicate solely with Patton Vision regarding their offer to purchase the shares held by the Trust,
 

(b)receive solely and exclusively all offers for the purchase of the shares held by the Trust,
 

(c)enter into purchase and sale agreements with respect to the shares held in the Trust,
 

(d)take all actions necessary to carry out the terms, conditions and obligations of any purchase and sale agreement with respect
to the shares held in the Trust, including negotiating and any modifications thereto,
 

(e)receive all proceeds from the sale of the shares held in the Trust,
 

(f)return to the co-trustees of the Trust (Mr. Cotter, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter) the net proceeds of the sale of the shares
held in the Trust to be invested, managed and distributed in accordance with the terms of the Trust, and
 



 
(g)
hire investment advisors,
tax advisors, accountants, attorneys or any other advisors the trustee ad litem deems 	necessary and reasonable;

  

(iii)to suspend temporarily the powers of Mr. Cotter, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter with respect to all of the foregoing and
within matters until further orders of the Court;
 

(iv)to allow the trustee ad litem compensation, calculated at the trustees normal hourly rate,
 

(v)to instruct the trustee to take all actions consistent with such Order, and
 

(vi)to grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
 
 
 
 

 5 
 

 
On February 23, 2017, the Court granted the ex parte
petition as modified by the Court as follows: the Court appointed an expert under Section 730 of the California Evidence Code (“Section
730 Expert”) for the purpose of evaluating the January 23, 2017 offer from Patton Vision to purchase the Trust’s shares,
and instructed the Section 730 Expert (i) to undertake sufficient diligence to evaluate the offer from Patton Vision, including
without limitation, by receiving and considering information from Patton Vision, the Company, Mr. Cotter, Margaret Cotter and Ellen
Cotter that may be relevant to such offer and (ii) to submit a report to the Court no later than April 1, 2017 of the Section 730
Expert’s opinions and/or conclusions and recommendations for next steps.
 
On March 1, 2017, the Court appointed a guardian ad
litem to represent the beneficiaries under the Trust and directed the guardian ad litem to report to the Court by April
1, 2017. The Court held additional hearings on the ex parte petition thereafter. Multiple additional briefs have been filed by
Mr. Cotter, Ellen and Margaret Cotter, the guardian ad litem, and the Company, and the Court has also ordered supplemental
briefing to be filed on July 21, 2017. Certain portions of the briefing filed to date have been sealed under court order. As of
the date hereof, the Court has not yet ruled as to whether or not to appoint a trustee ad litem in response to the ex parte
petition.
 
Derivative Action
 
On June 12, 2015, Mr. Cotter, on behalf of the Company,
commenced a derivative action entitled James J. Cotter Jr. v. Margaret Cotter, et al., Case No. A-15-719860-V in the Eighth Judicial
District Court of the State of Nevada for Clark County (the “Derivative Action”) against each of the other directors
of the Company, including Ellen and Margaret Cotter, for breaches of fiduciary duty, including the duties of loyalty, care and/or
disclosure, and for aiding and abetting fiduciary breaches. Mr. Cotter amended his complaint twice, adding allegations about subsequent
events, dismissing one (by then former) director without prejudice, and adding as defendants two individuals subsequently added
to the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”).
 
The pending Second Amended Complaint
(the “SAC”) in the Derivative Action alleges that certain of the director defendants, including Ellen and
Margaret Cotter, threatened to terminate Mr. Cotter as President and CEO of the Company if he did not enter into an agreement
with Ellen and Margaret Cotter to resolve the Trust Litigation on terms satisfactory to them, which terms included making
Margaret Cotter the sole trustee of the Reading Voting Trust. The SAC further alleges that after Mr. Cotter failed to
acquiesce to the threats of termination, certain of the director defendants terminated him as President and CEO of the
Company. The SAC further alleges that when Ellen Cotter was appointed interim CEO upon the termination of Mr. Cotter as CEO,
she pressured Mr. Cotter to resign from the from the Board by falsely claiming that his executive employment agreement
required him to do so and by threatening to terminate certain employment benefits, including the health and medical benefits
the Company then provided Mr. Cotter and his family if he did not resign from the Board. When Mr. Cotter did not resign,
Ellen Cotter terminated such benefits and caused the Company to commence an arbitration against him as described
under “Employment Arbitration” below.
 
The SAC further alleges that individual director defendants
acted to entrench themselves in control of the Company, including by forcing a noncompliant director to “retire” and
by adding to the Board two persons with no experience in the Company’s businesses or as directors of a public company who
were family and/or personal friends of Ellen and/or Margaret Cotter. The SAC alleges that certain director defendants acting as
members of the Board’s compensation committee, in derogation of their fiduciary duties, authorized Ellen and Margaret Cotter
as executors of the Estate to exercise the option to acquire 100,000 shares of Class B Common Stock that the Company previously
had reported to be held by the Trust. The SAC also alleges that Ellen and Margaret Cotter failed to make timely and accurate SEC
filings and caused the Company to make materially misleading if not inaccurate SEC filings, in furtherance of the alleged entrenchment
scheme.
 
The SAC also alleges that in late 2015 and early 2016,
certain director defendants, including Margaret Cotter, aborted the then ongoing search using an outside recruiting company to
find a new, permanent CEO of the Company, and then with the other director defendants appointed Ellen Cotter as CEO, notwithstanding
the fact that she did not meet the search criteria previously agreed to and used to identify CEO candidates. The SAC also alleges
that the director defendants in the Spring of 2016 made Margaret Cotter a highly compensated, senior executive at the Company responsible
for development of its valuable real estate assets in New York City, notwithstanding the fact that she had no prior real estate
development experience.
 
 
 
 

 6 
 

 
The SAC further alleges that the director defendants
failed to take actions sufficient to make an informed, good faith decision in response to a cash offer by  third parties (including
Patton Vision) to purchase all of the stock the Company at a price in excess of the price at which it traded in the open market,
and instead rejected the offer and refused to engage with the offerors because that is what Ellen and Margaret Cotter indicated
that they wanted.
 
Discovery in the Derivative Action is substantially complete,
certain writ proceedings are before the Nevada Supreme Court and no trial date presently is set.
 
Employment Arbitration
 
On July 14, 2015, the Company filed and served a Demand
for Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association under Mr. Cotter’s Employment Agreement, entered into on or about
June 3, 2013 (“2013 Employment Agreement”). By the arbitration, the Company seeks declaratory relief determining “that
Mr. Cotter’s employment and employment agreement with the Company have been validly terminated, that the Board validly removed
him from his positions as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company and positions with the Company’s subsidiaries.”
The Company further seeks declaratory relief determining “that Mr. Cotter is required to submit his resignation from all
positions with the Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries, including as a member of the Board of Directors, and that Mr. Cotter
is not owed any further compensation or benefits” under the 2013 Employment Agreement. On January 20, 2017, Mr. Cotter filed
a First Amended Counter Complaint, which asserted contractual and employment claims, including a claim for declaratory relief as
to whether the Company’s breach of the 2013 Employment Agreement was unlawful. To date, no arbitration hearing has been scheduled.
 
…
 
Except as described above or elsewhere herein, each of
Mr. Cotter, the Trust, the Cotter grandchildren trust and the Cotter Foundation holds the shares of Class A Common Stock and Class
B Common Stock, as applicable, reported herein for investment purposes.
 
Mr. Cotter will continue to evaluate his ownership and
voting position in the Company and may consider the following future courses of action:  (i) continuing to hold the Class
A Common Stock and/or Class B Common Stock for investment; (ii) disposing of all or a portion of the Class A Common Stock and/or
Class B Common Stock in open market sales or in privately-negotiated transactions; or (iii) acquiring additional shares of Class
A Common Stock and/or Class B Common Stock in the open market, upon the exercise of options or in privately-negotiated transactions,
in each case as may be permitted by Company policy.
 
Mr. Cotter is a Director of the Company, and expects
to be involved in the development, analysis and/or review from time to time of transactions involving the Company, including the
transactions identified in clauses (a) through (j) of Instructions to Item 4. Mr. Cotter considers his involvement in such
development, analysis and/or review process to be principally that of a Director of the Company, and accordingly, does not anticipate
making disclosure of his participation in the review and evaluation of such possible transactions, separate and apart from relevant
disclosures that may be made from time to time by the Company.
 

Item 5.Interest in Securities of the Issuer.
 

(a)Class A Common Stock. As presently shown in the Company’s records, Mr. Cotter is the beneficial owner of
an aggregate of 2,758,282 shares of Class A Common Stock (including 50,000 shares of Class A Common Stock subject to an option
that is exercisable within 60 days of the date hereof), or 12.8% of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, based on 21,503,376
shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding as of May 5, 2017, as reported in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q filed on May 9, 2017. Mr. Cotter claims to beneficially own additional shares of Class A Common Stock as described under “Probate
Litigation” in Item 4 above.
 
Class B Common Stock. As
presently shown in the Company’s records, Mr. Cotter is the beneficial owner of an aggregate of 696,080 shares of Class B
Common Stock, or 41.4% of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, based on 1,680,590 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding
as of March 5, 2017, as reported in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on May 9, 2017. Mr. Cotter claims to
beneficially own additional shares of Class B Common Stock as described under “Probate Litigation” in Item 4 above.
 
 
 

 7 
 

 
 

(b)Class A Common Stock. Mr. Cotter individually holds, and has sole voting and investment power with respect to,
423,604 shares of Class A Common Stock (including 50,000 shares of Class A Common Stock subject to an option that is exercisable
within 60 days of the date hereof).
 
Mr. Cotter is Co-Trustee of a trust
for the benefit of James J. Cotter, Sr.’s grandchildren (the “Cotter grandchildren’s trust”), which holds
284,278 shares of Class A Common Stock, and has shared voting and investment power over such shares. Margaret Cotter is the other
Co-Trustee of the Cotter grandchildren’s trust.
 
Mr. Cotter is Co-Trustee of the Cotter
Foundation, which holds 102,751 shares of Class A Common Stock, and has shared voting and investment power over such shares. Ellen
Cotter and Margaret Cotter are the other Co-Trustees of the Cotter Foundation.
 
Mr. Cotter is Co-Trustee of the Trust,
which holds 1,897,649 shares of Class A Common Stock (as presently shown in the Company’s records), and has shared voting
and investment power over such shares. Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter are the other Co-Trustees of the Trust. Mr. Cotter asserts
that the Trust should hold an additional 326,800 shares of Class A Common Stock which are presently held by the Estate.
 
Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter are
United States citizens with the same business address identified in Item 2. Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter are both Directors
of the Company. Ellen Cotter is the Company’s Chair of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. Margaret Cotter

13D”) is filed by James J. Cotter, Jr. (“Mr. Cotter”) with respect to the Class A Nonvoting Common Stock, $0.01
par value per share (“Class A Common Stock”), and Class B Voting Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class
B Common Stock”), of Reading International, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”). The principal executive
offices of the Company are located at 5995 Sepulveda Blvd., Suite 300, Culver City, California 90230.     Item 2.Identity and Background  (a)The name of the person filing this Schedule 13D is James J. Cotter, Jr.  (b)Mr. Cotter is a citizen of the United States with a principal business address at c/o Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton
LLP, Attn: Adam F. Streisand, Esq., 1901 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 1600, Los Angeles, CA 90067.  (c)On June 18, 2015, the Company disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K that, on June 12, 2015, the board of directors of the
Company terminated the employment of Mr. Cotter as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately.
Mr. Cotter disputes the legal efficacy of such termination and reserves all legal rights with respect thereto.  (d)Mr. Cotter has not been convicted during the last five years in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar
misdemeanors) of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject
to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal
or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.  (e)Mr. Cotter was not a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result
of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating
activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.  (f)United States of America.  Item 3.Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration   Explanatory Note: The number of shares of Class A Common
Stock and Class B Common Stock over which the Trust (as defined below) and the Reading Voting Trust (as defined below) have beneficial
ownership reflects how the shares are presently held of record with the Company’s transfer agent, as set forth in the Company’s
2016 Proxy Statement. The ownership of these shares is subject to litigation, and Mr. Cotter asserts that (i) the Trust should
hold 326,800 shares of Class A Common Stock presently held by the Estate of James J. Cotter Sr (the “Estate”) and (ii)
the Reading Voting Trust should hold 696,080 shares of Class B Common Stock presently held by the Trust and 427,808 shares of Class B
Common Stock presently held by the Estate.   Mr. Cotter is Co-Trustee and beneficiary of the James
J. Cotter Living Trust, dated August 1, 2000, as amended (the “Trust”), which presently holds of record 1,897,649 shares
of Class A Common Stock and 696,080 shares of Class B Common Stock.   James J. Cotter, Sr. (Mr. Cotter’s father), the
original Trustor and Trustee of the Trust, passed away on September 13, 2014, at which time the Trust became irrevocable. The Trust
provided that, upon the death of James J. Cotter, Sr., 1,023,888 shares of Class B Common Stock would be held by the Reading Voting
Trust, primarily for the benefit of the grandchildren of James J. Cotter, Sr.   Pursuant to the 2014 Partial Amendment to Declaration
of Trust (the “2014 Amendment”), the Reading Voting Trust is to be held, administered and distributed by Mr. Cotter
and Ann Margaret Cotter (“Margaret Cotter”), as initial Co-Trustees, and provides that, if Mr. Cotter and Margaret
Cotter are unable to agree upon an important Trust decision, they will rotate the Trusteeship of the Reading Voting Trust between
them annually each January 1st, so that thereafter there will only be one Trustee acting at any given time.        3    The validity of the 2014 Amendment has been challenged
in the proceeding described as the “Trust Litigation” below. If the 2014 Amendment is invalidated in whole
or in part, then the 2013 Trust will control. The 2013 Trust provides that Margaret Cotter shall be the trustee of the Reading
Voting Trust. Mr. Cotter seeks in connection with the Trust Litigation, among other things, to have Margaret Cotter removed from
any fiduciary capacity in connection with the Reading Voting Trust, and has also initiated proceedings for the appointment of a
trustee ad litem, in the proceeding described under “Trust Litigation - Ex Parte Petition” in Item 4 below.   Additionally, the Company’s 2014 Proxy
Statement (the last proxy statement signed by James J. Cotter, Sr.) disclosed that the Trust held an option to purchase
100,000 shares of Class B Common Stock. However, Ellen and Margaret Cotter, acting as co-executors of the estate of James J.
Cotter, Sr. (the “Estate”), on September 21, 2015, took the position that such option was instead held by the
Estate and exercised such option in full, with the exercise price therefor being paid with 81,463 shares of Class A Common
Stock held by the Estate. Mr. Cotter has questioned the validity of this option exercise.   Mr. Cotter disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares
held by the Trust, the Reading Voting Trust, the Cotter grandchildren’s trust (defined below) or the Cotter Foundation (defined
below), except to the extent of his pecuniary interest, if any, in such shares.   Item 4.Purpose of Transaction   Mr. Cotter is involved in four judicial proceedings which
pertain to disputes regarding, among other things, (i) whether certain shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock
should be held by the Estate, the Trust or the Reading Voting Trust, (ii) whether a trustee ad litem should be appointed
to negotiate on behalf of the Trust with Patton Vision (as defined below) with respect to Patton Vision’s offer to purchase
Company shares presently held by the Trust and the Estate, and (iii) the legal efficacy of Mr. Cotter’s termination as the
Chief Executive Officer of the Company on June 12, 2015, in each case as described in more detail below. The outcome of these proceedings
could, but will not necessarily, result in a disposition of securities of the Company, an extraordinary corporate transaction involving
the Company (such as a change of control) and/or a change in the present board of directors or management of the Company.   Probate Litigation   In the probate case entitled In re the Matter of the
Estate of James J. Cotter Sr. (Case No. P-14-082942) before the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Mr. Cotter, Ellen Cotter
and Margaret Cotter are disputing whether the Reading Voting Trust, the Trust or the Estate should now hold certain shares of Class
A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. Among other things, Mr. Cotter asserts that (i) the Trust should hold 326,800 shares of
Class A Common Stock presently held by the Estate and (ii) the Reading Voting Trust should hold 696,080 shares of Class B Common
Stock presently held by the Trust and 427,808 shares of Class B Common Stock presently held by the Estate. The Court has yet
to approve the inventory of assets to be included in the Estate.   Trust Litigation   On February 6, 2015, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter
filed a Petition in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, captioned In re James J. Cotter Living
Trust, dated August 1, 2000 (Case No. BP159755). The Petition, among other things, seeks relief that could determine the validity
of the 2014 Amendment and who between Margaret Cotter and James J. Cotter Jr. will have authority as Trustee or Co-Trustees of
the Reading Voting Trust to vote the shares of Class B Common Stock held by the Reading Voting Trust (in whole or in part) and
the scope and extent of such authority. On June 1, 2016, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter filed an Amended Petition. On June 17,
2016, Mr. Cotter filed an Answer and Cross-Claim to the Amended Petition, wherein, among other things, Mr. Cotter seeks to have
Margaret Cotter and Ellen Cotter treated as having predeceased their father under California Probate Code Section 259 and to disqualify
each of them from serving as a fiduciary, including with respect to the Reading Voting Trust. On October 5, 2016, Ellen Cotter
and Margaret Cotter responded to Mr. Cotter’s Answer and Cross-Claim and filed their own Cross-Claim against him seeking
essentially the same relief against Mr. Cotter.        4      On August 18, 2015, Mr. Cotter filed a Petition in the
same court to, among other things, (i) remove Margaret Cotter and Ellen Cotter as Co-Trustees of the Trust due to abuse of power
and multiple conflicts of interest, (ii) suspend the powers of Margaret Cotter and Ellen Cotter and appoint a temporary trustee,
(iii) seek relief for breach of trust under the California Probate Code and (iv) compel an accounting and surcharge.   Trial on the validity of the 2014 Amendment commenced
on July 12, 2016, and closing arguments are scheduled for August 1, 2017. Mr. Cotter’s Petition to remove Margaret Cotter
and Ellen Cotter as trustees has not yet been set for trial, but the issues of Mr. Cotter’s, Ellen Cotter’s and/or
Margaret Cotter’s suitability to serve as trustees have also been raised in connection with the trial on the validity of
the 2014 Amendment.   Ex Parte Petition    On January 23, 2017, Patton Vision LLC (“Patton
Vision”) communicated to Margaret Cotter, Ellen Cotter, and Mr. James J. Cotter, as co-trustees of the Trust under the 2014
Amendment, an offer to buy the Trust’s shares of RDI for $18.50 a share.  Patton Vision made the same offer to Margaret
Cotter and Ellen Cotter as the sole co-executors of James J. Cotter, Sr.’s Will. On February 9, 2017, Mr. Cotter filed
an ex parte petition in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, seeking an order from the Court:   (i)to appoint a trustee ad litem for the Trust;  (ii)to grant the trustee ad litem with full power, authority and protections under the Trust to evaluate the offer from
Patton Vision, conduct due diligence, negotiate with Patton Vision or any other potential offerors, and take all actions necessary
or appropriate to consummate the sale of the shares held by the Trust, including but not limited to:  (a)communicate solely with Patton Vision regarding their offer to purchase the shares held by the Trust,  (b)receive solely and exclusively all offers for the purchase of the shares held by the Trust,  (c)enter into purchase and sale agreements with respect to the shares held in the Trust,  (d)take all actions necessary to carry out the terms, conditions and obligations of any purchase and sale agreement with respect
to the shares held in the Trust, including negotiating and any modifications thereto,  (e)receive all proceeds from the sale of the shares held in the Trust,  (f)return to the co-trustees of the Trust (Mr. Cotter, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter) the net proceeds of the sale of the shares
held in the Trust to be invested, managed and distributed in accordance with the terms of the Trust, and    (g) hire investment advisors,
tax advisors, accountants, attorneys or any other advisors the trustee ad litem deems 	necessary and reasonable;   (iii)to suspend temporarily the powers of Mr. Cotter, Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter with respect to all of the foregoing and
within matters until further orders of the Court;  (iv)to allow the trustee ad litem compensation, calculated at the trustees normal hourly rate,  (v)to instruct the trustee to take all actions consistent with such Order, and  (vi)to grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.         5    On February 23, 2017, the Court granted the ex parte
petition as modified by the Court as follows: the Court appointed an expert under Section 730 of the California Evidence Code (“Section
730 Expert”) for the purpose of evaluating the January 23, 2017 offer from Patton Vision to purchase the Trust’s shares,
and instructed the Section 730 Expert (i) to undertake sufficient diligence to evaluate the offer from Patton Vision, including
without limitation, by receiving and considering information from Patton Vision, the Company, Mr. Cotter, Margaret Cotter and Ellen
Cotter that may be relevant to such offer and (ii) to submit a report to the Court no later than April 1, 2017 of the Section 730
Expert’s opinions and/or conclusions and recommendations for next steps.   On March 1, 2017, the Court appointed a guardian ad
litem to represent the beneficiaries under the Trust and directed the guardian ad litem to report to the Court by April
1, 2017. The Court held additional hearings on the ex parte petition thereafter. Multiple additional briefs have been filed by
Mr. Cotter, Ellen and Margaret Cotter, the guardian ad litem, and the Company, and the Court has also ordered supplemental
briefing to be filed on July 21, 2017. Certain portions of the briefing filed to date have been sealed under court order. As of
the date hereof, the Court has not yet ruled as to whether or not to appoint a trustee ad litem in response to the ex parte
petition.   Derivative Action   On June 12, 2015, Mr. Cotter, on behalf of the Company,
commenced a derivative action entitled James J. Cotter Jr. v. Margaret Cotter, et al., Case No. A-15-719860-V in the Eighth Judicial
District Court of the State of Nevada for Clark County (the “Derivative Action”) against each of the other directors
of the Company, including Ellen and Margaret Cotter, for breaches of fiduciary duty, including the duties of loyalty, care and/or
disclosure, and for aiding and abetting fiduciary breaches. Mr. Cotter amended his complaint twice, adding allegations about subsequent
events, dismissing one (by then former) director without prejudice, and adding as defendants two individuals subsequently added
to the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”).   The pending Second Amended Complaint
(the “SAC”) in the Derivative Action alleges that certain of the director defendants, including Ellen and
Margaret Cotter, threatened to terminate Mr. Cotter as President and CEO of the Company if he did not enter into an agreement
with Ellen and Margaret Cotter to resolve the Trust Litigation on terms satisfactory to them, which terms included making
Margaret Cotter the sole trustee of the Reading Voting Trust. The SAC further alleges that after Mr. Cotter failed to
acquiesce to the threats of termination, certain of the director defendants terminated him as President and CEO of the
Company. The SAC further alleges that when Ellen Cotter was appointed interim CEO upon the termination of Mr. Cotter as CEO,
she pressured Mr. Cotter to resign from the from the Board by falsely claiming that his executive employment agreement
required him to do so and by threatening to terminate certain employment benefits, including the health and medical benefits
the Company then provided Mr. Cotter and his family if he did not resign from the Board. When Mr. Cotter did not resign,
Ellen Cotter terminated such benefits and caused the Company to commence an arbitration against him as described
under “Employment Arbitration” below.   The SAC further alleges that individual director defendants
acted to entrench themselves in control of the Company, including by forcing a noncompliant director to “retire” and
by adding to the Board two persons with no experience in the Company’s businesses or as directors of a public company who
were family and/or personal friends of Ellen and/or Margaret Cotter. The SAC alleges that certain director defendants acting as
members of the Board’s compensation committee, in derogation of their fiduciary duties, authorized Ellen and Margaret Cotter
as executors of the Estate to exercise the option to acquire 100,000 shares of Class B Common Stock that the Company previously
had reported to be held by the Trust. The SAC also alleges that Ellen and Margaret Cotter failed to make timely and accurate SEC
filings and caused the Company to make materially misleading if not inaccurate SEC filings, in furtherance of the alleged entrenchment
scheme.   The SAC also alleges that in late 2015 and early 2016,
certain director defendants, including Margaret Cotter, aborted the then ongoing search using an outside recruiting company to
find a new, permanent CEO of the Company, and then with the other director defendants appointed Ellen Cotter as CEO, notwithstanding
the fact that she did not meet the search criteria previously agreed to and used to identify CEO candidates. The SAC also alleges
that the director defendants in the Spring of 2016 made Margaret Cotter a highly compensated, senior executive at the Company responsible
for development of its valuable real estate assets in New York City, notwithstanding the fact that she had no prior real estate
development experience.          6    The SAC further alleges that the director defendants
failed to take actions sufficient to make an informed, good faith decision in response to a cash offer by  third parties (including
Patton Vision) to purchase all of the stock the Company at a price in excess of the price at which it traded in the open market,
and instead rejected the offer and refused to engage with the offerors because that is what Ellen and Margaret Cotter indicated
that they wanted.   Discovery in the Derivative Action is substantially complete,
certain writ proceedings are before the Nevada Supreme Court and no trial date presently is set.   Employment Arbitration   On July 14, 2015, the Company filed and served a Demand
for Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association under Mr. Cotter’s Employment Agreement, entered into on or about
June 3, 2013 (“2013 Employment Agreement”). By the arbitration, the Company seeks declaratory relief determining “that
Mr. Cotter’s employment and employment agreement with the Company have been validly terminated, that the Board validly removed
him from his positions as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company and positions with the Company’s subsidiaries.”
The Company further seeks declaratory relief determining “that Mr. Cotter is required to submit his resignation from all
positions with the Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries, including as a member of the Board of Directors, and that Mr. Cotter
is not owed any further compensation or benefits” under the 2013 Employment Agreement. On January 20, 2017, Mr. Cotter filed
a First Amended Counter Complaint, which asserted contractual and employment claims, including a claim for declaratory relief as
to whether the Company’s breach of the 2013 Employment Agreement was unlawful. To date, no arbitration hearing has been scheduled.   …   Except as described above or elsewhere herein, each of
Mr. Cotter, the Trust, the Cotter grandchildren trust and the Cotter Foundation holds the shares of Class A Common Stock and Class
B Common Stock, as applicable, reported herein for investment purposes.   Mr. Cotter will continue to evaluate his ownership and
voting position in the Company and may consider the following future courses of action:  (i) continuing to hold the Class
A Common Stock and/or Class B Common Stock for investment; (ii) disposing of all or a portion of the Class A Common Stock and/or
Class B Common Stock in open market sales or in privately-negotiated transactions; or (iii) acquiring additional shares of Class
A Common Stock and/or Class B Common Stock in the open market, upon the exercise of options or in privately-negotiated transactions,
in each case as may be permitted by Company policy.   Mr. Cotter is a Director of the Company, and expects
to be involved in the development, analysis and/or review from time to time of transactions involving the Company, including the
transactions identified in clauses (a) through (j) of Instructions to Item 4. Mr. Cotter considers his involvement in such
development, analysis and/or review process to be principally that of a Director of the Company, and accordingly, does not anticipate
making disclosure of his participation in the review and evaluation of such possible transactions, separate and apart from relevant
disclosures that may be made from time to time by the Company.   Item 5.Interest in Securities of the Issuer.  (a)Class A Common Stock. As presently shown in the Company’s records, Mr. Cotter is the beneficial owner of
an aggregate of 2,758,282 shares of Class A Common Stock (including 50,000 shares of Class A Common Stock subject to an option
that is exercisable within 60 days of the date hereof), or 12.8% of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, based on 21,503,376

Litigation” in Item 4 above.  Class B Common Stock. As
presently shown in the Company’s records, Mr. Cotter is the beneficial owner of an aggregate of 696,080 shares of Class B
Common Stock, or 41.4% of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, based on 1,680,590 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding
as of March 5, 2017, as reported in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on May 9, 2017. Mr. Cotter claims to
beneficially own additional shares of Class B Common Stock as described under “Probate Litigation” in Item 4 above.        7      (b)Class A Common Stock. Mr. Cotter individually holds, and has sole voting and investment power with respect to,
423,604 shares of Class A Common Stock (including 50,000 shares of Class A Common Stock subject to an option that is exercisable

which holds 1,897,649 shares of Class A Common Stock (as presently shown in the Company’s records), and has shared voting
and investment power over such shares. Ellen Cotter and Margaret Cotter are the other Co-Trustees of the Trust. Mr. Cotter asserts

of the Company. Ellen Cotter is the Company’s Chair of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. Margaret Cotter

Cotter is Co-Trustee of the Trust, which presently holds 696,080 shares of Class B Common Stock (as shown in the Company’s
records), and has shared voting and investment power over such shares. Mr. Cotter asserts that these shares, together with an additional
427,808 shares of Class B Common Stock that are presently held by the Estate, should be transferred to the Reading Voting Trust.   Margaret Cotter is the other Co-Trustee
of the Reading Voting Trust. Margaret Cotter is a United States citizen with the same business address identified in Item 2, is
a Director of the Company and the Company’s Vice Chair of the Board and Executive Vice President-Real Estate Management and
Development. Mr. Cotter is not aware that Margaret Cotter has been involved in any matters requiring disclosure under clauses (d)
or (e) of Item 2 under Schedule 13D.   (c)On June 23, 2017, the Cotter grandchildren’s trust, of which Mr. Cotter is Co-Trustee, sold 5,112 shares of Class A Common

Forward-Looking Statements
Our statements in this press release contain a variety of forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements reflect only our expectations regarding future events and operating performance and necessarily speak only as of the date the information was prepared.  No guarantees can be given that our expectation will in fact be realized, in whole or in part.  You can recognize these statements by our use of words such as, by way of example, “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” and “anticipate” or other similar terminology.
These forward-looking statements reflect our expectation after having considered a variety of risks and uncertainties.  However, they are necessarily the product of internal discussion and do not necessarily completely reflect the views of individual members of our Board of Directors or of our management team.  Individual Board members and individual members of our management team may have different views as to the risks and uncertainties involved, and may have different views as to future events or our operating performance.
Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or underlying our forward-looking statements are the following:

With respect to our cinema operations:
o	The number and attractiveness to movie goers of the films released in future periods;
o	The amount of money spent by film distributors to promote their motion pictures;
o	The licensing fees and terms required by film distributors from motion picture exhibitors in order to exhibit their films;
o	The comparative attractiveness of motion pictures as a source of entertainment and willingness and/or ability of consumers (i) to spend their dollars on entertainment and (ii) to spend their entertainment dollars on movies in an outside the home environment; and
o	The extent to which we encounter competition from other cinema exhibitors, from other  sources outside of the home entertainment, and from inside the home entertainment options, such as “home theaters” and competitive film product distribution technology such as, by way of example, cable, satellite broadcast, DVD rentals and sales, and so called “movies on demand;”

With respect to our real estate development and operation activities:
o	The rental rates and capitalization rates applicable to the markets in which we operate and the quality of properties that we own;
o	The extent to which we can obtain on a timely basis the various land use approvals and entitlements needed to develop our properties;
o	The risks and uncertainties associated with real estate development;
o	The availability and cost of labor and materials;
o	Competition for development sites and tenants; and
o	The extent to which our cinemas can continue to serve as an anchor tenant which will, in
turn, be influenced by the same factors as will influence generally the results of our cinema operations;

With respect to our operations generally as an international company involved in both the development and operation of cinemas and the development and operation of real estate; and previously engaged for many years in the railroad business in the United States:
o	Our ongoing access to borrowed funds and capital and the interest that must be paid on that debt and the returns that must be paid on such capital;
o	The relative values of the currency used in the countries in which we operate;
o	Changes in government regulation, including by way of example, the costs resulting from the implementation of the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley;
o	Our labor relations and costs of labor (including future government requirements with respect to pension liabilities, disability insurance and health coverage, and vacations and leave);
o	Our exposure from time to time to legal claims and to uninsurable risks such as those related to our historic railroad operations, including potential environmental claims and health related claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos or other substances now or in the future recognized as being possible causes of cancer or other health-related problems;
o	Changes in future effective tax rates and the results of currently ongoing and future potential audits by taxing authorities having jurisdiction over our various companies; and
o	Changes in applicable accounting policies and practices.


The above list is not necessarily exhaustive, as business is by definition unpredictable and risky, and subject to influence by numerous factors outside of our control such as changes in government regulation or policy, competition, interest rates, supply, technological innovation, changes in consumer taste and fancy, weather, and the extent to which consumers in our markets have the economic wherewithal to spend money on beyond-the-home entertainment.
Given the variety and unpredictability of the factors that will ultimately influence our businesses and our results of operation,  no guarantees can be given that any of our forward-looking statements will ultimately prove to be correct.  Actual results will undoubtedly vary and there is no guarantee as to how our securities will perform either when considered in isolation or when compared to other securities or investment opportunities.
Finally, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or to revise any of our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable law.  Accordingly, you should always note the date to which our forward-looking statements speak.
Additionally, certain of the presentations included in this press release may contain “pro forma” information or “non-US GAAP financial measures.”  In such case, a reconciliation of this information to our US GAAP financial statements will be made available in connection with such statements.
