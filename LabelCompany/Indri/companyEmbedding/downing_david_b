Lindsay has irrigation systems operating in more than 90 countries. As a Nebraska-based company, Lindsay is strong and dependable – much like the small town roots that the company originated from. Tough, dependable Zimmatic by Lindsay irrigation systems have been the choice of the world’s irrigators for over 50 years. The company’s success comes from finding a better way to irrigate almost any crop on varied terrain and soils to increase yields and better utilize natural resources.
About Lindsay

Lindsay’s infrastructure segments are driven by the world’s population growth, particularly in emerging nations. These divisions are working with agencies to make roadways and railways safer during expansion and renovation.

Today, a wide variety of road safety products have made Barrier Systems a leader in the roadway safety industry.

Recent acquisitions have expanded Lindsay’s capabilities in offering various industrial solutions. Digitec, acquired by Lindsay in 2010 is an electronics research, development and manufacturing company. One of their key products is WaveRoute Enterprise is a hosted web based M2M application for managing, monitoring and controlling these devices and sensors remotely.

IRZ Consulting, acquired in 2011, is an irrigation consulting and design firm known for its work with large growers to design water delivery systems for agriculture and for providing services for yield-enhancement and cost reduction. These value-adding services include soil moisture monitoring and energy usage monitoring and reduction processes, among others. The addition of IRZ allows Lindsay irrigation to offer turn-key systems.

Overview



This book intervenes dramatically in current debates about the future of English studies as business interests reach deeper into the domains of higher education. By recognizing that economic pressures keenly manifest themselves in curricula, writers in this book explore possibilities for curricular reform in English in order to serve the interests of students, teachers, and local communities."The editors have done a superb job. They have thoroughly surveyed the literature in the raucous debate they are entering, and I believe they are quite right to assert that no previous discussant has taken quite the global view represented in this volume, attending to large issues of international complications and future consequences as well as helpful specifics of curriculum design." Patricia Bizzell, Department of English, College of the Holy Cross"This book has a very good chance of capturing the attention of far more than the typical audience of concerned English teachers, occasional administrators, alarmed graduate students, and professional educators that such books normally reach. Anyone interested in the fate of the humanities or involved in language and literature education, whether at the secondary school or the collegiate level, should find this book challenging and instructive, and with some luck, it might also find its way on the shelves of policy makers at the local and perhaps even the national level." Giles Gunn, Professor of English and of Global and International Studies, University of California, Santa BarbaraEditors David B. Downing, Claude Mark Hurlbert, and Paula Mathieu have titled this collection Beyond English, Inc. to suggest that "whatever curricular innovations we imagine, we must negotiate our visions within specific institutions and against specific constraints of powerful corporate-management models commanding our educational system." As one writer notes, corporatization cannot be stopped, but it can be shaped and resisted. This book explores how.The essays in this volume address historical and theoretical questions about the relationships among management pressures, disciplinarity, and curricular reform, including the changing role of writing, and the curricular impact of new university-wide initiatives, such as distance learning, service-learning, and vocational demands.
