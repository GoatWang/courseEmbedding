Emerging Traders Fund LP - A Privately Managed Futures Fund










914 669-9820          info@EmergingTraders.com









 
The Emerging Traders Fund is a Series Class Interest Limited Partnership. Due, to the structure of the fund this allows the individual client to build out their own private futures fund with limited risk, utilizing state of the art technologies. The wide breadth of individual share classes enables the client to create a diversified portfolio of CTA's based on their specific portfolio requirements. The fund was so designed to give the client a more hands-on- approach in customizing their individual account so that reallocation can be implemented in a dynamic fashion, moving in and out of different strategies in given market conditions.
				            
			              
The Emerging Traders Fund provides its investor's access to managers that normally require higher minimum investment levels and enables one to enter such programs at a lower price point of $25,000. This democratizes the process of selecting managers, as clients now can have access to some of the same managers, that until recently were only available to those with multi-million portfolios.

AMENDED
AND RESTATED MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

 

This
AMENDED AND RESTATED MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT made as of the 1st day of
November, 2010 is by and among CERES MANAGED FUTURES LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (“CMF” or the
“General Partner”), EMERGING CTA PORTFOLIO L.P., a New
York limited partnership (the “Partnership”) and PGR
Capital LLP, a United Kingdom limited liability partnership (the
“Advisor,” together with the General Partner and the
Partnership, the “Parties”).  This Agreement
amends and restates the Management Agreement dated as of October
30, 2009 (the “Existing Agreement”) by and among the
Parties.

 

W
I
T N E S S E T
H :

 

WHEREAS,
CMF is the general partner of the Partnership, a limited
partnership organized for the purpose of speculative trading of
commodity interests, including futures contracts, options, forward
contracts, swaps and other derivative instruments with the
objective of achieving substantial capital appreciation, such
trading to be conducted directly or through investment in PGR
Master Fund L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Master
Fund”), of which CMF is the general partner and PGR is the
advisor; and

 

WHEREAS,
the Second Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement dated
as of October 20, 2010 (the “Partnership Agreement”)
permits CMF to delegate to one or more commodity trading advisors
CMF’s authority to make trading decisions for the
Partnership, which advisors may or may not have any prior
experience managing client funds; and

 

WHEREAS,
the Advisor is registered as a commodity trading advisor with the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), is a
member of the National Futures Association (“NFA”) and
is authorized and regulated in the United Kingdom by the Financial
Services Authority (“FSA”); and

 

WHEREAS,
CMF is registered as a commodity trading advisor and a commodity
pool operator with the CFTC and is a member of the NFA;
and

 

WHEREAS,
the Parties have entered into the Existing Agreement and now wish
to amend and restate the Existing Agreement as set out in this
Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS,
CMF, the Partnership and the Advisor wish to enter into this
Agreement in order to set forth the terms and conditions upon which
the Advisor will render and implement advisory services in
connection with the conduct by the Partnership of its commodity
trading activities during the term of this Agreement;

 

NOW,
THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

 

1.  
DUTIES OF THE ADVISOR .  (a) For the period and on
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Advisor shall have
sole authority and responsibility, as one of the
Partnership’s agents and attorneys-in-fact, for directing the
investment and reinvestment of the assets and funds of the
Partnership allocated to it by the General Partner in commodity
interests, including commodity futures contracts, options, forward
contracts, swaps and other derivative instruments.  All
such trading on behalf of the Partnership shall be in accordance
with the trading policies set forth in the Partnership’s
Private

 

 

 

  

 

Placement
Memorandum dated October 2010, as supplemented (the
“Memorandum”), as such trading policies may be changed
from time to time upon receipt by the Advisor of prior written
notice of such change, and pursuant to the trading strategy
selected by CMF to be utilized by the Advisor in managing the
Partnership’s assets.  CMF has initially selected
the Advisor’s PGR Mayfair Program (the
“Program”), as described in Appendix A attached hereto,
to manage the Partnership’s assets allocated to
it.  Any open positions or other investments at the time
of receipt of such notice of a change in trading policy shall not
be deemed to violate the changed policy and shall be closed or sold
in the ordinary course of trading.  The Advisor may not
deviate from the trading policies set forth in the Memorandum
without the prior written consent of the Partnership given by
CMF.  The Advisor makes no representation or warranty
that the trading to be directed by it for the Partnership will be
profitable or will not incur losses.

 

(b) CMF
acknowledges receipt of the description of the Program, attached
hereto as Appendix A.  All trades made by the Advisor for
the account of the Partnership shall be made through such commodity
broker or brokers as CMF shall direct, and the Advisor shall have
no authority or responsibility for selecting or supervising any
such broker in connection with the execution, clearance or
confirmation of transactions for the Partnership or for the
negotiation of brokerage rates charged therefor.

 

(c) The
initial allocation of the Partnership’s assets to the Advisor
will be made to the Program as described in Appendix A attached
hereto.  In the event the Advisor wishes to use a trading
system or methodology other than or in addition to the Program in
connection with its trading for the Partnership, either in whole or
in part, it may not do so unless the Advisor gives CMF prior
written notice of its intention to utilize such different trading
system or methodology and CMF consents thereto in
writing.  In addition, the Advisor will provide five
days’ prior written notice to CMF of any change in the
trading system or methodology to be utilized for the Partnership
which the Advisor deems material.  If the Advisor deems
such change in system or methodology or in markets traded to be
material, the changed system or methodology or markets traded will
not be utilized for the Partnership without the prior written
consent of CMF.  In addition, the Advisor will notify CMF
of any changes to the trading system or methodology that would
cause the description of the trading strategy or methods described
in Appendix A to be materially inaccurate.  Further, the
Advisor will provide the Partnership with a current list of all
commodity interests to be traded for the Partnership’s
account and the Advisor will not trade any additional commodity
interests for such account without providing notice thereof to CMF
and receiving CMF’s written approval.  The Advisor
also agrees to provide CMF, on a monthly basis, with a written
report of the assets under the Advisor’s management together
with all other matters deemed by the Advisor to be material changes
to its business not previously reported to CMF.  The
Advisor further agrees that it will convert foreign currency
balances (not required to margin positions denominated in a foreign
currency) to U.S. dollars no less frequently than monthly. U.S.
dollar equivalents in individual foreign currencies of more than
$100,000 will be converted to U.S. dollars within one business day
after such funds are no longer needed to margin foreign
positions.

 

(d) The
Advisor agrees to make all material disclosures to the Partnership
regarding itself and its principals as defined in Part 4 of the
CFTC’s regulations (“principals”), partners,
directors, officers and employees, their trading performance and
general trading methods, its customer accounts (but not the
identities of or identifying information with respect to its
customers) and otherwise as are

 

 

-2-

  

 

required
in the reasonable judgment of CMF to be made in any filings
required by Federal or State law or NFA rule or
order.  Notwithstanding Sections 1(d) and 4(d) of this
Agreement, the Advisor is not required to disclose the actual
trading results of proprietary accounts of the Advisor or its
principals unless CMF reasonably determines that such disclosure is
required in order to fulfill its fiduciary obligations to the
Partnership or the reporting, filing or other obligations imposed
on it by Federal or State law or NFA rule or order.  The
Partnership and CMF acknowledge that the trading advice to be
provided by the Advisor is a property right belonging to the
Advisor and that they will keep all such advice
confidential.

 

(e)  The
Advisor understands and agrees that CMF may designate other trading
advisors for the Partnership and apportion or reapportion to such
other trading advisors the management of an amount of Net Assets
(as defined in Section 3(b) hereof) as it shall determine in its
absolute discretion.  The designation of other trading
advisors and the apportionment or reapportionment of Net Assets to
any such trading advisors pursuant to this Section 1 shall neither
terminate this Agreement nor modify in any regard the respective
rights and obligations of the parties hereunder.

 

(f) CMF
may, from time to time, in its absolute discretion, select
additional trading advisors and reapportion funds among such other
trading advisors for the Partnership as it deems
appropriate.  CMF shall use its best efforts to make
reapportionments, if any, as of the first day of a
month.  The Advisor agrees that it may be called upon at
any time promptly to liquidate positions in CMF’s sole
discretion so that CMF may reallocate the Partnership’s
assets, meet margin calls on the Partnership’s account, fund
redemptions, or for any other reason, except that CMF will not
require the liquidation of specific positions by the
Advisor.  CMF will use its best efforts to give two
days’ prior notice to the Advisor of any reallocations or
liquidations.

 

(g)  The
Advisor will not be liable for trading losses in the
Partnership’s account including losses caused by errors;
provided, however, that the Advisor will be liable to the
Partnership with respect to losses incurred due to errors committed
or caused by it or any of its principals or employees in
communicating improper trading instructions or orders to any broker
on behalf of the Partnership.

 

2.  
INDEPENDENCE OF THE ADVISOR .  For all purposes
herein, the Advisor shall be deemed to be an independent contractor
and, unless otherwise expressly provided or authorized, shall have
no authority to act for or represent the Partnership in any way and
shall not be deemed an agent, promoter or sponsor of the
Partnership, CMF, or any other trading advisor.  The
Advisor shall not be responsible to the Partnership, the General
Partner, any trading advisor or any limited partners for any acts
or omissions of any other trading advisor to the
Partnership.

 

3.  
COMPENSATION .  (a) In consideration of and as
compensation for all of the services to be rendered by the Advisor
to the Partnership under this Agreement, the Partnership shall pay
the Advisor (i) an incentive fee payable quarterly equal to 20% of
New Trading Profits (as such term is defined below) earned by the
Advisor for the Partnership and (ii) a monthly fee for professional
management services equal to 1% per year of the month-end Net
Assets of the Partnership allocated to the Advisor (computed
monthly by multiplying the Partnership’s Net Assets allocated
to the Advisor as of the last business day of each month by 1% and
multiplying the result thereof by the ratio which the total number
of calendar days in that month bears to the total number of
calendar days in the year).

(b)
“Net Assets” shall have the meaning set forth in
Paragraph 7(d)(1) of the Partnership Agreement and without regard
to further amendments thereto, provided that in determining the Net
Assets of the Partnership on any date, no adjustment shall be made
to reflect any distributions, redemptions or incentive fees payable
as of the date of such determination.

 

(c)  “New
Trading Profits” shall mean the excess, if any, of Net Assets
managed by the Advisor at the end of the fiscal period over Net
Assets managed by the Advisor at the end of the highest previous
fiscal period or Net Assets allocated to the Advisor at the date
trading by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership commences,
whichever is higher, and as further adjusted to eliminate the
effect on Net Assets resulting from new capital contributions,
redemptions, reallocations or capital distributions, if any, made
during the fiscal period decreased by interest or other income, not
directly related to trading activity, earned on the
Partnership’s assets during the fiscal period, whether the
assets are held separately or in margin
accounts.  Ongoing expenses will be attributed to the
Advisor based on the Advisor’s proportionate share of Net
Assets.  Ongoing expenses will not include expenses of
litigation not involving the activities of the Advisor on behalf of
the Partnership.  No incentive fee shall be paid until
the end of the first calendar quarter of trading following the date
of this Agreement, which fee shall be based on New Trading Profits
earned from the commencement of trading operations by the Advisor
on behalf of the Partnership.  Interest income earned, if
any, will not be taken into account in computing New Trading
Profits earned by the Advisor.  If Net Assets allocated
to the Advisor are reduced due to redemptions, distributions or
reallocations (net of additions), there will be a corresponding
proportional reduction in the related loss carryforward amount that
must be recouped before the Advisor is eligible to receive another
incentive fee.

 

(d)
Quarterly incentive fees and monthly management fees shall be paid
within twenty (20) business days following the end of the period
for which such fee is payable.  In the event of the
termination of this Agreement as of any date which shall not be the
end of a calendar quarter or month, as the case may be, the
quarterly incentive fee shall be computed as if the effective date
of termination were the last day of the then current quarter and
the monthly management fee shall be prorated to the effective date
of termination.  If, during any month, the Partnership
does not conduct business operations or the Advisor is unable to
provide the services contemplated herein for more than two
successive business days, the monthly management fee shall be
prorated by the ratio which the number of business days during
which CMF conducted the Partnership’s business operations or
utilized the Advisor’s services bears in the month to the
total number of business days in such month.

 

(e)           The
provisions of this Section 3 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

 

4.  
RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN OTHER ACTIVITIES
.  (a)  The services provided by the Advisor
hereunder are not to be deemed exclusive.  CMF on its own
behalf and on behalf of the Partnership acknowledges that, subject
to the terms of this Agreement, the Advisor and its officers,
directors, employees and partners, may render advisory, consulting
and management services to other clients and accounts. The Advisor
and its officers, directors, employees and partners shall be free
to trade for their own accounts and to advise other investors and
manage other commodity accounts during

the term
of this Agreement and to use the same information, computer
programs and trading strategies, programs or formulas which they
obtain, produce or utilize in the performance of services to CMF
for the Partnership.  However, the Advisor represents,
warrants and agrees that it believes the rendering of such
consulting, advisory and management services to other accounts and
entities will not require any material change in the
Advisor’s basic trading strategies and will not affect the
capacity of the Advisor to continue to render services to CMF for
the Partnership of the quality and nature contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(b) If,
at any time during the term of this Agreement, the Advisor is
required to aggregate the Partnership’s commodity positions
with the positions of any other person for purposes of applying
CFTC- or exchange-imposed speculative position limits, the Advisor
agrees that it will promptly notify CMF if the Partnership’s
positions are included in an aggregate amount which exceeds the
applicable speculative position limit.  The Advisor
agrees that, if its trading recommendations are altered because of
the application of any speculative position limits, it will not
modify the trading instructions with respect to the
Partnership’s account in such manner as to affect the
Partnership substantially disproportionately as compared with the
Advisor’s other accounts.  The Advisor further
represents, warrants and agrees that under no circumstances will it
knowingly or deliberately use trading programs, strategies or
methods for the Partnership that are inferior to strategies or
methods employed for any other client or account and that it will
not knowingly or deliberately favor any client or account managed
by it over any other client or account in any manner, it being
acknowledged, however, that different trading programs, strategies
or methods may be utilized for differing sizes of accounts,
accounts with different trading policies, accounts experiencing
differing inflows or outflows of equity, accounts that commence
trading at different times, accounts that have different portfolios
or different fiscal years, accounts utilizing different executing
brokers and accounts with other differences, and that such
differences may cause divergent trading results.

 

(c) It is
acknowledged that the Advisor and/or its officers, employees,
directors and partners presently act, and it is agreed that they
may continue to act, as advisor for other accounts managed by them,
and may continue to receive compensation with respect to services
for such accounts in amounts which may be more or less than the
amounts received from the Partnership.

 

(d) The
Advisor agrees that it shall make such information available to CMF
respecting the performance of the Partnership’s account as
compared to the composite performance of other accounts managed by
the Advisor or its principals, if any, as shall be reasonably
requested by CMF.  The Advisor presently believes and
represents that existing speculative position limits will not
materially adversely affect its ability to manage the
Partnership’s account given the potential size of the
Partnersh
