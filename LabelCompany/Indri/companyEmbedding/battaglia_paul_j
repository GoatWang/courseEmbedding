To anyone who does not know -- 
Paul was a victim of the World Trade Center attack on September 11, 2001. He died at the age of 22, on the 100th floor of Tower One, where he had worked for about a year. Since then, the web site he set up before his death has served as a gathering place for his family and friends to share their grief, their memories, their thoughts, and their love and loss. The posts in his guestbook have been a testament to the love and character of a young man who touched many lives, but who was taken away from us by hate, fear, and intolerance. You may wish to go to the earliest entries and read through them in order. Through the words of others, will come to know a young man who impressed and moved people with his strength of character and generosity of spirit. 
--JL

If you would like to add to the guestbook, you may do so. Click on this link, or send an e-mail to leinung@mac.com. We will review your post, and then incorporate your entry into the full guestbook as soon as we can. (Please indicate if you do not want your e-mail address visible.)

I wanted to let you know my son who is in the 7th grade in Richmond, TX got a history assignment to make a "in loving memory of" project for those who lost their lives on 9/11. They were told to pick someone they could relate to and he chose your family member. He chose Paul because of his love for numbers, and simple things like they both have dark hair and glasses and that he always looked happy in his pictures. I hope this lets you know that children who weren't even born yet realize the importance of the lives lost and everyone in Bowie Middle School in Richmond Texas will get to hear about your family member, when they present the projects. Have a wonderful week and know that we are all praying for you. 
God Bless

Dear Paul

Last year was year 12 and it was a horrible, no good, very bad year, and I just could not seems to get it together to write a coherent narrative. Grandpa Jerry is now with you - he left us on April 16th 2013, a Tuesday.  It seems death comes to our family on a Tuesday. You were Tuesday's Child for sure, born on Tuesday and died on Tuesday. Fall 2012 we had Hurricane Sandy. It destroyed many areas in Brooklyn, SI, NJ. and hit Sheepshead Bay. Our home took some hard knocks. It was  a difficult time for us all. 
Again it is September 11, 2014. 13 years have passed. The weather is as beautiful as it was on that day. The sky is so blue. I hang out a 9/11 remembrance Flag. Dad and I mourn quietly. Eric visited the new museum and Ground Zero. 
In the evening we listened to WHRW and your old Radio shows. I weep. You sound so alive, so "here." 
I will turn 60 in 2 short months. I always thought I'd have my oldest son by my side. This has been a personally difficulty year for me as I have had some medical issues. There were some scary events, but I am still here. I guess you were watching over me. Only you could make me laugh when I was angry at something or someone, and forget why I was angry in the first place. We shared the same warped sense of humor. You never judged me. You were more than a son, more than my child; you were a piece of my soul. 
I will always love you and miss you forever. I talk to you every day, and look for those "Paul" signs you send my way when I am especially down. When they come, I know you are still with me even though I can't see you. I long for you touch, your laugh, and I try to be the best I can until the day I can see you again my son, my first born. I love you forever, like you for always, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be. 
 

Your Mom

Dear Paul, 

My brother Lee who is now 24 was down at Ground Zero today walking around the memorial. He found your name and gave me a call to let me know he found it...he look a picture on his phone so he could share it with me. I need to come down there myself and pay my respects, as that is the least I can do to show that you are not forgotten.

Dear Paul, it is 9/11, Again. 

Now it is 11 years since you are gone. Some of your friends are still keeping me in their thoughts. I have gotten some texts and Facebook posts and and e-mails. Some of my friends have called and texted.

Today was a Tuesday and he weather was as beautiful with clear skies and fluffy clouds just like the first 9/11/01. I feel like I am in the movie Groundhog day- it is 9/11/01 all over again - trying not to have those terrible flashbacks to that day and trying to focus on all my wonderful memories of you.

Today I kept it low key- no reading of the names, no visits to Ground zero- the cemetery  ( which is an empty plot anyway) or a nostalgic trip to Regis. Just spent it  getting my portfolio ready for promotion and tenure.

I am driving Dad nuts and he is obsessively trying to make sense of my "storage" system on the computer. I can't help but think of how you would have sorted me out in 5 minutes - you could follow my train of thought and finish my sentences. I can smile when I think of you and sometimes I can close my eyes and feel your presence. 

I know you would have enjoyed all the new technology and been the first to get the I-pad and I phone. I can't believe the changes in these past 11 years-  yet so much is unchanged. You would so impressed by embracing of the computer and my ability to use Blackboard and Open Lab with my students. I think you are still helping me. 

Grandpa has hung on like the energizer Bunny - his doctor says, "my patient Jerry - you are still alive!" when we visit. But I am seeing a definite downturn - I hate to see him deteriorating and this long slow decline. 

Kristen is an RN and will be a Psych NP. She has 1 more year at Columbia - I will be guest speaker at her Health Policy Class next month and for the first time we will attend a professional conference together.  Eric is 23. I have never had a 23 year old son. He still seems so much younger than you were. But he is the baby of the family. 

Wesley is aging, he still looks good but he is definitely an old dog now at age 14, partially blind and his back legs bother him. And yes we can still tell if I am on a diet by how much the Dog weighs. Answer - both of us fat and waddling.

 

OXOXOX 
Love you forever like you for always as long as I'm living your Mother I'll be 
MOM
PS I try to behave so I can see you in Heaven. But Paul, you know I am not a patient woman - can't you put in a good word for me?

Dear Paul
You would be 33 today - Jan 2nd 2012. Od course we always celebrated your family �Birthday on New Year's Day. 
I always said I would get to tell the story every year and I couldn't wait to tell it to your future wife- but that did not happen. Now, I tell it in writing to your on line "guest book" and I relive it in my head. Because all �woman relive the birth of �their children - that's part of their history.  The story of pregnancy and childbirth - 
I joked, I couldn't complain that I carried you for 9 months because you came 6 weeks early - you were always in a hurry! I began having contractions early New Year's Eve and Dr. Mays checked me and said I was in labor and there was no more stopping it - I should eat light and be prepared to come to the hospital. I said I was going to my Grandmother's and having a big fish dinner - and there was no way I going into labor on New Year's Eve unless he could guarantee I would have the baby at 12 midnight - and get some gifts. Dr. Mays said he couldn't time it that way, so I said see him after the Eve. He said I was about 4 cm and my mucous plug had passed so he would probably see me in a couple of hours!l
But- I could be stubborn and I really did not want to spend New Year's Eve in the hospital knowing that the staff wanted to party and I wanted to eat my lobster dinner!l
So, I sipped some wine to slow the contractions (ETOH was used to stop labor in those days and you turned out just fine!) My water broke on New Years just after Midnight! I was totally "bummed out"- I had no intention of going to the hospital right after the New Year and not having the first baby anyway! But off we went. I was 6 cm dilated and you should have been born in less than 8 hours. However- my body refused to cooperate. As soon as I got to the hospital, all contractions just stopped! Maybe it was the Brandy Alexander I had but maybe it was mind over matter. I just refused to have you that night because I had insisted everyone was drinking and I was concerned something would go wrong. I felt a good night's sleep would benefit everyone, and I would have you in the morning. However, my uterus refused to start up again and needed a shot of Pitocin to get going! 
It was show time and you had to come out. You were a forceps delivery. Thankfully there wasn't a mark on you - that was how skilled Dr. Mays was!

Dr. Mays retired after he deliver you. He promised me he would wait until he delivered my baby and he did. I had a difficult pregnancy and delivery. If he wasn't the attending doctor I would have had a C/S - the nurses were only too eager to inform me how lucky I was that Dr. Mays had the patience to "let me labor so long."
No one ever would ever suspect you were a "preemie." You were large for dates and hit all your developmental milestones on time, some early. You were born with your eyes wide open (unusual - almost unheard of in an infant born so early). You came out curious to see what life had to offer.

And you remained that way until - 9/11: Quick and curious, with a smile that could light up a room. 
I think of what you would look like today - at 33 - would you have some gray at your temples? I barely have gray hair at 57 - my side doesn't seem to go gray until after 60. I know you would still be smiling and quick - I didn't slow down until after 55 - though my students don't think of me as slow.
I know I would never have achieved all that I have without you in my life, if you had not been born. I would not have become a Nurse Educator and Nurse Practitioner.

I had such a bad feeling when your work mates nicknamed you Rocket. Turned out I was right. 
When a child is born, as the delivery room nurse hands the baby to the mother she often says something about the infant - what the nurse may not know is that her causal remarks stay with new mother forever and become part of the story of that child's life. The nurse�pronounced you an old soul. For some reason I was a uncomfortable - I wanted to hear you were perfect, etc. I asked If you had hair- I was told you had a full head. I was happy - I had a son with hair! �But, I never forgot the old soul remark. It was true �you were an old soul. You came into this world with a flourish and �lit up my life. You left in a terrible inferno and �you made an indelible mark �on the world.
I love you forever I like you for always as long as I'm living my baby you'll be.
And I will always remember the day you were born- just like I can't forget the day you were killed. 
Love,


Your Mom, Elaine

Dear Mr. & Mrs. Leinung, 
Shortly after 9/11, I read an article about Paul. I specifically requested a silver remembrance band with his name on it because of that article. I live in Texas, so there is no way he and I would have ever met in person, but I want you to know that I will be wearing that band in remembrance of him this weekend. 
I was single in 2001 but I am now married with a son of my own. I cannot imagine what you have been through with losing Paul. Thank you for continuing the guestbook on his site. I just wanted you to know that Paul and his family will be thought of and prayed for by people you know and don't know in the coming days. I know the anniversaries, holidays and birthdays must be the worst for you. I hope this brief note brings a little comfort and peace to you and yours. 
May God bless you,

Andy Crews

Hey Paul
It's me your Mother
This week end was sad - New Year's and you were my mister New Year- my New Year's baby. You would have  been 32 -- a handsome man, with a wife a 2.3 children and a dog -- I try not to think of what should have been. I thought I'd get to tell the story of my labor and your birth to your wife when she was having your first child. I thought I'd get to tell the story to grandchildren -- well maybe I can tell it again someday-to my granddaughter if I should be so lucky to have one. 
Kristen is back in school for Nursing of all things. She will become a Pscyh-NP. Eric is still so unsettled. He is 21 more, boy than man -- 
I have always loved my kids for their differences. With you gone the equation is just not balanced though. 
Wish you were here. Hope that there is an after life and I will be with you again someday. After 9/11 that gave me some comfort and something to hang on to. But then the day-to-day reality of life without you in it has taken it's toll. I struggle every day. I am finally writing for my study. I pray for strength and wisdom to complete it and do a good job. 
Everywhere I looked there was the name Paul this weekend -- in a book I read a character was a Paul. I went out, at the next table was a Paul. I passed a car, there was a Paul license plate. Somedays I see one Paul -- this New Years weekend they were all around. I am sure you were saying hello and trying to let me know you were still there on some level. At least that is what I tell myself so I can function for another year  till wee meet again. 

Love you 4 ever, like you for always -- as long as I'm living my baby you'll be. 

 

Love Mom on your 32nd Birthday

You and your family will forever be on our minds on this anniversary, Paul. Wishing you all peace.

DEAR Paul,
It's me, your Mom. Well it has been 9 very long years- though in many ways 9/11 seems like yesterday. I still remember your bright smile and infectious laugh. The days leading up to 9/11 are hard for me - I get anniversary reaction- anxious and depressed. I wish I could see you and touch you. 
My clinical students gave my beautiful cards and wrote me some nice  messages- One said- "He will Always be Remembered." I thought that was very caring of them- I have a Muslim student in this group and she is very sweet. I have had Muslim students since 9/11 and I never feel any animosity towards them or get any reactions from them. It amazes me that people can be so bigoted and hateful. 
Today for the Memorial services, Kristen Chenowith sang Borrowed Angels and the NYC Youth choir sang Never Forget- the services this year were very moving. Family members were able to speak about their loved ones. If I had know that I would have read the names and spoke about my son who was old beyonf his years and brought so much joy into our lives. 
Grandpa is hanging in there- Dad is, well, Dad! I won't write about Kristen & Eric- because of privacy issues. I'd write more about me but again there is too much information, the thing Kristen always warns me about. Suffice it to say we all miss you. I talk to you every day anyway- so you know what is in my heart and mind. 

Love you 4 ever, like you 4 always , as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be.
Give my love to Love to Harry , Jeannie, Joey, Uncle Joe, Aunt Jean and Grandma. Till we meet again ....

I met Paul when I was at Binghamton, he was a sophomore and I was a freshman, I met him through mutual friends, and we both lived at CIW. I just came across a photo of a bunch of us in the dorms at CIW and Paul was in the photo. We all looked so young in the picture, even though it feels like just yesterday we were all in school together. I remember his website and I just came across the guestbook, and it was really emotional reading all of the posts, especially yours Elaine. Although I didn't know Paul very well I do definitely remember him well. I know how funny and nice he was, how outgoing, and how driven he was. I have a random memory of a couple of us going to a J. Crew warehouse sale in Binghamton and we both bought the same shirt. I always think of Paul at this time of the year, and how senseless and tragic it was that he was taken. 
Paul, you and your family are in my thoughts and prayers.

Paul,
On this anniversary of your death, I would rather say it is the anniversary of your new life. I hope you are having a great time. Do you see the universe? Do you get to fly? What is it like to be in the presence of God? You always enjoyed life, how much more  you must be enjoying an existence without pain, or sorrow, or tears. Till we meet again.

Mr and Mrs Leinung, 
My name is Phil Hurwitz, a Vestal native currently living in Denver. I was a regular caller and occasional guest panelist on the Mad Trivia Party on WHRW, while Mark Scudder was running the show. Mark and I have recently reconnected, and every September I remember the profound impact Paul had on his friends and everyone who knew him at WHRW. 

I emailed in to a show on Sirius/XM satellite radio that I listen to daily, and that brings enjoyment to me and thousands of others every weekday. One of the co-hosts, Mike Tully, is the primary point of contact, and I asked that Paul's name be mentioned in memoriam. 

As you'll read below, Mike actually went to high school with Paul (I believe he said he was a couple years ahead of Paul), and not only honored my request, but even mentioned battaglia.org on the program. 

I hope the loyal listeners of the Jason Ellis Show were motivated to visit Paul's site, read about the great man he was, and maybe even donate towards his memorial fund in his honor. 

I can't imagine the difficulty you face every September, as the anniversary passes. I just hope there is some comfort in hearing stories like these, and knowing that Paul is missed. If you feel this to be appropriate, you can also feel free to post this on his guestbook at battaglia.org. 

Sincerely,
Phil Hurwitz

Glad I could help.
I always remember the time Paul hung photocopies of the head of Mr. Coleman - our school's librarian, who appearance was notable for his humongous ears - throughout the halls, as a joke. The Dean of Discipline questioned me as a suspect; as far as I know, Paul was never caught.
Please send my regards to his family.

Dear Elaine, again you and your family are remembered and will always be, your friend, 

Pat Cooper

Today I cried for a moment
Thinking of your last vision
Seeing your son walk into the morning
on that dreadful day

He looked back at you
as he carried his hanger of clothes
over his shoulder, on his journey
away from you that day

The parting is not forever
all of life continues on
He would want you to keep on teaching
to help others find their way

Your heart is big
Your smile so sweet
as you encourage others
to make life good and great

September 11, 2009 5:21:26 PM EDT

Paul
Today it is eight years since that terrible day the terrorists attacked our country.
This morning I listened as the names were read and a bell was rung to mark the times the Tower were struck and when they fell. My mind went back to the phone call you made to 911 and how long they kept that from us. It was so hard to listen to your voice as you tried to keep calm. How proud I was so proud that you were trying to help those who were trapped with you. Your call may have been the only one out from the 100th floor that day. You were always quick. You were so fast you were even in a rush to be born, coming a full 6 weeks early. The nurses were surprised because you were born with your eyes open. Most "preemies" don't open their eyes so easily! Then again maybe you knew you'd only have a short time to accomplish things and that is why you were always in a hurry and in many ways ahead of your peers. 
Kristen turned 23 in January 2009. She is now older than you when you were killed. I now have a 23 year old for the first time. It seems odd. She is now older than her big brother. Eric is a man 20 years old- but still a boy in many ways. He is searching. For himself. For what he wants out of life. I can't help but think things would have been better if we hadn't had to live through your loss. 
Is is so funny, you always knew just what you wanted and you were on the verge of having it all when you were so cruelly taken from us. 
Dad and I still miss you. People don't seem to get it. The loss goes on and on. Your friends are marrying and having families. You will be forever 22... The circle was broken and my heart hurts every day. Grandpa is hanging in there but he needs oxygen for all his activities of daily living. Hard to watch such an active man fade. 
Thank you for the penny Wednesday. It has been awhile since one turned up in an unexpected place all shiny and new and heads up ,of course! It made me smile. I felt your presence and knew my "first day of school" would be OK. 
Say hello to Harry and Jeannie and Joey and Uncle Joe and Grandma & Aunt Jean and all the rest of the family there to keep you company, until we meet again my son. 
Love you forever, like you for always, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be.

When today rolls around, I always think of Paul. I didn't know Paul particularly well (he was a senior at Regis when I was a lowly freshman). But I recall him being one of my first examples of the promise and potential that is constantly exhibited by Regians. He wasn't what you were supposed to be, but rather what you could be with hard work and ingenuity.
It's a shame that I'll never have the opportunity to thank him in person for that. But I'll always remember and be grateful.
My thoughts and prayers go out to Paul's family on this sad anniversary. God bless.

Hello: I just wanted to say that I am thinking of Paul today, like I always do around this time. He was one of the funniest people to hit the airwaves at WHRW, and I remember those moments like they were yesterday. I can't believe it's been eight years. My thoughts are with you and all of Paul's family and friends at this time. I promise he will always be remembered.

To all of Paul's family: Just to let you know Paul has not been forgotten. It's not just that I share the same surname that I remember. When I first went to his site I was awed by the pictures he had taken from his floor window and of his desk. I also remember that Paul had a gift of math and that he could add up his mom's grocery's bill while the food items were going through the check out. I wish I had known Paul because I started a career in radio and then TV and I know he was involved in radio when he went to college.

Blessings to the family.

Dear Paul,
Today is your birthday. You would have been 30 years old today. A milestone birthday.  Where would you be? How would you be celebrating? Questions we'll never have an answer to. I haven't visited your website in such a long time. Time marches on but the memories live inside of us forever. You had such a stong faith for one so young. I often marvelled at that as it wasn't too common as so many lose their way in their youth. I thought I had strong faith too and then you were taken from us so senselessly. I hope there is a heaven and we'll all be reunited one day. Know that you are forever in our hearts and we miss you dearly.
All our love,
 

Dad, Cathy, and brothers Mike and Matt

Dear Paul, 
I put my old email address into the web browser by accident, and in the search engine came up your web page. I had posted back in 2002 in your guestbook, and I have not posted since. Let me tell you a little secret, I think about you, and you never leave my thoughts. Every time I am near or going past ground zero, I think about that day, and how your life was cut short. I found this picture of you and my friend David and I, it was up in Hemlock. I think we are like 13 or so in it, but I keep it on a shelf in the country house. We had a lot of good summers there, and I am sad that you are not here. I would have liked to have seen what you would have turned out like, I am sure just as funny, and cool as you were in your youth. My love goes out to you and your family, and I hope you are keeping my mother company up there :)
All the best,

To Paul, and his mother 
I don't understand why it took me seven years to find Paul's website. As I sat in my cubicle for 2 hours today, reading every single post that someone made, I was compelled in such a way that I had to post something to express the way I feel. I couldn't stop crying thinking about everything he could have gone through, and what his mom goes through everyday. 

My name is Kathryn and I grew up with Paul in the summers in Hemlock Farms, PA. Paul and I attended the same day camp for a few summers in the very early 90's. We are the same age and our families live around the same areas in NYC. We even have close birthdays (Jan 2 & 30) I'm sure this year he would have partied it up for his 30th. I remember Paul as being that friendly laid back kid who liked to laugh, have fun and play pranks with his boy Andy. He was outspoken, sympathetic and a great listener, all at the age of 12. He loved numbers too. However, his fear of the water must have been big because he never went swimming, even on those really hot summer days.  I wish I could have taught him how to swim : (( We hung out in the teen center, steer barn and handball courts. I'll always remember his khaki shorts and boat shoes. Who wore boat shoes at the age of 12?? I guess you could say he had his own style.  I also can't forget the camp sleep-out in the apple orchard either. Ghost stories and pranks were his specialty that night. 

My brother was the first to tell me about Paul that day. I worked in Maspeth at the time, over near the LIE/BQE intersection and I had a great view of the city from my office window.  I could see from the Empire State building all the way downtown to the twin towers. When I saw what was happening, I couldn't believe my eyes. When I read Paul's name on the list of missing persons and saw his picture, my heart broke, knowing that I possibly lost a childhood friend at such a young age. But why would God take away such a great person?? That's just not fair.

At this time, I would like to send my thoughts and my prayers to your entire family, especially your mom. I know she loves and misses you very, very much, just by reading all the words she has written. I think about you often and hope your mom continues to be the strong woman that she is. Much love and God bless.

Paul, I can't believe it's been 7 years now. It's been awhile since I wrote to you. Life just seems to happen all too quickly now. It's been awhile since I remembered your smile. Today I was able to remember it and smile back. May your motivation always live on.

Dear Mr. and Ms. Leinung, 

I was a classmate of Paul's at Binghamton. I am thinking of Paul and your family today. I will always remember Paul for his great spirit and have thought of him often over the years and what a wonderful person he was. I, along with everyone else he came across, are better for having known him. 

With warm regards,

Dear Paul,

Today is the 7th Anniversary of 9/11. I have been thinking of you - I am always thinking of you. 

 This week of course it is constantly on my mind. I wish I could just remember your life, your energy, and your spirit. The manner of your death still haunts me. I know you had time to feel afraid. Time to know the end was near. And I couldn't be there for you. I couldn't save you. And that is an unimaginable pain. I was proud when I herd you placed a 911 and was trying to help the others trapped with you on the 100th fl. I wish of course I could have spoken to you that day. I wish I could have spared you a horrible death. When you were little I used to sing to you @ Bedtime (alright I use the term sing loosely, You had the same tuneless "voice" which you employed with great gusto!) I used to sing part of a song, "Tell me why you are crying my son, are your frightened like everyone? Is it the thunder in the distance you hear? Will it help if I stay very near- I am here. And if you take my hand my son, all will be well when the day is done. And if you rake my hand my son all will be will when the day is done... But, I couldn't take your hand and when the day was done, it was not well. It was truly terrible.

I have "moved" forward. I finished my Doctorate in Nursing this August. I kept my Promise to you, Kristen just Graduated Fordham. Eric completed 1 yr @ CW Post. Dad is working and playing guitar in Church. He continues to be very involved with Peaceful Tomorrows. Grandpa is doing well despite the doctors dire predictions. Aline will be here later today. We will go to the Cemetery where I have a marker with no body under it for you. Since the 9/11 Memorial is still not completed in NYC, I am glad I have something that honors and remembers you. Aline will marry in June, to a Regis boy-  Regians are the best of the best. Your friends have been a great support to her. Binghamton built a memorial to the Alumni lost- you were the youngest. Your smiling face from your 2000 graduation photo greets all those who pause on their way to and from class. 

I had that small brass plaque placed in the Regis Chapel for the fallen Regians. However, to my great chagrin NYC had not "done the right thing" and built a decent Memorial for the families, New Yorkers, the rest of the Nation and the World to see that the saying we will never forget, was not an empty promise. 

This year, the seventh year is especially poignant for me. This year your baby sister Kristen is 22 (she is also a January baby) she is the exact age you were on 9/11 2001. Soon she will be older that her older brother. I will have a 23 y/o in Jan a birthday you never got to celebrate. MY cousin Debbie's son was married on Labor Day weekend 2001. He is a father of 3 -- 2 girls and a boy. You and Aline were supposed to have married and had children. But, it was not to be.  7 years... too long. I miss you. I long to hear your laugh, see your smile. Feel your smooth cheek on mine when you gave me my "good night" kiss. 

They are calling the name-l the role call of the dead. Your name was called by a student from Azerbaijan Your entire name, Paul James Battaglia, was clearly enunciated. Your face with its smile looked on for a brief moment. I will listen for Harry's name to be called. I will get dressed- walk Wesley. Stop on the way out and drop a kiss on Grandpa's head. Today I will mourn and not even try to "be strong" for others, Kristen, Eric, I will not try to look or act as if It is all right, I am fine. Today I will be what I am beneath the veneer, a bereaved mother. Missing her first born and oldest son. My rock, my heart, my soul. 

It is 9:03 am when the plane hit the second tower. 

At 8:46 the first plane hit Tower 1 and at 8:57 you got a cell call thru to 911. A call they denied anyone could have made from the 100th fl of Tower 1.
But, you called and the First responder in a calm and almost happy voice advised you to wait- help was on the way. This was not to be and I live with the pain of not being able to comfort you. A parent is not supposed to outlive a child. It is against the natural order, though it occurs and it is never an easy thing for a parent to face or accept. A murdered child is even worse and when that child had to suffer for Politics, and your Country has not done what it said it would do. Capture and punish the perpetrators, the masterminds. Well, it is almost too much to bear. I go on. I have no choice.... I have another promise to fulfill- to write about the grief process and to write the story of one mother's journey coping with loss. I am doing my best until we meet again. My son, I am so sorry I could not make it well when the day was done. It was done all too soon for you. We, your loved ones will never forget. 

Love you forever, like you for always
As long as I'm living your Mother I'll be

I can still remember reading that to Kristen every night and you would sit beside me as I put her to bed. It was to you as well. When I'd read it to Eric a few years later. I'd sometimes add it is a good thing I love you! (He was such a difficult child and he never went to sleep without a fuss)
You would get annoyed with me when I was not patient with Eric. You'd spend a few minutes with him. Sometimes singing to him, I'd listen and smile
I'd smile at the love you had and shared with your sister and brother. I'd smile because I had such a wonderful and loving son.  We were so lucky to have had you in our life... I miss you -- I will always miss you. 

Your Mother for ever

My son,
It has been 6 years since that very tragic day. The day our nation was attacked and so many beautiful and talented people lost their lives. Many, like yourself, were young and just starting to build a career , looking forward to marriage and children. The circle of life was broken and will forever remain incomplete. A life unfinished. That is how I think of your life even though it is over. To me with so much ahead of you it will always be a life unfinished.
As new gadgets come out I can't help but think of how you would be the first to have one of whatever. When your Regis buddies broke the Subway record for riding all the lines on one fare I know you would have been with them. I try not to think of how different  (and better) my life would be like now with you in it. In Jan when Kristen has her 22nd birthday it will remind me that was the last birthday you ever had. You would be 29 on the 2nd, my faux New Year's boy. It will be such a difficult day happy for daughter who is a Senior In college and has grown into a lovely young woman. In pain for all the birthdays I will never see you celebrate. 
Kristen will get older than her older brother. That is very hard to bear.
Eric is 18 now and suffering over the breakup of his first serious girlfriend. I remember when that happened to you and your high school sweetheart. She is a married woman now. 
I hurt for you (and her). It is not any easier watching your last child going through it than it was the first time around. Each child is special and a mother hurts when her children hurt. 
Eric is a freshman at CW Post. He is a theatre major as you well know he has a histrionic streak. Grandpa is hanging in there defying all predictions about his asbestosis. 
Dad (John) is still involved in PT and misses you daily. 
The SI crew are OK. Little Christopher is not so little and is in kindergarten. Alexa is in 6th already. Time flies but for me 9/11/01 was yesterday. 
I still remember 9/10/01 How happy I was and how bright and full of promise the future of all my children looked. 
Last May we got the recording of your last phone call. Your friend Justin said you made two 911 calls that morning but when Verizon sent the cell phone bill it stopped @ 9/10. They confirmed the phone call times when I called the first time but, when I tried to get written confirmation or access to the call I was denied.  Then May 2006 the City called us and asked us if we wanted a copy of your last call. It was extremely hard to listen to it. However it did you credit. It was so you only 22 yet concerned about the 30 or so others who were trapped with you. You were one of the many unsung heros of 9/11. You will always be my personal hero. I miss you so much. More than words can express. I wish it were possible to see you or touch you or talk to you .... I hope I will see you again some day in Heaven despite my imperfections! 
I hope you and Harry and the members of our family that went before you and after you are  together. I miss all of them especially Jeannie and Harry. You always said your favorite  Holiday dinners were spent with them.
Aline called today She is almost an NP!! I was so glad to hear from her.  
Paul, if you have any pull I could use your help with the Case IRB!
And, can you help send Kristen a nice boy soon. You know what I want for Eric.
As long as I'm living your mother I'll be.
PS I'll see you in my dreams.

Hi, 
   I wanted to say how sorry I am for your loss. I heard Paul's name a few minutes ago on television and I thought Paul might have been another Paul Battaglia I knew from high school. It had never hit me before that the name was called, because I have always been too depressed to focus on the names. Though I am saddened, I am this year doing my best to honor every individual in any name I can. Even though he is not the same person, I wanted to send you my deepest sympathies and I can see clearly he always was and will be loved. Your dedication to family makes me feel closer to my family and I would like to say I will always remember how important each person was to many others. I will pray your family has peace of mind and the strength to achieve all they want.
Sincerely,                                                                                         Paulina

To Paul, family, and friends -
Tonight I was thinking of you again, for no particular reason other than to remember you, a victim of 9/11 that I never personally knew, yet I know you due to your web page memorial that I read so long ago. I signed your guestbook on December 26, 2001, and now I wish to do the same again. All your family and friends will one day rejoin with you in Heaven, as will all victims of that fateful day with their own. My sympathy and best wishes go to your kin in hope that such a tragedy as 9/11 will never happen again. Rest in peace until that joyful day of Resurrection with our Lord.

Paul my Dearest son,
Another year has come & gone without you. The pain has turned to a stone in my heart. I will carry it forever. This year marks 4 years since the attacks on the WTC and the American way of life has been changed. The world seems to be in a cycle of destruction. Natural disasters have killed thousands. The Tsunami and most recently a Hurricane destroyed New Orleans. Joanne & I went there in June with Cheryl, Tracy and the kids to the Safety Engineers conference a Scholarship was established in Harry's name. I enjoyed being with the kids but, we never should have had to go there in the first place. Harry should have been alive and so should you and almost 3,000 others. But, we saw "The Big Easy" and the French Quarter. I can only hope they will rebuild. This damage could have been prevented but, enough money wasn't allocated to repair the levee's. So thousands perished and a historic city will be changed forever. NYC is also changed forever but, this was not "natural" however, it could have been prevented. Again money was the issue. 
The airlines still haven't spent enough on proper security. The government created the Victim's Compensation Fund to keep the airlines from going bankrupt from lawsuits. They were supposed to correct their security problems but, again money and profit motives have prevented them from doing all they should do. ( The Fund was a horrible way to deal with our pain and loss. Even Feinberg "the Special Master" said it should have never been done that way. ) I will honor you, Harry and all those killed on 9/11. I hate that this war was started in 9/11 victims names. Other Mothers are losing sons and daughters. They too will carry that pain like a stone in their hearts forever. I cry for them, for all the young people deprived of a life. I am sick over the loss of lives from Katrina. When will we learn? 
Why? Why? I said I wouldn't get myself caught up in asking Why? It wouldn't bring you back. But, I still do it WHY??? My son , my son. I miss you beyond words. I miss the baby I bore though I remember him, I can still feel your baby skin, I grieve for the young child who struggled to master his fear of the water, I grieve for the man you became. You were so happy, smart, compassionate and accomplished. You were just beginning your adult life. You had so much to offer. I was so proud to have been your Mother. 
I will love you forever, like you for always, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be. 
Love to my son on his 4th anniversary in Heaven

Mr. and Mrs. Leinung,
I wanted to take a minute to write to you this morning.  I heard you both speak this morning with joy and tears in your voices on NPR as I drove to work.  The memories and emotions of your son Paul were heartwarming to me.  Since coming to work, I looked up Paul's website to learn more about him and his life. I smiled this morning as you told the story of your daughter and how protective she was of Paul  I was this type of younger sibling as well.  In my case, it was my brother Kevin.  He passed away unexpectedly in 1995 at the age of 37. 
Thank you for sharing your son with me.  I feel I have learned from him in how he lived his life. 
My best wishes to you for your strength and peace as life continues on.  Now 10 years later, I still struggle to accept my brother's death, but know that I must work to preserve his legacy.  Thank you for doing the same for your son. 
Warm  Regards,

Things are crazy in the world today and you probably could help us shed some light on it.

Hi Paul,
The other day I was listening to the radio and the song "My Own Worst Enemy" came on. I had this flashback to, oh, I don't know, 5 years ago? Some of us were sitting on the couches in the lobby of the radio station when you came in and told us that you'd just heard that this group called Lit was going to be the opening band for Garbage when they played on campus. One of us, who was too cool to listen to mainstream radio, asked who the band was, and instead of answering, you just busted out with this great imitation of the whiny opening line of their (one and only?) hit single: "It's no surprise to me I am my own worst enemy / 'cause every now and then I kick the living s*** out of me..." And the person (wish I could remember who!) had NO idea why those words came out of your mouth and was so confused. We all laughed; it was a really cute moment. Thinking about it the other day made me happy, and made me remember why I loved being friends with you. So anyway, just wanted to post here that I thought of you and that even now you make me smile.
Love, Dava

Dear Paul,
Happy Birthday in heaven. It has been such a long time since I have posted here. Today we all gathered here to celebrate Grandpa B.'s 80th birthday. He never likes to have a big fuss made over him, but since Aunt Rose passed away so suddenly last month, it seems like family should gather and celebrate whenever we can. It still seems so unbelievable that more than 3 years have gone by, but you are never far from us in spirit and are forever in our hearts.
Love, Dad and Cathy

I was at my computer today just looking at pictures of victims of 911and feeling sad when I stumbled on Paul's picture and writeup. I was so impressed and I went looking for his website. Today I got to meet Paul with all the wonderful things written about him by friends and family. He was a great person. At 22 he was very intelligent and so talented. May the Lord continue blessing his family especially his mother and father. One day we will all get to meet Paul in Heaven. We all miss you Paul.
God Bless!

To Paul's friend's and family-- I met Paul briefly in 2000. I was Aline's TA and good friend in nursing school. I remember how much she loved him. Her eyes lit up with the mere mention of his name. I happened to find this site the other day while surfing the web. This is an amazing tribute to a wonderful person. The stories and postings on here are heart-wrenching. Aline and I have lost touch. I'm hoping to reconnect with her. I want to express my deepest condolences to everyone who loves him. He is the only 9/11 victim I knew personally. I am thinking of you and pray for you.

To all who sent notes to the guestbook earlier this year and have been waiting to see their notes posted -- I'm sorry for the long delay.  Dealing with loosing Paul has only been made more difficult by virtue of 9/11 having been in the news in some form, nearly every day for these three years.  I'm afraid it just came to the point where, for a time, I couldn't face the updating chores.  To you all, and to Paul, I apologize.

Hi! Paul,
It's me . It has been a long time since I last wrote. For several reasons.
One, I feel you are with me in Spirit & I "talk " to you daily. Well, as you know the plaque was blessed at Regis on Friday 9/10. The three Regians are listed by year of graduation. It is in the Chapel that you so loved.
We went to the dedication of the SI Memorial on 9/11. The architect (he looked about 12) did a fantastic job. It is everything a memorial should be.
I am now going to try to get Brooklyn to install an appropriate memorial.
I'll let you know how I make out!
Miss you love you forever....
Kristen is at Fordham -- but you knew that. I could use your help with Eric!

Dear Paul,
I am a Regis alumnus who never knew you. You never knew me either. But during the homily of our memorial mass at St. Ignatius, your name was mentioned along with many other members of the Regis community who were taken away from us.
I've looked back to see all these entries written by your mother and friends, and even people like me who never knew you. I felt compelled to write because after reading these entries, I've created an image of you in my mind that is so familiar--you are like all my best friends, all of my friends at Regis and "Brothers in Christ."
On this day, I am praying for you and for your very strong mother, who loves you so much. It hurts to imagine that things like this happen to great people and wonderful families, but it only makes it so much more obvious that we are called to love each each other.
The sun is shining today in Boston. Is that all of you?

Dear Mrs. Leinung,
Just wanted to drop you a quick note to let you know that I was thinking about you and your family today. I went to Binghamton with Paul--and knew him through mutual friends. Gosh--he had a magnetic personality, didn't he? Anytime someone I knew (Al Acker, Liz Leinhard, Greg, Dava, Mary) spoke about him, they always had a funny story and a huge smile. Anyway, I visited his website today, and wanted to write you an e-mail to say hi. You are in my thoughts and prayers, and while today was so hard for you, I hope that you were able to smile at some of your fun memories of him and feel comforted.
Warmest Regards,

Dear Paul,
It's now been 3 years and your memory still makes me smile.  I can never forget witnessing how you stormed the Dickinson Dining Hall with Seth and Jeremy broadcasting as they order a "Klaffburger".  Your enthusiasm was, and still is, inspiring and still makes you one of the best GM's I've ever had at the H' - long after I have graduated from Binghamton.
As always, my prayers are with you, your family and loved ones, the rest of the victims and all those effected by what happened September 11, 2001.  Please be assured that although the world gives off the appearance that it does not want to recall what happened that day, the reality is that it is because of people, like you, who remind us all that we should never forget.  Personally, I know that I will always remember...
Rest in Peace, Paul.  Peace, Love and Moe.  Now, more than ever...

Hi Paul,
Where were all of us 3 years ago tonight... doing what... 
These past 3 years I feel that I have gotten to know you... know what kind of a young man you were etc. Prior all I knew of you was when you were a small baby and then meeting you again at Grandma and Grandpa Battaglia's 50th anniversary... Your great Great Aunt Tannie and I were so happy to meet you and to see what a fine young man you were. We knew that your parents were so proud of you... and your grandparents were too... I guess the lord decided that he needed you up in heaven with him more than he wanted you to be here on earth with the rest of us. 
Please watch over us and help us all to be good people... Aunt Tannie still says her rosary for you.
Much love, your cousin,

I did not know Paul. But by some chance of fate I was
brought to this page. I want to express my deepest
most heartfelt condolences to the family and friends
of this fine young man. I think it is a beautiful,
loving tribute leaving his words and images untouched,
left behind for all to read- especially those who
never had the chance to be touched by the life Mr.
Battaglia. I too, lost a dear friend, Jeff, to
senseless violence. He was murdered 12/01/02 at the
video game store in which he worked. He was only 21,
to be 22 on 12/03/02. His memorial page is located at
http://www.geocities.com/darcytristessa I only wish
that I had writings from Jeff, as you have from Paul.
Although my story differs from yours, I do know what
it is to lose someone you love and care for in such a
terrible and senseless act of hatred and violence. My
thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends
of Paul as well as Paul himself. 9/11/01 should have
never happened. And it saddens me that people seem to
have forgotten. I haven't. And now that I've had a
glimpse of Paul, I won't forget him either. Please
take care.
Sincerely,

Lianna

I came across your web site by accident through the 9/11/01 Memorial Bracelet site. Every entry in the guest book broke my heart. I live in Seattle and was not personally touched by the horrific events of September 11th but as much as it hurts, I find myself searching for information about the people and the day. Paul, this website is a great testament to you and your life....I loved the stories about you and your friends. Your mother sounds like a great person, I'm sure you are proud of her.

Fellow Americans: don't forget the pain of that day, remember the great ones like Paul.

Elaine, 
Thankfully, I didn't lose anyone close to me on September 11th. But the truth is, I felt like I had. All of those innocent people....it was just too much to think about. That next September, in my English Comp class, we were asked to pick a victim of the attacks and write about them to honor the anniversary. I went home that night, and looked at the list of victims on the web. Scrolling through, Pauls name stood out to me for some reason. I clicked on the link, and it brought me here. I have learned so much about that wonderful young man, and wish I could have known him. Two years after that assignment, I still find myself drawn to this site. I come here atleast once a week. I feel for all of you who were close to him. And if I am ever to lose a child, I hope I can be as strong as you. You are truly an inspiration.

Paul, It's me, your Mom.
I talk to you so much in my head I don't remember to post some messages. I thought I wrote about Aline's visit from "Down under". She went to lunch with Kristen and stopped by my office to say Hello. She & Sadie are happy in Australia. She likes her job. Though Nursing is different there, the Nurses have been good to her. 
Seth & I had a nice lunch just before Christmas. He is a writer now. Maybe I'll get him to help me publish this site as a book!
Some of he Regis's boys checked in. Got a nice Card from Al. After Aline, she was my next choice for a D-I-L. Miss Justin, Hope he graduates and goes on to be a very good doctor. 
You probably know all this already, but I need to "talk" to you.
I do it especially when I'm driving. 
Love you forever, like you for always as long as I'm living my baby you'll be.
Love, Mom.

Dear Paul,
Happy Birthday Baby. You would be 25 years old had you not been murdered. You are forever in my heart in my thoughts and my prayers.
I bought you a gift today even though you are not here. It is your name -- its origin, meaning and qualities that go with it. The background has a eagle soaring into the sky. The saying was so "you," I had to get it. I placed it by your picture in the living room. Aunt Karen calls it my shrine. Joanne brought me a penguin Beanie Baby today, it has your Birthday, Jan 2nd. He is sitting on the Flag case. We all thought about you today. I told funny Paul and Mom stories. Inside I cried.
 Kristen will be 18 on the 25th of this month -- a big birthday for her. Another occasion I will mourn and celebrate. My life is full of such contradictions now. 
Goodnight my son. I hope you are at peace. 
The Holidays were very draining . I will love & miss you forever. 
Love,
Mom

Dear Elaine,
Thank you for your e-mail. I'm very sorry that it has taken me so long to get back to you. 
I thought that you would like to know that since the morning of September 11th 2003 I have been in touch with Brian Lennon, a very dear friend of mine, who I had managed to lose touch with over the years. Brian and I are now as close as we ever were. I thank Paul for bringing my friend back to me. 
Paul's memory stays alive in us, always.

Dear Paul, 
Well it comes around quickly, but it still doesn't make it any easier to deal with. I only knew you 3 weeks around Europe, but I feel we bonded even during that short time. You seem like an old school buddy. Mate, I think about you lots..... the good times we had on tour. The energy you gave to the trip. It was truly inspirational. I am thankful to have you contribute to SO many great memories. 
Despite it being difficult to visit your guestbook and read some of the messages from your mother, I still remember the great memories I have of you. 
Thinking of you & your family always.

Dear Paul,
It is 10:30 PM and I know that two of my children are here but one is gone forever. I hope that there is a "Heaven".
I should be preparing for my lecture tomorrow but, I just replied to an e-mail from a mother & child who purchased a Memorial Flag with your name on it. I told them about you, how you were funny, and bright and when you were a kid you were a "regular" boy. How I worried about your room being messy and those pranks you and Andy used to pull!
How well adjusted you turned out to be. I didn't say you were not only my son but, my friend -- My own special "cheer leader". You were my only child for 7 years. My first born, my practice child and in many ways my partner in crime!
Sunday we had a Memorial Luncheon for you. Many people who touched my life and your's were there. Fr. Kuntz came even though he hasn't been well. I think his stint in Africa had alot to do with his health problems. Some of the Regis guys were there. Dave, Vinny, BJ Brian Lennon & Boyle.Brian Nappy couldn't make it down from Binghamton. I really wanted to see him. He set up a scholarship fund in you name at Binghamton. Justin is in Medical school he has an OB/GYN rotation this semester. He hasn't been to see us since just after 9/11. Your death hit him very hard. As it did to all your close friends.
The Regis Fund is stopping giving scholarships. It is just too difficult. The Board is moving on. Though Vinny had the hardest time with letting go. We are donating the rest of the money to Regis. It is under discussion with Fr. MacLaine just what form it will take. BJ wants to do something for the OWL. You column Owl Droppings has been taken up again after an absence of several years by another young witty and sarcastic Regian.
GrandPa had a hard time with the whole thing. He misses you & mourns every day. Uncle Johnny and Uncle Vinny & Aunt Jo and his sister were all there for him but, he still cried. Dad was so upset he didn't take any pictures though he had his camera on him the whole time. He has been very depressed and this second Anniversary was difficult for him as well. He misses you too and the time you guys spent together. Only Eric take his side now if we argue. Nanna & Opa and his brother's and their families all came. You know Uncle Mark spent the night of 9/10 on the sofa bed in your basement apartment. He felt so helpless when he saw Kristen's face when she came home from school that day.
Your Father and Cathy were there with Matthew - he has gotten tall and thinner. Michael was up @ school. Your Grandparents and Aunt Joyce & Uncle Ted came too. Your father was trying to reminisence about my Senior Prom 30 years ago. 30 years!! We were such young kids. We tried to be married but, messed it up. 
At least you weren't messed up. Now we are no longer connected by even a thin thread. The last connection was severed when you were killed. I have our wedding Album. Dec. 1, 1973 I was saving it for your kids. I was planning to use my wedding dress that My Aunt Josephine hand sewed hundreds of little pearls on for a Christening Gown or pillow for my Grand children from you. Now the dress & the Album have no purpose. That chapter of my life is now closed. I suppose he felt that and still wanted some connection thru old memories. . While you were alive we were divorced parents. Now we are nothing. Just ex-spouses. It is strange. I hated the thought of having to share you and your future wife & kids with him especially on Holidays. As if that was the worst thing in the world. Little did I know. Now I'd have him over if only you could be there too. 
Goodnight my son, my son. I love you forever, Like for always as long as I'm living my baby you'll be.
Love,MOM

Dear Elaine,
My name is Nikki. I live in Odessa Texas. On the anniversary of 9-11, one of our banks here held a memorial for all of the victims. More than 3,000 flags were set out at our Memorial Gardens park on the 10th. That following Sunday, my 8 year old daughter purchased one of those flags for a donation. Each flag came with the name of one of the victims of 9-11. Your son's name was the one with the flag she received.
I have been searching on the internet to find out something about your son that I can tell my daughter. She has a collection of the newspapers, etc from that horrible day. I would like her to have something that tells about the person that her flag represents. I just happened to come across a web sight with the guestbook and was reading some of the messages to Paul when I came across yours. I just had to email you.
We are so sorry for your loss. I'm sure it is not easy living without your son. We pray for the victims and all of their families each day. We will continue to keep you and your family in our daily prayers. If it is not too much trouble, could you tell me a little about him so that she will have something to save with the flag she has in his honor?
Thank you so much,

On behalf of my brother and I, as well as on behalf of all of those Binghamton University students who may have known Paul as friends or even acquaintances, I just wanted to say that we all still cannot fathom what happened to him on September 11, 2001.
Paul, you brought a lot of energy to the 5th floor of Cayuga my freshman year, and a lot of positives to the radio station as well. Even though you may never have known this, you always brought a smile to my face and my roommate's face when you did wacky things like calling the automated CIW Menu Lady during your Sunday radio show.
You have not been forgotten by so many people who you touched or inspired, and you will be remembered by so many other former BU students who have at least one or two Paul stories in their respective repertoire of memories.
I guess I will end this with the way I always used to sign off of WHRW after September 11, 2001.
Peace. Love. Moe ... and Paul.

It still feels like just yesterday that we were laughing in CR-1 while doing a radio show, or laughing in the back room of the Pipe Dream office while designing the WHRW program guide, or laughing in the car on the way to Coney Island to film stuff for the TV show. Strangely enough, whatever the memory, it feels like we were laughing. That, or singing "Off The Books" as off-key as humanly possible. Paul, not a day goes by that I don't still think about you constantly, wonder what you think about what's going on down here these days, wish you were around to give me advice and to make smartass comments about everything and everybody. Please know that you are still a huge part of my life and the lives of so many others -- and we all wish you peace, love, moe and Paul.--

Dear Paul,
Today is 9/11 2003 the second anniversary of you murder. Murder is such a painful word but, that is what you, Harry and almost 3,000 others were. Senselessly & with no regard to age, race, creed or gender. Just killed for an ideology. In the name of ALLAH!! God Almighty! How can anyone think the creator of life would want murder done in his name?
I miss you my handsome, bright, funny & loving son. All week I have had terrible dreams with many flashbacks to that horrible but paradoxically beautiful September day that you were taken from us.
So much has happened! Yet, in many ways I feel like it was just yesterday.
Aline has moved to Australia (she took Sadie with her). She has a job on a cardiac floor there and is dating a nice young man from Sydney. She has not talked to me about him, but Kristen says he sounds very nice. I know she had to go on with her life. I wish her only good things she is a very special young woman. She called today. She is adjusting to her new job & life.
I wish that it all could have turned out differently.
Cheryl is still very depressed and has not been able to return to work. Lori's Rob is terminal. How much more can she take first her mother then her Dad & you, now her boyfriend of three years? I hope she will find the strength to cope. 
Tracy & the Kids, especially little Christopher, bring me some pleasure. As do all my nieces and nephews. But Paul I just miss you so. I have to keep going I feel like a hamster in a wheel going round & round trying not to think about what could have been. Going & going but sometimes I tell stories about when you were growing up. Eric loves to hear them. Even Kristen will share and laugh. That is how we keep your memory alive in our hearts.
I love for forever like you for always, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be.
Much Love, Mom
PS Say Hi to the rest of the Family & let Jeannie know I'll try my best to help Lori.
Goodnight my son, my son.

You will always remain in our thoughts and prays.

Hi, Paul. I'm not sure if you remember me but we were neighbors on the 5th floor of CIW's Cayuga Hall. When I heard you left us on that day I wasn't sure what to feel. We never got to know each other, and so much of our memories are based on first impressions. Anyway, I wanted to write a little note on the 2nd anniversary of that horrible day. My advisor in graduate school wished me luck in my career, my studies, and my personal life.. and she said that the latter was by far the most important. I truly believe that now, and I remember you and your family on days when I feel so angry over the tiniest and most insignificant things. The truth is the life you led, though it ended too soon, was, I'm sure, full of happiness, joyous memories, and above all, love. I hope you are smiling down on us now and giving us a wallop whenever we focus on the most unimportant things... And that smile, I will never forget. First impressions are everything...

I was watching the 9/11 tribute today on TV and heard the name Paul Battaglia and I froze. For two years I was convinced that I was spared the experience of knowing anyone who was taken by this horrible event. A young child announced his name and I got the picture of his face in my mind. I looked at my husband and said, "I knew someone named Paul Battaglia in highschool. He went to Regis." Holland, my husband, told me there were tons of "Battaglia's" and that he was certain it wasn't him. 
I went on-line and the face that I had in my mind was the same one I saw on the computer screen. There was a link to Paul's website, which I clicked on. I began to read a blurb, which was directly under his picture. As I scrolled down, I saw the name Brian Lennon, a mutual friend of ours and I started to cry. 
It's been two years and I still can't believe this has happened. I work by the St. Francis Church and lit a candle for Paul. I can't say I could've called him a "close friend" but I definitely knew him well enough to say hi whenever I saw him outside Regis. I actually think he came to my house for the after party for Regis's production of Guys and Dolls. It's such a haunting feeling...I can't even write about it.... 
My thoughts are with his family on this day and every day to come.

What a remarkable man Paul must have been! I never knew him, yet through reading stories and memories people have shared, I can see why the world is a poorer place without him. I just gave birth to my first baby 6 months ago (a son) - only now can I truly fathom the terror of losing a child. To all who knew and loved Paul (and especially to his Mother & Aline): God bless you for being so strong and for having so much faith in him during the darkest hours. I pray that God continues to bring you peace and comfort in ways that only He can provide. 
Warmest Regards,

Paul's last web update was on my birthday, August 23, 2001. This is how I happened upon his website. I had also turned 22 years old and was facinated that someone my age was already working at the top of the world in The Towers. I was excited to follow his progress through his website. I found it inspirational. But even more inspirational is how this website has survived and enlightened thousands since then. Thank you for keeping it alive.

When I first came across Paul Battaglia's website, at the end of 2001, I could not stop crying while I read all of the entries in his guestbook. Now, 2 years after the horrible terrorist attack, I still feel sad from the inside out when I hear about that day; it is an sadness that will never go away from the hearts of Americans. Paul was only a few years older than me, (I am now 22) and know that his life was taken from this world much too soon. Although I never met him, I feel as though his presence in this world has touched my life from the day I read about him on the internet. I feel selfish that my life was allowed to continue after September 11th, 2001 and the lives of people like Paul were taken from us so cruelly. To Paul's dear friends and family who still mourn his loss on the 2nd anniverary, my thoughts and prayers are with you. Sincerely,

Dear Paul
It is Sept 10th at 9 pm and I just received a phone call from my cousin Bernie' Femminella 's daughter, who wanted to know what your relationship to her was. Her mom passed away this June . She works in a church and at lunch they prayed for her.. And she asked that they pray for you, her cousin also. Her mom Cathy, died of lung cancer and was confined to bed for the past year or so and prayed for you all the time. She used your prayer card as a marker in her books of prayer . Renee said she loved your smiley face. Cathy recently lost one son and another about 3yrs ago so if you meet a Danny or David Femminella up there tell them you are cousins.
My cousin Rosemary recently saw your name up on a remembrance wall in a park in sterling NJ. She gave me the info and I am going to pass it on to Grandma Annette... They might want to take a trip there to see it.
Aunt Tanny still says the rosary for your entire family everyday and I know that tomorrow will be a hard day for her as it will be for your Mom and John and Dad and Cathy. So many members of my family have all asked how Grandma Annette is and your Dad and Cathy these past few weeks, and I know that all of them will be praying not only for you but for all that was lost on that dreadful day.
Many, many prayers from all of us. 
Sincerely, your cousin

Dear Mr. and Mrs Leinung,
I just wanted you and all Paul's family and friends to know that you are especially in my thoughts and prayers these days. I know there are, and always will be, many, many aches and pains. It is a tribute to Paul, and to all the people who helped him to be who be the wonderful person he became in this life, that we all still feel such a loss. To those who were, and still are, closest to him, I want to thank you that he touched so many of us with his warmth and humor and gentleness and wit. I marvel that this young man who stopped in my office at Regis so often still is so much a part of my memory; he helped Regis to be what it was and still is for me. And that was ten years ago.
It is two years now since Paul was taken away from you and from all of us. I am sure we will always miss him. But that is a sign of what a great gift he was and is to us. It is hard to remember the loss. But I am so glad that we were given the gift of him. And I am especially grateful that you shared that gift with all of us.
With constant thoughts and prayers,

It has been a while since I have written but that does not mean I have not thought about Paul. I used to work at Marsh with Paul and Jessica.
He started working with me at 1166 as a summer intern. Harry was also my boss. I miss him too.
I just wanted to write and say that I often think about Paul. I miss his intelligence and priceless advice on computers. I need to buy a computer for my house and don't know what to buy. I keep saying to myself I wish Paul were here to help me know what I should get. Sounds kinda silly but I trusted Paul's computer knowledge - he always knew where to go to get things at the best price.
Although I enjoyed working with Paul at Marsh I sometimes wish he would have taken the other job instead of coming back to Marsh. I would rather him far away than not here at all. If I wrote all I want to say I would probably go on forever but sometimes it is so hard to sit down and write. It takes you back to a place and thoughts that are too painful to bear. I talked about Paul to some of my former Marsh colleagues and they visited his site. It made them cry, I'll admit I get teary eyed too when I read all the loving memories and tributes on his site.
Paul was one of the most incredible people I have ever met and I will never forget him.
Finally I want to say that even though you may not hear from people or his site may not be visited regularly - don't think for one minute that he is not in alot of our daily thoughts. Sometimes we just don't take the time to let you know.
I'm glad I did today.

Dear Paul,
It's me your mother. I feel like it has been so long since I last wrote you. So many things have happened. It has been so long since i last saw you that's for sure. In some ways it is harder now.
Now I know you will never be home for dinner. Never pick up the phone to say Hi!
People expect me to be better. I am of course moving forward but, over it or better is impossible. There will never be closure. Till the day I die I will mourn you my son. my son.
A life only just begun to be lived. I hate that i am expected to be strong for everyone.
i can't cry too much I don't want to worry Grandpa, frighten Eric or push Kristen & Dad away.
I am supposed to upbeat around others and refrain from making then uncomfortable about my loss and pain.
There are some who even feel I should say i have two children when asked so as not to make people feel sorry for me.
I am supposed to deny the life of my first born for the sake of some strangers delicate feelings.
Then the whole public memorial mess!!! They just don't get it it is ABOUT TERROrISM STUPID!! The fact that innocent American's were attacked at their place of business' on American soil in a Holy War we didn't even know we were fighting!! There must be only one Memorial. But, the cops and firemen's lives seem to count more than yours or Harry's or any other poor soul just going about their daily lives a freedom that was supposed to be gurranteed to all .
And Bush's half- assed War. Has accomplished absolutely nothing!!
I keep busy. I finally got to Italy with Grandpa . Aunt Karen & Joanne. Grandpa had a great time.
When I went to the vatican I pictured you visiting with your class in 1992. I remembered the statue of the Pieta you brought me home. Did you know in your heart then you'd leave me ? I stood before her & cried. The guide said Michaelango showed the Virgin as young mother because no matter the age of the child when a child dies before the mother the mother feels like she has lost her baby. A wise guide or wise sculptor. I have lost my baby , my first born, my son, my future a part of my body.
I miss you so. I am tired of behaving socially acceptably. You know it is not something i have ever really been good at. So I won't , I can't. I'm just too damned tired.
I had the surgery on the 22nd so now i am officially a crone. I have passed thru the three stages of woman. Maiden, Mother & now Crone. With that comes a new freedom to say and do whatever I please. Wear whatever i want ect.
Watch out world this crone is not taking any bull shit
Love you forever like you for always as long as I'm living my baby you'll be.
LOVE MOM

Dear Paul,
Another Holiday. Father's Day. We have trouble celebrating without you. Grandpa kept busy. He fixed our leaking pipe in the House in PA. Dad weeded the driveway & I planted some ground cover in the new garden. Grandpa made me a rustic fountain from that old red hand pump & an old wine barrel. He has to run a wire from the house & down a tree so it will work.
He just keeps going like the energizer bunny. John on the other hand has become more depressed. He misses you too. I miss what I had & what I thought was my future and yours. 
We went to "Uncle Karen's Steve"'s 50th Birthday Party yesterday. He had a casino night. Even the kids played. With fake money of course. Eric & Dad won the grand prize, Tickets for a Mets Vs Yankee game next weekend. I know you are around when these things happen. I'd like to think that.
Love you 4 always!
Mom

Hello,
I did not know Paul personally, but randomly fell upon this page over a year ago and this site has had a special meaning for me ever since. I'm from NYC and am about Paul's age. You are in my thoughts Paul. I will try to live my life for you. You seemed to have done so much in your life. Some people live a full lifetime, without having a fulfilling life. What I've read from your site, you did more than most, enjoyed your life, and felt so much love. Your family and friends should take so much comfort from that. It will almost be 2 years since that incident, and I will never forget. It sometimes baffles me how New Yorkers (and how I) have gone back to business as usual, preoccupied with such petty things. I know that this is a good thing to keep going. But we must never forget. I hope I can muster such a fulfilling life full of joy and happiness for myself that you had in yours. You are my inspiration to try. 
Sincerely,
A fellow New Yorker

The moment I saw Paul's face on the CNN tribute site, I had to learn more about this remarkable man. I'm so glad that I did. 
Paul Battaglia sounded like one of the most incredible men on earth. I will always regret not meeting him. 
Elaine, please know that reading about Paul's life has made me want to NEVER feel sorry for myself again. 
Paul was a true go-getter. He is an absolute inspiration to me. I will live forever never forgetting Paul and the rest of the innocents that died on 9/11. 
This is a crazy, crazy world. I feel scared sometimes that things will never, ever be the same again. I try to put myself in your shoes and how you still have so much 
positivity and hope for the future. It is remarkable. 
Paul's family, take care of yourself and pass Paul's light to the rest of the world. 
Paul, you are in heaven. This is a certainty. 
God Bless,

Dear Paul,
It's me your mother. That is the message i'd leave for you on your voice mail @ work or when you were away @ school. When you'd come back to the apartment Justin would say "call your mother she sounds upset!" I miss calling you with my computer problems, problems with Eric & sometimes Dad! I almost never had any complaints about Kristen. But, this college business is driving me crazy.
You remember how we fought that year before you went to Binghamton. You wanted a top private College. You didn't listen to me and spread your applications out a bit. You thought it was the end of the world when Columbia didn't accept you. You ended up @ Binghamton your "fall back " school & loved it ! But, before you went you complained about everything.
Well, Kristen is starting early. She has no idea what she wants to do with her life. Gave up on the pediatrician idea. I was disappointed but, I want her to do something she wants to do. She just doesn't know what she wants. She also has it in her head that she wants to go to school in another city preferably a BIG city - i.e. Boston, San Francisco, if she thought I'd agree to it.
I have told her to set her sights on a good STATE school. For the "quiet one" she is being the most stubborn ( its the Bertha Schlickman gene). Guess it will all work out I am in for a rocky road this year wish you were here.
Eric is remaining @ Adelphi for HS. His Confirmation was Sun 6/8 it was a tough day without you. My son, my son. How has this terrible thing happened? WHY should this have happened to anyone? It stinks!!
Love you forever, Like you for always as long as I'm living my baby you'll be.
Love & kisses, 
Mom


Brooklyn, NY - Wed Jun 11, 2003 8:34:45 PM

Dear Paul,
It has been a long time. It was hard to write man. Seems appropriate to do it now on Memorial Day. 
I didn't write sooner. It was a rough 1st year after being down at the Trade Center on the 11th. Ironically my military unit was activated and we landed in Afghanistan on the one year anniversary. 
We barely knew of each other at Binghamton before I left and went to Oswego. Sandra remembers you and your jokes. She laughed when she told me about them.
I want you to know a couple of things-we tried so hard at the World Trade Center to find you and the others. We just wanted to be superman and move all those giant steel beams but we couldn't. We honestly thought the little buckets were a tiny ripple of hope and out of that would come at least one person alive. We never gave up hope until that Sunday...and that was it. I didn't find out about you until I returned home. I know it bothers many today but we did the best we could. And we are sorry that this happened to you. All you did was go to work and live the American dream.
The second thing is that while we were there in Afghanistan vengeance was not our goal but justice. We want to make sure that what happened to you doesn't happen to anyone else or their parents, family, and loved ones. The year after September 11 I tried to figure out why this happened but it's not my job to figure it out. It was evil, pure evil. The only consolation is that there is judgement in the end on these things for we all die, but I think it's how we treat each other down here.
When in Afghanistan when I felt down at times I remembered you and the rest of the victims and you kept me going. Thank you Paul. Thank you for living life. Thank you for giving a face to remember. I spoke to your mother online recently. She is a very strong lady and her strength is in you Paul. You continue to make a difference today and you are not forgotten by myself and certainly those who knew you better than I. It was worth it to be away from my family overseas and loved ones to serve your family and the rest of the country. Please keep praying for us and see you someday up there man. God Bless your family and loved ones.
With Best Wishes,

DEAR PAUL
YOUR GREAT AUNT ANNA (tANNY TO SOME) JUST CELEBRATED HER 97TH BIRTHDAY...SHE IS OF SANE MIND AND ALERT FOR HER AGE BUT VERY FRAGILE... ALL SHE CAN DO IS PRAY AND THIS SHE DOES ALL DAY...(WHEN SHE ISN'T PLAYING SCRATCH BINGO). SINCE 9/11 SHE HAS SAID THE ROSARY EVERYDAY...NOT FOR YOU, BUT FOR YOUR MOTHER AND JOHN, AND YOUR FATHER AND CATHY AND YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTER. SHE IS IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH YOUR GRANDMOTHR ANNETTE AND LISTENS TO HER WHEN SHE TALKS ABOUT YOU.. SHE ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT HOW GRACIOUS YOU WERE TO HER ,AT GRANDMA ANNETTE'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY AND YOUR PRAYER CARD HAS A PLACE ON HER DRESSER MIRROR, SO SHE CAN SEE YOUR SMILING FACE EVERY MORNING WHEN SHE GETS UP. EVEN THOUGH SHE DIDN'T KNOW YOU VERY WELL, YOU WERE A PART OF HER FAMILY. REST IN PEACE AND LOOK DOWN ON ALL OF US AND TAKE CARE OF US

Dear Paul,
It is Mother's Day 2003. 20 months since that terrible day. It is my second Mother's Day without my first born. My heart aches from the loss. Dad & Grandpa & Kristen & Eric all made me breakfast. We had Belgian waffles complete with whipped cream and berries.
We wen tup to Binghamton on Friday for the Paul Battaglia Memorial classic softball game, a fundraiser by WHRW. The opposing team was Wild 104, a commercial station in the area. I'm sorry to say WHRW lost but I told the players & fans that they would have lost if you were playing. You were a great radio personality but a lousy softball player. The event was very well attended. We will be back in Binghamton next weekend for the SOM awards ceremony. A nice young man Justin Hoch is the recipient.We met him @ the game. He lost a 15 y/o brother a few years ago in a jet ski accident. So he was very sensitive to Eric. Eric threw out the game ball but he was very moody. Kristen wasn't able to attend. Grandpa was there He misses you very much. I keep forgetting to pick him underwear & socks. Not to mention his pants!! His wardrobe needs a complete overhaul. That was something you & he did together since you were 11 and my mother died. So many thing are different & we are still adjusting.
I am glad that such nice and brilliant person is getting a scholarship from Binghamton's Paul J Battaglia'00 Memorial Scholarship. Brian Napolitiano set up the Binghamton Scholarship. He worked very hard to get it it established and fully vested.
We are planning on taking him out to eat next weekend . We hope Aline will join us too. Unfortunately not @ the BIG BULL place. It has since closed. Anyway, it wouldn't have felt right eating there without you.
We are awarding the Paul J Battaglia Memorial Scholarship for a Regis graduate to Vincent De Magggio. I haven't met him yet but from the nominations, he seems alot like you.
Paul, all your friends have been wonderful establishing Awards in your name & memory but, I still would give anything to hear your voice and see you smile once more.
Love You forever like you for always as long as I'm living my Baby you'll be
P.S. Kristen now has a drivers license! I can't believe she is old enough to drive. I still see her pig-tails when I look at her.
LOVE
Your Mom Elaine

Though I never knew Paul, I feel a connection with him due to having the same name as him. I am also Paul J. Battaglia. I had the experience of friends and others being concerned about the loss of someone with my name. My heart goes out to the family and friends of Paul.I don't think I'm related to him but the truth is we are all related and we all lost something that day. Though I travel to Manhattan quite often.I no longer feel safe.But, Paul is safe now in Heaven.

Dear Paul,
I visited New York City for the first time this past weekend. At the WTC site, my girlfriend Kelley pointed your name out to me on the rememberance wall. We are probably not even closely related, but it did add new meaning to the 9/11 tragedy for me. Your website is great and I'm glad to see that it is still up. I too have a website where I post goofy things and pictures of my friends and family. I've often tried to obtain the battaglia.com, .org, or .net domain names for my own website. How ironic to learn now that you have it...oh well. God bless you and your family. It is unfortunate that we often learn about great people like yourself only after they are gone. But life is short, in your case too short, and I look forward to meeting you somewhere down the road...

Dear Paul, 
It's been 18 months since that horrible day that hatred took you away from us. And yet, somehow I feel that you are with us, watching over us, our own guardian angel. I know this must be true because Matthew is still in remission and has been off all medication since the end of last summer.  He will be receiving his Confirmation this May. Do you remember the promise you made to him 5 years ago at Michael's Confirmation? He asked if you would be his sponsor, too, when his time came, and you said yes. He chose your name, Paul, and wrote a beautiful report about St. Paul, and why he chose that name. Michael will be graduating in June and then he is off to college. He will be attending SUNY New Paltz, far enough away, but close enough too. Dad has been working a lot of overtime this winter, with all the snow we have been having. I'm still at home, with too much time on my hands. We miss you Paul, and love you always. 
Dad, Cathy, Mike, and Matt

Dear Paul 
I think of you every morning when I wake up and every night before I go to sleep. But,you have been on my mind constantly this week. Several things have reminded me of you. Your smell -- a student of mine (male) wears your cologne, and I saw a movie in which the mother and son recite the words from I love you forever etc. I also needed to talk to you, see your smile & get a big Hug.
This past week both the State and the National League of Nursing paid my school a site visit. 
We had low state board pass scores and a host of other problems. The school was on warning from the state and probation by the NLN. If we failed to convince the visitors we had changed and improved the program we would have to close. We prepared our defense in the form of a tedious 150 page self study and verbally. I had to defend my courses and I only just got to the school in the Fall! They questioned me over 30 min on Tuesday and again Wednesday! I was glad I had no idea of what I was in for prior to the visit! 
But, I kept thinking of how proud you were of me when I became an Adjunct @ Pace and how you got such a kick out of that pen inscribed "Professor Leinung." I really felt your presence those days giving me support. I also found two "heads up" pennies Tuesday morning. One right by my car and one in the bathroom!!! They were both so shiny!! I was thinking they were a message from you & Joey. My own "pennies from Heaven". I more than held my own during the interrogation. I really believe you sent them because the NLN team told us they were sent to close our program but couldn't do it after they met the faculty and the students!! I know I had to have had some divine intervention.
I wanted you there physically, to hug and celebrate with me. But, I'll have to content myself with the pennies. 
Love you forever like you for always as long as I'm living my baby you'll be. 
Love, MOM

Dear Paul,
I know as a Catholic I am supposed to accept your loss as God's will. But, even Jesus wept when he lost a loved one. Was it Lazarus? You would have known the answer. Even though I went to 12 years of Catholic school the Nun's were no match for the Jesuits in teaching theology and of course Math & Science but, I digress as usual I can't stick to a topic. Any way the Beatitudes say "Blessed are those who mourn". What in Hell does that mean anyway? I wish you were here so we could discuss it . To outsiders our discussion may have appeared like a fight. We certainly did go at it you & I. But, we always got over it just as quickly as the tempers flared.
I am teaching Nursing you would have been so proud of me. I really enjoy my students. Passing the Torch and all that. You'd get a kick out of it.
Kristen enjoyed her trip to England. She met some English boys. I'm glad as you would be they are on the other side of the Atlantic.
Eric failed Math. He is such a pill. He misses you so much. I miss you and I miss not being able to send Eric down to you so he could play some inappropriate and violent computer game which in his case served as an outlet for his aggression yours too I think.
Aline keeps in touch with Kristen I'm glad for that. Bye for now
love you etc.,
Your Mom

today is pauls birthday, and i did not know it until i read the guestbook. i am so sorry about your loss. he did not die in vain. i believe that he is looking down on all of you right now smiling. he is so lucky to have had a family like yours, and you were lucky to have a son like him. i always find it heart wrenching when i read about someone so young die, and not getting the chance to experience marriage, kids, and all of that. my prayers are with your family today. i didnt know anyone killed on september 11, and i cannot really sympathize with you about that, but i know what it is like to lose someone close to you. holidays and birthdays are the worst, and i hope that this one isnt as bad. i wish you all of the happiness and luck in all that you and your family do. the lord really blesses women with motherhood, and it makes one feel better knowing that they brought an angel into the world. God bless, and all the happyness in the world

Today would have been your 24th Birthday. Yesterday we went to the cemetery visited your headstone and left a spray of flowers. I know you wanted me to stop crying but, today I have been crying on and off. I still remember my first look at you and the first time I held you in my arms. I will love you forever,like you for always as long as I'm living my baby you'll be. You're in my heart and my thoughts.

Dear Paul, As I sit to write this it is 2 days after Christmas 2002. This is our second Christmas without you. It is not any easier this year. in fact, It seems harder. I can still see your smile. I miss your energy, your boundless enthuisam for the Holidays. Your cajoling me into baking just one more kind of cookie, just one more batch. And of course your personal batch of the Italian Flag cookies. You deserved them! I only wish you were here to enjoy them. I can't make them yet maybe someday I'll bake them in your memory but for now it is too painful. You were the spirit of Christmas for me and with you gone I'm just going through the motions.
Uncle Joe passed away on Dec 18th I hope you are all together. Joanne is taking it hard. We all miss him he was a good man and an great uncle. Eric was hit hard by his loss as well he loved when Uncle Joe would pick him up at school for me when he was sick or when I couldn't get him. He gets angry he feels (and it is true) that our family has had too many deaths in the past two years. I have no answers for him. I don't understand why either.
With the New Year will come your Birthday. We always celebrated your family Birthday on New Years Day. This was because when I was pregnant with you we were all at My Grandma Z's for New Years Eve. At 11 :55 PM my water broke, with all 23 family members there!! When I went to Methodist Hospital I was 4-5 cm dilated but all labor stopped I didn't want to give birth on a Holiday if you weren't going to be the first baby of the New Year. I went back to my Grandmother's and the next day Jan 1 after eating a big dinner I went into active labor and you were born Jan 2nd 1979. You were 6 wks early but you weighed in at 5lbs 10 oz you had a head full of dark hair, long eyelashes and long tapered fingers. You were the prettiest baby in the special care nursery. You were the best looking baby in the whole hospital!! Your Aunt Karen stood by the window and kept announcing that fact to anyone who walked by!
You were perfect with ten perfect fingers and ten perfect toes and the biggest wide open eyes. Even though you were early you were born with your eyes open and you looked around at everyone and everything. You hit the ground running ready to take it all in and the world on. Too soon your amazing energy and light was extinguished. I miss you and love you forever
Your Mother

Hi Paul, sorry it took so long for me to write..but things here haven't been so good. Wed Dec 18, 2002 my dad, your uncle passed away. I hope he is with you, Joey, Jeannie and Harry. In a few days it is going to be Christmas. I thought I wouldn't get through last Christmas but this one is going to be worst then last year...please Paul, you and Joey have to take care of Uncle Joe now. I wish I could still be doing it but it is out of my hands and in yours...tell him I love him and miss him the way I do you, Joey, Jeannie and Harry. Please make your Christmas a fun and happy one. Love and peace...

I have wanted to write to you for some time now. The events that occured on September 11 were by far the darkest time our country has ever had to face. Like others, I was drawn to the lists of missing, hoping beyond hope for the families that these people would be found. Each image, each name moved me and I prayed for the families. Then I came across Pauls name and photograph and my heart STOPPED. I saw my a man who could be part of my family. You see, my name is Debbie Battaglia Evans. I called my dad to ask if Paul was a relative and to the best of our knowledge he is not (although he cannot be 100% sure), and yet I felt a kinship to this man. If in name only, this horrible act has taken a member of my family. I hurt and then I thought of his family and how they must hurt. I have said many a prayer for you and thought of you often. I only hope that my prayers have brought you some peace. From what I have read, Paul lead a very active and fufilling life. Though that does not negate what a potential he was to the world, it does ease the pain some.
Anyway, like I said, I have wanted to write for some time and again offer prayers for peace and love. I very much believe that our loved ones are still a part of our lives and that their love lives on in us.
Sincerely,


Debbie Evans <evansdebbie@hotmail.com>

I keep reading his guestbook and see all the love and
respect people had for Paul. I was even visited e-bay
and looked up the feedback he received...it was all
good of course. My thoughts and prayers are with all
of his family and friends.

Dear Paul,
 Another Thanksgiving Day We still miss you. it is difficult having all 
your favorite foods and not getting to watch you eating them. Aline's SIL 
Heather gave birth last night to a baby boy Brendan Ryan 4lbs 12 oz. He 
was a little early but he is healthy . We have had new babies born since 9/
11/01 they are a special blessing but I wish I would have had a grandchild 
from you. I will never stop thinking of you and missing your smile and hugs.
 Kristen is going to London with her friend Juile this Christmas She is 
finding it too painful to put up the tree with all the old ornaments. Dad 
& Eric don't understand. They want to keep everything the same the 
Holidays will never be the "same" life always brings change but this 
change is neither natural or easy to accept. Paul I love you forever like 
you for always as long as I'm living your mother I'll be. Say Hi! to 
Grandma , Jeanne, Harry & Joseph, I hope you all have a nice Holiday in 
Heaven.
Love , Mom

Dear Paul,
Last night dad & I attended the Deo et Patrie dinner for those who have achieved the Order of the Owl. When the class fund raising chairs (from those years whose classmates contributed over a certain amt of money to Regis) stood I nearly broke down. One of your goals was to have your year make the Order of the Owl each & every year. I have no doubt that you would have achieved that goal had you lived. The fund raising chairman from the class of '25 stood!!! He probably contributed it all himself I don't think that class can have many living members. I wish you would have gotten the 80 year plan like that gentleman. You should have. You didn't drink, smoke, do drug or drive too fast . You were such a straight arrow kind of guy but, not in a wimpy way. Of course the evening ended with the singing of the Regis song. Again, I shed some tears. But, I went and stood up when they called your name all the while wishing You could have been there. I just want to scream you had so much to offer, I spoke with the families of the other two Regians who were killed. GregTrost class of '93 & Matt Leonard class of "80. Both special young men. I hope you guys saw us @ the dinner & joined your fellow Regians in the song.
All my love ,

Dear Mrs. Leinung,
Just a quick note to say that I very much appreciate Paul's website and the guestbook in which you and others have been able to share so much regarding Paul's too short life. You may recall that I taught at Regis(from 85-97) and taught Paul in his senior year. I left NYC in July 97 and returned to my childhood home in Washington state. For the past four years I have lived in Tacoma which is about 30 miles south of Seattle. On Wednesday I will return to teaching math (at a local community college). I recently visited NYC (Sep 7-17) and caught up with some old friends at Regis and Fordham U. I felt that I needed to be in NYC for the first 9/11 anniversary. Having lived in NYC for 13 years and having taught Paul and Greg (Trost), I was in shock around this time last year. It has taken some time for the sadness to be more deeply felt. I think my visit and this message to you will help me further that process.
I hope this message finds you and your loved ones in good health and with daily support from each other.
Thanks again.
peace, 
vince <vbander@juno.com>
P.S. I recently dropped in the mail a check for Paul's memorial fund which you should receive in the coming week.

To the Battaglia and Leinung families, 
So many times this past year I have gone into the website and cried. When I would tell my mom who would be Paul' great great aunt she would cry with me and say why did God take such a vibrant young man... why didn't he take me? I am an old lady (96)...I guess God needed Paul in heaven for a special reason and none of us will ever understand the whys.
I only know that 9/11 has left all of us very different and I hope and pray that the caring and concern we have for each other as human beings will remain with us and that 10 or 20 years down the line there will not be big 09/11 sales.. that we will and that our children will and that their children will always remember this day with reverence and that all offsprings from the Battaglia's and Leinungs will always keep Paul in their heart and remember him to be the wonderful son ,brother,grandson,nephew,co-worker and friend that he was. 
may God bless all of you . Annette and Paul, your Femminella family always have you and your family in their prayers.
All my love and prayers

My Dearest son,
My heart grieves your loss. I try to move forward but, i'm in such pain. 
Your friends and Aline planned a wonderful event ( an evening boat ride around Manhattan) to raise money in for the Paul J Battaglia Memorial Scholarship fund. They also wanted to get together and remember the happy times you guys shared.
I had such difficulty with the concept of planning a party for you, YOU 
should have been here you would have planned he best party and had the 
best time. I was of no help and alot of the work fell on Aline's shoulders. She and the guys did a remarkable job (despite the fact that dad was on 
the committe!) 
The guys all sang the Alma Mater last night. I cried to think your loud 
tuneless voice which could always be heard above everyones was missing. I 
couldn't help thinking of your annual Regis reunion weekends at the house 
in PA. 
The fund raiser was a big success despite my silly basket raffle. I could 
imagine you laughing at me for thinking of a gift basket raffle. Next Friday night Dad & I will attend the Deo et Patre dinner given by Regis. Your name and the names of the other Regians who were killed in the WTC will be inscribed on a plaque. I keep thinking how excited you were last year about attending the dinner with Aline or was that the order of the Owl dinner? Anyway Regis played such a big part in your life I remember when you graduated, you cried because you didn't want to leave Regis. Then you became the class fund raising chairman so you could be involved with Regis "forever." Forever for you was just 5 years after graduation. 
Goodnight Paul I will love you forever like you for always as long as I'm 
living my baby you'll be.
Love

Dear cousin Leinung - 
A year had passed. It's an awful anniversery. I watched the memorial ceremony on the TV. It makes me so sad, when I think what happened to Paul and the other people in the WTC. I feel close to you even I live on the other side of the atlantic. I periodical read in Paul's website. Perhaps it helps you a bit in your grieve that so many people think about Paul and remember what a nice person he was. I'm so sorry for your loss.
Love allways, your cousin Bettina from Germany

Option 7 at the NDB 800# was the quacking of their duck. It was sick humor, and Paul loved it. So did I.
It sounds Trivial, but when I hear that sound (quack-quack), I will think of paul, and smile. Few people can take a trinket of live and leave it for people to remember.
I am sure you have many, many such trinkets that will be a constant reminder. Try to smile and go on. Paul would want it that way.

Hey Paul - 
It was a year ago tomorrow night (9/13) that I found out you were among the 
missing. It's hard to believe that much time has passed ... I was watching 
CNN's broadcast of Congress singing God Bless America on the steps of the 
Capitol yesterday. With the timing of a great radio man, you're name 
scrolled across the bottom of the screen just as they hit the last note of 
the song. You couldn't have done it any better. 
I just started work at a radio station with studios in the city's municipal 
building on Centre St., five blocks from the WTC. I think about you often, 
but even moreso now that I get to walk right by you on my way to do radio. 
I hope you're doing well up there, man. When you get behind the big 
microphone in the sky, don't forget to take your transmitter readings - I'll 
bet frequency deviation can be a real bitch when you're broadcasting at 
infinity. 
your friend

Elaine, 
I just wanted to pass along my prayers and best wishes today to you and your family. Please know that not a day goes by that I don't think about Paul constantly; I still feel like he's a huge part of my life. Although I only really knew Paul well for a few months back in 1999, he's someone who I considered a true friend and someone who has helped make me who I am today. And I know I'm definitely not the only person who feels that way. 
He always spoke of you and his whole family so warmly; I must admit I was envious of the relationship you and he had. In fact, I was envious of a lot of things about Paul. I regret the way our friendship turned out in the past few years, but I think Paul always knew how much I cared for and admired him. 
I know today must have been tough for you, but please take some comfort in knowing that around the world, there are thousands of people thinking about Paul today -- smiling about something he said, telling a story about something he did, listening to a memorable radio show, or just looking at a picture (and yes, he's smiling in the picture). Paul died a hero, and his memory and legacy is something no one will ever be able to take from him. 
As always, if there's anything I can do to help you honor Paul's memory, just say the word. 
Wishing you nothing but peace, love, moe and Paul ...

Mrs. Leinung,
I just wanted to let you know I thought about you all day yesterday. I know we've only communicated once in an email, but something about your family has made me feel close to you.  I feel like I knew Paul. Perhaps it is his website and all of the similarities I think Paul and I have in common. I think of you often and include Paul and your family in my prayers every night. I am Paul's age maybe that is the connection. I have a two year old son, so as a mother the pain you are going through is unimaginable. 
Please be strong! A mother is the backbone of every family. And I can feel you are a strong person.  Take care of yourself, I truly believe Paul is watching from above and I believe he is still around you guys. It sounds crazy but I believe you never lose the people you are close to. I lost my bestfriend of 15 years 2 years ago. And the signs and dreams I have seen and had are Phenomenal. If someone would have asked me 5 years ago If I believed in that I would have thought they were crazy, but not anymore. I believe that is God's way of letting us know that our loved ones are ok. It's strange, but I tell Amy (my bestfriend) to watch out for Paul. And I swear to you I feel both of their presence. I bet Amy and Paul are having a deep discussion right now about Politics or Wall Street.! I hope so. I know you don't know me, but I am here for you if you ever need anything. I hope it did not offend you for me to write or cause you any more pain. That's the last thing I wanted to do. For some reason as I stated before, I feel a connection with Paul and you guys. Feel free to write me back if you need to. Take care of yourself and your family. 
Love always,
Jocelyn Boddie <ckz8q@Allstate.com>

Paul,

It has only taken me a year and a day to finally post something on your site. 
 Every time I start to think about the way you were tragically taken from 
this world I become filled with anger and pain. I wish we had gotten the 
chance to meet up again as young men and spend time hanging out like we did 
when we were in St. Mark's. I still remember the trip I took with your 
family to Pennsylvania for a weekend. Man did we have fun that weekend. I 
also remember you coming to my house for my birthday and you and my family 
going out to dinner and then you spending the night at my house for a little 
birthday celebration. I also remember being at your house on East 19th 
Street as kid just hanging out inside or riding our bikes outside. I will 
never forget the time we had just finished riding bikes we went to the yard 
to put our bikes away and you went into the garage and came out with car wax 
and you said I have a great idea lets wax our bicycles it will make them 
shine like a nice new car. I wish there was a way to go back to those days 
when we were young and didn't have the responsibility of getting up everyday 
and working 9 to 5. Instead now everyday I get on the Q train at Sheepshead 
Bay Road, occasionally running into John, and as I ride over the Manhattan 
Bridge the first thing that pops into my thoughts is you. I begin to think 
why couldn't Paul have overslept that morning and been late for work then you 
would still be here with us and we would have been able to become 
reacquainted. 
Just recently I was cleaning up some old things I had in my closet and I was 
getting rid of most of it when I came across a bunch of papers together and 
when I pulled it out the papers said Autographs '89. We had been in St. 
Mark's at the time and when I looked at the autograph that was on top it 
read: Dear John, Have a terrible summer, hope you fail everything. Hope you 
know I am just kidding. From, Paul. That day I burst out first into laughter 
and then into tears thinking that Paul had some sense of humor. 
Paul I regret that we never met up again. Until we meet again. Paul I 
always thought of you as my second brother. You are always in my thoughts 
and will remain there forever.
Your Eternal Friend,
John Passantino <Passantj@aol.com>

I want to give my deepest sympathies to all of Paul's family, friends and loved ones. To say I knew Paul was not very accurate. Rather, I knew of him as a fellow Binghamton University student. I do remember meeting him once in WHRW where I was an apprentence for one of the Heritage DJ's during my junior year in the Fall of 1999. Whenever I saw Paul either around the station or around campus he was always smiling and that is one thing about Paul that myself and many other people will never forget.
I have known about Paul's passing since my big sister who was a friend of Paul's told me but sadly, I never said anything on this webpage celebrating the life of a person who was always smiling and kind. I do want to say that eventhough I have not said anything since now, I have been praying for Paul and all his loved ones in this past year. I can say that only meeting Paul once was enough for me to remember him forever, so much so that I have a Mercy Band with his name on it.
With all of this said I want to wish the very best to Paul's family and 
friends. I know that he is still wish us smiling like always.
Yours,
Marianne Stephan <MsAngelfish79@aol.com>

Paul, I signed your guestbook last October and I'm still thinking of you...a man I never knew but wish I had. You and your family are in my thoughts every day. People will ask me if I knew anybody that died that day...one year ago today...and I will tell them no. Then I will tell them about you and your website. I believe people will be honored to "know" a man like yourself so I mention this site when I get a chance. Your site has given me a chance to get to know you and that makes me feel good inside and makes me a better person. 
Always,

I don't know what to write....
I am an employee of a company in San Diego, CA that commemorated the 9/11 
Anniversary. Our building holds over 2,000 employees, and the idea was to 
assign each employee a name of a victim of the September attacks - to 
realize the multitude of the event. As we entered our place of business, we 
were given a red, white, & blue sticker with the name and age of a victim to 
wear throughout the day. I received Paul's name.
I felt compelled to find out who he was, and I located this website. I just 
wanted to let his family and friends know that Paul is touching people, even 
a year after his death.
Thank you, and God bless.

Dear Paul,
As I sit here now, one year to the date of your tragic death, I can finally bring myself to write something. I did not know you well personally, but many of my close friends were good friends of yours. I heard only great things about you and I can only wish that I had known you better. When I found out that you worked in the towers, I continously kept in contact with Mary, Dava and Meaghan to see if anyone had heard about your whereabouts. Day after day the news was the same. This morning I sat by the TV and waited for your name to be called during a memorial service at Ground Zero. It was my way of paying respect to you and your family. I hope this site brings comfort to those close to you and I want you and your family and friends to know that I think of you often.

 Dear paul. Today is 9/11/02. It is one year since you and Harry and 2800 others were senselessly murdered by evil and hatred of Americans and our way of life. 
Everything has changed in our family's life but, not enough has changed in the world. The killing goes on.
I am sad every day that you are not with us. You had such energy and love for life I can't believe it has been taken from us. We have all suffered from your loss. Kristen is doing better. She has begun to smile again. Eric is still angry. He has started in Adelphi, I hope it will be good for him. Grandpa still keeps fit by biking but I wish he would stop he got hit by a door from a parked car and fell on his bike. Dad does his slipper and Yankee T shirt shuffle and I eat and yell and boss every one around. I have started teach @ LICHSON, please put in a good word with the "BIG GUY." We have an accredation site visit in Feb. I really need to keep this job!
 Yesterday, as the anniversary was approaching I began to have panic attacks again. I was all wound up I believe you knew and tried to diffuse the situation with humor like you did when you were here. First, the kitchen light turned on by it self when no one was in there the the TV kept switching to CBS channel 2 I kept putting my movie on and putting the remote back down in a few minutes CBS appeared this happen three times yesterday and it happened to Eric twice today. I couldn't help smiling thru my tears. I have to believe it was you playing tricks on us. Oh my son, my son what can I say? I will love you forever, like you for always, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be.
Love for ever & ever until we meet again,

G'day Paul.
Well mate, a year has past and I still can't believe what has happened. I had a fantastic time around Europe with you and I often reflect on the good times shared. I remember your laughter and I recall you were always there to applaud friends. We had a tour theme song that reminded me of our great trip. Everytime I hear that song now, I think of you mate. (You Get what you give - New Radicals). The title of the song seemed quite appropriate when on tour, but now when I think of it, I feel you gave so much more, and didn't deserve what happened. 
My thoughts were with you yesterday & with your family.
Thinking of you always,

Kristen,
I would have written to you sooner but to tell you the truth i didnt 
know what to say.When the attack first happened i didnt know that Paul had worked at the wtc, it wasnt until i came home from school a few days later and heard your moms message on the answering machine.I broke down and cried for hours.I only had two sisters and since you were my best friend he was almost like my brother too.I was in NY this summer and i wanted to visit but things were hard for me to and i didnt want to face the reality of goig to your house and him not being there. I remember the summer trips upstate with you and your family, those were the best.Remeber the time we were playing hid and go seek at your aunts house in penn and we ended up hiding behind the car from a bear.Well any way if you want to talk just give me a 
call. I'll definately come to visit you when i come to NY next.

One year already. I can't beleive it. Around 9 am, on sept.11 2001, I was afraid. I thought(without admitting it though) that it might be the end of the world. THE big war, THE END. 
But as the day unfolded, my kids came back from school and we were watching all of it on tv. But for all of them, all 2081 people who were in-around the WTC, the Pentagon or on flight 93, it had been the end. I cried. And this morning, after being silent for a minute at 8:46, tears were back again. 
No, I didn't know Paul. I just happened to read a short story about him, and checked out his web site. Since then, I kind of feel like I knew him. I didn't know any of those people who lost their lives last sept.11. But this morning, watching the ceremony held at Ground Zero, I thought of Paul. As I did when I visited Ground Zero in July. 
God bless you Paul, and all of those who love you

I finished watching the names read at the World Trade Center tribute and for some reason had an enormous desire to do a google search on your name. Paul's website came up. I'm sorry for Elaine and your loss, Paul sounds like a wonderful boy. It's been a long time since Michigan City, but I guess when you know someone the connection never really ends.

I can't believe a year has passed since 9-11. On the one hand it feels like it just happened, on the other, things that happened just before 9-11 seem to have happend years ago. I am comforted by the knowledge that we will see you again. I believe with all my heart that in spite of the horrible hate that some people harbor, God's love will overcome it all. He is in charge. Keep up the faith. We WILL get through this

It's been one year. Even though we were just acquaintances, you have been in my heart and thoughts everyday. The memories I have of you always out a smile on my face, from the first day I encountered you (a DA girl meeting a Regian in a driver's education class at Regis) to our college days where I met up with you again at WHRW. You are greatly loved and missed. In my prayers always-

I can't believe it's taken me a year to the day to write something here. I find myself here again for the same reason as last year - to find some sort of comfort. I've been visiting Paul's site regularly since day 1 and I contemplate adding my thoughts each time. I always decide that I can't possibly express how I feel in writing and abandon the thought. 
I work down at the World Financial Center and every day I think about Paul when I step out of the subway. I look up into the sky at where the WTC used to stand and just picture Paul sitting, smiling (as always) at his desk. Even a year later, it's hard to really believe what happened and imagine that it's all gone now. I wasn't one his closest friends, but I'm happy and thankful that I had the opportunity to know him. 
To all of Paul's family and friends, my thoughts and prayers are with you. I hope this site will stay up for a long time to come, so that people from all over can come here, get an idea of what an amazing person Paul was and continue to share their thoughts. I certainly will never forget.

When it happened, I couldn't stop watching CNN; I hoped one of the news stories, one of the awful images they kept showing would make me understand or believe it. But CNN's coverage just seemed like something out of Independence Day - too big, too awful to be real. 
But today, one year later, I stumble upon this sight; a friend of friend of Paul's just gave it to me. I have only stopped crying because I am dehydrated. I went to Binghamton and never met Paul, but his life puts a face on the tragedy for me. From what I can tell, it's a smart, loving, beautiful and kind face. When I read the guestbook, I am at the heart of all of it, and I am so deeply sorry that those who love him have to live without him, and I am amazed that his life has brought out the same beautiful parts of humanity from every person who reads it. He must have been wonderful to know.

Paul,
Today I am thinking of you, your friends, your loved ones, and your family. A year is a long time, although 2002 seems very, very, short. Just wanted to let you know that I have sent family, friends, and others to this site in hopes that the postings by your family, friends, and others will help them realize and appreciate every thing, every day, and every gift that they have....like the way I understand you did. I know the postings have helped me in that way.

My deepest regrets for not having the chance to know you well in this world...perhaps in the next, and my deepest sympathies to those who did.

I started coming to Paul's site after reading about him last November in New York Times "Portraits of Grief". After reading Paul's portrait, I was immediately drawn to him. I think that the sentence in the portrait where Paul's mother discussed how Paul was balancing a checkbook at age four and how he was like an adult trapped inside a child's bottom. The reason that I was so intrigued was because my mom always tells me that as a child, I was "A 40 year old trapped in a 4 year old's body". It seems that Paul used the word "hence" a lot on his website, which is a word that I say frequently but for most people, that word is absent from their daily vocabulary. After reading everything on Paul's current and old site, I realized what a great man he was; smart, funny, caring among other things. I have tried numerous times since last year to post but every time, I go to write something, I find myself at a loss of words. I just wanted to let Paul's family and friends that I keep you and Paul in my prayers as well as all affected by that horrific event which somehow or another changed us all. September 11th changed me for the better; it made me realize the value and importance of everything that I have from friends to my car. It also helped me see the aesthetic beauty in all things especially those in nature. I would like to say that this post is therapeutic for me on all different levels. I think that by coming to Paul's site, people learn about him and therefore, a part
of Paul lives in each of his readers, most of which never had the chance to meet him.
God Bless,

Hey Paul, I didn't know you but I feel your family's pain.
I live in Israel, and as everyone know, it's not the safest place nowdays.. 4 people I knew personally were murdered in terror attacks in the past 2 years, and I've been 5 minutes close to be blown up myself; once I was in the other side of the street from a suicide terrorist when he bombed himself killing 13 Israelis.
I have no words in my mouth.. I read all your guestbook, from the oldest posts to the the latest of your mom, and I just started crying.
I feel your pain. Be strong!

What a difference a year makes.
As we approach another September 11th, I'm sure everyone cannot help but reflect about what has happened to us, our country and the world that day. For me, this past year involved a lot of reflection on how I interact with people and how I express myself. Because whenever I thought about what happened that day, I thought of Paul - one of the most happy, nicest General Managers I ever worked with at WHRW.
People who have asked me for my reflections on what happened that day I would tell them about Paul and give them his website. I would share what memories I had of him: what a nice guy he was, what a big smile he had, how dedicated and full of life he was. Then I would always start to get a bit misty-eyed because what happened to Paul should never have happened at all, not to someone as nice as Paul - not to ANYONE in this world.
If it's this hard for me, I can only imagine how hard it has been for those who knew him closely, loved him dearly and were privileged enough to become a close friend of his. Paul's physical presence may no longer be with us, but it's nice to know that his spirit lives on with everyone he came in contact with. I know that it does in me - I always try to go through my day smiling, just as Paul would have done. On the anniversary of September 11th, I will proudly wear my blue and khaki...just for him.
Peace, Love, Moe...and Paul.

To Paul's family:
For a year now, I've visited the website every few
weeks to see what other wonderful things people could
say about Paul. I went to Binghamton, too, and though
I didn't know Paul personally, I remember seeing him
around campus all the time and heard lots about him
from my friends involved at WHRW. 
As this awful anniversary approaches, I keep thinking
of you and wishing there was a way to lighten the load
of your grief. Perhaps the only way I can help is to
tell you that I would if I could. Maybe it helps to
know that thousands of people across the world think
of Paul every day, think of you every day, and grieve
a little bit with you.
You are in my prayers. God bless you,

Paul... You didnt know it but once again after over ten years we were neighbors again. It's Mike remember we were each other's first friends. We grew up together on E 19ST right next door to each other. We lost touch when my grandparents moved. I tried a few times to get in touch but never a 150% effort me and your always known for. But what we both didnt know was how close we were to each other. You see buddy i'm on the New York City Fire Dept and work in downtown Manhattan. Your building was my responsiblity until eight that morning when i got off. I was back there as soon as i heard 
what happen i was standing there on West ST. I didnt know that my childhood friend-better yet my best friend was 100 stories away. I worked over 24 hours that day and when i came out of the dust i heard your name. I dont get it man I'm the dangerous one I take that extra step or dance with the devil. I wish we would have met up again had some drinks and some laughs.. but hey i'll have one for you..See you buddy

Dear Paul,
Well, I am finally working full time at Lehman. I remember sitting in that
pizza joint 3 years ago listening you explain to me why I should go into
Investment Banking. I had no idea what you were talking about, but you
convinced me that I would make more money on Wall Street than in Medicine. It seems like last week... the image is still so vivid in my mind, though in reality so much has changed since then. 
It still seems unreal that you are gone. I live near the WTC site now,
though it is difficult for me to recognize the reality of what has occurred
there. Francis and I talk about you and experiences that we shared with you as if you are still here with us. You know, you won him over to the
financial world that day in the pizza place as well. You would be proud.
I miss you every day.
Love,

Dear Mrs. Leinung,
My name is Thomas Herrera and I live in Dallas, Texas. I came to Paul's
website after reading his story on the New York Newsday website and their
Remembering the Lost section. The first thing I noticed about him was his
smile in all those photos on his website. He was, I am certain, a wonderful
person and a great friend. Of course, I don't have to tell you that. I
know he was someone I would like to have called friend. I graduated from
the University of Texas in May 2001. My graduation trip in June 2001 took
me to New York City for about 10 days. I had so much fun. While there, I
was able to visit the World Trade Center. Who knew at the time, that the
memories of that visit would become a part of my life forever in a way
unimaginable.
It goes without saying that on September 11th, I was horrified at the
destruction. Immediately, my thoughts went to the victims and their
families. I was so moved emotionally by all the people holding flyers with
pictures of their missing loved ones. I still cry when I think about it
all. Looking at Paul's picture, makes me wonder if maybe, just maybe we
might have said hello to each other just by chance on the day of my visit.
To be sure, I think about all the people I saw on that day of my visit to
the WTC, how many survived and how many perished. I know that of all the
individuals working at the Windows on the World restaurant, no one survived.
I remember some of their faces. All the victims at the WTC, including Paul,
were just going about their daily lives, professionals and kitchen staff at
the Windows restaurant alike. It's just not fair. From what I read, Paul
was the type of friend I would like to have had. You have my deepest
condolences. I am so sorry for your loss.
I am contemplating going to New York on Sept 11th, 2002, as a way for me to
pay my respects to all those lost, including Paul. I hope it's OK for me as
a non-New Yorker to go. Once again, let me say how sorry I am Ms. Leinung,
for your loss. I know you do not know me, but believe me when I tell you
that we, the people of Dallas, Texas, extend our sympathies to all New
Yorkers. We will never forget. God bless you and your family.

Dear Paul,
It is Sunday 8/11/02 11 months since that fateful day you left for work 
and never returned. These months have gone by in a haze of pain and sorrow.
Last night was Lisa Fama's wedding. She made a beautiful bride. Though 
we had to leave the reception before she danced with her dad and Joe with 
his mom, I didn't want my grief to ruin their day. I have learned that 
happy times must be celebrated. You never know what is around the corner. 
When you were young Ann & I joked that you two would get married and have 
beautiful,bright but very tempermental children. Of course, Lisa met Joe & 
you met Aline. I hoped to dance at your wedding and hold my first born 
grandchild by my oldest son. I looked forward to the circle of life , 
unbroken into the next generation. We were cheated you & I. I miss you everyday I long to hold you to talk to you to hear you call me 
Elaine when I annoyed you. You were my precious first born.
Paul, there were things about your life I did not tell you. Prehaps, you 
had the right to know. I'm sure you know now. I hope that you realize how 
much I wanted you and was determined to give you life. I still feel that I 
failed you. As a Mom I should have been able to protect you. I guess all 
the Mom's who lost children feel that they should have done something more.
I love you for always, like you forever, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be.
Love and Kisses,
MOM

Paul,
I haven't been to your site in a while, my kids are always on the computor. Still, I think of you every day. I have pictures of you all over my house. You as a three year old in my apartment, you in the funny glasses with the nose and mustache, and of course the picture I took of all the grandchildren to give grandma for mother's day. I'll never forget that chaotic day. My dog was barking wildly as everyone came into the house. Kids were screaming, mothers yelling SMILE or you're gonna GET IT....and you in the center of it all. I laugh when I look at that photo. It all looks so peaceful. When it came time to pick the photo I would enlarge for grandma I narrowed it down to two....one in which you looked good, but my kids didn't, and one where they looked good, but you had a weird expresion on your face. I had to pick the one which showed your smiling face....after all you had endured, how could I not? I am sure I will see you again, in a much better place, but for now I miss you and can't believe you are gone. I still can't 
believe it.

Hello,
I had recently bought the Portraits 9/11 and when I saw that Paul had a web site, I went to his site and I enjoyed looking at his pictures of his travels and all the work he had done in creating his site. It is so personal and means so much to everyone. It is a treasure and so very special.

I read your entry in the guestbook on America United Website and I wanted to let you know that I will never forget. I too lost someone very special, my nephew, my brother's only son. I miss him dearly, his birthday is in two weeks and the pain is still so strong. I as long as I have breath in me I will make sure that he will be remembered. I will never know your pain as a mother loosing a child. I have no words that could comfort you. Only know that you are not alone, he is with you. 
God Bless you and try to stay strong.

I worked "The Rocket" briefly during an internship that Paul had at Marsh Risk Finance in, what was it?, 1998? What an enthusiastic, energetic, and brilliant guy! We lost so many colleagues on that awful day, but Paul was such a bright, fiery light, who seemed to experience utter joy in everything he did. It's a great tribute that a young man can touch so many people in such a short life.

Dear Paul,
On Sunday the Board of Directors of the PJB Scholarship Fund took the first recipient, Ryan Huber & his parents to dinner @ Lundy's. It was difficult for me. The young man was very nice and the general consensus from the Regis '96 crowd was that he has your type of humor and personality.
Aline has just returned from her Contiki trip to Spain & Portugal. Dave also went they even got him to get up & dance. She & Kristen & her friend Meghan went to the beach today. Aline has been great to the kids. Grandpa loves her and wishes things had worked out differently. You & she made a great team. I love you forever, like you for always as long as I'm living my baby you'll be.
Love,
Mom

Hello--
I know you do not know me... I was browsing the internet, and came across your words about the loss of your son (posted on a 9/11 tribute site).
I just wanted to send my condolences, and let you know, that even now, 9 1/2 months later, people all across America are still praying for you, and families like yours.
I'm 27 years old, and reside in Dallas, Texas. I am fortunate to not have known anyone directly affected by the horror on that day. I do, however, ache for your sadness, and wish you didn't have to say goodbye. I pray that you find the strength you and your family needs to continue to rebuild your lives, and mend your broken hearts. Know that many people all over the country (and world) hold you in their hearts, and you do not weep alone. We weep with you.
Many blessings,

Dear Mrs. Leinung,
I am a total stranger, but wanted to write to let you know your family is in 
my thoughts and prayers. Last night I purchased the book "Portraits of 
Grief" from the New York Times, and that is how I found out about your son's 
web-site. From looking at the pictures and things posted on the site, I can 
see that Paul not only loved life, but his family as well. May your memories 
always bring you peace.
Sincerely,

To Paul's family,
I live in Canada and I am reading the Portraits 9/11/01 book right now. 
I started reading the letter "B" yesterday and came across Paul's story today. The fact that there is a web site caught my attention, so I opened the computer and came to check out the pictures.Tears didn't stop flowing since.
He seemed so proud of his office, of the view he had... And to know he died in his office makes me think that he really left for heaven from a place he was proud of: his own office on the 100th floor of the World trade Center...
 I definitly didn't know Paul, but I am proud of him, of what he managed to accomplish at such a young age...
May God be with you Paul.

Dear Paul,
I can't believe it has been 9 months since the attacks that killed you, Harry and 2,800 other innocent souls.
We are all still devastated by your loss. On Tuesday 6/11 Dad & I went to Washington with others surviving family members to request an independent bi-partisan commission to look into the collapse of the Twin Towers. Since 9/11 many families have become politically aware and more active. I have just been able to hold myself together and try to help Kristen, Eric , Grandpa & Dad aka Step John. But, I am planning to get more involved in the hopes that this will not happen to other families. Oh, Paul I hate having to be strong. I just want to hold you. I'm also gaining weight again I know you would be annoyed and try to get me up and moving! I'm a couch potato these days. I will write again after we meet the first recipient of your Scholarship.
All my love,
Mom

I really do not know what to write to you, I have been lost for words these many months. I keep wondering what was the last thing I said to Paul all the many years ago. I really can not have a day go bye, and not think about your son. I am sorry that I did not write you two sooner, but as you may know writing a letter like this is not easy. I will not be able to put into words of how much my heart goes out to your whole family, and for what they have been going threw. I can only say that I carry Paul in my thoughts from day to day with me. Andy Finiasz and I talk from time to time; I try to keep up to date with how he is doing these days. I really do not know what else to write, this alone is very hard to do. I will end this e-mail with the only thing that I know to be. This being that Paul was a great guy, and he will live on in many of our memories for ever. My love and prayers go out to both of you and the rest of your family.
With my Wishes

Hi- Just by chance I came to Paul's web site. What a wonderful person he must have been. I looked through his picture gallery and saw that he enjoyed life so much. He was young enough to be my grandson (I'm 69 years old). I'm sure he is in Heaven preparing, and rearranging, it for all his family and friends. I'll remember him in my prayers.
God Bless. Dick Battaglia

First, of all, I would like to express my sincerest and deepest sympathies
to Paul's Family and friends. They have been with you since September, but
until now I have not been able to put them into words. I knew your wonderful
son, brother, and friend for only a short time while I attended Binghamton.
He was in several of my business and finance courses, and although we were
never close, were always cordial to one another. Paul was one of the
brightest students I encountered at Binghamton, and I always admired (and
perhaps envied a little) his ambition and drive. He was always so full of
animation, and his smile lit up even the darkest of rooms, but then again,
if you knew him, I'm not telling you anything you don't already know...He
was a beautiful kind hearted soul, and I pray that his family and friends
are comforted by the fact that he was so well loved and regarded by so many.

I first visited Paul's site shortly after reading about him on the NY
Times. I was drawn to his huge, contagious smile and his age, since I am 22
as well. I read through most of the entries and couldn't help but cry, even
though I had never met him. I wanted to write, but never knew what to say.
I keep finding myself back at his page and still don't know what to
say...but I'll try. I, obviously, can't even begin to imagine the the
feelings that all of his friends and family are living with every day - of
anger, sadness, grief and everything else that goes along with losing such
an amazing person...it's obvious he was that....so many things to so many
people in this world. Yes, it has been months since 9/11 and yes, it gets
easier every day, but I know that it never completely goes away and I'm so
sorry for all of you for that. 
It's strange the way I never met him, yet still felt drawn to him. We were
at similar points in our lives - recently graduated, working new, exciting
jobs, planning trips with the loves of our lives, still living with our
parents and loving them and respecting them but itching for some
independence...just to name a few things. And with all that in mind, I just
can't imagine being whisked away so suddenly with no chance to say goodbye.
I was drawn to Aline as well, not knowing her, but just feeling drawn to
her - I can't comprehend the grief she must feel over the loss of what she
thought was her future. I am not excluding Paul's family, because I know
it's just as difficult and even more difficult is many ways...it's a
different kind of love that involves history and family. But I can relate
to Aline...I can see and feel everyone's pain on all its levels - from his
family to his friendships and beyond. From the bottom of my heart, I want
to tell you all that I'm sorry. Sorry just doesn't seem to cut it, but it's
all that I can say. I only hope that someday, I will be as remembered and
as cherished as Paul certainly was, is and always will be.

I have visited Paul's site many times in the past and I was particularly drawn to it today especially after reading the article in the NY Times. Once again I have been brought to tears by you and your family's pain. I was saddened that your children have had to encounter unfeeling teachers who have forgotten the tremendous loss your children have experienced. It is too bad that the teacher did not have the sensitivity to accept Kristen's love for her brother and not insist that she list Paul as her half brother on the family tree. I know some teachers may find it difficult to deal with children's pain but they must acknowledge their lack of experience or lack of comfort dealing with their student's grief. The Board of Ed needs to help these teachers recognize that everyone handles loss differently --especially children. What these teachers say will impact upon their students forever and ultimately help these children toward healing. I do realize as a pediatric nurse practitioner I have had more experience and I am perhaps more sensitive to other's needs but I feel we must never forget what happened to all of you. I will never forget that day and what I saw when I was in ground zero. I will never forget my friends and patients who have lost loved ones on Sept. 11th. I will always grieve your loss and pray for all who have been affected.

I'm currently watching Bates Battaglia help the Carolina Hurricanes as they are minutes away from dispatching the Montreal Canadiens to move on to the Stanley Cup semi-finals. He's scored in four straight games in this series. If Carolina wins their next series, they will go to the Stanley Cup, and if Battaglia stays on his hot streak, we could see a Battaglia score the winning Stanley Cup goal.

Dear Paul,
It's me your Mother. As this my first Mother's Day without you is rapidly approaching I'm remembering all those cards you made me when you were small. As you got older you never failed to pick out just the right card that fit what was going on that year! You were " the spirit of Christmas, & the Easter Bunny " to quote and old song by the immortal Sinatra as well as Cupid, the fun behind Halloween (Kristen's friends still talk about your "Haunted House " in our playhouse in the yard). Hoilday's will never be the same again. Paul we are all going forward as you would have wanted but, we all miss you. I'm trying to find a way to carry your spirit in my heart and try to be calm knowing I'll always have mu memories. Eric is still very angry and struggling to find his way. Kristen seems to be doing better in school but, she will always miss her adored big brother, 
We have picked the student from Regis who will be the first recipent of the Annual Paul J Battaglia Schorlaship. The committee (B.J, Dave, Tom, Justin, Brian, Vinny & Aline) all want to meet the young man and give him the check in person. Of course I'll go too but it will be one of the hardest things I've ever done. But, we wanted to do something to honor you spirit and enthusiam for life and Regis. I will love you forever, like you for always as long as I'm living my baby you;ll be. 
You remain forever in my heart ! 
Love, Mommy

I have been thinking about signing this guest book for months. Its taken so 
long for me to decide what I wanted to write about Paul. The two things that 
keep coming back to me are trips to Pizzarina, and the video on fire 
prevention my father helped him to make. Most of the time we spent together 
was when we were only kids. But I have many fond memories of Paul and he will 
always be in my heart.

Dear Paul,

This is third time I am writing in your guestbook. I hope you don't mind, I am 
normally a pretty quiet guy, but I wanted to remind you that I still think about 
you and care very much, especially as I pass the WTC site. Wasn't the light 
display beautiful? 

I still have two of the books you sold to me prior to my sophomore year in h.s. 
by the way (I know I mentioned this in my last post), one is a book of American 
poems and the other is a chemistry workbook. They were both pretty useful and 
worthwhile (apparently, for them to have remained well past high school).

You know what else particularly saddens me, I was due to see you again toward the 
end of September, at the Regis Order of the Owl dinner for alumni, and it was 
scheduled to be at Windows on the World, of all places. My last memory of you is 
sometime around your h.s. graduation, wishing you the best of luck before your 
sojourn to Binghamton. It looks to me like you made as much of a lasting 
impression there as you did at Regis.

Well I am going to leave it here for now, Paul; there's probably a lot more to 
discuss - please know for now that your fans, even the lesser known of us, 
certainly have not forgotten you and your family and appreciate the example you 
set forth in life.

I just found the legacy.com site...which led me to Paul's site. I did not
know him but as many have said I feel closer to him now. I just hope he
realized how many friends he had & how much his friends & family loved
him..it is so obvious to a complete stranger..somehow I feel he knew. There
was nothing I could do for anyone there but send prayers & my 6 year old son
included all involved in his prayers for the longest time. Nothing anyone
could say will help but once again...my thoughts are with you...your love
for your son & his friends have moved me to tears more than once. I will
check back with this site again. My thoughts & prayers are with you all.

I just wanted to write and express my sympathies for Paul's family and friends. I visit this site every so often and after reading through it I feel like I knew him, even though I did not have the honor of actually knowing him. What a wonderful, intelligent, sweet, caring young man. What a charismatic personality to make friends wherever he went. The world is a better place having had him in it. I am so so sorry for your loss. God bless.

To The Battaglia Family: 

I have never meet Paul, or anyone of you, but I would like to offer my heartfelt sympathies, prayers and words of sincerity to you all. 

I read about Paul on Legacy.com and felt compelled to go up on Paul's website. 

This man was highly intelligent, funny and from all of the photos, truly loved life. From all of the moving tributes, I know that my instincts are not wrong when I say how deeply he was loved and he will truly be remembered, not just by his family and friends, but by myself. 

I will keep Paul and all of you in my thoughts and prayers. 

I know he was an inspiration to many who were lucky to have them in their life. 

What a great smile he had...I will not forget him. 

God Bless You All. 

May Paul rest in peace forever, in God's loving arms. 

With heartfelt sympathy,

Paul - I miss you buddy. I keep wanting to write every time I am on this
site but end up cancelling because I simply cant carry on. September 11 is
still so fresh in many minds and its still so difficult to let go. I still
feel the same way I did back then...that you're standing right behind me and
if I look hard enough, I'll see you. If I close my eyes, I will see you
there. I am not ready to accept you are gone. Physically...yes, but
spiritually I think you'll always be here for the people who love you so
deeply. This site is a testimonial to how many lives you have touched. So
many people from around the country have stumbled on your website only to
find themselves crying with tears of pain and sorrow. So many people wish
they would've met you, been friends with you, shared an experience with you.
I know it sounds cliched, but I am proud to have had a friend like you. I
would never be able to tell you this in person (wouldnt want to add to that
ego of yours), but you changed me for the better. You had that balance in
life that you kept things in perspective. Paul - I will always miss
you....but I will also know that you are always here....

overwhelmed by all the tributes to you. You truly were a great mate!
We still think about you heaps and talk about the geat times we had on
tour.

What possible words of comfort can I give to all who are devastated by Paul's death? I am barely functioning myself. What can we do but go through the motions and pretend to be living again. I have to believe that the pain will subside somewhat, and the memory of Paul will one day bring a smile rather than a tear. I know we will see him again. At least there is comfort in that. Still, I miss him so much. I just want his families (Paul, Cathy, Matt Michael, Elaine John Kristen and Eric) to know they are in my prayers daily.

Hi Paul. I miss you very much. I haven't posted since right after September 11th, but I come to the sight often to read what everyone else is writing. I guess I had a belated reaction to everything because I wasn't able to really talk to anyone for a few months and the smallest things would make me cry. So many tiny things remind me of you. Silly things you would laugh at. There's a commercial for Next Day Blinds, I see it almost every morning, and the guy in it makes that funny face you always made, with your eyes wide open and eyebrows arched and your mouth as an O. And all of this political and economic stuff has happened as a result of September 11th and I really want to talk to you about it and have you explain Enron to me and all kinds of things. It's very hard to be living away from New York. People in DC care much more about the political impact and forget that people lost loved ones and are grieving, and they don't talk about it as much in general. Everyone talks about the war, but the war and your death are so disconnected in my head. I am still not really processing everything.

I happened to be in New York for work on the six-month anniversary and I went to Ground Zero. At first I was fine, it just looked like a construction sight. Then I saw the list of names and I lost it. I had a picture of the two of us with me. We're in the kitchen at Orton, it was the night we all threw the wine and cheese party. I left the picture there.

To Aline and the Leinungs and Grandpa Jerry and everyone else, I am so sorry I don't call more. I feel so selfish. But I just can't yet. I think about you all the time. I will be home in a few weeks and am planning to go to the cemetery. I hope that will give me some closure. And maybe I'll be able to talk to all of you then.

Love you and miss you Paul,
Al

Dear Elaine,
I am Kristen Smith's mother, Kathy, and I came upon Paul's website last 
weekend. I read all the posts and they broke my heart. What a wonderful 
young man he was. I just want you to know that I think of you and your 
family every day. You are always in my thoughts and prayers. I think you 
have a wonderful daughter and I know she has always been a good friend to my 
Kristen. I always enjoyed having her over during the year when the girls made 
their confirmation. She is so sweet and always a pleasure. I call the girls 
"Kristen squared". They are happy to share the same name with the same exact 
spelling. I can't imagine how painful the 6 month anniversary was for you 
all. I watched TV in the morning and cried all day. I lost two children when 
they were infants and I know how devastating that was. I can't imagine the 
pain of losing a child that you have raised to adulthood. I used to wake up 
in the morning and wonder how the sun could be shining and the birds singing. 
 My neighbor lost her 22 year old son who worked at Cantor Fitzgerald. 
Everytime I open my blinds in the morning I see their house and remember them 
and your family in my prayers. I hope it helps just a little to know that we 
are always thinking of you.

Months ago I read about Paul in an article and wrote down his website. I stayed up all night reading everything on it. Tears were rolling down my face. I couldn't stop. Since then I have visited the site periodically. Each time there would be a new posting and each time my heart ached. Unfortunatley I never met Paul. I wish I had. We lived thousands of miles apart yet he touched my life. I didn't know anyone that perished that horrible day but through the last months I have come to have this feeling as if I knew Paul and he was my friend. I am sure if we had met we would have come to be friends. Last night while I watched the "special" on that black Tuesday all the same feelings came flooding back. The only exception was that this time it hurt more. I had these images of Paul in that building and feeling scared for him. I cried myself to sleep thinking of everything that happened that day and thinking of Paul. To his family, I am so sorry for your loss. I can not begin to say that I understand how you feel because I don't. Please know that even though he is gone he is still touching lives just like he did when he was here. You family is forever in my thoughts and prayers and I will never forget...

It is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.


Hi there:
The Battaglia name must be very rare - there are apparently only two
different Battaglias in the Calgary phone book, and there are almost 900,000
people in Calgary. If that frequency could be extended to all of Canada and
the USA, that would be only about 600 Battaglia's in our two countries.

Thus, I couldn't help but catch the name of another Battaglia on the sports
last night - there is a Bates Battaglia playing for the Carolina Hurricanes
of the NHL (he scored a goal against the Calgary Flames yesterday). I hope
this doesn't seem disrespectful; I just thought that I'd point it out.

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Leinung,
I just wanted to let you now that I have been remembering Paul and you and his 
whole family in my masses and prayers every day, and especially yesterday, 11 
March. I still miss him a great deal, as do so many whose lives he touched, 
sometimes only for a few minutes. That is a great testament to the young man 
you sent to Regis and Binghamton and the world. Thank you for your gift of 
Paul to us, and know that we are still with you. 
Sincerely in Christ,
Jim Van Dyke, S.J.

  The planters stood around us, full twenty score or more;
  They ranked us up like horses and sold us out of hand,
  They chained us up to pull the plough, upon Van Diemen's Land.

I only knew Paul a sort time at Regis and not on a personal basis. However,
I still remember waling through the tunnel every day and walking through the
quad to the locker room. I could always guarantee seeing Paul in there and
seeing his smile or hearing him making a joke from across the room. no
matter how bad I felt that day his jokes always had a way of perking up
anyone's day even if they were ridiculous. He always had a way of
brightening everyone's day and no matter who he met and who he saw he always
said hello and he always had something positive to say. Six months later I
can finally come to terms with the pain and tragedy I felt that day, but the
greatest pain I felt was knowing that one of my fellow alumni was lost. We
may not have been the greatest of friends, but we were both Regians and we
shared a great bond. Paul's death may have killed me that day, but his laugh
and his jokes keep me going every day of my life, and as long as he is in my
heart, along with all of the others we lost, my life will keep going, and my
purpose will continue to be for others. Paul truly was a man for others and
he will never be forgotten. Thank you Paul for three years of laughs, and
thank you for an eternity of strength to go on. As long as I remember your
laugh I will always be happy.

Dear Paul,
This was an especially trying weekend leading up to 3/11, the 6 month anniversary. The Media of course made it more gruesome to insure good ratings. I was between the rock and the hard place. I don't want what happened to be forgotten. I don't want to feel that you and Harry died in vain. But, it feels like you just can't escape the horror. Paul, my biggest concern is that you did not suffer. I hope you and Harry were together. We all miss you so much. Aline watched the CBS film on 9/11 last night -- she was very upset. Dad and I and Eric stayed home today. Just couldn't get much done. Couldn't face the Memorial services. The temporary Tribute in Lights with two blue beams looks better than I thought it would. Still, its a sad reminder of what was and could have been. I don't know when I'll ever feel normal again. I think of that day in September when the Plane hit and how I now longer felt you. You see, I always felt your presence, even when you were away at school. But at that moment I felt the connection sever. Later that day I thought I saw you up ahead on the street. I called your name -- you were dressed in your Khakis and a blue Polo and had your bag across you body. You gave me your biggest smile and disappeared. I knew then I'd never see you again. At least not in this life. I had a similar experience when my little Grandmother died. I also saw her. I know it sounds crazy, but then I think you had to say good-bye to me. You were that kind of son; you'd never let me worry. But Paul, I miss you so much. Kristen, Eric , Dad and Grandpa are all still trying to come to grips with this. Why us, why you? My son, my son I hope to see you again in a better place. Until then I'll carry my love for you in my heart everyday. 
Love you forever, like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be. 
All our love
Mom, Dad Grandpa Kristen & Eric.

Although I never knew Paul, just reading about him and looking at his websight makes me realize what a good person he truly was. As a mother of a young boy I hope I never have to experience the heartbreak and the pain that Pauls family and friends have had to endure. My heart and my prayers go out to all of them....May you find the strength to go forward and keep Pauls memory alive forever........

Good morning Paul. Today makes 6 months of what happened on that terrible day in Sept. We miss you and Harry very much.. The city is holding a memorial service at the site but Mom is not going she stayed home from work today...I saw her sat with Lori and Cheryl. Eric is staying home from school today it will be better for him not to go. Kristen is going because that is the way she wants it, you know Kristen... Paul I can not put into words how we are still feeling this will be with us for the rest of our lives. And I'm so sorry you and Harry had such a short time here with us. I wish thing could be different. I wish it could be the same but in my heart I know it will never be the same. I pray for you, Harry, Joey and Jeannie every night. I wish I could say more but right now I am to full with sorrow. Love and peace. Love cousin Joanne.

I had only briefly heard of Paul before September 11th. One of my
closest friends, Charlotte Diffendale, is a dj at WHRW at SUNY
Binghamton, and so I had heard a lot about the people who made WHRW what
it was. On the evening of September 11th, she gave me the links for
Paul's site as well as Pipe Dream Online. I remember reading Venti's
first post from about 10am that morning, and staying up nearly all night
talking with Charlotte about the attacks, about Paul, about how
uncomfortably close to New York City everything seemed to be. I
remember that I had a more reliable internet connection than she had,
and so I was going through all of the survivor lists I could find to see
if I could find Paul's name on them. I never met him, but that didn't
really matter. I kept hoping, and hoping that I'd find Paul's name in
there. I checked Pipe Dream Online religiously, several times a day,
hoping that there would be news of Paul being found, being okay. I
still check it a lot, just because. I've been reading the guestbook a
lot, and was horrified when I saw what hackers had done. Paul was a
beautiful person and his memory should be honored with the respect it
deserves. Anyway, I just wanted to say that I never knew Paul, and I
only know a couple people who knew him directly but I wanted to pay my
respects to his family and his friends. He was a wonderful person to
have touched so many lives. I wish I had gotten the chance to have had
the honor to meet him.

Dear Elaine,  
I wrote you a while ago to extend my prayers for you and your family. I lived next door to Paul during my senior year in Cayuga at Binghamton University. Today, being the six month anniversary of the loss of your son and me almost also dying I feel compelled to write to you. I was in tower Two of the WTC when the plane hit tower One. And I was on the 44th floor when the plane hit the tower I was in. 
I hope that through these past six months you have been able to hold close all the good memories of your son. I remember living in 5W right next door to him and hearing the sound of his laughter and their tv turned up really loud. I also remember his great smile. 
If you have questions that you are searching for an answer for I might have them since I was in the WTC that day. Please do not hesitate to contact me. 
My heartfelt wishes go out to you and your entire family. Take care of yourself and each other. 
Sincerely,
Laurie Downey, Binghamton Alumni 1/99.

  I write to you with heartfelt -- but probably very inadequate -- words of condolence for the loss of you son, Paul. We don't know each other, but I write as a fellow parent, a New Yorker and a Regis grad (almost 30 years before Paul). 
  Surely the death of a child is the worst burden that parents can be asked to bear (children are meant to carry on for their parents). Yet the loss of someone with so much promise, who has already touched so many people, is especially tragic. You won't believe it now, but time does provide some healing (I lost a brother and my best friend too many years before either of them should have died). But they died "of natural causes", your son died simply because of demented, evil people. If not now, I pray that you someday will take comfort from the knowledge that you raised a wonderful kid. Providing that realization is the very least that God can do for you. 
  I didn't know your son, but I've come across his name several times: he was remembered at a mass at St Ignatius a few days after the attacks (Regis held the Mass with Convent of the Sacred Heart, where my daughter is a freshman) and Regis has remembered him in an alumni mailing and on its website. Our neighbor, Dwight Darcy (father of Kieran, also Regis '96) was killed at the WTC, and I prayed for your son at his memorial mass. Through a series of coincidences, I was fortunate to find, read and enjoy your son's website this morning. He surely was a young man of talent and character, someone who loved life and shared his talents and joy with literally hundreds of friends. I alternately laughed and cried as I followed his European trip (my wife and 2 children had visited Italy this summer, and my wife and I commented more than a few times how much sheer joy the �college grads' seemed to have!). 
  I was heartened to see the Regis hotlink! I went to Regis almost 30 years before Paul. In those days, we regularly sang the alma mater (and we still do at the annual Deo et Patriae dinner, which this year would have been at the Windows of the World on 9/28). You may know it, but it may not be a popular thing anymore. The first stanza begins "May ours be the noble heart, strong to endure" and ends "May our be the hero's part, ready to do, we are your sons, fair Regis, our spirit comes from you". Everything I've read about Paul says that he had a noble heart and that he was not only "ready to do" great things, but had already done so. He would want you to be "strong to endure" the pain inflicted on you. 
  I have never written to a complete stranger (or even a "letter to the editor"). Hundreds, if not thousands, have already told you that Paul was a treasure. What can I possibly add??? Just the thoughts and prayers of another parent. God bless you and ease your pain!

I have been reading Paul's website every day for nearly the past six months. I always want to write something but I never know what to say. I grew up with Paul; our moms are very close friends. I can remember spending many days with our moms and sisters during our St. Mark's years. Paul & I used to hang out while I babysat Kristen and Eric, and I never understood why Elaine had to pay me to keep an eye on them if Paul was home. Maybe he charged more per hour, who knows. I always thought of Paul as a genius and I knew that he would be successful in whatever he did. I referred to him as "Alex P. Keaton." The last time I saw Paul was probably over two years ago on the Q train. We had not seen each other in a while and he called my name and gave me a great big smile. He told me all about what was his internship at the time, which just further convinced me that he would do something great with his life. I feel bad that we lost touch as we got older, although I always knew what was going on in his life through my mom or when I would talk to Elaine. I had the pleasure of meeting his beautiful girlfriend at Kristen's Sweet 16; I know that she is someone very special.  
To Elaine and John, I just want to let you know how proud you should be to have raised such a wonderful man. Reading this website, I see what an AMAZING person he turned into. I truly admire you for your courage and strength. Not a single day goes by that I do not think of Paul. The two of you, your dad, Kristen, Eric and Aline are in my prayers every night.

Dear Mr. John Leinung:
 Our family would like to express our sympathy to you and your family 
members because of your recent loss of your son, Paul. 
There aren't any words that can remove the pain that is felt when we lose 
a loved one in death, but for many,the words recorded in the Holy Scriptures 
have proven to be a source of real comfort. Regarding those who are in 
Almighty God's memory Daniel 12:2 says "And there will be many of those 
asleep in the ground of dust who will wake up, to indefinitely lasting life." 
Just as you and your family remember the qualities of Paul so does Almighty 
God. Almighty God also has not forgotten the cruel, violent actions of others 
that has resulted in untold suffering for many and he has promised (Ps. 
37:29,34, Rev. 21:4,5) to bring an end to all forms of violence.
 Sincerely,

Mrs. Anna Kinred <deanna@catskill.net>

Dear Elaine and John,
I just discovered this amazing and moving website today while browsing other sites. Elaine, you may remember we went to Bishop's together (and the senior prom!); Joyce and I remained in touch all these years.
Although I met Paul only once when he was about three at Joyce's - and I was impressed by him! He ran around the backyard so exuberant and friendly and bright-eyed! - I was grieved when Joyce emailed the news, and now doubly so after reading the testimonies to what an extraordinary person he was. It appears that he grew into adulthood remaining true to his essense, free to grab life by the tail, attracting the best of people by his magnanimous spirit. It seems he achieved in his shortened life what many people never achieve in a lifetime. You must be very proud. 
I want to tell you, through this site and through Paul's personal website, Paul - and the tragedy of 9/11 - has become more real to me, and now I now feel a bit more that I've also lost a personal friend or nephew. I wish I'd had the honor to meet him as an adult. I just want you to know my heart aches for you and your family.
Peace to you,

I just wanted to say I feel some of the loss because my name happens to be Paul J. Battaglia and immediately after September 11th, I had people running up to me and hugging me saying"Thank God you're alive". They must have seen the name on a list and thought it was me. I did lose a few friends that day including an old classmate of mine. I just wanted to pay my respects and I'm deeply sorry!

Hi Paul,
These past few days have been very stressful. Twice I came to your site to write and twice I couldn't due to the same type of hate, fear , envy and ignorance that took you from those who loved you . Some hacker, a misguided kid I hope, keeps wrecking the site. Aline also came on and saw the first desecration she like I, cried. I miss you so much the pain is physical, like phantom limb pain. My grief group tells me that this is how most mothers experience grief, like a part of their bodies have been cut away.
Kristen looked like a Princess at her Sweet 16. It was so hard for me I almost expected to see your smiling face at any moment. Then Monday was five months that I have not seen or spoken to you, I miss your voice, your 30 second phone calls , your smile, I miss you! My son, my son , how I wish I'd see you soon. That all of this was just a bad dream. Today is Valentines Day. You were always so good o me on this day! I loved the cards and candy. But, Valentines Day is primarily for young lovers. Aline was having a bad week also. She wanted to avoid this day! Then to make her more depressed two of her friends from Nursing school were badly injured in a car accident. They will live both face many months of rehab. You know how close Nurses become with their classmates ans teachers. You always joked about how it wasn't really school because everyone was so 'touchy feely' calling each other by first names and celebrating birthdays, pregnancy announcements etc. Anyway, our prayers are with them and their families. Aline visited Grandpa for his birthday she baked him Irish soda bread, her baking skills are improving! The bread was delicious. She gave him two books, I guess she knows how he loves to read. I'm back at work part time. Caring for my patients is good but, the mornings are tough especially on the days I would have taken the train with you. I was so proud to be seen with you. I loved to look at you, I loved your hair, the smell of your favorite after shave Polo. Some days I wear it from the last bottle you touched. It makes me feel close to you. I am so tired, so easily fatigued. It is a struggle. I go on for you and for Dad, Grandpa, Kristen and Eric someday I hope I'll go on for me. I love you for always, like you forever as long as I'm living my baby you'll be. All my love MOM

I never knew your birthday was on January 2nd. A belated happy birthday to you. I am working on taking my clearance test for WRPI (the campus radio station here at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) and should be cleared this summer. I've also spoken to the general manager there about doing a 24-hour radiothon to raise money for WRPI like you did for WHRW. While I can't ever hope to duplicate the successes you had there, I am going to give it my best shot.

The date of the radiothon? February 3, 2003. Four years to the day that you did the one at Binghamton. 

I forgot to mention, you share the same birthday with another very special person.....my mother.

Paul -- it was exactly three years ago today that we hosted the 24-hour radiothon on WHRW. We were so proud to be a part of it -- we did so much that day; parade around campus, WHRW Night at the Gym, riding along with ULED, invading the Lecture Hall, cooking at the Dining Halls, screaming from the top of the library tower, decorating the sun dial like it was a Christmas tree, and -- of course -- selling out the Campus Pub for the last time ever. We know how proud you were of that. We got together with Gregger for lunch today to celebrate the three-year anniversary, and we saved a seat for you. We like to think that the Radiothon was when we bridged the gap between "guys who saw each other at the radio station every so often" to "friends." Hell, if you can spend 24 hours with a person and still want to see them again after, that's friendship. On the way back from Binghamton, we made sure to listen to "Off the Books," and we know that somewhere in heaven you were singing along. We all miss you very much, Paul. Happy anniversary.

This is a test posting. I'm afraid I'm nowhere near the Webmaster Paul was. We hope to have everything back to normal soon. Thank-you to all who have posted these past few months -- your thoughts have been a great comfort to Paul's mother, sister, brother, and me. -- Peace.
