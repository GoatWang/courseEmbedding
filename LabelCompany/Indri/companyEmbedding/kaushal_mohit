		            	Paul Klingenstein	            	

		        		Managing Partner		        	


Paul Klingenstein founded Aberdare in 1999.
His recent focus has been on technologies which drive transformational efficiencies in care, leading Aberdare commitments in areas such as personalized medicine (Clovis Oncology) and biosensor systems and data analytics (mc10, RxAnte).  Earlier at Aberdare, he helped establish the firm as a leading healthcare venture investor through commitments to more traditional technologies such as drug discovery and development (Pharmion, Ironwood, Anacor) and highly engineered interventional devices (Nevro, Ablation Frontiers).
Prior to founding Aberdare, Paul was an advisor to the Rockefeller Foundation, where he helped launch an early public private partnership (IAVI), directed at finding a broadly effective vaccine for HIV.
At Accel Partners (1986 – 1997) he led a highly successful healthcare effort. He invested in and served on the board of Aviron, Isis Pharmaceuticals, Viagene, Neurex, Glycomed, US Behavioral Health, Amerigroup, Xomed Surgical Products, and others.
After working as a field biologist and Outward Bound instructor in Africa, he began his investment career at Warburg Pincus in New York. In the early 1980s, he had the opportunity to be a participant in an earlier wave of systemic transformation, through his involvement in first generation biotechnology (Synergen, Vestar) and managed care (U.S. Healthcare).
Paul serves on the board of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Campaign Legal Center.  He is a former Board Chair of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and of Juma Ventures, and a former Trustee of the Taft School and of the Marin Country Day School.
He is a rancher, fisherman, and backcountry pilot, and received his AB in anthropology from Harvard and his MBA from Stanford.

HTML preprocessors can make writing HTML more powerful or convenient. For instance, Markdown is designed to be easier to write and read for text documents and you could write a loop in Pug.

Add Class(es) to <html>






Adding Classes



In CodePen, whatever you write in the HTML editor is what goes within the <body> tags in a basic HTML5 template. So you don't have access to higher-up elements like the <html> tag. If you want to add classes there, that can effect the whole document, this is the place to do it.

About the <head>



In CodePen, whatever you write in the HTML editor is what goes within the <body> tags in a basic HTML5 template. If you need things in the <head> of the document, put that code here.

    CSS Base
  





About CSS Base



It's a common practice to apply CSS to a page that styles elements such that they are consistent across all browsers. We offer two of the most popular choices: normalize.css and a reset. Or, choose Neither and nothing will be applied.

    Vendor Prefixing
  





About Vendor Prefixing



To get the best cross-browser support, it is a common practice to apply vendor prefixes to CSS properties and values that require them to work. For instance -webkit- or -moz-.
We offer two popular choices: Autoprefixer (which processes your CSS server-side) and -prefix-free (which applies prefixes via a script, client-side).

    Add External CSS
  
These stylesheets will be added in this order and before the code you write in the CSS editor. You can also add another Pen here, and it will pull the CSS from it. Try typing "font" or "ribbon" below.





About External Resources



You can apply CSS to your Pen from any stylesheet on the web. Just put a URL to it here and we'll apply it, in the order you have them, before the CSS in the Pen itself.
If the stylesheet you link to has the file extension of a preprocessor, we'll attempt to process it before applying.
You can also link to another Pen here, and we'll pull the CSS from that Pen and include it. If it's using a matching preprocessor, we'll combine the code before preprocessing, so you can use the linked Pen as a true dependency.
