(CHEK) APBK Capital Special situations, portfolio strategy, macro, commoditiesSummaryCheck-Cap's technology could revolutionize a large segment of the medical diagnostics industry.The diagnostic technology is well poised for quick adoption by doctors, patients, and insurers.Check-Cap expects quick regulatory approval and commercialization.Overview
Check-Cap LTD (NASDAQ:CHEK) is an early clinical-stage medical diagnostic products company based in Israel. The company is currently developing a single product used in the diagnosis of colon and rectal (colorectal) cancer. Their product is capsule and imaging-system, which can be swallowed, and does not require lengthy fasts or cleansed. The capsule then allows X-rays to image the colon. This method is an alternative to the colonoscopy, a more invasive diagnostic technology. Check-Cap's upside potential is enormous. The company offers a key-solution to a major medical shortcoming for patient and doctors, it deeply under-prices its substitute making insurance coverage easily justifiable, and has a promising outlook for regulatory approval.
Changing Medicine
Colorectal cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer, and is the second leading cause of death due to cancer in the US. A leading driver in the mortality rate is the timing of detection.

One of the reasons patients avoid screening and detection for colorectal cancer is the invasiveness and displeasure associated with screening. The current and most commonly used method of screening is the colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy. The Check-Cap imaging system is very different. It is an ingestible pill-shaped capsule that uses X-ray technology to image the digestive system.

The X-ray imaging and data could potentially even be converted to 3D renderings of the colon providing doctors a very easy and accurate alternative. As a result, this method could easily create better adoption rates of screening amongst patients. Being the more pleasant alternative should propel patient and doctor adoption of the technology.
Insurability
According to costhelper.com, the average cost of a colonoscopy before insurance coverage is just over $3,000, and a patient's responsibility is determined by type of insurance coverage. That simply means someone is paying $3,000 for the colonoscopy. The cost is in large part due to the time it takes to prep the patient, the nursing care, the lab work, and the doctor's time to complete. Now imagine the capsule - beyond purchasing the technology and the cost associated with reading the results does all that work without the requirement of hands-on time and prep work. If the technology is mass-produced it can easily under-price the colonoscopy by thousands of dollars.
Even if the technology is not as accurate as the colonoscopy, insurance companies will not have a problem covering it due to the cost savings. Not to mention the increased potential to prevent even more costly late-stage Colorectal Cancer treatments. If the technology is as accurate or more than the colonoscopy insurance companies will prefer this treatment, which could eventually phase out colonoscopies for the majority of diagnostic cases. In any event, there should be no limitations to adoption given the fact that insurance coverage will be easy to obtain.
Approval and Clinical Studies
Check-Cap has already completed a clinical proof-of-concept study that focused on the safety and feasibility of the imaging system. The study focused on 10-cases and produced very promising results allowing the company to move forward. The company has now moved on to 60-subject study which will more extensively access feasibility and set the ground work for clinical approval in both Europe and the United States. Additionally, the company has already been moving forward with pre-submission meeting with the US FDA. Given the current timing the company expects to launch their product commercially to Europe in 2016, and to the US in 2017.

Summary
Based on the current offering per share price range of $6-$8, Check-Cap is looking to sell 2 million shares. This would result in just under 10 million shares outstanding, and at $7 average a market value of $70 million dollars. This is a very bargain price for a technology that could potentially revolutionize the colonoscopy industry and significantly improve colorectal cancer detection. However, investors should be aware of the risks investing in a company at the very early stages of clinical testing. The method has not been proven to meet all of the regulatory guidelines and therefore may never make it to market. For investors looking for a gamble or a great company to keep an eye on they should consider adding Check-Cap to their watch-list or portfolio.

The first non-invasive, prep-free imaging test for colon cancer 
Early detection can save lives. Everyone over 50 should be regularly screened for colon cancer - and with Check-Cap, there's now a non-invasive way to do it. Patients just swallow the capsule and continue their daily routine. The capsule will travel through the colon and be excreted naturally, all while transmitting relevant data to an external device (CPS) attached to the patient's back. Check-Cap is not only patient friendly; it's also designed to detect clinically significant polyps with a high degree of sensitivity.
Check-Cap's ultra low dose X-ray Radar device is being designed to create reconstructed 2D and 3D images of the colon. No prior bowel cleansing is needed because its x-rays create 360-degree angular scans that can "see through" intestinal content. Exposure to radiation is minimal and equivalent to a regular chest x-ray. The capsule transmits data to a receiving device attached to the patient's back, where it is stored for a physician's analysis. If nothing is detected, no colonoscopy is necessary. If the 3D images reveal polyps, a therapeutic colonoscopy will be prescribed as needed.

Check-Cap. Patient-friendly. Accurate. Life-Saving. 
 Patient-friendly
      No preparation, invasive procedures or sedation are required. The patient swallows the Check-Cap capsule and continues his or her daily routine while the capsule travels through the colon. Small amounts of standard contrast agent are taken with meals.
















Please note: the Check-Cap system is not available for sale or for any clinical use.

ISFIYA, Israel and BOSTON, May 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Check-Cap Ltd. (the "Company" or "Check-Cap") (NASDAQ:   CHEK, CHEKW), a clinical stage medical diagnostics company engaged in the development of an ingestible capsule for preparation-free, colorectal cancer screening, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with a single health-care focused institutional investor for the purchase of 1,349,500 ordinary shares, at a purchase price of $2.00 per share. Concurrently, in a private placement, the Company will issue one-year warrants to purchase up to 1,349,500 of its ordinary shares, at an exercise price of $2.125 per share, that are immediately exercisable. The Company will receive approximately $2.69 million gross proceeds at the closing of the offering and approximately $5.57 million total gross proceeds in the event that the warrants are exercised in full in cash.  The offering is expected to close on or before June 2, 2017, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. 


Rodman & Renshaw, a unit of H.C. Wainwright & Co., is acting as the exclusive placement agent for this offering.
The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to advance the ongoing clinical development of its C-Scan® system, and for general corporate purposes.
The ordinary shares are being offered pursuant to a shelf registration statement (File No. 333-211065), which was declared effective by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on July 11, 2016.  A prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus relating to the offering will be filed with the SEC and will be available on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Copies of the prospectus supplement, when filed with the SEC, and accompanying prospectus relating to this offering may also be obtained from H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, by emailing placements@hcwco.com or by calling 646-975-6996.
The warrants and the ordinary shares underlying the warrants are being offered and sold in a private placement and have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or applicable state securities laws, and accordingly may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such applicable state securities laws.
This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any of the securities described herein, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
About Check-Cap 
Check-Cap is a clinical-stage medical diagnostics company developing C-Scan®, the first capsule-based system for preparation-free colorectal cancer screening.
Utilizing innovative ultra-low dose X-ray and wireless communication technologies, the capsule generates information on the contours of the inside of the colon as it passes naturally.  This information is used to create a 3D map of the colon, which allows physicians to look for polyps and other abnormalities. Designed to improve the patient experience and increase the willingness of individuals to participate in recommended colorectal cancer screening, C-Scan® removes many frequently-cited barriers, such as laxative bowel preparation, invasiveness and sedation. The C-Scan® system is currently not cleared for marketing in any jurisdiction.

X-ray Radar Technology 
Check-Cap's imaging capsule contains a device that transmits X-rays, with minimal radiation, to the intestinal wall and back. The analysis of distances creates 3D images of the colon's internal surface, enabling the detection of clinically significant polyps with a high degree of sensitivity. Bowel cleansing is unnecessary, since X-ray technology, unlike optics, create 360-degree angular scans that can "see through" intestinal content.

ANo!  There is no application fee.



QDoes Check Into Cash work with other payday lenders?
AYes. Getting a cash advance fast in an emergency money situation is important.  If we cannot complete your loan request, we will give you the option to work with a network of lenders to get you a fast money loan as soon as possible.



QWhat is an online cash advance or payday loan?

AIt’s a short term, small dollar loan that gives you some extra cash before payday. The amount is usually between $100 – $1,000, depending on income level and state law limitation.



QHow can I find out if I qualify for an online cash advance payday loan?
AIt’s easy! To be approved for a payday advance, you only need:

Have an active checking account open for at least 90 days
Be at least 21 years of age (19 years of age in Alabama)
Be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States
Have a current home/cell and work phone number
Have a valid email address

*Oklahoma and Indiana residents must provide proof of a Social Security Number.



QHow much can I get?
AYou may qualify for a fast payday loan from $100 to $1,000. Maximum loan amounts vary by state and are determined during the credit decision process. 



QHow do I get the money?
AOnce your cash advance is approved, the money is electronically deposited directly into your active checking account.



QWhat if I don’t have a checking account?
ACurrently, Check Into Cash requires an active checking account in order to provide you with a payday loan.



QIs it safe to enter my account number or social security number on your website?
AYes. All of our application information is submitted on secure, encrypted pages.



QCan I still get a loan if I have bad credit?
AYes. If you’ve had bad credit in the past, you may still be able to get the money you need from Check Into Cash, so don’t hesitate to apply.



QDo you check my credit score?
ACheck Into Cash does not check the three major credit bureaus.



QHow long does it take to get an online payday loan?
AIt takes just minutes to fill out our online payday loan application! A conditional approval is given immediately on the website at the time of submission. Once the application is received, a customer service representative will then call you to verify your application information. If all information is verified, your funds will usually be available on the next business day.



QDo I need a fax machine or printer?
AIn the event we need additional information (such as a bank statement, pay stub or other form of payment), you may need access to a printer to print the supporting documents as well as a fax machine to send the documents back in some cases. Documents may also be emailed to customersupport@loanbyphone.com.  



QWhat if I don’t have any family to list as a reference?
AList another friend instead.



QHow much does it cost?
AThe fees will vary depending on the amount of your payday loan and your state of residency. See your states fee schedule on our Rates & Terms page for more details. 



QHow and when do I repay the loan transaction?
AThe loan amount and fee are withdrawn from your checking account automatically on the due date.



QWhat states are you licensed for online payday loan business?
AAlabama, California, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. 



QDo you have to call my employer?
AYes, sometimes we do need to contact your employer to verify employment. We will not ask any personal questions – we will simply ask if you are employed there.



QHow long does it take to get a loan approved?
AIn most cases, you will know within 30 seconds if your loan request is pre-approved by Check Into Cash. 



QWhen will I get the money?
AIn most cases within 1-2 business days.



QWhat hours is the service available?
AWe accept requests for payday loans 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Our transactions are processed between 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM (EST) Monday – Friday. We can only electronically fund loans to your checking account on valid banking days (Monday–Friday). 



QWhat is a bank routing number?
AThe bank routing number is the nine (9) digit number on the bottom of your personal checks and is used to identify your banking institution. The routing number begins with 0, 1, 2 or 3.  If this number is not entered correctly during the online application process, it will delay the approval and funding process of your loan request.



QHow do I find my bank account number?
AYour bank account number is located at the bottom of your personal checks. Sometimes your check number is also found on the bottom of your check. Don’t include your check number with your bank account number. If this number is not entered correctly during the online application process, it will delay the approval and funding process of your loan request.



QHow will I know if I’m approved?
AYou will receive a pre-approval notice on the website. A customer service representative will call you shortly thereafter.



QCan I pick up the money at one of your stores?
AYou can choose to complete your loan online or at one of our convenient store locations, but be sure to select the appropriate channel prior to submitting your application. 



QIs my cash advance or payday loan transaction confidential?
AYes, but certain restrictions may apply. Please see our Privacy Policy for more information.

Our Loan Process
A payday loan is a small dollar short-term advance used as an option to help a person with small, often unexpected expenses. Payday Loans are short-term in nature and not intended to be used long-term or for larger purchases like a home or a car. They are a safe and convenient way to allow a customer to stretch their buying power and help cover small, unplanned expenses. Whether you’re suffering from seasonal expenses like holiday bills and back to school costs or you need help with unexpected bills, or repairs, Check Into Cash can help.
How much can I borrow?
Check Into Cash advances range anywhere from $50 to $1,000 depending on your state of residence. The qualifications for our loans are typically less stringent than for conventional loans. In exchange for the cash you need, Check Into Cash charges a small fee. This fee along with the original amount borrowed is typically due on your next day of pay.
Where can I get a fast cash loan?
At Check Into Cash, we have made it easy and fast to get the cash you need, when you need it. Whether you are borrowing online or at one of more than 1,000 retail locations near you, we offer a hassle free approach to borrowing.

MOTOR VEHICLE TITLE LENDING IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA BORROWER RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES



Please take the time to carefully review the information contained in this pamphlet. It is designed to advise you of your rights and responsibilities in connection with obtaining a motor vehicle title loan in Virginia under Chapter 22 (§ 6.2-2200 et seq.) of Title 6.2 of the Code of Virginia.
If you have any questions about motor vehicle title lending or want additional information, you may contact the Virginia State Corporation Commission’s Bureau of Financial Institutions toll-free at (800) 552-7945 or on the Internet at http://www.scc.virginia.gov/bfi.
In General: You are responsible for evaluating whether a motor vehicle title loan is right for you. Alternatives may include among other things less expensive short-term  nancing from another  nancial institution, family, or friends, a cash advance on a credit card, or an account with overdraft protection.
Notice from Lender: A motor vehicle title lender is required to provide you with a clear and conspicuous printed notice advising you that a motor vehicle title loan is not intended to meet your long-term  nancial needs, that the interest rate on a motor vehicle title loan is high, and that if you fail to repay your loan in accordance with your loan agreement, the motor vehicle title lender may repossess and sell your motor vehicle.
Prohibition on Obtaining Loan if Motor Vehicle has Existing Lien / One Loan at a Time: Virginia law prohibits a motor vehicle title lender from making a motor vehicle title loan to you if (i) your certi cate of title indicates that your motor vehicle is security for another loan or has an existing lien or (ii) you currently have another motor vehicle title loan from either the same motor vehicle title lender or any other motor vehicle title lender conducting a motor vehicle title lending business in Virginia.
Prohibition on Obtaining Loan on Same Day Another Loan was Repaid: Virginia law prohibits a motor vehicle title lender from making a motor vehicle title loan to you on the same day that you repaid or satis ed in full a motor vehicle title loan from either the same motor vehicle title lender or any other motor vehicle title lender conducting a motor vehicle title lending business in Virginia.
Prohibition on Loans to Covered Members of the Armed Forces and their Dependents: Virginia law prohibits a motor vehicle title lender from making motor vehicle title loans to covered members of the armed forces and their dependents. If you are (i) on active duty under a call or order that does not specify a period of 30 days or less; or (ii) on active guard and reserve duty, then you are a covered member of the armed forces and a motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from making a motor vehicle title loan to you. A motor vehicle title lender is also prohibited from making a motor vehicle title loan to you if (i) you are married to a covered member of the armed forces; (ii) you are the child, as de ned in 38 U.S.C. § 101(4), of a covered member of the armed forces; or (iii) more than one-half of your support during the past 180 days was provided by a covered member of the armed forces.
Certi cate of Title / Other Security Interests: Prior to obtaining a motor vehicle title loan, you will be required to give a motor vehicle title lender the certi cate of title for your motor vehicle. The motor vehicle title lender is required to record its lien with the motor vehicle department in the state where your motor vehicle is registered and hold the certi cate of title until your loan is repaid or satis ed in full. The motor vehicle title lender cannot take an interest in more than one motor vehicle as security for a motor vehicle title loan. Apart from your motor vehicle and any accessories that are attached to it, the motor vehicle title lender cannot take an interest in any other property you own as security for a motor vehicle title loan.

In general, a motor vehicle title lender cannot seek a personal money judgment against you if you fail to pay any amount owed in accordance with your loan agreement. However, a motor vehicle title lender may seek a personal money judgment against you if you impair the motor vehicle title lender’s security interest by (i) intentionally damaging or destroying your motor vehicle; (ii) intentionally hiding your motor vehicle; (iii) giving the motor vehicle title lender a lien on a motor vehicle that has an undisclosed prior lien; (iv) selling your motor vehicle without the motor vehicle title lender’s written consent; or (v) securing another loan or obligation with a security interest in your motor vehicle without the motor vehicle title lender’s written consent.
In collecting or attempting to collect a motor vehicle title loan, a motor vehicle title lender is required to comply with the restrictions and prohibitions applicable to debt collectors contained in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S .C . § 1692 et seq., regarding harassment or abuse, false, misleading or deceptive statements or representations, and unfair practices in collections. A motor vehicle title lender is also prohibited from threatening or beginning criminal proceedings against you if you fail to pay any amount owed in accordance with your loan agreement.
Repossession and Sale of your Motor Vehicle: If you do not repay your motor vehicle title loan in accordance with your loan agreement, the motor vehicle title lender may repossess and sell your motor vehicle in order to recover any outstanding amounts that you owe.
If a motor vehicle title lender repossesses your motor vehicle, the motor vehicle title lender must send you a written notice at least 15 days prior to the sale of your motor vehicle. The notice will contain (i) the date and time after which your motor vehicle may be sold; and (ii) a written accounting of the outstanding balance on your motor vehicle title loan, the amount of interest accrued through the date the motor vehicle title lender took possession of your motor vehicle, and any reasonable costs incurred to date by the motor vehicle title lender in connection with repossessing, preparing for sale, and selling your motor vehicle. At any time prior to the sale of your motor vehicle, you may obtain your motor vehicle by paying the motor vehicle title lender the total amount speci ed in the notice. Payment must be made in cash or by certi ed check, cashier’s check, money order or, if the motor vehicle title lender is equipped to handle and willing to accept such payments, by using a credit card.
Within 30 days of a motor vehicle title lender receiving funds from the sale of your motor vehicle, you are entitled to receive any surplus from the sale in excess of the sum of the following: (i) the outstanding balance on your motor vehicle title loan; (ii) the amount of interest accrued on your motor vehicle title loan through the date the motor vehicle title lender repossessed your motor vehicle; and (iii) any reasonable costs incurred by the motor vehicle title lender in repossessing, preparing for sale, and selling your motor vehicle.
See section above on “Costs of Repossession and Sale” for additional information regarding the conditions that must be met in order for a motor vehicle title lender to collect the reasonable costs of repossessing, preparing for sale, and selling your motor vehicle.
Violation of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act: Losses suffered as the result of a motor vehicle title lender’s violation of Chapter 22 of Title 6.2 of the Code of Virginia may be pursued under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (§ 59.1-196 et seq. of the Code of Virginia), which in some cases permits consumers to recover actual and punitive damages.
Complaints and Contacting the Bureau of Financial Institutions:
For assistance with any complaints you may have against a motor vehicle title lender, please contact the Bureau of Financial Institutions toll-free at (800) 552-7945 or on the Internet at http://www.scc.virginia.gov/b . Complaints must be  led in writing with the Bureau of Financial Institutions. Complaints should be mailed to the Bureau of Financial Institutions, Attn: Complaints, P.O. Box 640, Richmond, Virginia 23218-0640, or faxed to the Bureau of Financial Institutions, Attn:Complaints, at (804) 371-9416.

Loan Proceeds: You will receive your loan proceeds in the form of (i) cash; (ii) a check from the motor vehicle title lender; or (iii) a debit card. If you receive a check, the motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from charging you a fee for cashing the check. Similarly, a check casher located in the same of ce as the motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from charging you a fee for cashing the motor vehicle title lender’s check. If you receive a debit card, the motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from charging you an additional fee when you withdraw or use the loan proceeds.
Other Businesses: A motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from engaging in any other businesses in its motor vehicle title loan of ces unless permitted by order of the State Corporation Commission. A motor vehicle title lender is also prohibited by statute from selling you any type of insurance coverage.
Using Motor Vehicle Title Loan to Purchase Products or Services or Repay Other Loans: A motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from making you a motor vehicle title loan so that you can purchase another product or service sold at the motor vehicle title lender's business location. A motor vehicle title lender is also prohibited from making you a motor vehicle title loan so that you can repay another loan you may have from either the motor vehicle title lender or an af liate of the motor vehicle title lender.
Right to Cancel: You have the right to cancel your motor vehicle title loan at any time prior to the close of business on the next day the motor vehicle title lender is open following the date your loan is made by either returning the original loan proceeds check or paying the motor vehicle title lender the amount advanced to you in cash or by certi ed check, cashier’s check, money order or, if the motor vehicle title lender is equipped to handle and willing to accept such payments, by using a credit card. If you cancel your motor vehicle title loan, the motor vehicle title lender must mark your original loan agreement with the word "canceled" and return it to you along with your certi cate of title.
Cash Payments / Partial Payments / Prepayments: You have the right to receive a signed, dated receipt for each cash payment made in person, which will show the balance remaining on your motor vehicle title loan.
Additionally, you have the right to make a partial payment on your motor vehicle title loan at any time prior to its speci ed due date without penalty. However, a motor vehicle title lender may apply a partial payment  rst to any amounts that are due and unpaid at the time of such payment. If your motor vehicle title loan is current, a partial payment will reduce your outstanding balance as well as the total amount of interest that you will be required to pay.
You also have the right to prepay your motor vehicle title loan in full before its speci ed maturity date without penalty by paying the motor vehicle title lender the total outstanding balance on your loan, including any accrued and unpaid interest and other charges that you may owe on your motor vehicle title loan.
Lender to Return Original Loan Agreement and Certi cate of Title: Within 10 days after the date that you repay your motor vehicle title loan in full, the motor vehicle title lender must (i) mark your original loan agreement with the word “paid” or “canceled” and return it to you; (ii) take any action necessary to re ect the termination of its lien on your motor vehicle’s certi cate of title; and (iii) return the certi cate of title to you. If you have any questions or concerns regarding your certi cate of title, you should contact the motor vehicle department in the state where your motor vehicle is registered.
No Rollovers, Extensions, Etc.: A motor vehicle title lender cannot re nance, renew, extend, or rollover your motor vehicle title loan.
Failure to Repay: Pay back your motor vehicle title loan! Know when your payments are due and be sure to repay your motor vehicle title loan on time and in full. IF YOU DO NOT REPAY YOUR MOTOR VEHICLE TITLE LOAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR LOAN AGREEMENT, THE MOTOR VEHICLE TITLE LENDER MAY REPOSSESS AND SELL YOUR MOTOR VEHICLE (see section below on “Repossession and Sale of your Motor Vehicle”).

Maximum Loan Amount: A motor vehicle title lender cannot loan you more than 50% of the fair market value of your motor vehicle . The fair market value is generally based on the loan value for your motor vehicle according to a recognized pricing guide.
Minimum and Maximum Loan Term / Monthly Payments: Under Virginia law, your loan term cannot be either less than 120 days or more than 12 months. Your motor vehicle title loan will be repayable in substantially equal monthly installments of principal and interest. However, if you have a longer  rst payment period, your  rst monthly payment may be larger than your remaining monthly payments.
Interest and Other Loan Costs: The following are the maximum interest rates that a motor vehicle title lender is permitted to charge you PER MONTH on the principal amount of your loan that remains outstanding: (i) 22% per month on the portion of the outstanding balance up to and including $700; (ii) 18% per month on the portion of the outstanding balance between $700.01 and $1,400; and (iii) 15% per month on the portion of the outstanding balance of $1,400.01 and higher. As long as these maximum rates are not exceeded, a motor vehicle title lender is allowed to accrue interest using a single blended interest rate if the initial principal is higher than $700. In addition to interest, a motor vehicle title lender may charge you for the actual cost of recording its lien with the motor vehicle department in the state where your motor vehicle is registered.
If you make a payment more than seven calendar days after its due date, a motor vehicle title lender may impose a late charge of up to  ve percent of the amount of the payment.
A motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from accruing or charging you interest on or after (i) the date the motor vehicle title lender repossesses your motor vehicle; or (ii) 60 days after you fail to make a monthly payment on your loan, unless you are hiding your motor vehicle.
Other than interest and the costs speci cally mentioned in this section and the section below (“Costs of Repossession and Sale”), no additional amounts may be directly or indirectly charged, contracted for, collected, received, or recovered by a motor vehicle title lender.
Costs of Repossession and Sale: A motor vehicle title lender may charge you for any reasonable costs that it incurs in repossessing, preparing for sale, and selling your motor vehicle if (i) you default on your motor vehicle title loan; (ii) the motor vehicle title lender sends you a written notice at least 10 days prior to repossession advising you that your motor vehicle title loan is in default and that your motor vehicle may be repossessed unless you pay the outstanding principal and interest; and (iii) you fail to pay the amount owed prior to the date of repossession. A motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from charging you for any storage costs if the motor vehicle title lender takes possession of your motor vehicle.
Written Loan Agreement: A motor vehicle title lender must provide you with a written loan agreement, which must be signed by both you and an authorized representative of the motor vehicle title lender. Your motor vehicle title loan agreement is a binding, legal document that requires you to repay your loan. Make sure you read the entire loan agreement carefully before signing and dating it. A motor vehicle title lender must provide you with a duplicate original of your loan agreement at the time you sign it. If any provision of your loan agreement violates Chapter 22 (§ 6.2-2200 et seq.) of Title 6.2 of the Code of Virginia, the provision will not be enforceable against you.
Property Insurance: A motor vehicle title lender may require you to purchase or maintain property insurance for your motor vehicle. However, a motor vehicle title lender cannot require you to purchase or maintain property insurance from or through a particular provider or list of providers.
Prohibition on Obtaining Funds Electronically: A motor vehicle title lender is prohibited from electronically debiting your deposit account or obtaining any of your funds by electronic means.
