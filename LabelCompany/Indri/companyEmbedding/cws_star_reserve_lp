Terms & Conditions
GENERAL TERMS:Our terms and conditions are subject to change at any time. All items must sell through the auction process, no pre-sales. This is an AUCTION and not a retail purchase. All units are sold as-is, where-is with no warranties written or implied as to the usefulness, condition, or merchantability. We do our best to accurately describe all of our products and their locations. Please call if you wish to verify details of the items description and location. ALL SALES ARE FINAL. All items are located in the United States unless otherwise stated. By bidding on our items in the auction, you are agreeing to all the terms listed below.INVOICING:Invoices are processed as the auctions end and are finalized after closing on the day of the auction. They are invoiced from Indigo Industrial Inc. All lots won in a single auction by a single buyer are invoiced together. We do not split invoices into multiples, nor do we split shipments to multiple addresses - there are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule. All items won in one auction date are combined into a single invoice and will not be split into multiple invoices. PAYMENT:Successful bidders must contact us within 24 hours of the completion of the auction to verify method of payment. Payment is to be received within 3 days. If we have not received contact or payment from you by the Friday following the auction, your item(s) may be subject to relisting. A restocking fee of 10% will be required if your item has been relisted. Payment methods: Credit card, wire transfer [international payments must be minimum $1,000.00], cashier's check [US Customers Only], and check [US Customers only]. Payments over $1,500.00 CANNOT be paid via credit card. All credit card payments will be subject to a 3% convenience fee. Checks can be mailed to the address on the invoice, but are subject to a 10-business-day clearing time, and all payments MUST be made out to INDIGO INDUSTRIAL INC. WE DO NOT ACCEPT CASH PAYMENTS. Buyer is responsible for any wire transfer fees imposed by their financial institution.TAXES:It is said that there is nothing sure in life except death and taxes. In our case, the latter is certainly true. Taxes are payable on all items that are picked up at any of our locations, or shipped within those jurisdictions. In the case of certain tires, federal excise taxes are due on those as well, and is charged IN ADDITION TO the winning bid. In the instance that you are a Canadian buyer and wish to have your product shipped to you, duties and brokerage will be required.SHIPPING QUOTES:Shipping quotes provided in the ads, whether specified or not, are for shipments to commercial, non-rural locations with forklifts. Farms are NOT considered commercial with our brokers. Any ad without a shipping cost either requires a shipping quote or must be picked up by the buyer. Quotes can take anywhere from 24-48 hours to provide, so please request them in advance. Only emailed shipping quotes will be honored. Shipping quotes made over the phone will not be honored.SHIPPING:Shipping is automatically applied to each invoice we send out, except in the cases where quotes are required. This is because the majority of people buying have their products shipped to them. Shipping addresses MUST BE CONFIRMED prior to your item being shipped. Please include it with your payment if you are paying via check or bank draft. WE DO NOT OFFER ANY SHIPMENT OPTIONS OUTSIDE OF THE CONTINENTAL 48 STATES/CANADA. Items denoted as ‘Ship-only items’ on invoices are shipped by us and are not available for pick up and must be delivered to a US address in the lower 48 states. To serve our customers better, we offer a discounted shipping rate to our customers on their behalf, however, this is an optional service and we reserve the right to relinquish our offer of shipping on behalf of anyone. All products are sold at their respective locations and will be found in their described state if picked up there. Having your item shipped leaves your item open to potential cosmetic damage that we are not responsible for: we DO NOT cover cosmetic damage. ALL CLAIMS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BUYER, as we are shipping these products on the buyer's behalf. ALL ITEMS MUST BE INSPECTED WITHIN 24 HOURS OF RECEIPT - IF ANY DAMAGE IS FOUND, YOU MUST INFORM US OF THIS WITHIN 48 HOURS OF RECEIPT. Any items that are returned to us will be subject to a 120 day claims process and no replacement or refund will be given until the claim is complete. Please be certain that you have given us your correct shipping address as well as a phone number for contact. In the event that your delivery is a residential address, tailgate service, in need of delivery notification, or incorrect address given (having the shipment reconsigned), there will be an additional fee charged. Any items shipped via UPS do not receive any shipping discounts whatsoever, and full shipping price must be paid for each item that would normally ship UPS. We DO NOT offer shipping to terminal.PICKING UP YOUR ITEMS:If you are planning on picking up your item yourself, you must call in at least 24 hours in advance to set a pickup time. Our warehouses are open Monday through Friday, 8AM-3PM local time. If you show up at any of our locations without first making pick up arrangements, a $100 charge will be applied to your invoice that must be paid prior to your products being released to you. If you do make an appointment, but do not show on the date of your appointment, a storage fee will be applied of $10/item/day, payable prior to the release of your products. All items must be picked up within 10 business days of the auction. After that, there is a $10/item/day storage fee applied, with the exception of storage buildings and sea containers, which are $25/item/day. US buyers paying via check are given 15 business days to allow for check clearing time. If you are sending an employee to pick up, an “Authorization of Release” form will be required prior to booking your appointment. Same-day appointments are subject to a $50 fee, payable prior to booking. This applies if you actually call in to make your appointment prior to showing up at our warehouse.We have a prep fee of $25.00 (minimum – the fee is sometimes higher for more fragile/expensive products) for buyers arranging their own shipping. This fee covers the prep work required (and already built into our shipping quotes) for having your product ready to be picked up by your carrier. A bill of lading and an authorization of release will be required prior to booking any arranged shipments.We are not responsible for any damage to your or your authorized representative’s vehicle or trailers in the process of loading. We are not responsible for: a) damage incurred to a product after pick up (it is up to the buyer or buyer's representative to inspect the item prior to signing the packing slip), b) any expenses incurred in the event of a mistake in pick up (it is up to the buyer or the buyer's representative to be informed of what their product is and to verify the item prior to signing the packing slip). You must make sure that you bring the correct equipment for the loading and transport of your products. If you do not, you may be turned away. Any excessive equipment work required to adjust your product on your equipment will be charged a flat fee of $50, payable prior to the work being done. Any excessive manual handling will be charged a flat fee of $25, payable prior to the work being done. Items not picked up within 45 calendar days of the auction will be subject to item forfeiture.Our fee schedule:Credit card convenience fee: 3% of invoice totalRestocking fee: 10% of item total – to be paid if you fail to pay for your product in the allotted time frameResidential fee - applied if shipment is made to a residential address/non-business (this includes farms, homes, and rural locations) address: $35Notification of delivery - applied if you require a guaranteed phone call prior to delivery: $30Tailgate - applied if you do not have a way to get your product off of the trailer at your location (orders over 150lbs require a forklift/skid steer/tractor for offloading): $60Storage: $10/item/day, with the exception of storage buildings and sea containers which are $25/item/day, payable if a) you set up an appointment and miss your appointment, or b) do not pick up your product within 10 business days of the auction date.
