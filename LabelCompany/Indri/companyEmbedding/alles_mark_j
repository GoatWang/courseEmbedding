I would now like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark J. Alles - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We are pleased to be with you today to discuss the details of our exceptional start to 2016.
During the first quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our key strategic imperatives, and the results and progress we will highlight today reflect the strong operating momentum of our global commercial franchises and significant advancements made in the key areas of research and development. Importantly, we achieved these results while both investing in our high-potential research portfolio and assertively managing our capital structure.
Our first quarter performance and key market dynamics for our products strengthen our confidence that we will achieve at least the midpoint of our 2016 EPS and product sales guidance ranges that we provided in January. To that end, today we are raising the lower end of our 2016 sales and EPS ranges. Our excellent business momentum also presents us with the opportunity to provide further clarity on our 2017 targets, where we now expect top line growth of approximately 18% and EPS growth of approximately 22% based on the midpoints of our adjusted 2016 and 2017 ranges.
Peter will provide additional details on our updated 2016 guidance and 2017 targets. And in addition to reviewing our excellent commercial performance, Jackie and Scott will discuss the progress our global teams are making towards maximizing the potential of our marketed products and broadening the footprint of our therapeutic franchises.

With the positive results of the Phase IIIb PSA-006 trial evaluating OTEZLA in biologic-naive patients with psoriatic arthritis, we have entered a two-year period when we expect to have the results from 18 Phase III clinical trials involving our commercial portfolio and several key late-stage compounds. These significant later-stage programs and several molecules in early and mid-stage development are expected to provide the platforms for our continued growth through the next decade. Under the leadership of Rupert Vessey and Rob Hershberg, our Thematic Centers of Excellence and our integrated collaborative research model continues to advance our portfolio of unique and potentially transformative early-stage molecules towards critical decision points.
Since the start of this year, we have already achieved important milestones relating to the development of three novel therapies. We filed investigational new drug submissions for: CC-90009, a cell-mod for acute myeloid leukemia; CC-90010, a BET inhibitor in development for solid tumors; and in collaboration with our partner Bluebird Bio, we have dosed the first patient with BB-2121, our BCMA CAR-T therapy for patients with multiple myeloma.
Additionally, based on the tremendous progress our partner Juno has made with its CD19 CAR-T therapy, we exercised our option on the program, providing yet another opportunity for us to build on and leverage our existing expertise and infrastructure to accelerate the development of a unique therapeutic approach in the promising field of immuno-oncology.
Combining our expertise in immunology and inflammation, protein homeostasis, epigenetics, and immuno-oncology with insights gained from our world-class partners is rapidly increasing our understanding of the biology and drivers of cancer and immune-inflammatory diseases. This research engine is enhancing our discovery capabilities and driving the identification of therapies that have the potential to disrupt and improve the treatment paradigms for significantly underserved patient populations.
Our first quarter performance and important research, clinical, and regulatory achievements have us well positioned to deliver high growth in the near, medium, and long term.
Thank you, and I'm pleased to welcome Peter to our call.
Peter N. Kellogg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thank you, Mark, and good morning everyone.
As Mark mentioned, this has been an exceptional start to the year, with strong, volume-driven product sales growth of 21% driving bottom line growth of 23%. We are delivering this industry-leading performance while significantly increasing our R&D investments, as we lay the foundation for long-term growth. Our business momentum has us on track to achieve the upper half of our previously issued 2016 adjusted earnings guidance. Accordingly, we are now raising the bottom end of that range, updating guidance to $5.60 to $5.70 per share. Later on the call, I will discuss how we see this momentum continuing into 2017 and right through to 2020.
First, I would like to provide our thoughts on the outstanding Q1 results. Q1 net product sales grew 21% to approximately $2.5 billion, really strong growth. And key contributions were made by REVLIMID, POMALYST, and OTEZLA. Both Jackie and Scott will address the underlying demand dynamics and outlook for these products later on the call.
Separately, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, the sequential performance from Q4 to Q1 is always impacted by several items. REVLIMID and POMALYST were impacted in Q1 by higher gross-to-net adjustments related to early Medicare donut hole and other ACA payments. In addition, international REVLIMID sales were favorably impacted by the Russian tender in Q4. And ABRAXANE sales were impacted by customer contract optimization that resulted in a buy-in during Q4, followed by a sell-through in Q1. Not surprisingly, these dynamics resulted in a 2% sequential decline to net product sales from Q4.

Looking at our top line drivers of growth, volume accounted for 19 of the 21 total percentage points of growth, outstanding operational performance. A modest contribution from price was partially offset by foreign exchange. The strengthening U.S. dollar drove a negative ForEx impact of approximately $31 million, or a 1.5% negative impact to net product sales.
At the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share grew 23% to $1.32 per share, which includes a $0.065 impact from milestone payments made to collaboration partners for the advancement of our joint programs. Now you may recall that we did not have any milestone payments in Q1 last year. This performance exceeded our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.30 per share due to this strong operational performance. U.S. REVLIMID sales are ahead of expectations, and OTEZLA and POMALYST posted very solid year-on-year growth.
Turning to the P&L line items, as you can see, Celgene's outstanding P&L performance continued. The adjusted operating margin improved 160 basis points to 54%. We saw meaningful leverage from G&A and also from the fact that we are now lapping strong sales and marketing investments that were in place a year ago. And these investments last year supported the launches of REVLIMID in newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma, the U.S. OTEZLA launch, and global rollouts for ABRAXANE and POMALYST/IMNOVID. This year, the increase in SG&A was primarily to support the rollout of OTEZLA in the European Community.
As we highlighted over the last few quarters, we are making significant investments in advancing our next generation of growth drivers through the mid to late-stage clinical trials. Year over year, R&D grew 37% due to: increased clinical trial activity; the Receptos operations, which were not part of our Q1 financials last year; and the $65 million of collaboration-related milestone payments that I just mentioned earlier.
Finally, the tax rate increased from the prior period, largely due to product and geographic mix.
The exceptional operational performance in Q1 drove adjusted earnings per share. Operating income growth drove $0.27 per share of the $0.25 per share bottom line growth. In total, financial levers had a negative $0.02 impact, primarily due to higher interest expense from the $8 billion bond offering last summer.
We ended the quarter with approximately $5.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. As we mentioned on the last call, given current market conditions and our long-term view on the value of the company, we accelerated our full-year plans and were forceful during Q1 with the repurchase program, acquiring $1.4 billion of shares. We achieved this level of activity while preserving financial flexibility to continue making strategic investments that further build long-term shareholder value.
Based on the strong start to the year, we are updating our 2016 guidance. We now expect REVLIMID to achieve sales of $6.7 billion, the high end of the previous range. ABRAXANE sales are expected to be in the $950 million to $1 billion range due to a highly competitive U.S. market for lung and breast cancer therapy. OTEZLA and POMALYST are on track with solid trajectories for the year. All of this gives us confidence to raise the lower end of the previous total net product sales range to $10.75 billion.
We expect R&D to increase throughout the year based on clinical trial activity and new programs coming into the portfolio such as the recent opt-in on Juno's CD19 CAR-T program. Based on these adjustments, we are also raising the lower end of the adjusted earnings guidance to the new range of $5.60 to $5.70 per share, as I mentioned earlier.
A great first quarter and an improved outlook for 2016; and very importantly, we anticipate that this strong operational momentum will carry forward.

Our guidance for 2016 equates to 19% top line growth and 20% bottom line growth. We have spent some time assessing how this great 2016 momentum will carry forward beyond our current guidance year into our target timeframe. We are very pleased to say that despite the previously discussed ForEx impact of the strengthen in the U.S. dollar and our ongoing substantial late-stage R&D investment, we expect to sustain our top and bottom line performance into 2017 and through to our 2020 target goals. This has been achieved as we significantly increased our R&D late-stage pipeline investment, funding 18 Phase III trials and is based on current ForEx exchange rates. Our outlook for 2017 now establishes a target of 18% growth top line, completely in line with our 2020 target CAGR previously announced. It is again worth noting that viewed on a constant currency basis, this 2017 top line outlook represents performance at the high end of our previous target range.
Additionally, we anticipate that the 2016 bottom line growth rate will be improved in 2017 to 22%, which is approaching our 2020 CAGR previously announced in our prior targets, and it represents an improvement over the increased 2016 bottom line guidance range. Of course, all these growth rates are based on the midpoints of our target ranges. With these outstanding growth prospects the operational performance of Celgene is expected to remain outstanding relative to the industry for the duration of our target timeframe.
Now let's focus on the two target years specifically. Turning to 2017, the primary driver in our expected commercial performance is REVLIMID, which we now expect to achieve sales of approximately $8 billion, a $1 billion increase from our prior target. Both POMALYST and OTEZLA are on track and expected to achieve our previous targets. These three drivers are partially offset by ABRAXANE due to the previously mentioned competitive dynamic.
Importantly, our R&D agenda remains very full in 2017. Programs such as GED-0301, ozanimod, durvalumab, and Juno's CD19 program are exciting high-potential assets that represent next-generation growth drivers for the company, and they will all receive important R&D late-stage investment in 2017.
At the bottom line, we now target 2017 adjusted earnings per share of between $6.75 and $7.00 a share and expect a 22% increase from 2016 based on the guidance midpoints in each year.
Finally, for modeling purposes, we advise you to use a diluted share count of 825 million shares. Now, this figure is in line with our prior target but higher than our 2016 guidance. Beginning next year, a change to the FASB accounting standards for share-based payments eliminates the favorable adjustment that is currently provided in the treasury stock method for calculating the diluted share count. This will increase our share count based solely on the new calculation methodology. Additionally, increases in the Celgene share price will also create an increase in the calculated share count.
To round out our longer-term targets, we are on track to achieve our 2020 targets of over $21 billion in product sales and over $13.00 in adjusted earnings per share. As I mentioned, these figures now reflect the current ForEx environment. We are on track despite the weakened U.S. dollar due to our operational strength. We expect that our mix of products will be different, as we now anticipate that the momentum and upside expected with REVLIMID, POMALYST, and OTEZLA will be offset by our reduced ABRAXANE outlook.
As you can see, Q1 financial performance was outstanding. It supports a strong full-year outlook and aligns with our targets for 2017 and 2020, a very strong position for Celgene.
Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to my colleague, Jackie.

Jacqualyn A. Fouse - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director
Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone.
Our teams around the world produced excellent results during Q1. Our hematology franchise performance is particularly robust, especially in multiple myeloma. We have leading positions in many geographies across all lines of myeloma therapy, and we have significant growth opportunities ahead of us.
Our global launch of REVLIMID in newly-diagnosed myeloma continues and is a key driver of our growth trajectory. POMALYST/IMNOVID remains a critical component of our portfolio and has a strong global position in relapsed refractory myeloma. ABRAXANE's growth outside the U.S. remains solid, as the product rises to a standard-of-care position in multiple markets in pancreatic cancer. In the U.S. we continue to face significant competitive challenges as we compete with novel agents in terms of both breast and lung.
Our clinical, medical, and regulatory teams delivered another strong quarter of execution on our development programs. We've made progress across all therapeutic categories on our portfolio of trials, including opting into Juno's CD19 program. We look forward to the ongoing advancement of our programs, including the first readout from our Phase III REVLIMID lymphoma program, with top line results from REMARC for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma coming soon.
Significant growth opportunities are ahead of us in multiple myeloma. REVLIMID and POMALYST/IMNOVID are now backbone therapies within combination regimens across all lines of myeloma treatment. Triplet combinations and continuous treatment are driving and will continue to drive increases in duration. We are gaining shares in newly-diagnosed myeloma across many geographies and will continue to build on our competitive position with label expansions for REVLIMID in the post-stem cell transplant segment and for POMALYST/IMNOVID in renal impaired patients and over time for both products in combination regimens.
Generally for multiple myeloma, the pool of patients is growing around the world with the aging population and with new therapies expanding survival and thus prevalence. And large areas of unmet medical need in myeloma remain. We believe we have a strong portfolio of novel agents in development that position us very well to deliver new therapies to patients who are not yet cured of their disease, and we will report on our progress with those programs as they advance.
Even as those development plans evolve for new novel agents starting already now with recently approved and soon to come triplet regimens, we see nice growth opportunities for IMiDs and combination regimens including IMiDs to continue to gain market share in the U.S., EU-5, and other geographies as well.
REVLIMID had a great quarter in Q1, and we are extremely pleased with our 19% year-over-year growth excluding negative foreign exchange.
In the U.S. in multiple myeloma, we continue to see strong growth in new Rx's and total Rx's, positive momentum in duration, and the ongoing adoption of the continuous treatment approach with REVLIMID. Our growth is mainly volume-driven, and we expect this to continue for a long time to come.
This strong momentum stems from a series of positive events that put REVLIMID in an outstanding position as a backbone therapy in the treatment of multiple myeloma. We now see solid trends in the U.S. with 12 to 18 months of experience, demonstrating the impact of these events in the marketplace. These same trends are taking hold outside the U.S. as well, as we achieve reimbursement for newly-diagnosed myeloma across Europe and now in Japan. With approximately one year of data post the launch of newly-diagnosed myeloma in Europe, now in several countries across Europe we feel highly confident in REVLIMID's future growth trajectory as we continue its broad global expansion.

POMALYST/IMNOVID's global growth remained stellar at 38% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis and is robust across most major geographies. One exception was France, where net revenues for the quarter were negatively impacted in the amount of about $15 million due to a one-time adjustment to rebates. Globally, growth is volume-driven from share gains and increasing duration of treatment. POMALYST/IMNOVID now holds a leading position in third-line and greater myeloma in all major markets where it is approved and reimbursed.
Growth will continue to be strong in 2016 and beyond, as we will have our first full year of product sales in Japan, as duration trends continue to increase around the world, and as we work to update our label for renal impairment data, which will allow us to better address that patient segment. In addition, POMALYST/IMNOVID combination regimens are being studied with a variety of novel agents, and additional future growth will come as those data and subsequent approvals become available.
ABRAXANE continues to hold a solid position in the treatment of breast, lung, and pancreatic cancers within a highly competitive marketplace. In the U.S., overall demand for the product has been relatively stable. In pancreatic cancer, ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine remains the standard of care, with around 50% share of first-line patients. In both breast and squamous lung, U.S. shares have been generally flat, while shares are somewhat down in non-squamous lung. We are also seeing some downward impact on the number of breast cancer patients being treated with chemotherapy post the launch of palbociclib early last year.
Outside the U.S., ABRAXANE growth is good as the product is moving to a standard-of-care position for pancreatic cancer in the markets where it is reimbursed. Future catalysts for ABRAXANE include data from the now fully enrolled apact adjuvant pancreas trial, expected in 2017, and data from immuno-oncology combination trials in lung, expected in 2017, and triple-negative breast expected in 2018.
Our hematology/oncology franchise is off to a great start to the year, with particularly strong trends in hematology. As Peter highlighted, this momentum is causing us to now see REVLIMID coming in at the upper end of our revenue guidance range for 2016 at around $6.7 billion. With the strength we see across our hematology portfolio this year, when we look ahead to next year we now expect a target range for 2017 total hematology revenues of $10.2 billion to $10.5 billion and range of $11.2 billion to $11.5 billion for the combined hematology/oncology franchise, including the net negative impact of foreign exchange.
Our clinical programs are advancing, with lymphoma in the lead, and we look forward to sharing top line data with you soon from the REMARC diffuse large B-cell trial. As we move into 2017, we will have even more data coming from our lymphoma program, as we will see the readout of the RELEVANCE in follicular lymphoma in the first half of the year and the AUGMENT trial in the second half.
Moving to the longer term, we have expanded the number of new compounds and indications in our mid to late-stage hematology pipeline. This progress gives us significant confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2020 target of over $17 billion of hematology/oncology sales despite negative currency impacts. We look forward to providing you with more updates on our clinical programs during upcoming medical meetings, as ASCO [American Society of Clinical Oncology] and EHA [European Hematology Association] are upon us, and we have excellent sets of abstract submissions for both congresses.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Andrew Smith - President-Global Inflammation & Immunology

Thank you, Jackie, and good morning.
Q1 was a strong quarter for Celgene I&I and for OTEZLA. In Q1 we saw revenues continue to grow throughout the quarter in the U.S. and the EU. Leading indicators of demand remain strong in all geographies in which we have launched, and in March we filed the JNDA in Japan. We also significantly advanced the development pipeline for Celgene I&I by taking important steps forward in the GED-0301 and ozanimod programs as well as with many other early to mid-stage clinical programs.
Global OTEZLA net sales for Q1 2016 were $196 million. This represents a 224% year-on-year increase. Sales in Q1 continued to increase despite normal TRx market declines in the first quarter. The majority of revenues remain from the U.S., but we are also seeing encouraging metrics in the early launch countries in Europe. In 2016, our focus in Europe is not only on execution in the early launch countries but also on gaining optimal reimbursement decisions in the next wave of countries and more broadly expanding our footprint in the EU. This should be a significant source of growth in 2017 and beyond.
Overall, we are very pleased with the global execution of the OTEZLA launch as we head into the second full year of commercialization. This strong start in 2016 will help enable us achieve our goal of $1 billion in sales in 2016.
Now looking specifically at the U.S., physician and consumer campaigns are driving increases in brand awareness, patient requests, and trial. It's important to note that OTEZLA continues to lead all other therapies in new-to-brand share, with approximately 40% of both psoriasis and PSA markets. Additionally, OTEZLA total market share in the large psoriasis market has surpassed Enbrel and now stands at 20% of the total branded market. In the slower evolving PSA market, OTEZLA has already achieved 15% market share of the branded market.
Also importantly, earlier this month at the AMCP [Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy] meeting, data was presented that concluded OTEZLA patients showed a similar persistence compared with a biologic cohort amongst adults with psoriasis in the United States.
We are continuing to execute and advance on a robust lifecycle plan for OTEZLA. As previously mentioned, we filed for both psoriasis and PSA in Japan. We also received data from PSA-006, a Phase III study in biologic-naive patients. This was our fifth positive Phase III study for OTEZLA in PSA. We expect a number of milestones in 2016 in 2017, including data from our once-daily registration program as well as Phase II studies in atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis. Phase III data from the global Behçet's trial should be available in 2017.
We are aggressively advancing all pipeline programs, including GED-0301 and ozanimod. Specifically looking at GED, in Q1 we completed enrollment in the endoscopic study CD-001 in Crohn's disease as well as continuing to enroll the large pivotal Phase III Crohn's disease trial CD-002 and a Phase II proof-of-concept study in ulcerative colitis.
During Q1 we saw significant data readouts for ozanimod, including presentations of both the 72-week MS data at ACTRIMS [Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis] and the TOUCHSTONE UC Phase II data at ECCO [European Crohn's and Colitis Organization]. We also expect the TOUCHSTONE data to be published in a major medical journal in the very near future.
Q1 was a quarter of tremendous progress for Celgene I&I. The execution of the OTEZLA launch has put us in a position to have a blockbuster contributor to the Celgene portfolio this year and beyond. We also moved all major development programs ahead. These programs will be major contributors in driving strong growth through 2020 and beyond. We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio as we move deeper into 2016.

Thank you for your attention. I'd like to now turn the call back to Mark.
Mark J. Alles - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Scott, and thanks, Peter and Jackie.
As you've heard from the team, we had an outstanding first quarter, and our global teams made great progress towards meeting or exceeding many of the aspirational goals and objectives we set at the beginning of this year. We look forward to providing further updates regarding these milestones at key conferences and major medical meetings throughout the year. Our business momentum is accelerating, driven by the robust value propositions of our major products and the beginning of a catalyst-rich two-year period, with data expected from 18 late-stage clinical trials.
We are energized and focused on executing on our strategic imperatives, maximizing our incredible potential, and discovering, developing, and delivering transformational therapies to patients in need. Our outlook has never been stronger, more dynamic, or held as much promise as it does today.
Operator, please open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.
Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, thanks. Congratulations, Mark; it's your first big earnings call as CEO. On the 2017 guidance, I appreciate slide 39, which really implies that it's all due to FX. Can you just help me connect the data points between REVLIMID going up by $1 billion but total net product sales going down by about $1 billion? So that would imply changes not only to ABRAXANE but OTEZLA and possibly POM [POMALYST], which wasn't necessarily commented on. Can you walk us through what the thinking is around those other products and if the guidance you're thinking has changed on 2017? Thanks.
Peter N. Kellogg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Hi, Michael, it's Peter. Let me start on that, and then I'm going to pass it to Jackie and Scott as well just to comment on their outlooks for each of their related products.
So you referenced a slide that actually, for the benefit of all the listeners, is actually in the backup. It's the first slide, I believe, in the backup of the slides that we went through. And it just simply highlights that over time we've had targets for 2017 revenue, which actually from when they were originally issued to more recently they were $13 billion to $14 billion, which was an increase from the original target. And if you eliminate the ForEx impact, what it shows is that in fact our current operational performance is in the high end of that guidance range. The entire discussion for 2017 total product sales is entirely a question of the strong operational performance offset by foreign exchange impacts by a strengthened dollar. So thanks for pointing that out.
I think the key is also, though, and very importantly, is with the targets that we've laid out for 2017 and for 2020, we can see now our path forward, at current foreign exchange rates, to having very strong sales momentum that we're achieving this year, that we anticipate maintaining that momentum in 2017, and quite frankly that sets us up very well to maintain that momentum all the way through 2020.
Now in terms of the individual products, maybe I'll let Jackie and Scott each just comment on what they see happening.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director
Thanks, Michael. So just on the Heme/Onc franchise, we've talked about the mix for the franchise for probably about a year or so as being different than what we had expected back in 2013 when we gave these targets, largely driven by the dynamics for ABRAXANE in the marketplace post the era of the checkpoint inhibitors and a couple of other novel agents as well. So if you take the REVLIMID update of $8 billion compared to $7 billion before, that's the plus $1 billion that you talked about. When you think about the operational performance though, the lion's share of the foreign exchange would also hit REVLIMID. That $8 billion excluding foreign exchange would be even higher, significantly higher.

The other product that would come next in the ranking of those impacted by foreign exchange would be POMALYST/IMNOVID, now that we're into the year where we have more international sales for that product. You will remember that the ABRAXANE target for 2017 that was given in 2013 was $1.5 billion to $2 billion. So now honing in on that ABRAXANE number of around $1 billion, you can see I think pretty clearly where that mix shift is.
Scott Andrew Smith - President-Global Inflammation & Immunology
This is Scott. On the OTEZLA side, we're reaffirming the 2017 target for OTEZLA, regardless of FX, at $1.5 billion to $2 billion.
Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Citi.
Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and the slides are great, by the way, for all of us here. I just had a big picture question and a maintenance question. The big picture question is I get a lot of questions from investors trying to understand what kind of changes to the REVLIMID dynamics are going to happen as we approach the cliff. You've got a lot of new combos and data that are coming out this year. I'm wondering if you thought about how you might articulate to investors how to think about, either qualitatively or quantitatively, what percentage of REVLIMID you might be able to offset with these new combos because modeling that in the out years really makes a difference, and there's not a lot of color out there right now.
Then the second question is a maintenance question for Scott, any changes in prior auth [authorization] requirements for OTEZLA that you've seen in the last three months? Thanks.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director
Thanks, Robyn. It's Jackie. I'm going to jump in on the REVLIMID question, and if any of my colleagues who want to add to it, please feel free. The main thing that we see as we continue to make progress on the top line is we feel like we've got pretty clear visibility to how we will be able to bring more targeted novel agents to market to further address certain patient segments within multiple myeloma, be they high-risk patients, patients that are refractory to certain compounds. And we I think have a plan and a strategy that's as clear as it's ever been with the agents that we have in our hands today, and you saw that on one of the slides where we have quite a nice portfolio.
And what we've learned about the mechanism of action of the IMiDs over time is also allowing us to potentially accelerate the next generation of compounds coming out of that platform and the cereblon-modifying agents to allow us to achieve that segmentation and then bringing in more targeted therapies to the different patient segments. So when we think about REVLIMID as we approach that 2025 – 2026 timeframe, we see it probably not being replaced by one new novel agent, but by a basket of novel agents and combination therapies that are going to allow us to grow through that patent cliff, and I think that's probably as much is I need to say at this point in time. I would also maybe add that at some point when we do another research day or an analyst/investor day, I think we'll be looking to give you a bit more visibility to how we're thinking about those things.
Let me also maybe just summarize before I turn it over to Scott. Sorry for the long-winded answer, but with the negotiation on the patent litigation, I think from your perspective in modeling, now that you've got that 2026 goalpost in there, you can see how we get there over the next 10 years in terms of bringing these novel agents forward, and I think you'll see that our development programs are taking us in that direction. Sorry I'm keeping – going long with this, but there are some compounds that are also not in any of our forecasts yet, including durvalumab, for example, which is one that you've got a decent amount of visibility to already in terms of the clinical development program, and you'll see data over time. So with that, I'm going to stop.

Scott Andrew Smith - President-Global Inflammation & Immunology
Thank you for asking the question, Robyn. I think to understand – to answer your question, I think you have to look at the market dynamics and what you see for the market as a whole in Q1 relative to Q4, Q3, Q2, is this idea of patients re-insuring and re-having to go through the prior auth process. And so you definitely see for all compounds, all products in the space that there is an increase in that prior auth process early in the year, and then the patients work through it. A number will have to redo it every year, some will go continuously. But what you see overall is a little bit of a chilling or a drop in Q1 in the overall psoriatic marketplace, and you've seen it for number of years in a row. And then you see the increases happening in Q2, Q3, and Q4, and we see that in the market this year. So you do see an increase in the number of prior auth requirements for OTEZLA, but you see it for the whole market. It's a normal market phenomenon that we see in Q1.
Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
What about step edit? Do you have to use Enbrel ahead of OTEZLA? Is that changing yet?
Scott Andrew Smith - President-Global Inflammation & Immunology
It's a dynamic environment in terms of the payer environment. Over time, we are increasing the number of patients who aren't exposed to step edits. One thing I will say is that the step edits that exist in plans are not necessarily mandatory step edits. There are processes, letters of medical necessity, and other things that can happen to allow access for patients even on plans where there are step edits. Our guess right now is that 80% of patients who are being prescribed OTEZLA are getting OTEZLA, regardless of the edits on the plan, within a reasonable period of time. So we're continuing to evolve the landscape. We want to make it better and better, but the access position is relatively good for a launch product at this point in time.
Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Great, thanks so much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC
Thanks very much for taking the question and congratulations on clarifying 2017. Peter, I just wanted to, if you can, give us a little bit more color on the sequential gross-to-net from Q4 to Q1 in the U.S. for OTEZLA, REV [REVLIMID], and POMALYST. You mentioned that.
And then secondly, you talked in your presentation about the strong financial flexibility; that you have a certain amount of leverage already on your balance sheet. Could you give us a sense of where you might be willing to go in terms of debt to EBITDA or debt to total capital using your balance sheet from here? That would be helpful. Thanks.
Peter N. Kellogg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure. Good morning, Geoff, thanks for the question. So the first thing on the sequential, what you see each quarter, at the beginning of each year in the first quarter, I think this is actually not so much specific to Celgene even necessarily. It's an industrywide phenomenon, which is with the ACA program you do make payments. Each of us has a certain tax we pay, as well as we have to make higher gross-to-net payments early in the year to fill the donut hole. So I think that's a dynamic where you see a lot of that coming through, and basically it's a first quarter effect that hits the gross-to-net. That's the main item.
I don't think there's anything else beyond that. And I do think probably if you found products that came into the same reimbursement world with the government programs under ACA, you'd see that for most companies. I went through that. Just to highlight, as you go from Q4 to Q1, it's just an odd thing. If you happen to be looking at sequential quarters, which personally I always like to look at year-over-year growth obviously. But if you look at sequential quarters, these are the things to keep in the back of your mind; that the gross-to-net does pick up some extra volume in the first quarter.

Also, just to remind you, in Q4 we actually did have a very favorable tender that helped our performance in the first quarter. It's not so much of a gross-to-net, but it's a good volume item, and I mentioned that as well. And then Jackie in her comments, we did have one adjustment into our gross-to-net in France that actually impacted the gross-to-net for POMALYST. So POMALYST really I think is key to understand that there is a slight adjustment in the first quarter. It's a one-timer, it's a catch-up. So POMALYST I think you need to read through that a little bit to make sure you get an accurate view of the momentum of POMALYST, which is just great and doing very well around the world.
On the second question relative to our flexibility, I would just highlight a couple things. First of all, as we went to the transaction with Receptos last year, we did increase our debt load. And obviously we highlighted that that took us up to a much higher debt-to-EBITDA ratio for the short term. And with the very strong cash flow performance of the company, that will be worked back down again, pretty quickly actually. We've obviously covered that with the credit agencies very carefully and full understanding and agreement on that, which is great.
The other thing I'd say is that as we do our business development activity, we are able to use some of our foreign cash in a lot of these transactions because very often we have rest-of-world rights. So we're actually buying IP that, for example, when we did the AstraZeneca deal, that IP was already offshore, or as you get other transactions like GED-0301, likewise an offshore asset, so we are able to use that. And so as a result, our U.S. cash position relative to the Moody's rating is not as stressed. We were also able to do that with Receptos, so we have a relatively good U.S. cash position. We highlight that in the 10-Q. You'll see that in the 10-Q each quarter. We did it for the 10-K as well. And in fact, our U.S. cash position is actually relatively good having gone through that transaction. So from that standpoint, we feel very good about our debt to EBITDA. We actually just recently met with all the agencies. Everything is good.
Now your question was more prospectively. If a transaction came along, how would we look at it? Those are situation specific. I think it was a large transaction – obviously we're not trying to forecast that would be the case, but obviously you might end up using some equity, or you might push yourself up again a little bit. But we obviously have got a very, very full arsenal right now between our internal pipeline as well as our collaboration portfolio. And so we really did use 2015 as a major year to step into immuno-oncology.
Are we still hungry for BD deals? Absolutely, you see us continuing to do transactions with different companies, often fitting in the profile of our collaboration portfolio. So from time to time, if the right opportunity came along, we would be happy to step up. And I think the point about strong financial flexibility is that we have been very fortunate to have a very strong cash flow in this company. We work very closely with the credit agencies on a regular basis, and we feel very comfortable about where we are and where we're going.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC
Great, thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI
Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking my question, I really appreciate it. Congratulations to Mark. It seems everyone is breaking the rules, so I'll ask two questions too. You can decline to answer one if you like.
But I think Bob is in the room. I know Bob has been very involved I think in pharma and bio. And a big top-down issue for the sector is drug pricing. I'd love to hear, Bob, you just talk about where you think that's going and how that's going to evolve either with your Celgene hat on or with your pharma/bio hat on, if you're willing to.

And then a more operational question – not really operational, a pipeline question. Can you just talk more about the REMARC trial? The primary endpoint I believe is PFS [Progression-Free Survival], and I'm assuming it's not powered for OS [Overall Survival]. So is PFS enough, A), to gain regulatory approval in both the U.S. and the rest of world and without OS? And, B), if it is approved, do you think physicians will adopt this therapy without seeing and OS benefit? Thank you very much.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director
Hi, Mark. It's Jackie, so I guess I get to choose which question we don't answer?
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI
Yes, that's fine. You can answer both, though.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director
I'll take the REMARC one first and then turn it over to Bob. I think I can answer the REMARC question pretty quickly. I think we've talked about this before. Everybody knows the trial that's on is REVLIMID maintenance for patients that have responded to R-CHOP. It's for two years. It matches up very nicely with the unmet medical need in that space.
The trial is powered for both PFS and OS. What we would expect to see – I think we've even told you and you can see out there in ClinicalTrials.gov that the expected PFS difference would be about 15 months versus the control. And we would expect or hope to see a positive statistically significant result on PFS and a trend on OS. We do not necessarily expect at this time to see a statistically significant trend. So we think that with the trend in OS and a positive PFS trial that we've got a nice regulatory submission.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI
Thanks, Jackie.
Robert J. Hugin - Executive Chairman
And then, Mark, on the pricing and the environment that we face, I think there are important issues that we need to make sure we're all aware of. We have the overarching economics of the demographics of the developed societies that are going to keep pressure on healthcare economics for several decades. And so I think the most significant issue that we all face is how do we afford the healthcare that we want to have and make the investments in the future that we want. And I think that we're very concerned by the level of noise in the environment. It's very concerning and it's real.
And also to put it in perspective, every eight years we have a presidential election. When that's definitely going to turn over, you see this happening whether you look at 1992 or 2008 and what happens. And so it is an important time for us to address these issues. So first, we're going to be faced with these issues of cost and value for a long time regardless of the politics of it. The politics are important to us. I think we need to make sure we understand that the kind of changes that anybody would propose to really affect our outcomes are going to be very significant are unlikely to occur.
So we think the issues are going to have to be dealt with through the normal operations of our businesses and the systems in our ecosystem, whether it's payers and providers. And we've got to work to do a better job to define what value is, and I think you're seeing people on one side of the system trying to decide this is the way we'll define value and others are going to other methods. I think there are many collaborative efforts going on today between companies on our side and also versus payers, working together to find solutions to these issues to ensure that we do constrain cost but not at the reduction of these kind of investments that we need to deal with the incredible issues that we as a society face from Alzheimer's, cancer, metabolic disease, et cetera.
So we're very concerned about it. Before the end of this presidential debate, we've got to change the tenor to it to ensure that there's a balance to the discussion. We've got important initiatives coming on from the industry about that in the coming weeks and months. But I think we all have to recognize, this is a long-term issue that we're going to be dealing with based on the longer-term healthcare economics of the entire system, and we're going to have to (48:40) be prepared for that discussion.

Mark J. Alles - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think, Bob, just to wrap the point up and we'll go on to the next question, Mark, you know Celgene has been engaged in this discussion for a long time. It's not new for us, as Bob said. This is a very long-term issue, and we're totally engaged worldwide. We've built core capabilities across the globe in our franchises and in our global functions. So it's a thoughtful, engaged approach. And so for us, this idea of patient access, sustaining innovation, I think the narrative that's in the media is different than what's actually happening between governments, innovator companies like Celgene, and the patient groups that we deal with all the time. So I think we'll see the tide change a little bit after the election. But we're totally engaged. It's constructive. And I think for the long term, we understand what our value proposition is as a company and what we have to do in research to continue to bend the curve in the future. So maybe we'll go to the next question, Patrick.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.
Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on REVLIMID and the implications of the 2017 guidance. I'm really curious about the actual drivers behind the sizable bump to your updated rev outlook for 2017 and how much recent positive data sets like the SWOG S0777 study are driving this. Because if they are, I'm curious if there's any particular reason why 2020 stays the same for now, in terms of that outlook. Thanks.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director
Maybe the short answer to your question on 2020 is conservativism. The trends are – that's one reason why we put the slide in there where we show some of those events that have occurred over the last 12 to 18 months that support REVLIMID's position as a backbone therapy and the dynamics around its performance in the marketplace. And now we just had the SWOG data presentation at ASH [American Society of Hematology] last year.
But with that, what we're seeing, and this is true across the world. I think we also included the slides for the early launch countries for newly-diagnosed in Europe, where we now have about a year's worth of data. We see very strong share uptake in the markets where the product is reimbursed, and we're seeing positive duration trends in all geographies. We're also seeing physicians who previously did not necessarily fully embrace the continuous treatment paradigm now embracing that paradigm. We're also seeing fundamental support for not only REVLIMID, but also POMALYST in combination, that is going to be a reality for a long time to come. We're seeing very nice increases in duration for POMALYST as well. So I think that we're in a great position.
When you run some of the numbers out and do some scenarios, we could have some nice upside to 2020. I think today, what we are prepared to say about that is we would expect the mix to be different between heme and onc, as we have said, for 2016 and 2017. But the fundamentals for REVLIMID and POMALYST both are really exceptionally strong.
Mark J. Alles - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I would just add, Jackie, if I could. Recall that obviously we have never changed our view of 2020. In fact, despite the fact that the dollar has strengthened, the operational strength, the power of REVLIMID and POMALYST and OTEZLA and our outlook for that have driven right through that foreign exchange impact, so that's a little bit of the dynamic. So we feel very good about the operational performance of these drugs. More data coming through that's been great, so in no way, Cory, do we want you to think that we're not very bullish on these leading brands.

Peter N. Kellogg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I think some of those updates will come as we get more visibility into the market. But I think the other thing that we've already talked about today is we have a robust pipeline of myeloma drugs behind all of this that we still need to see when and how they segment and change the market. So a lot of dynacism, a lot of opportunity, and I think Jackie said it well. There's probably conservatism in the outlook simply because there are so many dynamic levers. So thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital Markets.
M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Thanks for taking my question. I was excited to see CC-122 and CC-220 mentioned as part of your line extension strategy for myeloma. I was hoping you could speak to maybe the aspect of the REVLIMID profile these two drugs could potentially improve upon. And I know there are, at this point at least, no clinical trials in myeloma. Maybe if you could speak to the regulatory timelines and clinical timelines and what the strategy will be. Is there potential for in the future running head-to-head trials versus REVLIMID?
Jacqualyn A. Fouse - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director
Yes. So, Ian, as I spoke about with respect to the patients and the segmentation strategy and how we see this playing out over the next few years, we do think there is the potential to run head-to-head trials in certain patient segments. We think that what we have learned about effects, immune effects with these different compounds and the mix of immune effects versus antitumor effects is something that is informing how we view these molecules. You saw us add them to the pipeline for myeloma relatively recently, so I think that should tell you something about the insights that we have. It's not only myeloma. We're also learning things that would inform how we think about the future for NHL [Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma] novel agents and CLL [Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia] novel agents, and still unmet medical need patient segments in those categories too.
So I think one of the key aspects of this – there are probably two maybe. And again, those are the kinds of things that we would be able to address in a research type of day, are the molecules behave very differently. We know a lot about them now and are able to design them to fine-tune certain aspects of them to target certain patient segments. We're optimistic about that. And the second thing would be based on what we know about this class of drugs is our ability, once we see some proof-of-concept data, to jump faster to pivotal trials and accelerate the approval timelines for the drugs.
M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
What would those timelines be?
Jacqualyn A. Fouse - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director
We think that we have a good way to move forward with the portfolio of development programs for multiple novel agents and differentiated combinations that will allow us to bring those therapies to market for the 2026 timeframe for the REVLIMID patent.
Patrick E. Flanigan III - Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations
I want to be sensitive to all the other earnings calls that are going to happen today. So maybe, Karen, if we have time for just two more callers.
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is maybe for Scott. I guess you just reaffirmed the 2017 guidance for OTEZLA of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We're probably running at $1 billion or so in 2016 levels. So what gives you the confidence that you will be able to meet that goal? And also do you see any impact at all from the newly launched, for example, COSENTYX from Novartis?

And then second question I want to ask to maybe Jackie, are you seeing pressure in terms of competitive pressure from the newly launched drugs, for example, DARZALEX, in the third-line setting in myeloma? And if so, what's your vision going into the next couple years for POMALYST in that setting? Thanks.
Scott Andrew Smith - President-Global Inflammation & Immunology
Thank you. Relative to OTEZLA and the confidence we have on the targets or our goals for 2016 and 2017 are the idea that the TRx's continue to grow. We're at the highest levels ever as of last week. We're seeing patient initiations at the highest levels possible. We're continuing to gain market share. There's a lot of momentum on demand, and we're seeing very good persistency of patients on the drug.
There was a paper just published last week showing very similar persistency, OTEZLA versus a biologic cohort, which is very encouraging. And then we've got a number of countries that are going to be launching as we go through 2016 into early 2017. We are still at this point in reimbursement discussions and not launched yet in the UK and France and Spain and Italy, so those are upside and growth drivers for late 2016 – 2017 and beyond.
And Japan we believe is going to be a strong growth driver as well. We filed in Japan. We had a very strong pivotal trial in PSOR-11. We filed in Japan. We expect an approval towards the end of this year and be launching with reimbursement early in 2017. We think there's a tremendous opportunity for the compound in Japan. They're very oral-oriented and very safety-oriented, and we think the product fits very, very well in there. So we have a nice growth opportunity in Japan.
The second part of the question was COSENTYX. What we've seen since the launch of COSENTYX, and if you look at the slides you can see the market share graphs, both from a new-to-brand patient initiation perspective and from a market share perspective and a TRx perspective, we've seen OTEZLA continue to grow at a similar rate before versus after the launch of COSENTYX. We believe that they are products which are competing in quite different parts of the market, COSENTYX mainly from the TNF failure portion. And if you remember some of the data that we presented on OTEZLA, 80% of patients who are coming to OTEZLA are coming from something other than a biologic therapy, whether that's lide [lidocaine] or topicals or oral DMARDs. So I think they're products that are in very different parts of the market and looking at different patient segments.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director
Hi, Ying. So just on the dara [daratumumab] question, what we're seeing in the U.S. is that it's mostly staying in the fourth-line and greater setting in terms of usage. We are seeing some combination usage. This is actually a positive thing for POMALYST. We're seeing increasing usage of POM in second and third lines. It's moving up, I would say. The dynamic is actually quite good in terms of the overall relapsed refractory market. And we think as the combination data continues to emerge, this is going to be quite positive for POMALYST on a go-forward basis.
The other thing, as I mentioned in my comments, is we're seeing nice increases in duration of treatment for POMALYST, and we're seeing them quarter after quarter. We're still seeing double-digit growth in both new Rx's and almost double the new Rx level of growth in total Rx's for POM in the U.S., so it's quite positive. When you think about the environment outside the U.S., the one thing I would say is keep your eyes on reimbursement discussions as novel agents come to market, and keep in mind that POMALYST has an overall survival benefit in its label, and that's quite important when you think about reimbursement positioning.

Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you.

Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company.
Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thanks, just two real quick ones for Scott. Can you tell us what percent of a price increase you might actually capture on OTEZLA? I see there were a couple increases earlier in the year.
And then for Peter, the other income line is running well below the guidance you gave us last fall. Should we rethink that guidance?
Scott Andrew Smith - President-Global Inflammation & Immunology
Thank you, Eric, for the question. We have had a couple of price increases. If you take a look at the value proposition that we created for OTEZLA at launch, and that was to be at a significant discount to average biologic price, when we launched we were at about a 30% discount to average biologic price. Now, even though we've had a couple price increases, we've lost a little bit of ground to the market and we're at a 35% decrease or beneath our market competitors and where they're at.
So the market has been aggressive on price. We've been a little bit less aggressive than the market over the past couple of years. We want to maintain that position at a discount to biologic price because we think not only in the U.S., but around the world, it gives us the best opportunity to penetrate and to be used early and the encouragement for patients to be used in the pre-biologic space, so we're going to continue with that pricing strategy.
Peter N. Kellogg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Eric, this is Peter. Just on the OIE line, really quickly, if you look at just interest expense and interest income, we're right on track with the guidance we gave. But then always there's this other category where there's a lot of other things that come in. It tends to be a little bit noisy. You have some impairments, some gains on some of our equity holdings and so forth, and that nets out to be this quarter a little bit positive. But quite frankly, some of the gains were discrete items that pushed our tax rate up a little bit. So overall in the financial section, I'd say really not much benefit there.
And then overall, the net positive, probably we had a couple of positive items on our hedging relative to the recognition of positive impacts from the forward points as we roll forward. You may recall last fall we had a couple of quarters where we had some negative impact. This is just a volatile item that bounces back and forth. So net-net, though, I think I would retain my comment that the interest expense/interest income net-net should be in that high $400 million range on a full-year basis. In any given quarter, the other category can be positive or negative, and I wouldn't go one way or the other with that. And I would remind you that sometimes when there's a positive, it is offset by a higher discrete item on the tax line.
Peter N. Kellogg - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So just to wrap things up, if I can just finish things up for the company, we're really thrilled with the first quarter. We feel like we have come into the year with great momentum, and it's allowed us to increase our guidance top line and bottom line. We have allowed that momentum to help us think through exactly where we're going with our financial targets out in the outer years for 2017 and 2020. We feel really good about that.
I think as Jackie and Scott and Mark all talked about, we have got a lot of exciting activity going on in the pipeline and a lot of late-stage report-out coming in the near term. So I think if you go through the balance of 2016 and into 2017, we have a lot of very positive stimulus items reporting out, and we'll see how that goes. But boy, we're excited to be running the business right now. Thank you very much for joining us on the call.

Good morning, and welcome to the Celgene second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. I would like to remind you this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Patrick Flanigan, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations at Celgene.
Patrick E. Flanigan III - Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations
Thanks, Kat, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings conference call. The press release reporting our financial results, in addition to the presentation for today's webcast, can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the corporate website at www.celgene.com.
Joining me in the room today with prepared remarks are Mark Alles, our Chief Executive Officer; Peter Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer; Jackie Fouse, our Chief Operating Officer; Michael Pehl, President of our Hematology & Oncology franchise; and Scott Smith, President and Global Head of our Inflammation & Immunology franchise.
As a reminder, during today's call we will be making forward-looking regarding our financial outlook, in addition to regulatory and product development plans. The statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those forecasted. A description of these risks can be found in our most recent 10-Q, on file with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we undertake no duty to update or revise them. Reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of the earnings release.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mark.
Mark J. Alles - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Patrick. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I'd like to begin by welcoming Michael Pehl to our call in his role as President of our global Hematology & Oncology franchise. Michael brings over 25 years of industry experience to his leadership position and joined Celgene in 2006 as the first General Manager of our German affiliate. Michael has made significant contributions to our company in roles of increasing responsibility, including Head of our Hematology business in Europe and Head of our global Hematology & Oncology marketing group. Welcome, Michael.
We appreciate the opportunity to review our second quarter operating performance and the progress we have made advancing major corporate objectives with you. Guided by our strategic imperatives, our global teams are driving outstanding results and achieving key financial, regulatory, clinical, and commercial milestones that Peter, Michael, Scott, and Jackie will discuss with you today.
Against virtually every metric, our second quarter was outstanding. This momentum, combined with the leverage our business model continues to generate, improves our full-year outlook such that today we are raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.70 to $5.75, from our earlier target of $5.60 to $5.70 and are guiding to the high end of our current net product sales range of $10.75 billion to $11 billion. Peter will provide much more detail about our second quarter financial performance and improving outlook in a few minutes.

Our management team is committed to delivering exceptional results each quarter while we continue to invest in and advance opportunities expected to maximize the potential of our commercial franchises and build strong and diverse platforms for long-term value creation. We believe this balance was well-represented in the quarter. For example, at ASCO and at EHA, new clinical data were presented that cemented REVLIMID's position as a standard of care for myeloma patients. In just the past year, five novel agents have generated significantly better clinical outcomes in multiple myeloma when combined with REVLIMID. These new data and real-world patient outcomes are adding to the momentum of our global myeloma franchise.
As you will hear from Scott, our investments in the commercialization of OTEZLA continue to drive it to leadership positions in the U.S. psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis markets. And its global expansion is accelerating as we complete launch preparations in major European markets and Japan.
Recognizing the inherent challenges associated with clinical development, we continue to advance high-potential pipeline programs to diversify our opportunities. Earlier this week, we announced that based on the interim overall survival analysis of the REMARC study testing REVLIMID as maintenance therapy for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, we currently do not plan to seek approval for this indication. However, given the optionality and diversity of our late-stage programs, we remain confident in our mid- and long-term growth potential and profile. One of these programs is GED-0301, where later this quarter we expect to have the CD-001 12-week endoscopic data. Scott will discuss our progress developing GED-0301 and our I&I pipeline later during our call.
Through our internal research capabilities, and with our exceptional partners, we have created and continue to add new platforms expected to improve our opportunities for longer-term growth. Since the beginning of the year, we have filed four investigational new drug applications for Celgene-developed products, entered into a number of important collaborations, and advanced key clinical programs with our partners. Last week, we announced a new collaboration with Jounce Therapeutics, adding to our differentiated opportunities to identify and develop novel immuno-oncology therapies. Our work with Jounce is expected to meaningfully add to the progress we are making with our immuno-oncology partners Juno, bluebird bio, Lycera, and AstraZeneca. And our expanded relationship with Agios will investigate potential new therapies based on immune cell metabolic pathways that are expected have applications for the treatment of cancers as well as inflammatory disorders.
These examples highlight just some of the progress we are making with our efforts to discover and advance tomorrow's transformational therapies and create a better future for patients in need. We look forward to updating you on the progress of our research and key late-stage programs throughout the second half of the year. Despite continued global economic and political uncertainties, our business momentum has never been stronger. We continue to invest in late-stage clinical trials to optimize the value proposition of our existing portfolio, advance our mid- and late-stage pipeline, and add promising alliances to our internal research efforts.
These are very exciting times at Celgene. Thank you very much, and please help me welcome Peter to our call.
Peter N. Kellogg - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.
In Q2, we continued to build on the momentum from the first quarter and execute across our portfolio. Our strong top line growth is driven by volume, with exceptional performance from our core products. Our bottom line is driven by careful P&L management, while we continue to invest in our innovative R&D portfolio. Our performance this year has led us to raise our adjusted diluted EPS range, as Mark said, to $5.70 to $5.75, to guide net product sales to approximately $11 billion, and REVLIMID sales to approximately $6.8 billion for 2016.

Turning to our second quarter top line results, we continue to see impressive, industry-leading growth. Our year-over-year growth for net product sales was 22%. Now, Michael and Scott will discuss the underlying demand for this performance later in the call. The driver of our top line growth continues to be volume. Volume accounted for 16 of the total 21.8 percentage points. Our bottom line growth continues to be strong, and adjusted earnings per share grew to $1.44 per share. Our year-over-year 17% growth was achieved despite higher R&D expenses related to our numerous late-stage programs, our acquisitions of Receptos and Quanticel that closed in the second half of 2015, and the decision to opt in on several collaboration programs over the past year.
Turning to our P&L, we continue to have exceptional performance. The adjusted operating margin improved 330 basis points year over year to 54.6% for the quarter. Quarter over quarter, we saw a 60 basis point improvement. We continue to see excellent leverage in SG&A, which from a margin perspective offsets our R&D investment. Operating income drove $0.35 per share of the $0.21 per share bottom line growth. Financial levers had a total negative $0.14 impact, which includes the additional interest expense from last year's bond offering.
We ended the quarter with approximately $6.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. For the first half of 2016, we purchased nearly $1.8 billion of our outstanding shares. And in June, an additional $3 billion for share repurchases was authorized, leaving us with a total authorization level of approximately $5.1 billion.
Based on our exceptional first half performance and strong momentum, we are updating our 2016 guidance for REVLIMID net product sales, total net product sales, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted diluted EPS. Now, our prior guidance for POMALYST, ABRAXANE and OTEZLA net product sales will remain unchanged. As mentioned earlier, we are guiding to full-year REVLIMID net product sales of $6.8 billion, from the prior guidance of $6.7 billion, and this is due to the strong uptake seen year to date. Our continued management of the SG&A line allows us to raise our adjusted operating margin guidance for the year by 50 basis points to approximately 54%. We now expect our adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.70 to $5.75. We are also updating our diluted share count from 811 million to 806 million due to our first half share repurchases.
Our first half performance has been superb, and we anticipate continued great commercial momentum. Looking ahead, we are also excited for the next phase of drivers to extend our future growth.
Thank you. And now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Michael.
Michael Pehl - President, Global Hematology and Oncology
Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone.
Before we start, let me take the opportunity to thank our hematology and oncology teams across the globe for their great work in delivering a truly outstanding second quarter. We have made significant progress in further maximizing the opportunity of our existing assets and in advancing our development programs and pipelines across assets and diseases.
Our Q2 financial results are extremely strong, with 16% year-over-year revenue growth and 9% sequential growth. The REVLIMID NDMM launch is highly successful across all geographies. We expanded reimbursement across key markets and saw positive uptake in duration trends in the markets where we have reimbursement.
POMALYST/IMNOVID continues to grow globally, with strong market share and duration results.
ABRAXANE had a positive quarter around the globe, despite the uptake of novel agents in breast and lung cancer. We are maintaining our U.S. leadership position in pancreatic cancer, and our pancreatic market share is growing in reimbursed markets outside of the U.S.

There was a very positive flow of data supporting our key in-line brands. Impressive clinical results of REVLIMID in NDMM maintenance, in combination with daratumumab in relapsed/refractory myeloma, as well as ABRAXANE combination data with checkpoint inhibitors, have been presented at the ASCO and EHA meetings in June.
Our pipeline is advancing substantially, including our AG-221 and luspatercept pivotal studies. We are very pleased with the progress of our I-O programs. We have opened additional trials of the FUSION program for the (12:42) and hematologic malignancies and made progress with our CAR-T partnerships with Juno and bluebird bio. Finally, our next-generation CELMoDs are moving forward in the clinic.
REVLIMID delivered outstanding results in Q2, with 18% year over year and 8% sequential revenue growth. All key performance metrics are strong globally, and the majority of the growth is coming from volume. The U.S. NDMM launch continues to produce significant share and duration gains. U.S. year-over-year growth in TRxes for the quarter was 16%, and NRx growth was 17%. We have made steady progress with reimbursement in Europe and expect to have reimbursement in additional markets, such as Italy, by the end of 2016. NDMM share continues to grow in reimbursed markets in Europe, as well as in Japan, and is in line with our expectations.
As we discussed during our Q1 earnings call, the momentum for REVLIMID in multiple myeloma is extremely strong, supported by multiple drivers such as the ongoing NDMM launch, the growing evidence for continuous treatment, and multiple triplet readouts and approvals in the U.S. and in Europe. Additional momentum in myeloma beyond 2016 will be generated through our ongoing and planned SCT maintenance submissions in Europe and the U.S., as well as the recent publication of Rd plus daratumumab data in relapsed/refractory myeloma, with an estimated progression-free survival of well over 14 months.
As we look forward for REVLIMID beyond myeloma, lymphoma will be a major growth driver by 2020 and beyond. As Mark mentioned, earlier this week we provided an update on the REMARC trial evaluating REVLIMID as maintenance therapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, responding to first-line R-CHOP therapy. We are working closely with our partner LYSA to analyze the data and look forward to presenting the results at a major hematology conference later this year.
The REMARC study is part of a broad REVLIMID program focused on multiple NHL histologies and patient segments. While REMARC evaluated a unique clinical strategy of using REVLIMID as maintenance monotherapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the other four Phase III studies are testing the combination of REVLIMID with rituximab, or rituximab-based combination therapies, in follicular lymphoma and first-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients with the ABC subtype.
We feel that the evidence created through multiple Phase II studies in those settings is very robust, supporting strong value propositions, unique mechanisms of action, and a good likelihood of success for the RELEVANCE, ROBUST, and AUGMENT trials. Results from the RELEVANCE and AUGMENT trials are expected next year. Our 2020 REVLIMID financial target includes between $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion in sales for lymphoma. We designed this range to be independent of the success of any one of the five Phase III trials.
POMALYST/IMNOVID delivered a strong 35% year-over-year and 16% quarter-over-quarter net sales growth. We have leading market shares in the U.S., launch markets in Europe and Japan continue to see share gains, while duration is increasing globally. Despite the growing number of relapsed/refractory myeloma treatment options, we see a stable third-line share and an increasing second-line share for POMALYST, which is driven by earlier usage directly after REVLIMID and in combination with traditional and new agents, further enhancing value proposition and clinical benefits.

We recently received FDA approval for a POMALYST label update in patients with renal impairment, which will allow us to better educate on the usage of POMALYST in this patient population. We have received a positive CHMP opinion for a similar label update for IMNOVID in Europe. Our development programs for POMALYST/IMNOVID in multiple combinations continue to advance. This includes our Phase III MM-007 trial in combination with bortezomib in second or later treatment lines, as well as ongoing Phase I/II combination studies with daratumumab and durvalumab.
ABRAXANE had a solid performance in the second quarter, with 2% year-over-year net sales growth and 11% sequential growth. In the U.S., ABRAXANE maintained its leadership share position in metastatic pancreatic cancer and continued to stabilize in breast and lung cancer, despite competition from other agents. ABRAXANE net sales outside the U.S. grew 2% year over year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and despite some slight headwinds from price and distributor buying patterns. It's important to note that many recently reimbursed markets have not yet reached peak shares in pancreatic cancer.
I'd also like to remind you of the long-term opportunities for ABRAXANE. Data for ABRAXANE in combination with Tecentriq in triple-negative breast cancer were presented at ASCO, adding to the highly encouraging clinical evidence for I-O ABRAXANE combinations reported a couple of months ago for non-small cell lung cancer. I-O ABRAXANE Phase III trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple negative breast cancer are set to read out in 2017 and 2018, respectively.
In addition to the development programs that I have described for our in-line brands, I am very pleased with the progress we are making in advancing our broad and deep earlier and later-stage pipeline. Let me focus on a couple of key programs and assets. The enrollment of the Phase II expansion study of AG-221 in relapsed/refractory AML is completed, and the Phase III study in relapsed/refractory AML is on track. Our luspatercept collaboration with Acceleron is rapidly moving forward, and our expected Phase III trials in patients with lower-risk MDS and beta-thalassemia continue to enroll well.
I'm particularly excited about the progress we've made with our I-O pipeline. The durvalumab FUSION program is now enrolling six trials in multiple hematological malignancies in combination with many Celgene assets, including POMALYST in relapsed/refractory myeloma, REVLIMID in newly diagnosed myeloma, daratumumab in relapsed/refractory myeloma, multiple assets in NHL or CLL, with Vidaza in high-risk MDS and AML, and with CC-486 in high-risk MDS.
In April, we opted into the CD19 CAR-T program with Juno and made good progress with our respective development programs for Europe. In the first quarter of this year, we opted into a bluebird BCMA program. This program continues to advance and, in conjunction with durvalumab and our next generation CELMoD, will be an important cornerstone on our way to the cure for multiple myeloma.
Finally, I'd like to highlight the progress we've made in substantially advancing our understanding of protein homeostasis over the past few years, which has put us in a position to investigate multiple new and potentially more effective next-generation CELMoDs in targeted, higher-risk patient segments. We have our CC-122 program enrolling into multiple proof-of-concept studies in several indications, both as monotherapy and in combination with new agents. And we have other candidates coming that we will tell you more about as we make progress.
To summarize, we had a great second quarter for the Hematology & Oncology franchise on all fronts. As Peter mentioned, our strong momentum has given us the confidence to raise our REVLIMID revenue guidance to approximately $6.8 billion. The strength of the entire portfolio makes us believe that we will hit the high end of our revenue range for 2016. Our clinical programs are advancing nicely. The RELEVANCE and AUGMENT follicular lymphoma trials will read out in 2017. The POMALYST/IMNOVID MM-007 pivotal study will provide results in 2018. And we have ABRAXANE opportunities in adjuvant pancreatic cancer and with I-O combinations that will be reading out in 2017 and 2018. Finally, our earlier pipeline is moving forward substantially, especially in I-O and protein homeostasis. We have a lot of confidence in accelerating momentum in our near-term and long-term opportunities and are on track to deliver on the 2020 target for our franchise.

Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Scott.
Scott A. Smith - President, Global Inflammation and Immunology
Thanks, Michael. Good morning. Q2 was a strong quarter for Celgene I&I. In Q2, we saw revenue growth accelerate throughout the quarter in both the U.S. and the EU. Leading indicators of demand remained strong in the U.S. and throughout Europe.
In Q2 we received the top line results for our atopic dermatitis Phase II proof of concept study and are evaluating next steps. We also advanced the development pipeline by taking important steps forward in the GED-0301 and ozanimod programs, as well as with other early- to mid-stage clinical programs.
Global OTEZLA net sales for Q2 2016 were $242 million. This represents a 170% year-on-year increase and a 24% quarter-on-quarter increase. The majority of revenues continue to be derived from the U.S., but we are seeing strong metrics in the launch countries in Europe. We are pleased with the emerging access footprint for OTEZLA globally. We have now achieved favorable reimbursement decisions in 14 countries in Europe and expect to conclude discussions in most of the remaining countries in Q3. This progress in Europe, together with an expected approval in Japan by the end of this year, should represent a significant source of revenue growth for OTEZLA in 2017 and beyond.
Now looking specifically at the U.S., physician campaigns and a refreshed consumer campaign are driving increases in brand awareness, patient requests, and trialings. Persistence on OTEZLA continues to lengthen as equivalent to biologic therapy at one year. OTEZLA also continues to lead all other branded therapies in new-to-brand share.
The PsA and psoriasis markets have grown significantly over the past few years, driven in part by new launches of products with novel, non-TNF MOAs. If we look specifically at these more recent launches, we can clearly see from the graph that OTEZLA has not only been a leader in growing the market but has also captured a strong and growing TRx leadership position.
We are aggressively advancing the ozanimod development program. As discussed previously, the MS pivotal trials are fully enrolled, and the ulcerative colitis pivotal Phase III trial, TRUE NORTH, is enrolling patients worldwide. During Q2, we saw significant data readouts for ozanimod, including presentation of the Phase II TOUCHSTONE histologic data at the DDW meeting in May, and, importantly, the publication of the full TOUCHSTONE Phase II data in the New England Journal of Medicine.
In Q2 we also completed enrollment of CD-001, the endoscopic trial for GED-0301. We expect to get initial top line data for the 12-week portion of this study in Q3. We intend to make these data available in the second half of 2016 at a major medical meeting. As a reminder, the objective of the 12-week portion of this study is to evaluate clinical response, clinical remission, and endoscopic improvements at an early time point. This trial targeted to enroll a patient population with advanced or serious disease confirmed by both CDAI and endoscopy at baseline. This is a multi-national site study with approximately 80% of patients in the world coming from North America.
The large Phase III pivotal trial CD-002 continues to enroll, and we have over 150 sites around the world now active. Additionally, the Phase II proof-of-concept trial of GED-0301 in UC is now fully enrolled.
Q2 was a quarter of tremendous progress for Celgene I&I. The execution of the OTEZLA launch has put it in a position to be a blockbuster contributor to the Celgene portfolio this year and beyond. We also moved all major development programs ahead through important milestones. These programs will be major contributors in driving strong growth through 2020 and beyond. We are very excited and optimistic about the future of OTEZLA and the rest of the I&I portfolio as we move into the second half of 2016.

Thank you very much for your attention, I'd now like to turn the call over to Jackie.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director
Thank you, Scott. As you've heard, our teams around the world delivered excellent performance during – in the second quarter. We're well-positioned to finish the year strong and move into 2017 with great momentum. This is the case for our commercial, operational, and financial performance, as well as our clinical regulatory and research performance.
Looking at the 2016 milestones we laid out at the beginning of this year, we see that we are outperforming on our financial targets, as reflected in our updated guidance today. Our commercial and operational positions have never been better and set us up extremely well to deliver on our ambitious growth objectives from now to 2020.
Our franchise teams are driving strong positive commercial trends across our key products and major geographies, and our global operational teams are delivering exceptional performance and helping to drive our operating profit growth. REVLIMID, POMALYST/IMNOVID, and ABRAXANE have already attained blockbuster drugs status, and OTEZLA is on its way to hitting the $1 billion annual revenue milestone this year, thus becoming the fourth blockbuster in our portfolio.
All four of these drugs have bright future growth prospects and unique profiles in their therapeutic areas. The growth potential across our existing product portfolio from ongoing geographic expansion remains ahead of us and is only one of the factors driving our growth as it contributes alongside enhanced value propositions and ongoing label expansions for our marketed products, as well as new product approvals to fuel our expected 18% revenue constant annual growth rate from 2016 to 2020.
Our regulatory teams are delivering on key submissions globally, and some new approvals have already been achieved. Our clinical teams are advancing our pipeline projects with milestones hit across a succession of trial initiations, enrollment achievements, and data readouts.
Our research and early development teams are producing new drug candidates for IND submissions and making progress on the early-stage trials that allow us to advance compounds into a later stage development. Building on the success achieved to date, we enter an exciting multi-year period when we will see numerous Phase III trial readouts.
By year-end, we expect new data and major medical meetings for some of our 2016 trial readouts. Looking ahead to 2017, we anticipate readouts for Hematology/Oncology for REVLIMID in follicular lymphoma and for ABRAXANE and both non-small cell lung cancer and adjuvant pancreatic cancer, as Michael mentioned.
Turning to I&I, we expect to see Behçet's data for OTEZLA and two trials for ozanimod in multiple sclerosis. And there's more in 2018, when for Hematology/Oncology, we will have data for ABRAXANE in triple negative breast cancer and POMALYST in second-line multiple myeloma. For I&I 2018 will bring three trial readouts in the IBD space, two in Crohn's for GED-0301 and one for ozanimod in ulcerative colitis. These are all major trials and potential major catalysts. This portfolio of trials gives us several high-quality shots on goal for products and indications that can significantly contribute to future our revenue growth and diversification.
To conclude, I would also point out that in addition to what is shown on this slide, we have even more information flow during the remainder of this year. As Scott mentioned, we expect to share 12-week data from the GED-0301 endoscopy trial in the second half of the year. As we deliver on our milestones, we will see a number of Phase II trial readouts from now to the end of the year. We also look forward to important data presentations at medical meetings, including UEGW in October, ASH in December, and San Antonio Breast in December. And we will kick off a new R&D deep-dive series with an investor/analyst event in September. Our first topic will be protein homeostasis and where we think the science can take our new product development programs in that area.

Our teams have put us in a fabulous place so far this year, and we have even more to come before year-end and great things ahead in 2017, 2018, and beyond. With that, I thank you for listening, and I now open the call to questions.

Thank you. Our first question today comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Congratulations on the progress. So I'm curious as to what kind of impact the Darzalex launch is having on your multiple myeloma franchise, especially pom. And, given the combination data that's being generated in the other studies that are ongoing, do you see the momentum building for that product as more of an opportunity or a threat for your IMiD franchise? Thanks.
Michael Pehl - President, Global Hematology and Oncology
Yeah, thanks, Cory. This is Michael. Thanks for the question. So, with what we've been showing you, I think it's very clear that we have a very good momentum for pomalidomide across the globe, and it's coming from a couple of factors, starting with the fact that there is a need for a product that is oral and effective and well-tolerated in the later-line patient population. That is the first point, which I think leads to some prescriber preference for using such an oral, very effective drug in that patient population as compared to an IV drug. But I think that's only part of the story. What we are seeing with pomalidomide is that it's moving up. It's moving up in third line, it's moving up even in second line, directly after REVLIMID, and we start to see a lot of combinatorial use, which has a very positive effect on the clinical benefit that we see on the outcomes of patients, but most importantly also on treatment duration.
So we actually don't see the situation that is building with CD38 and pomalidomide as competitive; we actually see it as complementary. The two drugs go extremely well together, and what we're seeing at this moment of time is a lot of combinatorial use.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Your line is open.
Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter. Wanted to ask you guys about the REV and other lymphoma indications, specifically how you guys think about cost-benefit for the REV-Rituxan combos. Since Rituxan's highly effective and reasonably priced, what does that do, if anything, to the hurdle you'll need to see for the REV combos going forward? Thanks.
Michael Pehl - President, Global Hematology and Oncology
So, yeah, thanks for the question. This is Michael. So I think you're referring to the combinatorial studies that we're doing in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma in combination with rituximab. The studies are actually set up in a way that they are with comparing with the current standard of care. So in case of induction of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, that's R-CHOP, which has been standard of care for induction for quite a while. And the study has been really set up in order to provide a huge improvement of outcome. What's also probably important to note that in this study in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma there's a limited treatment duration, so we are expecting a very marked outcomes improvement while at the same time there's a limited duration of treatment.
The situation in follicular lymphoma is building from the observation and the fact that the standard of care at this moment of time is mostly chemotherapy, with or without rituximab, or rituximab alone. We have an elderly, frail patient population in follicular lymphoma that is absolutely not tolerating chemotherapy well, whether it's (33:54) based or whether it's CHOP-based, or R-CHOP based. So there's a true need for improvement of treatment of this patient population. Again, we feel the studies, which are randomized studies, have been set up in a way that they're representing a true improvement of standard of care and the outcomes of these patients. That should translate in a very positive reimbursement situation for us.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, thanks for the question. Question for Mark or Scott on the GED-0301. You mentioned it a couple times as a key growth driver and as a catalyst. Just wanted to understand your current thinking on the endoscopy data, specifically how you think about the relationship versus CDAI, what specifically you're looking for in that study to increase or decrease our confidence on that program, and how confident are you on that data? Thanks so much.
Scott A. Smith - President, Global Inflammation and Immunology
Thank you for the question, Michael. So the study is ongoing. I do not – we haven't seen data. The 63 patients are not through the 12-week portion of the data. What we're querying and what we're looking at are three basic things there: clinical response, clinical remission, and then endoscopic improvements during that 12-week timeframe.
The study's also looking at a slightly different patient population than was looked at in the IGON-2 study. It is a relatively severe population, and there's confirmation of baseline of disease, both by CDAI and by endoscopy at baseline. So that's sort of a difference, or a hurdle, that other studies have not necessarily engaged in. But what it does is it ensures the disease state of the patient at the time of dosing; then we're looking at 12 weeks. So it's an exciting study for us. It's very data heavy. We should learn a lot about GED from that particular study. And we look forward to getting the results out in the second half of this year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thanks. Peter, could you just discuss what's going on with the share count? I know you raised the guidance for the share count last quarter; now you lowered it, and it looks like your guidance for the rest of the year assumes share count goes back up. So I was a little confused there. And then, Scott, just a quick one on atopic dermatitis, OTEZLA. It looked like the slides had a check next to that Phase II study? Does that mean the trial that you have in-house data on is actually positive? Thanks.
Peter N. Kellogg - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Eric. Good morning. So you're right, basically we did have a strong share repurchase effort in the first quarter, and then also we followed on a bit in the second quarter. And so our updated share count for this year really just reflects the full-year calculation of share count on that basis. So clearly the entire biopharma sector, particularly biotech, was down in the first quarter, which we all talked about at that time. And we saw our stock price down in the $90s, and so we took advantage of that and used our capacity to get some shares, and has, for the short term, reduced our share count.
When we go out to 2020, which is I think what you're referring to, we've also provided obviously a basis for that guidance that we gave, and that was a share count of 830 million. And basically what we were trying to do is kind of level-set for everybody, look, on this basis, this is what the P&L should look like on an earnings-per-share basis. So obviously it's a long time between now and 2020, so I think there's also things coming.
And the last thing is just in 2027, remember – in 2017, rather, there is some accounting changes which I could get into off-line, which do have some impact on share count. So all those factors come into play, but in general I think for 2016 we're just trying to help investors think about what they should see as we come in towards year-end on a share count basis.

Scott A. Smith - President, Global Inflammation and Immunology
Thanks for the question. Relative to atopic dermatitis, yes, we just got that data in. It's a relatively small proof-of-concept study – again, somewhat data-heavy, lots of different things that we're looking at in that study. The study did enroll a very significant cohort from Japan, where it is a very significant disease. And so we've got that data. We're working through it, and we're working on next steps. We're going to make the fullness of that data available to everybody, but right now our focus is understanding the data and working on our next steps.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions, and congratulations on the strong quarter. A question on REMARC. I realize you're still probably diving into all the details there, but I'm wondering if you had any initial take as to why you might've seen benefits on PFS without concurrent overall survival benefits. Was it just an issue of the magnitude of PFS not being clinically meaningful enough; are there other potential mechanistic explanations? And as you look at the data, how does it potentially increase or decrease your level of confidence in the other lymphoma studies, recognizing of course that they're testing slightly different indications? Thanks.
Michael Pehl - President, Global Hematology and Oncology
Yeah. Hi, Brian. This is Michael. Thanks for the question. So as you rightfully said, we are really in the midst, together with our partner LYSA, to analyze the data, and we're going to make sure that we're going to have to submit those data to major medical congress at the end of the year. So answering the question of the why is definitely following the analysis, and I hope we will provide a very robust update by the end of the year on those data.
The other part of your question was about the correlation of this data with the rest our lymphoma program. And I was trying to highlight in my transcript is the fact that there's very different patient segments and very different combinatorial strategies in our program. So the REMARC study was really done in an elderly first-time use, large B-cell, high-risk population after R-CHOP, and that was a maintenance therapy. That's very different from the rest of our program. You may recall that the ROBUST study is an induction study in an ABC subtype, and then we have two other important pivotal studies in follicular lymphoma – again, totally different biology and threat (40:33) combination, so I think it's definitely wrong to draw any conclusions from REMARC when we are looking at our other studies.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question. Scott, could I just ask you to help us a little bit on the primary endpoint for the GED study? I know it's sort of a composite that includes endoscopy (41:07) but also has some other components. Can you just walk us through how we should think about those components and how we should think about any of those scorings relative to what you might see in TNFs or other agents? Thanks.
Scott A. Smith - President, Global Inflammation and Immunology
Thanks for the question, Matthew. I assume you're talking about CD-001, the endoscopic study. The endpoint there would be change from baseline in endoscopic scope (41:31) score, which is the primary endpoint there. There are a number of exploratory endpoints that would come and that we would look at as well. There's been a lot of discussion in the environment over the last 24, 18 months relative to what should you expect in Crohn's disease relative to endoscopy.

And sort of the way that this has evolved is at the early time points, whether that's week 10, week 12, people are basically looking for a 25% change in baseline in your SES-CD scores. By the time you get out to week 24, people are looking at 50% improvements in the SES-CD scores. And then it's – when you get out to around a year, 52 weeks and beyond, the people will really look at what we call endoscopic remission or mucosal healing. That's when you expect to see that being significant.
So it's following sort of a time sequence. You expect to see, in an effective drug, strong signs of a response early on, and then you expect to see from an endoscopic perspective the mucosal of the GI tract getting better and better over time leading to different (42:43). But basically, 25%, 50%, and then mucosal at 52 [weeks] is the way that the environment is evolving right now.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Citi. Your line is open.
Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So this is a follow-up question on endoscopy for Scott. So is there any scenario where when you get this data set, that you would think stopping the Phase III trial, or amending the Phase III trial? And just to understand a little bit more about what you're saying about really seeing significant mucosal healing by 52 weeks, like, what have we seen with other drugs at 12 weeks on SES-CD? What kind of healing do we have by then? And how would you describe it? Is it a trend? Have you seen situations where there's none, but you get more at 52 weeks? Just trying to understand really how much – what information is there out there about the timelines for mucosal healing by 12 weeks versus the 52 you just mentioned? Thank you.
Scott A. Smith - President, Global Inflammation and Immunology
Thank you very much, Robyn. I can't thoughtfully respond to the first part of the question, because the study's not completed and I haven't seen the data. It is not unusual for large studies to have protocol amendments and some minor changes to statistical plans and things during the course of the execution of the study. I've never personally been involved in a study that had no amendments at all from start to finish. So some minor amendments can happen for a lot of different reasons. Specific to this case, I haven't seen – the study's not complete. I haven't seen the data. So I can't thoughtfully comment on whether there's anything there which would lead us to change. But at this point, we don't believe that there's anything that we see that would lead to major changes in the program.
Relative to what to expect, this is where it's a little bit different to take a look at comparables in the external world. Very few other companies use SES-CD as the main endpoint to look at endoscopic healing. There's been an evolution in time of what endpoint you should use. Some of the older studies had different endpoints.
And the other thing that I think is very, very important when you look at the data from GED or any new entity in Crohn's disease from this point forward, is we're starting to do baseline endoscopy so that we can confirm that there actually is mucosal involvement at baseline. The prior studies didn't do that, and some of the patients didn't have any lesions when they went into the study, maybe didn't have Crohn's disease. And that was one of the development challenges in Crohn's disease. The way to get around that is confirm active disease at baseline.
So this is a little bit different study. It's more rigorous from that perspective, making sure that there's a mucosal involvement and mucosal damage and then taking a look at, with the SES-CD, an endpoint which is different than endpoints that have been used in the past. So it's a pretty stringent study that's going to give us a really good idea of what's going on in terms of not only signs and symptoms in this population, but really importantly what's going on from an endoscopic perspective.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC
You guys are never supposed to call on Robyn before me. She worked for me.
Peter N. Kellogg - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Mark, your line is open.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC
Yes. No, I know. I was just kidding around. I'm sorry about that, guys. Can you hear me now?
Peter N. Kellogg - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
We can hear you now.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC
Okay. Please never call on Robyn before me. It's just weird because she worked with me. And, by the way, I just want to say congrats to Scott on the success of OTEZLA. A lot of skeptics out there, including me. It's annualizing at $1 billion.
But I would like to go back to Robyn's point. I mean, when we get this data from the endoscopy trial, if we do work on this, will we be able to correlate the magnitude of mucosal healing with a clinical outcome? Is that even possible here? Because that's what people are going to try to do. They're going to look at it and say is the magnitude of mucosal healing great enough that we could reproduce the Phase II data that were so wonderful.
And then John (47:18) has a question, John Miller. John (47:19) you're on mute, too. We have a mute problem.
Scott A. Smith - President, Global Inflammation and Immunology
So can I answer the initial question? So you will see in CD-001 both a clinical response from a CDAI perspective and clinical remission, so you can compare that to what you saw on a slightly different patient population in the IGON-2 study. The relative correlation between what you see in the mucosal (47:49) signs and symptoms, and real healing has been an area of major debate, particularly in Crohn's disease. Much clearer in UC. In Crohn's disease, it's been an area of major debate. There was a couple of recent review articles looking at all the data that are out there and that sort of provide a good picture, but the only correlation that's sort of arisen, that I'm aware of that you can see is if you get control from a signs and symptoms perspective early and you start to see some improvements in the mucosa, it generally leads to a positive effect when you get out to week 52.
And so that's basically what we're looking for in new Crohn's treatment: signs and symptoms, significant remissions, and signs that it's actually starting to work at the early time points, You're seeing endoscopic response or endoscopic improvement, and those things together yield a high – or a probability of a patient being in long-term remission and getting true endoscopic healing at those longer time points.
Unknown Speaker
Great. Thanks, guys. This is John Miller (48:55). I got to ask about the new regulations and especially with regard to up-fronts and licensing payments and the way that you structure these deals. I understand you've said you don't expect much of a difference, but can you really continue to exclude those from your non-GAAP metrics under the new regulations?
Peter N. Kellogg - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, hi, John. (49:17)
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC
Jackie, you like how I make my associate ask that?
Jacqualyn A. Fouse - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director
Yes.
Peter N. Kellogg - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So thanks for the question; this is Peter. So I think we believe that our treatment of strategic collaboration transactions, where the portion of an upfront is related to the acquisition of rights, is excluded from non-GAAP, is appropriate. The acquisition of rights is unique to the formation of the collaboration; it's very strategic, and it's not part of our ongoing operations. Of course subsequently, after that collaboration is formed, all other ongoing operating costs of the collaboration, whether they be development costs, they be milestones, they be royalties, co-commercialization – all the ongoing operational activities that we do together with our collaborator are included in our non-GAAP presentation.

So I think that's way we've always thought about it. It's very hard to forecast strategic transactions. It's something where I don't think many companies talk about what M&A deals they're going to do next year or what collaboration activity they're going to do. And there are many, many reasons that we could talk about in terms of how to think about this and how it makes sense. But in the interest of time now, since we're almost on the hour, I won't drag you through all of that at this point.
But in the interest of time, our approach has been consistent for many years. It's not uncommon across the industry. Many companies have the same approach. And, importantly, we're fully transparent on all the factors we have in our GAAP-to-non-GAAP presentation, always have been. And so anybody who wants to particularly look at it slightly differently certainly is able to do that, and that's fine. So at this point really we feel we're right on track with where we've been. Now, I will mention...
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC
Peter, have you talked to the SEC yet?
Peter N. Kellogg - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I'm sorry?
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC
Have you had a conversation with the SEC?
Peter N. Kellogg - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, obviously we're always talking to all the government agencies, the SEC and everybody else. So some of those ongoing dialogues occur over lots of different topics. Basically if something comes out of that that would be actionable, we'll communicate that, but at this point really there's not much to talk about.

Patrick E. Flanigan III - Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations
You're live. Yep. Go ahead and ask your question, Katherine.
Katherine Breedis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Great, thank you. Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. As a follow up on the GED-0301 Phase II endoscopy study, are you planning to present other biomarker data of mucosal healing, such as fecal calprotectin and fecal lactoferrin? I think that'll help provide additional color on the benefit of the therapeutic form of mucosal healing.
Scott A. Smith - President, Global Inflammation and Immunology
Yes, we are collecting those biomarkers, and it should be part of either the oral presentation or a publication at some point in time. But we are collecting them.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)
Thanks for taking the question. With so many Phase III data readouts between now and 2018, maybe you can help characterize which ones you think are higher probability of success, which you think carry a high or higher risk, and where would you put 301 in that spectrum? Thanks.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director
Josh, hi, it's Jackie. I'm going to jump in and speak on behalf of both franchises, but if the franchise heads want to come along after me that's great, too.
We're not going to sit here and outline successes or probabilities of success of these trials. I think the point is when you look at the portfolio of trials that we have for both franchises and combined, what you see are a significant number of Phase III trials and a significant number of Phase II trials coming along behind those, where you can find proof-of-concept data in a number of settings that support the therapies being studied. This is going to evolve over time, but we've got some programs that by the very nature of where they've moved to in Phase III over the course of time have become de-risked. And we're very excited about the totality of the portfolio, the indications being studied, the products that are in there, and the potential that they hold to come in and give us significant diversification and significant support to our revenue growth and upside potential over time.

So what's extremely exciting is you're going to have this endoscopy data relatively soon. And then there's, as we mentioned, a lot of information flow from now to the end of the year. And we will start in the second half of the year to see momentum going into 2017. And you're going to see these follicular trials read out beginning in the first half of 2017. And Michael did an extremely thorough job of outlining why we think that we will see success with those treatment regimens and what the differences are versus the REMARC trial. So we feel great about it and are looking forward to having some of these things start to read out.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Newman with Canaccord. Your line is open.
John Newman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I will not ask about 0301 since you've had a lot of those. My question is on ozanimod. In terms of the work you're doing in multiple sclerosis, when you brought in the asset, you did make some comments regarding commercialization. I'm just wondering if you are still considering the possibility of marketing that product on your own in MS or if it's more likely that you would consider a partnership. Thank you.
Scott A. Smith - President, Global Inflammation and Immunology
Thank you, John. Where we are right now, we would always – similar to what we did with OTEZLA, we would always take a look and have some discussions and see what's in the environment. There's been a lot of interest in ozanimod in MS, and a lot of companies and others have reached out to us. The way that I would look at this is that you would like to see the fullness of the program and the Phase III data before finalizing any decision on how you're going to commercialize and any of the commercial aspects, including pricing and partnering and our other things.
So we're going to get that data, and we should have a good view on that in first half of next year. But we feel confident if we make the decision to go ahead and go it alone, we feel very confident that we can do that very successfully. We're doing that right now currently with OTEZLA. It's a very – relatively tight specialty group of physicians. It fits what we do at Celgene. So if we looked at the data and made an organizational decision to move forward alone, we feel very confident that we would be able to do that. We would also look to talk to partners as well, if that made sense in terms of the overall value of the asset and the reach to patients worldwide.
Patrick E. Flanigan III - Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations

Jacqualyn A. Fouse - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director
So, yeah, thanks, everybody, for being on the call with us today. Just a couple of things before we close.
I think what you're seeing is simply outstanding execution across the franchises that is the culmination of a lot of years of strategic thinking behind everything that we're doing as well. So lots of exciting data to come for I&I. We've got multiple new products going to read out soon, multiple new indications.

For Hem/Onc, just one thing that I wanted to close with, with respect to the myeloma franchise, is we're in quite a unique position both with respect to our existing assets, as well as those that are coming through the pipeline that you'll hear more about over the course of the remainder of the year as we have our deep dive event and some other things over time. But we're the only company with multiple products in multiple myeloma that are positioned very uniquely across the spectrum between relapsed, refractory, and newly diagnosed, with backbone therapies for REVLIMID and POMALYST/IMNOVID that are combining with everything. And I think that's something to keep in mind. We see a lot of potential, very positive momentum, based on the data that we've seen so far, both in the relapsed/refractory setting for combos, as well as the newly diagnosed setting for combos, irrespective of which novel agent is coming along.
So everything's looking great. Thank you very much. Thanks again to our teams for a great second quarter, and we will talk to you soon.

 What Is a Markup on a Product? | Chron.com              Skip to main content.  What Is a Markup on a Product?  by M. Scilly        A product markup can be represented as a percent. Hemera Technologies/PhotoObjects.net/Getty Images   Related Articles  1 Excel Functions for Adding a Percentage Markup 2 How to Calculate Markup Cost 3 How to Do Percent Markup in Excel 4 How to Add a Markup Percent to a Product    If you're in the retail business you've likely heard mention of product markups. Product markups are a means of pricing products based on their costs. Calculate the markup as a percent or as a dollar value to see what your markup is and use a predetermined markup percentage to set your own prices.        Markup in Dollars When markup is expressed in dollars, it is simply the difference between the cost to acquire a product and the price that you can sell it for. Assume, for example, that you purchase a product for $3 and sell it for $5. To calculate the markup in dollars you would simply subtract the $3 cost from the $5 selling price, giving you a markup of $2. Markup as a Percentage Markup can also be expressed as a percentage. You need to divide the sale price by the cost and then subtract 1 to calculate markup as a percentage. Assume once again that you have a product that costs $3 for you to purchase and that you sell it for $5. To calculate the markup as a percentage, divide 5 by 3 to get 1.67, and subtract 1 to get 0.67 or 67 percent. Using Markup Pricing Markup pricing can be a simple way to ensure that your products make a certain profit if they sell. To calculate a price using a markup, simply multiply the cost of the product by the desired markup percentage and add the total to the product's sales cost. For example, if you have a product that costs $5 and you want to mark it up by 50 percent, multiply $5 by 50 percent to get $2.50, and then add $2.50 to $5 to get a $7.50 sales price. Determining Your Markup There is no hard and fast way to determine the appropriate markup for a product. In general, you should choose a markup that is in line with competitors in your industry. For instance, if the typical markup in your industry is between 70 and 80 percent, you might select 75 percent as your markup. Always take into account how that will affect your sales price, however, and adjust it if your price is too high or low based on demand for your product.
