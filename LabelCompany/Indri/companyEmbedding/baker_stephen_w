I am so grateful for his care of me.Karpitskaya Yekaterina MDEdie G. ratedprofessional and real good at her jobDid You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

Overview

The Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture responds to the desire of Catholics to study the Bible in depth and in a way that integrates Scripture with Catholic doctrine, worship, and daily life. The series offers a readable, informative commentary on 17 books of the New Testament. The Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture implements the theological principles taught by Vatican II for interpreting Scripture "in accord with the same Spirit by which it was written"—that is, interpreting Scripture in its canonical context and in the light of Catholic tradition and the analogy of faith (Dei Verbum 12).
The Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture is packed with features designed to help readers use the Bible more effectively in teaching, preaching, evangelization, and other forms of ministry. Each volume provides exegesis as well as reflection and application sections. A set of cross-references links each passage to the Catechism, the Lectionary, and related biblical texts. Sidebars present information on the background of the text and on how the text has been interpreted by the Church. Abundant quotations from saints and Church Fathers enable readers to glimpse the continuity of Catholic tradition. Each volume includes a glossary, a list of suggested resources, an Index of Pastoral Topics, and an Index of Sidebars.


With the Logos edition, each Scripture passage is linked with your favorite translation, and easy to study side by side with your other commentaries. You can search by topic or Scripture with lightning fast results!

Praise for the Print Edition

The Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture is a long-awaited addition to Catholic books on the Bible. It is clearly written, sticks to the facts, treats the Bible as true history, and does not get lost in idle speculation and guesswork about the sources of the Gospels and the other books. Homilists will find here the pearl of great price and the treasure hidden in a field. Laypersons who are looking for a truly Catholic interpretation of the Bible will find it here. Those who want to know more about God’s holy word in the Bible will want to purchase the whole set.
—Kenneth Baker, SJ, editor, Homiletics and Pastoral Review
Those who preach and teach will find their burden lightened and turned into delight with the help of these commentaries. In a time when much biblical scholarship is written for other biblical scholars, these authors understand that the Bible is the book of the Church, the entire people of God.
—Richard John Neuhaus, priest, Archdiocese of New York
Direct, clear, and spiritually rich, the Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture is just what we need today: patient exposition of God’s Word that illuminates and is illuminated by the teaching and practice of the Church.
—R. R. Reno, professor of theological ethics, Creighton University
There is a great hunger among Catholic laity for a deeper understanding of the Bible. The Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture fills the need for a more in-depth interpretation of Scripture. I am very excited to be able to recommend this new series to our Bible Study groups around the world.
—Gail Buckley, founder and director, Catholic Scripture Study International
The Word of God is the source of Christian life, and the Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture is an ideal tool for living our faith more deeply. This extraordinary resource combines superior scholarship and a vivid, accessible style that will serve the interested layperson and the serious scholar equally well. It feeds both the mind and the heart and should be on the shelf of every committed Catholic believer. I highly recommend it.
—Charles J. Chaput, Archbishop of Denver

The Gospel of Matthew

Author: Curtis Mitch and Edward Sri
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2010
Pages: 400

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




This engaging commentary, like each in the series, relates Scripture to life, is faithfully Catholic, and is supplemented by features designed to help readers understand the Bible more deeply and use it more effectively in teaching, preaching, evangelization, and other forms of ministry. The Gospel of Matthew is an ideal resource for those preaching or teaching on the Sunday Gospel readings from Matthew.


Over forty years ago, the Second Vatican Council called for biblical scholars to study the languages, literature, history, and culture of the Bible while paying close attention to the unity of Scripture, the living tradition of the Church, and the analogy of faith. In this exciting new commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, Curtis Mitch and Edward Sri do an outstanding job of fulfilling the biblical vision of Vatican II. For years I have wished for an up-to-date Catholic commentary on Matthew that would unite history and theology, Scripture and tradition, Old and New Testaments, Jewish roots and Christian faith. Now we have one! This extremely readable commentary should be on the shelf of any priest, deacon, seminarian, or layperson who wants to bring out ‘treasures new and old’ from the pages of the First Gospel.
—Brant Pitre, professor of Sacred Scripture, Notre Dame Seminary
Is it possible to write a historically informed commentary on the Gospel of Matthew that does not position itself skeptically vis-a-vis the claims made in the narrative? Catholic scholars have for some time been hesitant to answer yes. In this volume, Curtis Mitch and Edward Sri invite us to meet the Jesus depicted by the evangelist Matthew—to meet him in his historical context and to meet him without fear that Matthew is leading us astray. The result is like meeting Jesus again for the first time: the Jesus whom we worship in the liturgy meets us in the Gospel as the living, breathing first-century Jew who is Emmanuel, God with us.
—Matthew Levering, professor of theology, University of Dayton


Curtis Mitch (MA, Franciscan University) is research fellow and trustee of the St. Paul Center for Biblical Theology in Ohio. He is the coauthor with Scott Hahn of the Ignatius Catholic Study Bible.
Edward Sri (STD, Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, Rome) is Provost and Professor of Theology and Scripture at the Augustine Institute in Denver, is a founding leader with Curtis Martin of FOCUS (Fellowship of Catholic University Students) and the author of several books on Scripture and the Catholic faith.







The Gospel of Mark

Author: Mary Healy
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2008
Pages: 352

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Integrating Scripture with Catholic doctrine, worship, and daily life, Mary Healy’s volume unwraps the riches of Mark’s Gospel for serious students and novices alike. It includes links to catechism and lectionary texts, accessible and substantive exegesis, reflection and application suggestions, biblical background and living tradition sidebars, and much more.


This well-written book fills a very important niche in our appreciation of the Gospels. Healy combines literary sensitivity with theological vigor, resulting in a reading of Mark that puts a compelling face on the message of this Gospel.
—Gary Anderson, professor of Old Testament, University of Notre Dame
Though Mark’s Gospel is the shortest Gospel in length, it is certainly not short in profound insights on the life and teaching of Our Lord. Mary Healy plumbs the depths and unwraps the riches of this Gospel for both the serious scholar and the novice alike in her easy-to-read and lucid style. With the incisiveness of a surgeon and the clarity of a scholar, she pulls back the curtain on the first century and the ministry of Jesus Christ. This commentary on Mark will fill an important place in my library!
—Steve Ray, host of the ten-part documentary series Footprints of God: The Story of Salvation from Abraham to Augustine
Mary Healy skillfully and insightfully moves her readers to plumb the spiritual depths of Mark’s Gospel through helpful sections of ‘living tradition’ and ‘reflection and application.’ I have found her commentary a boon in homily preparation. If the other volumes in the Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture live up to the high standard that Healy has attained, Catholic Christians will be enriched and grateful.
—Robert J. Karris, OFM, research professor, The Franciscan Institute, St. Bonaventure University


Mary Healy (STD, Pontifical Gregorian University) is associate professor of Sacred Scripture at Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, Michigan, and senior fellow at the St. Paul Center for Biblical Theology. She is the author of Men and Women Are from Eden and coeditor of several books on biblical interpretation.




 

The Gospel of John

Authors: Francis Martin and William M. Wright IV
Series: Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture
Publisher: Baker Academic
Publication Date: 2015
Pages: 368

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




In this addition to the Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture, two well-respected New Testament scholars interpret the Gospel of John in its historical and literary setting—and in light of the Church’s doctrinal, liturgical, and spiritual tradition. They unpack the wisdom of the fourth Gospel for the intellectual and spiritual transformation of its readers and connect the Gospel with a range of witnesses throughout the history of Catholicism.


Francis Martin is a priest in the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C. He is a research fellow in Catholic biblical studies at the Intercultural Forum for Studies in Faith and Culture at the Pope John Paul II Cultural Center in Washington, D.C. He is the editor of  Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture: Acts.
William M. Wright IV is associate professor of theology at Duquesne University, Pittsburgh. He is the author of Rhetoric and Theology: Figural Reading of John 9.







Acts

Author: William S. Kurz
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2013
Pages: 416





What message was the author of Acts seeking to convey, and what would the original audience have understood? How is God using Acts to speak to believers today? In this addition to the Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture series, respected New Testament scholar William Kurz offers a close reading and explanation of the entire narrative of Acts, grounded in the original Greek but keyed to the NAB for liturgical use.


William Kurz, an accomplished biblical scholar, has a written a commentary on Acts that is up to date on current critical scholarship yet accessible to a wide audience of readers. Throughout the commentary one can see Kurz’s clear understanding of the relationship of Acts to the first volume by the same author, the Gospel of Luke. Kurz is always positive in dealing with problem areas of the text. This work will be especially valuable for study groups, college students, and preachers of the Word.
—Terence J. Keegan, OP, professor of theology, Providence College
Kurz sees the Acts narrative not just as a coherent story about the past—our Church’s earliest moments of evangelistic mission—but also as a mirror the contemporary Church may peer into to see its deepest identity manifested within the stories of the major figures led by God to advance the Church's mission to the ‘ends of the earth.’ It is a great service to provide a commentary that is technically pristine, theologically alert, and pastorally sensitive.
—Stephen Miletic, professor of Scripture, Theology Department, Franciscan University of Steubenville


William S. Kurz earned his PhD at Yale University. He has been a professor at Marquette University for more than 35 years and is the author of Reading Luke–Acts: Dynamics of Biblical Narrative.







First Corinthians

Author: George T. Montague
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 320





The first letter to the Corinthians offers crucial insight into a less-than-perfect Christian community struggling to follow Jesus in a multicultural world. Providing a fresh exegesis of the text, Montague examines the divisions within the Corinthian church, issues about marriage, problems with worship, and questions about the resurrection—and reflects on contemporary applications of Paul’s first-century epistle.


George Montague’s First Corinthians is a great addition to the Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture. Of all Paul’s letters, First Corinthians is the one that enables us to see the reality of a first-century Christian community and read Paul’s reflections thereon. Drawing from what Paul wrote, Montague shows the continuity between the Church of God at Corinth and the Catholic Church of the twenty-first century. It is as insightful about the one as it is the other.
—Raymond F. Collins, visiting scholar, Brown University


George T. Montague, SM (STD, University of Fribourg), is professor of New Testament at St. Mary’s University in San Antonio, Texas. He is the author of more than 20 books, including Understanding the Bible. In 1995 he began a new religious community in the Marianist family, the Brothers of the Beloved Disciple.







Second Corinthians

Author: Thomas D. Stegman
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2009
Pages: 320

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




In this volume, Thomas Stegman presents us with his work on Second Corinthians, a book he believes demands the most attention from Christians. Stegman is judicious and handles the material of Second Corinthians well, without losing his intended audience: Catholics who since Vatican II have shown a greater desire to learn about and understand Scripture and its role in their faith. It relates Scripture to life, is faithfully Catholic, and is supplemented by features designed to help readers understand the Bible more deeply and use it more effectively in teaching, preaching, evangelization, and other forms of ministry.


A blessing offered to the whole Church, Tom Stegman’s commentary presents the heart of St. Paul’s message: the fullness of God’s love for us that has opened up a new way of life, empowered by the intimate presence of the Holy Spirit, who shapes us more and more in the likeness of Christ. This inspiring book will encourage numerous Catholics and other Christians in understanding better and accepting more generously a truly Christ-centered existence.
—Gerald O’Collins, SJ, emeritus professor of theology, Pontifical Gregorian University
Thomas Stegman’s commentary on 2 Corinthians is elegant, clear, and deeply insightful. He takes one of Paul’s hardest letters and makes it intelligible. With a masterful grasp of Paul’s rhetoric, he shows readers how the apostle challenges his ancient readers—and readers today—to live out the character of Jesus Christ.
—Luke Timothy Johnson, Robert W. Woodruff Professor of New Testament and Christian Origins, Candler School of Theology, Emory University


Thomas D. Stegman, SJ (PhD, Emory University), is associate professor of New Testament and Professor Ordinarius in the ecclesiastical faculty at Boston College School of Theology and Ministry in Newton, Massachusetts. He is the author of The Character of Jesus: The Linchpin to Paul’s Argument in Second Corinthians.







Ephesians

Author: Peter S. Williamson
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2009
Pages: 224

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




In this volume, Peter Williamson interprets Ephesians for pastoral ministers and lay readers alike. Insightful, very accessible (especially to those unschooled in the use of commentaries) Ephesians provides a fresh and informative treatment of this epistle that handles biblical scholarship without delving into technical jargon or merely "academic" issues. This volume, like each in the series, relates Scripture to life, is faithfully Catholic, and is supplemented by features designed to help readers understand the Bible more deeply and use it more effectively in teaching, preaching, evangelization, and other forms of ministry.


A landmark achievement in theological interpretation of Scripture in and for the Church. Everything about it is inviting and edifying. Highly recommended for all!
—Michael J. Gorman, professor of Sacred Scripture, St. Mary’s Seminary and University, Baltimore


Peter S. Williamson (STD, Pontifical Gregorian University) holds the Adam Cardinal Maida Chair in Sacred Scripture at Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, Michigan. He is the author of Catholic Principles for Interpreting Scripture and coeditor of John Paul II and the New Evangelization.







Philippians, Colossians, Philemon

Author: Dennis Hamm
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2013
Pages: 272





Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon, written by Paul from prison in the middle of the first century, were addressed to specific Christian communities facing concrete challenges. What did these letters mean at the time, and what do they mean for us today?
In this addition to the Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture series, seasoned New Testament scholar Dennis Hamm explores the significance of these letters and their enduring relevance to the life and mission of the church. Based on solid scholarship yet readily accessible, the book is enriched with pastoral reflections and applications, and includes sidebars on the living tradition and biblical background.


A marvelous book—lucid, intelligent, learned, accessible, and provocative—written by a scholar who knows how to invite people into the riches of the New Testament. Presented in a lively format that will appeal to both scholars and general readers alike, Father Hamm’s new book is a boon to anyone seeking to understand and live out the timeless wisdom of St. Paul.
—James Martin, SJ, author of Jesus: A Pilgrimage
I’ve had the privilege of visiting the sites associated with St. Paul’s works, but the experience was not nearly as vivid for me as my reading of Father Dennis Hamm’s commentary. This book lives up to the standard of a series whose volumes have been at once devout, beautiful, erudite, and useful—an extremely rare achievement.
—Mike Aquilina, author of The Fathers of the Church and The Mass of the Early Christians


Dennis Hamm earned his PhD from St. Louis University. He is currently a professor of New Testament and the Graff Chair in Catholic theological studies at Creighton University. He is the author of several books and numerous articles.







First and Second Timothy, Titus

Author: George T. Montague
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2008
Pages: 272

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




The apostle Paul’s New Testament letters to Timothy and Titus offer crucial guidelines for pastors and church leaders. Montague presents sound exegesis that fully explores the offices and duties proposed in the first century, explains how they differ from contemporary practice, and reflects on the pastoral, theological, and practical applications of the text.


A good mixture of scriptural scholarship, background information, church teaching, and practical application. . . . [This commentary] will help especially the teacher and the preacher.
—David Sanders, OP, New Blackfriars
George Montague’s volume on First and Second Timothy, Titus in the Catholic Commentary on Sacred Scripture is a rich addition to the study of the Pastoral Epistles. Tackling the tough questions of authorship and dating, Montague presents a scholarly and Catholic exegesis that incisively analyzes all the arguments and draws carefully thought-out conclusions. Gleaning from sources ancient and modern, the scope of the commentary is broad and faithfully Catholic. The sidebars and historical and cultural notes make this an exceptionally valuable resource. This is certainly a welcomed addition to my library!
—Steve Ray, host of the ten-part documentary series Footprints of God: The Story of Salvation from Abraham to Augustine


George T. Montague, SM (STD, University of Fribourg), is professor of New Testament at St. Mary’s University in San Antonio, Texas. He is the author of more than 20 books, including Understanding the Bible. In 1995 he began a new religious community in the Marianist family, the Brothers of the Beloved Disciple.







First and Second Peter, Jude

Author: Daniel Keating
Publisher: Baker
Publication Date: 2011
Pages: 224





In this volume, Daniel Keating interprets First and Second Peter and Jude for pastoral ministers and lay readers alike.


Daniel Keating has produced a clearly written commentary on 1 Peter, 2 Peter, and Jude. It is striking how he integrates his exegetical insights with Catholic tradition and teaching, explains difficult terms and concepts in sidebars and a glossary, and maintains an exegetical flow alongside a practical focus as he carefully applies the three letters to the contemporary reader. This will certainly be a useful work for the layperson wishing to explore and understand these books as well as for the busy pastor who needs quick access, and it will be even more useful if they desire integration with the Catholic Catechism, the Church Fathers, and other relevant insights from Catholic tradition. The level of integration is striking and very much to be commended. Would that more commentators were equally integrated with their own pastoral and theological traditions.			
					
—Peter H. Davids, author, NICNT: First Peter
These biblical books remain in the relatively neglected corner of the New Testament so it is encouraging to have the Catholic Commentary series include them among its volumes . . . [Keating] does these works justice, particularly the beautiful First Letter of Peter. His commentary traces some of the issues concerning the origin . . . and purpose of the letter, and offers a clear and pastorally rich interpretation of its message.					
					
—Donald Senior, author, Sacra Pagina: 1 Peter, Jude, 2 Peter


Daniel Keating (DPhil, University of Oxford) is associate professor of theology at Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, Michigan. He is the author or coeditor of several books, including The Appropriation of Divine Life in Cyril of Alexandria, The Theology of Cyril of Alexandria, Aquinas on Doctrine, and Aquinas on Scripture.

Publisher: Baker Academic
Publication Date: 2015
Pages: 384

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7
