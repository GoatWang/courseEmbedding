STATISTICALLY DRIVEN,

First and foremost, we care.  We care about putting investors first.  We care about performance, integrity, and the world at large. Second, we believe a great philosophy is only valuable when it’s applied to the real world…with execution and results.

Now that 2013 has drawn to a close, those of us who care about tax efficiency (and that should be about everyone with a taxable account) should note an important anniversary. 2013 marked the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, and with it the inauguration of regular income tax in the United States.

More importantly, we believe the activity of market timing is fraught with severe risk.

History[edit]
In 1993, John Montgomery founded Bridgeway in Houston, Texas. Trained as an engineer, Montgomery began to develop his own models for portfolio management while pursuing his MBA at Harvard Business School. He began investing with the models in 1985, and due to the success of these models, he left his position in the transportation industry in 1991 to undertake the founding of Bridgeway.[1]
The business plan that Montgomery designed in 1991 was unique in the asset management industry. He established the benchmark that Bridgeway would donate 50% of its net profits to non-profit organizations. Included in Montgomery’s business plan was a commitment to stewardship, which Bridgeway demonstrates by avoiding all soft dollar arrangements. No full-time employee is permitted to make seven times more than the lowest paid full-time employee.
Investment procedures[edit]
Bridgeway employs a quantitative investment process. The company believes that using a quantitative approach will eliminate biases and human emotions in the investment management process.[2] Bridgeway applies up to 17 models with different factor weightings to diversify the risk associated with any one approach. Bridgeway tracks over 3500 stocks and ranks each stock in the universe based on a number of factors.[3]
Bridgeway Funds[edit]
The Bridgeway Funds family consists of 11 no-load mutual funds, and has no 12b-1 fees. Publications such as Barron's, Fortune, Kiplinger’s and Money frequently rate Bridgeway Funds amongst their top picks.[4][5][6]

History[edit]
In 1993, John Montgomery founded Bridgeway in Houston, Texas. Trained as an engineer, Montgomery began to develop his own models for portfolio management while pursuing his MBA at Harvard Business School. He began investing with the models in 1985, and due to the success of these models, he left his position in the transportation industry in 1991 to undertake the founding of Bridgeway.[1]
The business plan that Montgomery designed in 1991 was unique in the asset management industry. He established the benchmark that Bridgeway would donate 50% of its net profits to non-profit organizations. Included in Montgomery’s business plan was a commitment to stewardship, which Bridgeway demonstrates by avoiding all soft dollar arrangements. No full-time employee is permitted to make seven times more than the lowest paid full-time employee.
Investment procedures[edit]
Bridgeway employs a quantitative investment process. The company believes that using a quantitative approach will eliminate biases and human emotions in the investment management process.[2] Bridgeway applies up to 17 models with different factor weightings to diversify the risk associated with any one approach. Bridgeway tracks over 3500 stocks and ranks each stock in the universe based on a number of factors.[3]
Bridgeway Funds[edit]
The Bridgeway Funds family consists of 11 no-load mutual funds, and has no 12b-1 fees. Publications such as Barron's, Fortune, Kiplinger’s and Money frequently rate Bridgeway Funds amongst their top picks.[4][5][6]

History[edit]
In 1993, John Montgomery founded Bridgeway in Houston, Texas. Trained as an engineer, Montgomery began to develop his own models for portfolio management while pursuing his MBA at Harvard Business School. He began investing with the models in 1985, and due to the success of these models, he left his position in the transportation industry in 1991 to undertake the founding of Bridgeway.[1]
The business plan that Montgomery designed in 1991 was unique in the asset management industry. He established the benchmark that Bridgeway would donate 50% of its net profits to non-profit organizations. Included in Montgomery’s business plan was a commitment to stewardship, which Bridgeway demonstrates by avoiding all soft dollar arrangements. No full-time employee is permitted to make seven times more than the lowest paid full-time employee.
Investment procedures[edit]
Bridgeway employs a quantitative investment process. The company believes that using a quantitative approach will eliminate biases and human emotions in the investment management process.[2] Bridgeway applies up to 17 models with different factor weightings to diversify the risk associated with any one approach. Bridgeway tracks over 3500 stocks and ranks each stock in the universe based on a number of factors.[3]
Bridgeway Funds[edit]
The Bridgeway Funds family consists of 11 no-load mutual funds, and has no 12b-1 fees. Publications such as Barron's, Fortune, Kiplinger’s and Money frequently rate Bridgeway Funds amongst their top picks.[4][5][6]
