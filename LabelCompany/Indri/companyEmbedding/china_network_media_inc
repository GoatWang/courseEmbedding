(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.  Overview  China Network Media Inc. is an emerging online media, search, community and mobile service group. We operate a multi-lingual portal website that serves the technology industry and provides advertising opportunities to companies through our diverse business network in China. The Company currently operates its website through different versions in China.  As our main target, we provide an online platform to business entrepreneurs and corporations with a B2B marketplace that can help our customers:  · Set their brand image through online magazine, online corporate multimedia advertisement, executives interviews, institutional alliances and flexible membership package that tailor made based on what our customers need.  · Set up customer's online exhibition to introduce their products to the public, where they have our tailor-made corporate introduction and factory facilities online show room;  · B2B product purchase platform for companies and end-users;  · Online job opportunity section for corporate clients; and  · Corporate blogs;  We currently derive a substantial portion of our revenues from online advertising services. Our advertising solutions present corporate users with attractive opportunities to combine the visual impact and engagement of traditional television-like multimedia advertisements and online magazines with the interactivity and precise targeting capabilities of the Internet. We strive to promote a novel and unique advertising environment on our website to attract technology enterprises.  Science & Technology Media was organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands on February 15, 2011 to serve as a holding company for our PRC operations.  On September 16, 2011, Science & Technology Media established HK Science and Technology in Hong Kong to serve as an intermediate holding company.  On January 20, 2012, HK Science and Technology established Science& Technology Trading in the PRC. Its purposes are, among others, a platform for online B2B service.  On January 21, 2012, the "WFOE" ("Science & Technology Trading") respectively entered into a series of agreements with Dalian Tianyi, Science & Technology (Dalian) and their respective shareholders ("Contractual Arrangements"). The relationship with Dalian Tianyi, Science & Technology (Dalian) and their respective shareholders are governed by the Contractual Arrangements. The Contractual Arrangements is comprised of a series of agreements, including Exclusive Technical Consulting Service Agreements and Operating Agreements, through which Science & Technology Trading has the right to advise, consult, manage and operate Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian), and collect 85% of their respective net profits. The shareholders of Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian) have granted Science & Technology Trading, under the Exclusive Equity Interest Purchase Agreement, the exclusive right and option to acquire all of their equity interests respectively in Dalian Tianyi and Science &Technology (Dalian). Furthermore, the shareholders of Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian) are under the procedure of pledging all of their equity interests respectively in Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian) to Science & Technology Trading under the Exclusive Equity Interest Pledge Agreement, and through the Exclusive Equity Interest Pledge Agreement, Science & Technology Trading can collect the remaining 15% of Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian)'s respective net profits.  HK Science and Technology and WFOE are considered foreign investor and foreign invested enterprise respectively under PRC law. As a result, HK Science and Technology and WFOE are subject to limitations under PRC law on foreign ownership of Chinese companies. According to the Catalogue of Industries for Guiding Foreign Investment (2011 Revision) (the "Catalogue"), there are four kinds of industries which are encouraged, permitted, restricted and prohibited for foreign investment. The primary business of Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian) are within the category in which foreign investment is currently restricted. The Contractual Arrangements with Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian) allow the Company to substantially control Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian) through WFOE without any equity relationship.  According to the Power of Attorney executed by the shareholders of Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian), they exclusively authorized WFOE to perform and exercise any and all of the shareholder's rights in Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian).  As a result of the Contractual Arrangements, under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, the Company is considered the primary beneficiary of Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian) ("VIEs") and thus consolidates their results in its consolidated financial statements from January 21, 2012 on.  Science & Technology World Website Media Holding Co., Ltd ("Science & Technology Holding") is a corporation organized under the laws of British Virgin Islands on February 15, 2011. It was the sole shareholder of Science & Technology Media.  On October 29, 2012, Science & Technology Media entered into a Share Exchange Agreement by and among (i) Science & Technology Holding, (ii) the principal shareholders of China Network Media Inc ("China Network Media") (iii) China Network Media Inc and (iv) the shareholders of Science & Technology Holding.  The acquisition is being accounted for as a "reverse merger," and Science & Technology Media is deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the reverse merger. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that will be reflected in the financial statements prior to the acquisition will be those of Science &Technology Media and its wholly owned subsidiaries and VIEs, and will be recorded at the historical cost, and the consolidated financial statements after completion of the acquisition will include the assets, liabilities and operation of China Network Media, Science & Technology Media and its wholly owned subsidiaries and VIEs from the closing date of the acquisition. As a result of the issuance of the shares of common stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, a change in control of occurred as a result of the acquisition.  In connection with the closing of the Exchange Agreement, Toft ApS, China Network Media's principal shareholder, cancelled its 10,000,000 shares of the common stock that it owned in China Network Media and issued 50,000,000 shares to shareholders of Science & Technology Holding, who acquired a majority interest in China Network Media in October 2012 for the purpose of the reverse acquisition of Science & Technology Media. Additionally, the existing officers and directors from China Network Media resigned from its board of directors and all officer positions effective immediately after the closing of the reverse merger. Accordingly, China Network Media appointed Mr. Jiang Wei, the former major shareholder of Science & Technology Holding as the Chairman of the Board and appointed Mr. Peng HuiAn, the former major of shareholder of Science & Technology Holding as the Chief Executive Officer.  China Network Media's directors approved the Exchange Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Simultaneously, the directors of Science & Technology Media also approved the Exchange Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.  Prior to the Exchange Agreement, China Network Media operated in the energy solution industry in New York City. China Network Media was formed as a corporation pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware on April 18, 2008.  As a result of the Exchange Agreement, China Network Media acquired 100% of the processing and production operations of Science & Technology Media and its subsidiaries, the business and operations of which now constitutes its primary business and operations. Specifically, as a result of the Exchange Agreement on October 29, 2012:  · China Network Media acquired and now owns 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Science &Technology Media, a British Virgin Islands holding company which controls Dalian Tianyi, Science &Technology (Dalian) and their telecommunications business;  · China Network Media issued 50,000,000 shares of common stock to the shareholders of Science & Technology Media; and  · The shareholders of Science & Technology Media were issued common stock of China Network Media constituting approximately 95.02% of the fully diluted outstanding shares.  As a result of China Network Media's reverse acquisition of Science & Technology Media, China Network Media has assumed the business and operations of Science & Technology Media with its principal activities engaged in the internet service business in the city of Dalian, Liaoning Province of the People's Republic of China.  On December 3, 2012, China Network Media Inc. filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to change its name from "Metha Energy Solutions Inc." to "China Network Media Inc.".  Critical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relates to our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the consolidation, revenue recognition, income taxes and uncertain tax positions, computation of net loss per share, determination of net accounts receivable, and determination of functional currencies represent critical accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  Principles of consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and VIEs. Upon consolidation, all balances and transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and VIEs have been eliminated.  Use of estimates  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made; however actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include valuation allowances for receivables and recoverability of carrying amount and the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. Revenues are recognized when the four of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the service has been rendered, (iii) the fees are fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The recognition of revenue involves certain management judgments. The amount and timing of our revenues could be materially different for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.  Online Membership Revenue  Online membership revenue includes revenue from members for brand advertising services as well as others services.  The Company has the arrangements with nonrefundable up-front fees model ("the Model") to recognize revenue for the online membership business. We apply the Model, where a contract is signed to establish a fixed price for our services to be provided for a period of time as a membership enrollment, for a majority of our online membership revenue. Revenue is recognized ratably over the membership periods on a straight line basis, unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern, over the contractual term of the arrangement or the expected period during which those specified services will be performed, whichever is longer. We provide advertisement placements to our advertising customers on our different Website channels and in different formats, which can include, among other things, banners, links, logos, buttons, rich media, pre-roll and post-roll video screens, pause video screens and content integration, as specified in the contracts with the members. The members can choose various on line services from the membership contracts based on their yearly membership.  For online membership revenue recognition, we recognize revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met.  Others Revenues  Other revenues are primarily generated from online advertisement planning services which introduce our customer's profile, product, and awareness promotion for their executive officers to build a better brand name for non-member companies. We follows the guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission's FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 605 for revenue recognition for others revenues. The Company recognize others revenue when they are realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement that the services have been rendered to the customer, the sales price is fixed or determinable, the services are rendered and collectability is reasonably assured.  Income Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions  Income Taxes  The Company follows ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates, applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.  The Company adopted ASC 740-10-25, which provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax position. The Company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. Our estimated liability for unrecognized tax benefits, may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, changes and/or developments with respect to tax audits, and expiration of the statute of limitations. The outcome for a particular audit cannot be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit and, in some cases, appeal or litigation process. The actual benefits ultimately realized may differ from our estimates. As each audit is concluded, adjustments, if any, are recorded in our financial statements. Additionally, in future periods, changes in facts, circumstances, and new information may require us to adjust the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions. Changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recognized in the period in which the changes occur. The Company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to an uncertain tax position, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the combined statements of operations. The Company did not recognize any additional liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10-25.  Accounts Receivable  Accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value consisting of the carrying amount less an allowance for uncollectible accounts as needed. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company's existing accounts receivable. The Company determines the allowance based on aging data, historical collection experience, customer specific facts and economic conditions. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company did not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure relating to its customers, suppliers or others. As of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, management has determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts is required.  Property and equipment  Property and equipment mainly comprise computer equipment, hardware and office furniture. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation with no residual value.  Depreciation for financial reporting purposes is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets:  Office and other equipment 5 years  Computers 3 years  Depreciation expense is included in Selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses.  When office equipment and electronic devices are retired or otherwise disposed of, resulting gain or loss is included in net income or loss in the year of disposition for the difference between the net book value and proceeds received thereon. Maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the expected useful lives of the assets are charged to expenses as incurred.  Foreign currency transactions and translations  An entity's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates, normally that is the currency of the environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. Management's judgment is essential to determine the functional currency by assessing various indicators, such as cash flows, sales price and market, expenses, financing and inter-company transactions and arrangements. The reporting currency of the Company is United States dollars ("U.S. dollars" or "$"), and the functional currency of HK Science & Technology is Hong Kong dollars ("HK dollar"). The functional currency of the Company's PRC subsidiary and VIEs is the Renminbi ("RMB'), and PRC is the primary economic environment in which the Company operates. The reporting currency of these consolidated financial statements is the United States dollar.  For financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the Company's PRC subsidiary and VIEs, which are prepared using the RMB, are translated into the Company's reporting currency, the United States dollar. Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated using average rates prevailing during each reporting period, and shareholders' equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in owners' equity.  Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The resulting exchange differences are included in the determination of net income (loss) of the consolidated financial statements for the respective periods.  The exchange rates used for foreign currency translation were as follows (US$1 = RMB):   Average (Six Period End months ended) 06/30/2013 6.1882 6.2479 06/30/2012 6.3197 6.3255 12/31/2012 6.3161  No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars at the rates used in translation.  Translations adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholder's deficit were $48,762 at June 30, 2013 and $34,712 at December 31, 2012, respectively.

Loss from Operations  As a result of the foregoing, our operating loss was $232,897 for the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to loss of $375,962 for the six months ended June 30, 2012.  Other Income  Other income was $1,208,327 for the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to other income of $23,930 for the corresponding period in 2012. The increases were mainly due to the collectability of the customer deposit was reasonably assured, which resulted in the fluctuations between two periods. . . .

He’s even opened up his own tattoo parlor, the appropriately titled Evolution Tattoo
Studio. Multiple stars may show achievement or high quality.

	Inc.)








	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements




	(Unaudited)




	(U.S Dollars unless otherwise
	noted)



	 



	NOTE 1.     DESCRIPTION
	OF BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION



	 


	China Network Media Inc. (formerly known as
	Metha Energy Solutions Inc.) was incorporated on April 18, 2008 under the laws of the State of Delaware.


	 


	Science & Technology World Website Media
	Holding Co., Ltd. (“Science & Technology Holding”) was organized under the laws of the British Virgin Island on
	February 15, 2011.


	 


	Science & Technology World Website Media
	Group Co., Ltd. (“Science & Technology Media”) was organized under the laws of the British Virgin Island on February
	15, 2011 to serve as a holding company for the People's Republic of China (the "PRC") operations. On September 16, 2011,
	Science & Technology Media established Science & Technology World Website Hong Kong Media Holding Co., Ltd. (“HK
	Science & Technology”) in Hong Kong to serve as an intermediate holding company.


	 


	On January 20, 2012, HK Science and Technology
	established Science& Technology World Website Trade (Dalian) Co., Ltd (the “WFOE” or “Science & Technology
	Trading”) in the PRC. Its purposes are, among others, a platform for online B2B service.


	 


	HK Science and Technology and the WFOE are
	considered foreign investor and foreign invested enterprise respectively under PRC law. As a result, HK Science & Technology
	and the WFOE are subject to limitations under PRC law on foreign ownership of Chinese companies. According to the Catalogue of
	Industries for Guiding Foreign Investment (2011 Revision) (the “Catalogue”), there are four kinds of industries which
	are encouraged, permitted, restricted and prohibited for foreign investment. The primary business of Dalian Tianyi Culture Development
	Co., Ltd (“Dalian Tianyi”) and Science & Technology World Network (Dalian) Co., Ltd (“Science & Technology
	(Dalian)”) are within the category in which foreign investment is currently restricted.


	 


	On January 21, 2012, the WFOE respectively
	entered into a series of agreements with Dalian Tianyi, Science & Technology (Dalian) and their respective shareholders (“Contractual
	Arrangements”). The relationship with Dalian Tianyi, Science & Technology (Dalian) and their respective shareholders
	are governed by the Contractual Arrangements. The Contractual Arrangements are comprised of a series of agreements, including Exclusive
	Technical Consulting Service Agreements and Operating Agreements, through which WFOE has the right to advise, consult, manage and
	operate Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian), and collect 85% of their respective net profits. The shareholders
	of Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian) have granted WFOE, under the Exclusive Equity Interest Purchase Agreement,
	the exclusive right and option to acquire all of their equity interests respectively in Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology
	(Dalian). Furthermore, the shareholders of Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian) are under the procedure of pledging
	all of their equity interests respectively in Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian) to WFOE under the Exclusive Equity
	Interest Pledge Agreement, and through the Exclusive Equity Interest Pledge Agreement, WFOE can collect the remaining 15% of Dalian
	Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian)’s respective net profits.  


	 


	According to the Power of Attorney executed
	by the shareholders of Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian), they exclusively authorized WFOE to perform and exercise
	any and all of the shareholder’s rights in Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian).


	  


	As a result of the Contractual Arrangements,
	under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, Science & Technology Media is considered
	the primary beneficiary of Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian) (“VIEs”)

	On October 29, 2012, Science & Technology
	Media entered into a Share Exchange Agreement by and among (i) Science & Technology Holding, (ii) the principal shareholders
	of China Network Media Inc., (iii) China Network Media Inc., (iv) the shareholders of Science &Technology Holding and (v) Science
	& Technology Media.


	  


	The acquisition was accounted for as a “reverse
	merger,” and Science & Technology Media was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in the reverse merger. Consequently,
	the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that would be reflected in the financial statements prior to the acquisition
	would be those of Science &Technology Media and its wholly owned subsidiaries and VIEs, and would be recorded at the historical
	cost, and the consolidated financial statements after completion of the acquisition would include the assets, liabilities and operation
	of China Network Media Inc., Science & Technology Media and its wholly owned subsidiaries and VIEs from the closing date of
	the acquisition. As a result of the issuance of the shares of common stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, a change in control
	of occurred as a result of the acquisition.


	 


	In connection with the closing of the Exchange
	Agreement, ToftApS, China Network Media Inc.’ principal shareholder, agreed to cancel its 10,000,000 shares of the common

	who acquired a majority interest in China Network Media Inc., in October 2012 for the purpose of the reverse acquisition of Science
	& Technology Media. Additionally, the existing officers and directors from China Network Media Inc. resigned from its board
	of directors and all officer positions effective immediately after the closing of the reverse merger. Accordingly, China Network
	Media Inc. appointed Mr. Jiang Wei, the former major shareholder of Science & Technology Holding as the Chairman of the Board
	and appointed Mr. Peng HuiAn, the former major shareholder of Science & Technology Holding as the Chief Executive Officer.
	The shareholders of Science & Technology Media shareholder were issued common stock of China Network Media Inc. constituting
	approximately 95.02% of the fully diluted outstanding shares. After the RTO, 52,620,030 common stocks were outstanding.


	 


	China Network Media Inc.’ directors approved
	the Exchange Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Simultaneously, the directors of Science & Technology Media
	also approved the Exchange Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.

	On March 19, 2013, the Company submitted dissolution
	application for Science & Technology Holding which was approved on April 2, 2013.


	 


	China Network Media Inc., its wholly-owned

	NOTE 2.      GOING
	CONCERN AND LIQUIDITY



	 


	The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
	statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company currently has limited revenue
	and has accumulated deficit of $987,599 and $1,023,818 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and net income of 58,795 and$287,873
	for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
	ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans to fund continuing operations through new financing from related parties
	and equity financing arrangements. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to meet its
	obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required until 2016 when it can generate sources of recurring revenues and
	to ultimately attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
	of this uncertainty.


	 


	The principal sources of liquidity are cash
	and cash equivalents, short-term investments, loans from shareholders, as well as the cash flows generated from our operations.


	 



	As of June 30,
	2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $60,260. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had cash and cash
	equivalents of approximately

	$

	482,421. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits
	in banks with maturities of three months or less, and all highly liquid investments which are unrestricted as to withdrawal or
	use, and which have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.



	 


	The Company believes that the receivables due
	from related parties will be collected in near future. Therefore, the cash and cash equivalents combined with proceeds that it
	expects to generate from operating activities are sufficient to meet anticipated working capital needs, commitments and capital
	expenditures over the next twelve months. It may, however, require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions
	and other future developments, or changes in general economic conditions.

	NOTE 3.      VARIABLE
	INTEREST ENTITIES



	 


	To satisfy PRC laws and regulations, the Company
	conducts certain business in the PRC through its VIEs.


	 


	The significant terms of the VIE Agreements
	are summarized below:


	 




	Exclusive Technical Consulting Service
	Agreement:


	During the term of this Agreement, Science & Technology Trading shall provide the following technical consulting
	services to Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian) in accordance with this Agreement: (i) Provision of advanced management
	skills to offer a framework for the construction of a new management platform; (ii) Provision of technology information and materials
	related to Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian)’s business development and operation. The content of the technology
	information and documents may be enhanced or diminished during the performance of this Agreement and upon mutual agreement to address
	each Party’s requirements; and (iii) Training of technical and managerial personnel for Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology
	(Dalian) and provision of required training documents. Science & Technology Trading will send technologists and managerial
	personnel to Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian) to provide related technology and training services as necessary.
	Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian) hereby agrees to accept the technical consulting services provided by Science
	& Technology Trading. Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian) further agrees that, during the term of this Agreement,
	it shall not accept technical consulting and services from any other party without the prior written consent of Science & Technology
	Trading. Science & Technology Trading shall be the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title and interests to any and all
	intellectual property rights arising from the performance of this Agreement, including but not limited to, copyrights, patent,
	know-how and commercial secrets, whether such intellectual property is developed by Science & Technology Trading or Dalian
	Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian).


	 




	Exclusive Equity Interest Purchase Agreement:


	Under the Exclusive Option Agreements entered into by and among Science & Technology Trading, each of the PRC Shareholders
	irrevocably granted to Science & Technology Trading the exclusive right to purchase or designate one or more persons to purchase
	all or any portion of the Equity Interest from the PRC Shareholders subject to compliance with legal restrictions under applicable
	PRC laws. The PRC Shareholders shall not sell or transfer all or any portion of the Equity Interest to any party other than Science
	& Technology Trading and/or the Specified Person.


	 




	Equity Interest Pledge Agreement:


	Under
	the Equity Pledge Agreements entered into by and among Science& Technology Trading, the PRC Operating Entities and each of
	the PRC Shareholders, the PRC Shareholders pledged all of their equity interests in the PRC Operating Entities as security to ensure
	that Science& Technology Trading collects the Consulting Fee under the Service Agreement. The Pledge shall be effective as
	of the date that the Pledge is recorded in the register of shareholders of Dalian Tianyi and Science & Technology (Dalian)
	and shall remain effective so long as this Agreement remains in effect. During the Term of the Pledge, Science& Technology
	Trading shall be entitled to foreclose on the Pledge in accordance with this Agreement in the event that Dalian Tianyi and Science
	& Technology (Dalian) fail to pay the Consulting Fees in accordance with the Service Agreement. Science& Technology Trading
	shall be entitled to exercise, dispose of or assign the Pledge in accordance with this Agreement.


	 




	Powers of Attorney:


	The PRC Shareholders
	have each executed an irrevocable power of attorney to appoint Science& Technology Trading as their sole representative with
	full authority to perform and exercise any and all shareholder’s rights associated with the Equity Interest, including but
	not limited to, the right to attend shareholders’ meetings, the right to execute shareholders’ resolutions, the right
	to sell, assign, transfer or pledge any or all of the Equity Interest and the right to vote the Equity Interest for all matters,
	including but not limited to, the appointment of legal representatives, board members, executive directors, inspectors, chief managers
	and other senior management officers and the submission of all the Company’s related documentations to the competent authorities.
	The term of each power of attorney is valid so long as such shareholder is a shareholder of the respective PRC Operating Entity.


	 






	 


	F-

	As a result of these VIE Agreements, the Company
	through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Science& Technology Trading, was granted with unconstrained decision making rights and
	power over key strategic and operational functions that would significantly impact the PRC Operating Entities or the VIEs’
	economic performance, which includes, but is not limited to, the development and execution of the overall business strategy; important
	and material decision making; decision making for merger and acquisition targets and execution of merger and acquisition plans;
	business partnership strategy development and execution; government liaison; operation management and review; and human resources
	recruitment and compensation and incentive strategy development and execution. Science& Technology Trading also provides comprehensive
	services to the VIEs for their daily operations, such as operational technical support, OA technical support, accounting support,
	general administration support and technical support for products and services. As a result of the Exclusive Business Cooperation
	Agreements, the Equity Pledge Agreements and the Exclusive Option Agreements, the Company will bear all of the VIEs’ operating
	costs in exchange for 100% of the net income of the VIEs. Under these agreements, the Company has the absolute and exclusive right
	to enjoy economic benefits similar to equity ownership through the VIE Agreements with our PRC Operating Entities and their shareholders.


	 


	These contractual arrangements may not be as
	effective in providing the Company with control over the VIEs as direct ownership. Due to its VIE structure, the Company has to
	rely on contractual rights to effect control and management of the VIEs, which exposes it to the risk of potential breach of contract
	by the shareholders of the VIEs for a number of reasons. For example, their interests as shareholders of the VIEs and the interests
	of the Company may conflict and the Company may fail to resolve such conflicts; the shareholders may believe that breaching the
	contracts will lead to greater economic benefit for them; or the shareholders may otherwise act in bad faith. If any of the foregoing
	were to happen, the Company may have to rely on legal or arbitral proceedings to enforce its contractual rights, including specific
	performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages. Such arbitral and legal proceedings may cost substantial financial and
	other resources, and result in a disruption of its business, and the Company cannot assure that the outcome will be in its favor.
	Apart from the above risks, there are no significant judgments or assumptions regarding enforceability of the contracts.


	 


	In addition, as all of these contractual arrangements
	are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through either arbitration or litigation in the PRC, they would
	be interpreted in accordance with PRC law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal
	environment in the PRC is not as developed as in other jurisdictions, such as the United States. As a result, uncertainties in
	the PRC legal system could further limit the Company’s ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. Furthermore, these
	contracts may not be enforceable in China if PRC government authorities or courts take a view that such contracts contravene PRC
	laws and regulations or are otherwise not enforceable for public policy reasons. In the event the Company is unable to enforce
	these contractual arrangements, it may not be able to exert effective control over the VIEs, and its ability to conduct its business
	may be materially and adversely affected.


	 


	The assets of the VIEs can be used to settle
	obligations of the consolidated entities. Conversely, liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these VIEs do not represent
	additional claims on the Company’s general assets.


	 






	 


	F-

	Most of our operations are conducted through
	our affiliated companies which the Company controls through contractual agreements in the form of VIEs. Current regulations in
	China permit our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to us only out of its accumulated distributable profits, if any, determined
	in accordance with their articles of association and PRC accounting standards and regulations. The ability of these Chinese affiliates
	to make dividends and other payments to us may be restricted by factors that include changes in applicable foreign exchange and
	other laws and regulations.


	 






	A.


	Under PRC law, our subsidiary may only pay dividends after 10% of its after-tax profits have been
	set aside as reserve funds, unless such reserves have reached at least 50% of its registered capital. Such cash reserve may not
	be distributed as cash dividends.




	 






	B.


	The PRC Income Tax Law also imposes a 10% withholding income tax on dividends generated on or after
	January 1, 2008 and distributed by a resident enterprise to its foreign investors, if such foreign investors are considered as
	non-resident enterprise without any establishment or place within China or if the received dividends have no connection with such
	foreign investors’ establishment or place within China, unless such foreign investors’ jurisdiction of incorporation
	has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement.




	 


	As of June 30, 2016, the Company has no plan
	for distribution of retained earnings.


	 


	The following financial statement amounts and
	balances of the VIEs were included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months and three
	months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:

	All of our current revenue is generated in
	PRC currency Renminbi (“RMB”). Any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use net revenues
	generated in RMB to make dividends or other payments in U.S. dollars or fund possible business activities outside China.


	 


	Foreign currency exchange regulation in China
	is primarily governed by the following rules:


	 







	¨




	Foreign Exchange Administration Rules
	(1996), as amended in August 2008, or the Exchange Rules;





	 







	¨

	Under the Administration Rules, RMB is freely
	convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service related foreign
	exchange transactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investments, loans, repatriation of investments and investments
	in securities outside of China, unless the prior approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”)
	is obtained and prior registration with the SAFE is made. Foreign-invested enterprises like ours that need foreign exchange for
	the distribution of profits to their shareholders may affect payment from their foreign exchange accounts or purchase and pay foreign
	exchange rates at the designated foreign exchange banks to their foreign shareholders by producing board resolutions for such profit
	distribution. Based on their needs, foreign-invested enterprises are permitted to open foreign exchange settlement accounts for
	current account receipts and payments of foreign exchange along with specialized accounts for capital account receipts and payments
	of foreign exchange at certain designated foreign exchange banks.


	 



	NOTE 4.      SUMMARIES
	OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 





	a.    Basis
	of preparation





	 


	The accompanying consolidated balance sheet
	as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited interim consolidated financial
	statements as of June 30, 2016 and for the six months and three months periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared
	pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information and
	footnote disclosures, which are normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
	accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although we believe that
	the disclosures made are adequate to provide for fair presentation. The interim financial information should be read in conjunction
	with the Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
	ended December 31, 2015, previously filed with the SEC.


	 


	In the opinion of management, all adjustments
	(which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair statement of the Company’s consolidated financial
	position as of June 30, 2016, its consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the six months and three months periods
	ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, as applicable, have been made. The interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of
	the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future periods.


	 



	b.    Principles
	of consolidation



	 


	The consolidated financial statements include
	the financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and VIEs. Upon consolidation, all balances and transactions
	between the Company and its subsidiaries and VIEs have been eliminated.


	 



	c.


	   Use of estimates



	 


	The preparation of consolidated financial statements
	in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
	liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
	of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at
	the time the estimates are made; however actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates
	and assumptions include valuation allowances for receivables and recoverability of carrying amount and the estimated useful lives
	of long-lived assets.


	 



	d.


	   Cash and cash equivalents



	 


	Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand,
	cash on deposit with various financial institutions in PRC and all highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three
	months or less at the time of purchase. Cash accounts are not insured or otherwise protected. Should any bank or trust company
	holding cash deposits become insolvent, or if the Company is otherwise unable to withdraw funds, the Company would lose the cash
	on deposits with that particular bank or other financial institutions.

	e.

	    

	Property
	and equipment



	 


	Property and equipment mainly comprise
	computer equipment, hardware and office furniture. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation with
	no residual value.


	 


	Depreciation for financial reporting purposes
	is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets:


	 





	Office and other equipment




	5 years





	 


	 





	Computers




	3 years





	 


	Depreciation expense is allocated among Research
	and development expenses, Selling and marketing expenses and General and administrative expenses.


	 


	When office equipment and electronic
	devices are retired or otherwise disposed of, resulting gain or loss is included in net income or loss in the year
	of disposition for the difference between the net book value and proceeds received thereon.  Maintenance and
	repairs which do not improve or extend the expected useful lives of the assets are charged to expenses as incurred.


	 



	f.

	     

	Impairment of long-lived assets



	 


	Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
	whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability
	of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted
	future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future
	undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its
	fair value. There were no impairment losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


	 



	g.

	   

	Revenue recognition



	 


	The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
	with ASC 605,

	Revenue Recognition

	. Revenues are recognized when the four of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive
	evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the service has been rendered, (iii) the fees are fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability
	is reasonably assured. The recognition of revenue involves certain management judgments. The amount and timing of our revenues
	could be materially different for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.


	 




	Online Membership Revenue




	 


	Online membership revenue includes revenue
	from members for brand advertising services as well as others services.


	 




	F-

	11

	 





	 




	  


	The Company has the arrangements with nonrefundable
	up-front fees model (“the Model”) to recognize revenue for the online membership business. We apply the Model, where
	a contract is signed to establish a fixed price for our services to be provided for a period of time as a membership enrollment,
	for a majority of our online membership revenue. Revenue is recognized ratably over the membership periods on a straight line basis,
	unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern, over the contractual term
	of the arrangement or the expected period during which those specified services will be performed, whichever is longer. The Company
	provides advertisement placements to our advertising customers on our different Website channels and in different formats, which
	can include, among other things, banners, links, logos, buttons, rich media, pre-roll and post-roll video screens, pause video
	screens and content integration, as specified in the contracts with the members. The members can choose various on line services
	from the membership contracts based on their yearly membership.


	 


	The Company recognizes revenue when all
	revenue recognition criteria are met.


	 



	h.

	    

	Related
	parties



	 


	A party is considered to be related to
	the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under
	common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate
	families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls
	or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties
	might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or
	operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly
	influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate
	interests is also a related party.

	Earnings
	(loss) per share



	 


	Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed
	by dividing income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for all periods.
	Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number
	of shares outstanding, increased by common stock equivalents. Common stock equivalents represent incremental shares issuable upon
	exercise of outstanding warrants. However, potential common shares are not included in the denominator of the diluted loss per
	share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which a net loss is recorded.

	Foreign
	currency transactions and translations



	 


	An entity’s functional currency is
	the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates, normally that is the currency of the environment in which
	the entity primarily generates and expends cash. Management’s judgment is essential to determine the functional currency
	by assessing various indicators, such as cash flows, sales price and market, expenses, financing and inter-company transactions
	and arrangements. The reporting currency of the Company is United States dollars (“U.S. dollars” or “$”),
	and the functional currency of HK Science & Technology is Hong Kong dollars (“HK dollar”). The functional currency
	of the Company’s PRC subsidiary and VIEs is the RMB, and PRC is the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.
	The reporting currency of these consolidated financial statements is U.S. dollars.


	 


	For financial reporting purposes, the financial
	statements of the Company’s PRC subsidiary and VIEs, which are prepared using the RMB, are translated into the Company’s
	reporting currency, U.S. dollars. The financial statements of HK Science & Technology, which are prepared using the HK dollar,
	are translated into the Company’s reporting currency, U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange
	rate at each balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated using average rates prevailing during each reporting period,
	and shareholders' equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as
	a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in owners’ equity.


	 


	Transactions denominated in currencies
	other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of
	the transactions. The resulting exchange differences are included in the determination of net income (loss) of the consolidated
	financial statements for the respective periods.


	 


	The exchange rates used for foreign currency
	translation were as follows:

	Fair
	Value Measurements



	 


	The Company applies
	the provisions of ASC Subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements, for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities
	and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements.
	ASC 820 also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.


	 


	Fair value is
	defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
	market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or
	permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact
	and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.


	 


	ASC 820 establishes
	a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs
	when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives
	the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and
	the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair
	value hierarchy are as follows:


	 







	¨




	Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology
	are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.





	 







	¨




	Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology
	include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability,
	either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.





	 







	¨




	Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology
	are unobservable and significant to the fair value.





	 


	There were no transfers between level 1,
	level 2 or level 3 measurements for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.


	 


	As of June 30, 2016 the Company used Level
	3 to measure the fair value of the shares that the Company issued to employees and part-time consultants for the service rendered.
	As the Company’s shares were still not active on OTCBB, no quoted price for those shares. 


	 


	The carrying values of the Company’s
	financial assets and liabilities, including accounts receivables, other current assets, and accrued expenses and other current
	liabilities, are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments
	and their expected realization and if applicable, their stated interest rate approximates current rates available.


	 



	l.

	     

	Share-Based
	Compensation




	 



	Pursuant to ASC Topic 718,

	Compensation
	- Stock Compensation

	, the Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of stock-based compensation
	based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The cost is recognized over the requisite service period, except for awards granted
	to employees for past services, which are fully expensed by the grant date.

	Recently
	adopted accounting pronouncements



	 


	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
	Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue
	arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU
	2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. The amendment in this update defers
	the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption
	is permitted as of the original effective date, interim and annual reporting periods after December 15, 2016. Entities have the
	option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt ASU 2014-09. In April and May 2016, the
	FASB issued ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. These new standards will identify performance obligations.
	The Company is currently evaluating the effect of these new standards, including the transition method, to determine the impact
	on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or related disclosures.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
	Leases (Topic 842), aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable. The new standard requires substantially
	all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including
	today’s operating leases. For public business entities, the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
	15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the standard is effective for fiscal years
	beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early application
	is permitted for all entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated
	financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.


	 


	In March, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
	"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." This update was issued as part of a simplification effort
	for the accounting of share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either
	equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning
	after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
	of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.


	 


	We do not believe other recently issued
	but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the consolidated financial position,
	statements of operations and cash flows.


	 



	NOTE 5.          EARNINGS
	PER SHARE



	 


	The FASB’s accounting standard for
	earnings per share requires presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share in conjunction with the disclosure of the methodology
	used in computing such earnings per share. Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available
	to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share takes into
	account the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted
	into common stock. The Company has no potential dilutive securities as of June 30, 2016.


	 


	The following is a reconciliation of the
	basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:

	NOTE 6.         CONCENTRATION
	OF RISK



	 




	Credit risk




	 


	Financial instruments that potentially
	expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and related parties receivables.


	 


	The Company places its cash and cash equivalents
	with financial institutions, which management believes are of high-credit ratings and quality.


	 


	The related parties’ receivables
	are regularly monitored and an impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date based on the payment history and financial
	position of related parties.


	 


	The Company conducts credit evaluations
	of customers and generally does not require collateral or other security from its customers. The Company establishes an allowance

	Science & Technology Trading and our

	Realization of the net deferred tax assets
	is dependent on factors including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and adequate future taxable income,
	exclusive of reversing deductible temporary differences and tax loss or credit carry forwards. The Company evaluates the potential
	realization of deferred tax assets on an entity-by-entity basis. As of June 30, 2016, valuation allowances were provided against
	deferred tax assets in entities where it was determined it was more likely than not that the benefits of the deferred tax assets
	will not be realized. The Company had deferred tax assets which consisted of tax loss carry-forwards, which can be carried forward
	to offset future taxable income for five years from the year the loss occurred. The management determines it is more likely than
	not that these deferred tax assets could not be recognized, so full allowances were provided as of June 30, 2016 and December 31,
	2015.


	  




	B)    Value
	Added Tax and relevant surcharge




	 


	Revenue of our membership and advertising
	planning services are subject to 6% value added tax (“VAT”) and 0.72% total surcharge of the gross service income for
	the business incurred on and after November 1,2013. 


	 


	The Company pays the VAT when the invoices
	are issued to customers and estimates the income tax as the full received amounts had been recognized as revenue.

	NOTE
	13.       STATUTORY RESERVES



	 


	As stipulated by the laws and regulations
	for enterprises operating in PRC, the subsidiaries of the Company are required to make annual appropriations to a statutory surplus
	reserve fund. Specifically, the subsidiaries of the Company are required to allocate 10% of their profits after taxes, as determined
	in accordance with the PRC accounting standards applicable to the subsidiaries of the Company, to a statutory surplus reserve until
	such reserve reaches 50% of the registered capital of the subsidiaries of the Company. The Company can use the statutory surplus
	reserve to offset deficits, expand its plant or increase capital when and only when the reserve balance exceeds 50% of the registered
	capital, and the amount capitalized should be limited to 50% of the statutory surplus reserve. The Company appropriated statutory
	surplus of $2,576 and $0 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.


	 



	NOTE 14.       SHARES
	GRANTED AND ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES



	 


	On February 10, 2015, the Company determined
	to grant equity awards of 429,200 shares to 2 part-time consultants and 46 employees for the services rendered. The total fair
	value of these shares at the date of grant was estimated to be $21,224.


	 


	On November 27, 2015, the Company determined
	to grant equity awards of 75,000 shares to one part-time consultant for the services rendered. The total fair value of these shares
	at the date of grant was estimated to be $3,709.


	 


	On April 19, 2016, the Company grants equity
	awards of shares of common stock to employees for the services rendered. The total fair value of these shares at the date of grant
	was $7,467.


	 


	The fair value of the shares granted was
	$0.04945 per share calculated through the application of an income approach to evaluate the future value of the operation into
	a present market value. This method eliminates the discrepancy in time value of money by using a discount rate to reflect all business
	risks including intrinsic and extrinsic uncertainties in relation to the operation.


	 


	Major assumptions used for measuring the
	fair value as follow:


	 






	•


	It is assumed that there will be no material change in the existing political, legal, technological,
	fiscal or economic condition which may adversely affect the business of the Company;




	 






	•


	The Company will adhere to the terms that bond with the contracts and agreements;




	 






	•


	The Company’s competitive advantages and disadvantages will not change significantly during
	the period.

	Item 2. Management’s
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.




	 




	This quarterly report on Form
	10-Q and other reports filed by China Network Media, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”)
	from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) contain or may contain forward-looking
	statements (collectively the “Filings”) and information that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available
	to, the Company’s management as well as estimates and assumptions made by Company’s management. Readers are cautioned
	not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof.
	When used in the filings, the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,”
	“future,” “intend,” “plan,” or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they
	relate to the Company or the Company’s management identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current
	view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors. Should
	one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may
	differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned.




	 




	Although the Company believes
	that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future results,
	levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United
	States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.




	 




	Our financial statements are
	prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). These accounting
	principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions
	upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments, and assumptions
	are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date
	of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our financial
	statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. In many cases,
	the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment
	in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not
	produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements
	and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.

	4%. The increases were mainly due to an increase of share base payment of $7,467 and a $2,804 increase in miscellaneous fee.


	 




	Income from Operations




	 


	As a result of the foregoing, our

	Net Income




	 


	For the six months ended June 30,
	2016, we had net income of $58,795, compared to $287,873 for the six months ended June 30, 2015.


	 



	Going Concern



	 


	The accompanying unaudited consolidated
	financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company currently has limited
	revenue and has accumulated deficit of $987,599 and $1,023,818 as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and net income of 58,795
	and $287,873 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the
	Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans to fund continuing operations through new financing from
	related parties and equity financing arrangements. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability
	to meet its obligations, to obtain additional financing as may be required until 2016 when it can generate sources of recurring
	revenues and to ultimately attain profitability. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
	the outcome of this uncertainty.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	Our principal sources of liquidity
	are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, loans from shareholders, as well as the cash flows generated from our operations.


	 



	As
	of June 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $60,260. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had
	cash and cash equivalents of approximately

	$

	482,421. Cash and cash equivalents include cash
	on hand, deposits in banks with maturities of three months or less, and all highly liquid investments which are unrestricted as
	to withdrawal or use, and which have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.



	 


	The Company believes that the receivables
	due from related parties will be collected in near future. Therefore, the cash and cash equivalents combined with proceeds that
	it expects to generate from operating activities are sufficient to meet anticipated working capital needs, commitments and capital
	expenditures over the next twelve months. It may, however, require additional cash resources due to changes in business conditions
	and other future developments, or changes in general economic conditions.


	 




	Cash Generating Ability




	 


	We believe that we will generate
	cash flows from our membership business and other business, which, along with our available cash, will provide sufficient liquidity
	and financial flexibility.


	 


	Our cash flows were summarized below:

	Critical Accounting Policies
	and Management Estimates



	 


	Our discussion and analysis of our
	financial condition and results of operations relates to our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of these
	financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
	and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based
	on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
	of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
	from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the consolidation,
	revenue recognition, income taxes and uncertain tax positions, computation of net loss per share, determination of net accounts
	receivable, and determination of functional currencies represent critical accounting policies that reflect the more significant
	judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.


	 




	Principles of consolidation




	 


	The consolidated financial statements
	include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and VIEs. Upon consolidation, all balances and
	transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and VIEs have been eliminated.


	 




	Use of estimates




	 


	The preparation of consolidated
	financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
	that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
	financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management makes these estimates
	using the best information available at the time the estimates are made; however actual results could differ from those estimates.
	Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include valuation allowances for receivables and recoverability of
	carrying amount and the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets.

	Revenue Recognition




	 


	The Company recognizes revenue in
	accordance with ASC 605,

	Revenue Recognition

	. Revenues are recognized when the four of the following criteria are met: (i)
	persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the service has been rendered, (iii) the fees are fixed or determinable, and
	(iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The recognition of revenue involves certain management judgments. The amount and timing
	of our revenues could be materially different for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.


	 



	Online Membership Revenue



	 


	Online membership revenue includes
	revenue from members for brand advertising services as well as others services.


	 


	The Company has the arrangements
	with nonrefundable up-front fees model (“the Model”) to recognize revenue for the online membership business. We apply
	the Model, where a contract is signed to establish a fixed price for our services to be provided for a period of time as a membership
	enrollment, for a majority of our online membership revenue. Revenue is recognized ratably over the membership periods on a straight
	line basis, unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern, over the contractual
	term of the arrangement or the expected period during which those specified services will be performed, whichever is longer. We
	provide advertisement placements to our advertising customers on our different Website channels and in different formats, which
	can include, among other things, banners, links, logos, buttons, rich media, pre-roll and post-roll video screens, pause video
	screens and content integration, as specified in the contracts with the members. The members can choose various on line services
	from the membership contracts based on their yearly membership.


	 


	The Company recognizes revenue when
	all revenue recognition criteria are met. 


	 



	Others Revenues



	 


	Other revenues are primarily generated
	from online advertisement planning services which introduce our customer’s profile, product, and awareness promotion for
	their executive officers to build a better brand name for non-member companies. We follow the guidance of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission’s FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 605 for revenue recognition for others revenues. The Company recognize
	others revenue when they are realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned
	when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement that the services have been rendered to the customer, the sales price is fixed
	or determinable, the services are rendered and collectability is reasonably assured.


	  




	Income Taxes and Uncertain
	Tax Positions




	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company follows ASC 740,

	Income
	Taxes

	, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events
	that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for
	the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting
	amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates, applicable to the periods in which the differences
	are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the
	amount expected to be realized.


	 


	The Company adopted ASC 740-10-25,
	which provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax position. The Company must
	recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained
	on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial
	statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized
	upon ultimate resolution. Our estimated liability for unrecognized tax benefits, may be affected by changing interpretations of
	laws, rulings by tax authorities, changes and/or developments with respect to tax audits, and expiration of the statute of limitations.
	The outcome for a particular audit cannot be determined with certainty prior to the conclusion of the audit and, in some cases,
	appeal or litigation process. The actual benefits ultimately realized may differ from our estimates. As each audit is concluded,
	adjustments, if any, are recorded in our financial statements. Additionally, in future periods, changes in facts, circumstances,
	and new information may require us to adjust the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions.
	Changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recognized in the period in which the changes occur. The Company has elected
	to classify interest and penalties related to an uncertain tax position, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in
	the combined statements of operations. The Company did not recognize any additional liabilities for uncertain tax positions as
	a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10-25.

	Property and equipment




	 


	Property and equipment mainly comprise
	computer equipment, hardware and office furniture. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation with
	no residual value.


	 


	Depreciation for financial reporting
	purposes is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets:


	 





	Office and other equipment




	5 years





	 


	 





	Computers




	3 years





	 


	Depreciation expense is allocated
	among Research and development expenses, Selling and marketing expenses and General and administrative expenses.


	 


	When office equipment and
	electronic devices are retired or otherwise disposed of, resulting gain or loss is included in net income or loss
	in the year of disposition for the difference between the net book value and proceeds received thereon.  Maintenance and
	repairs which do not improve or extend the expected useful lives of the assets are charged to expenses as incurred.


	 




	Foreign currency transactions
	and translations




	 


	An entity’s functional currency
	is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates, normally that is the currency of the environment in which
	the entity primarily generates and expends cash. Management’s judgment is essential to determine the functional currency
	by assessing various indicators, such as cash flows, sales price and market, expenses, financing and inter-company transactions
	and arrangements. The reporting currency of the Company is U. S. dollars (“U.S. dollars” or “$”), and the
	functional currency of HK Science & Technology is Hong Kong dollars (“HK dollar”).  The functional currency
	of the Company’s PRC subsidiary and VIEs is the Renminbi (“RMB’), and PRC is the primary economic environment
	in which the Company operates. The reporting currency of these consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollars.


	 


	For financial reporting purposes,
	the financial statements of the Company’s PRC subsidiary and VIEs, which are prepared using the RMB, are translated into
	the Company’s reporting currency, the U. S. dollars. The financial statements of HK Science & Technology, which are prepared
	using the HK dollar, are translated into the Company’s reporting currency, the U. S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are
	translated using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date.  Revenue and expenses are translated using average rates
	prevailing during each reporting period, and shareholders' equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Adjustments
	resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in owners’ equity.


	 


	Transactions denominated in currencies
	other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of
	the transactions.  The resulting exchange differences are included in the determination of net income (loss) of the consolidated
	financial statements for the respective periods.


	 


	The exchange rates used for foreign
	currency translation were as follows:

	As of June 30, 2016 and December
	31, 2015, we had lease agreements for the principal offices with commitment amount of $52,124 and $17,121, respectively. The unpaid
	contract amount is expected to be paid in one year. We have not entered into any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee
	the payment obligations of third parties. We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and
	classified as shareholder’s equity, or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do
	not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity
	or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing,
	liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or that engages in leasing, hedging or product development services with us.


	 



	Impact of Recently Issued Accounting
	Standards



	 


	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU
	No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting
	for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance. In August 2015, the FASB
	issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. The amendment in this update
	defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early
	adoption is permitted as of the original effective date, interim and annual reporting periods after December 15, 2016. Entities
	have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt ASU 2014-09. In April and May
	2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. These new standards
	will identify performance obligations. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of these new standards, including the transition
	method, to determine the impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or related
	disclosures.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued
	ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable. The new standard requires
	substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability,
	including today’s operating leases. For public business entities, the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
	December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the standard is effective for fiscal
	years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early application
	is permitted for all entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated
	financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.


	 







	13

	 







	 




	 


	In March, 2016, the FASB issued
	ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." This update was issued as part of a simplification
	effort for the accounting of share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards
	as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendment is effective for annual periods
	beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
	the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, financial condition
	and cash flows.


	 


	We do not believe other recently
	issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the consolidated financial
	position, statements of operations and cash flows.

	Controls and Procedures.







	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
	and Procedures




	 



	Our management, including our Chief
	Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
	and procedures as of June 30, 2016.


	 


	Disclosure controls and procedures
	refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit
	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and
	reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated
	to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
	regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any
	controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
	control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.


	 


	Management conducted its evaluation
	of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on
	that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, because of the material weakness in internal
	control over financial reporting, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2016.



	 



	Our management has identified the
	following steps to address the above material weakness:


	 


	(1) We have engaged a financial
	accountant to assist us in preparing our financial statements in accordance with US GAAP standards and SEC rules and regulations.


	 


	(2) We intend to hire, as needed,
	key accounting personnel with technical accounting expertise and reorganize the finance department to ensure that accounting personnel
	with adequate experience, skills and knowledge relating to complex, non-routine transactions are directly involved in the review
	and accounting evaluation of our complex, non-routine transactions.


	 



	Changes in Internal Controls
	over Financial Reporting




	 



	There has been no change in our
	internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
	that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Despite a slowdown in economic growth and uncertainty about US policy, the outlook for Chinese businesses remains positive, according to Kate Richdale, co-head of the Asia Ex-Japan Investment Banking Division at Goldman Sachs. Richdale explains that Chinese corporations are strategically navigating China’s economic headwinds to stay strong, in part by raising debt offshore and deploying cross-border M&A strategies.

Chinese corporations remain extremely strong. Operationally their businesses are going well…. For our clients, they see this as very much related to what they’re doing from an M&A perspective. A lot of them have business rationale for going overseas, acquiring entities overseas, and the ability to raise debt offshore is very, very important.
 - Kate Richdale

 As China shifts to a consumption-led economy, the government has signaled a long-term commitment to environmental reform, both through its leading role at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris and by making clean energy financing a key part of the agenda at the 2016 G20 Summit. Mark Schwartz, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia Pacific, discusses how China’s green initiatives align with its broader economic transition.

 Our Thinking 
 Macroeconomic Insights 
 China in Transition 








 The Rise of China's new consumer class 
Across Asia, rising incomes are creating an enormous new class of consumers. Much of that growth is coming from China, whose working population is larger than those of the US and Europe combined. As more Chinese consumers gain purchasing power, their needs and preferences will have a powerful effect on the global economy.

Who are they?
中国主流消费者
Today’s China consumer market is dominated by a relatively narrow middle class. Less than 2% of workers earn enough even to pay income tax. So what the world has seen so far is only a preview of the opportunities to come.

Four Tiers of Consumers 
 The “average Chinese consumer” does not exist. China’s consumers can be divided into four tiers. Future growth will come from two key groups—the white-collar “Urban Middle”, and the blue-collar “Urban Mass”. 
Next

 



Movers & Shakers
 China’s wealthiest citizens already make up a large part of global demand for high-end goods. Their spending patterns will continue to influence trends as the country grows. 


Population
1.4 Million


Annual Income per Capita
US $500,000



 



Urban Middle
 This is China’s narrow middle class. Nearly half of them are on the public payroll, so policies to increase income will have a strong effect here. 


Population
146 Million


Annual Income per Capita
US $11,733



 



Urban Mass
 This group—blue-collar workers and migrant workers who have moved to cities to find better-paying jobs—is expected to see the biggest rise in income. This will allow them to broaden their spending beyond consumer staples. 


Population
236 Million


Annual Income per Capita
US $5,858



 



Rural Workers
 Half of China’s workers still live in rural areas. With lower incomes and fewer available jobs, their spending is concentrated on essentials such as food and housing. 


Population
387 Million


Annual Income per Capita
US $2000

what do they want?
他们的消费模式
Food and clothing account for nearly half of all personal spending in China. As disposable incomes rise, those consumption patterns are going to change. But affordability will still be an issue, especially for the Urban Mass.

Seven Consumer Desires
Chinese consumer spending can be broken down into seven categories.
The Seven Key Consumer Desires

衣Looking more beautiful
食Eating better
住Better home
行More mobility/connectivity
娱Having  more fun
康Well-being(health/education)
奢Luxury



A Look Ahead?
Comparing China’s consumption patterns with those of the US shows how as incomes rise, spending will shift from necessities to discretionary items.

What do they want?
Fun
娱乐
Spending on recreational activities—including travel, dining out, sports and gaming—is much lower in China than it is in other countries. That gap means that as incomes rise, this category could see the biggest growth.

Dining Out: Cost is Key
Most food spending is for meals eaten at home. For the young Urban Mass who eat out, affordability is a prime consideration according to a 2014 Peking University survey.

Travel: Already Growing
Although approximately only 3% of Chinese have passports, travel is booming. But affordability is still an issue: the Urban Middle takes more trips abroad, while the Urban Mass stays closer to home.

What do they want?
Technology & Media
科技与媒体
The perpetually falling costs of electronics, combined with the growth of “fun” activities such as movies and online gaming, are fueling significant growth opportunities in technology and media.


Explosive Growth

Gaming Is Big, Movies Are Growing
Low costs have made online games the biggest component of media spending. But movies are showing rapid growth as affordability improves.

Smartphones: Data Primed for Growth
Low handset prices have increased China’s smartphone penetration to 62%. But high costs are keeping data usage low. This should change as affordability improves.

What do they want?
Well-Being
身心康健
As they move beyond the basics, China’s consumers will be looking to their futures: health and wellness and their families’ education. These concerns are especially important for a country with an aging population.

Healthcare: Controlling Costs 
The government has increased healthcare spending in the past decade, with subsidies to help contain the growth in out-of-pocket costs.

Focusing on the Children
China’s one-child policy means that most families have six adults saving for one child. That’s fueling growth in education, housing and other sectors.

 Going to School  (test prep + vocational training) 
 Getting Married  (gold jewelry + diamond) 
 Buying a Home  (down payment) 
 A New Baby Born  (diapers + infant formula) 










What do they want?
E-commerce
电子商务
Brick-and-mortar commerce in China is still relatively underdeveloped. And low car ownership limits shoppers’ mobility. But with widely available mobile internet, low shipping costs and a flood of cheap unbranded products sold online, conditions are right for e-commerce to take off.

The Growth Has Begun
China’s explosive growth in shipping is an indication that e-commerce is already expanding—and has potential to grow even further.
Shipping grew 10x from 2006 to 2014


 2006 1 billion packages delivered 

 2014 10 billion packages delivered

The Takeaway
总结
 The Chinese consumer market has seen enormous growth—and only 11% of the population has reached the middle class. As their ranks swell, so will their effect on the global economy. There will be huge opportunities for the entertainment, food service, technology and other industries. But to take advantage of them, businesses will need to understand China’s Urban Mass and Urban Middle, and align pricing, offerings and other practices to the groups’ specific needs.

Buyer's Feedback


Easy Sourcing helps me trade easily!
As a new member to Made-in-China.com, I posted my first request on Easy Sourcing one month ago. Fortunately, I received the first quality quotation from supplier - Changzhou Ji****Co., Ltd. within 2 hours after submission! Finally I ordered Electronic Transformer from the supplier. In the past I had to spend several days to find a satisfied supplier. Now, I only need a few hours!

I have found several qualified suppliers through Easy Sourcing!
I have been a premium buyer with Made-in-China.com for many years. Since the first time posting sourcing request on Easy Sourcing, I have found several reliable suppliers, it's convenient for me to receive rapid quotations and compare the suppliers. Easy Sourcing has provided tremendous value to me. Now it's my favorite way to find Chinese suppliers.
