Airborne Wireless Network
                is poised to create the future of airborne connectivity.
                The Network was conceived almost twenty years ago at a time
                when fast Internet was a luxury only few could afford.

                The Network was conceived by a forward-thinking
                entrepreneur, who had the vision of creating a
                global, "Data-pipeline", or "Airborne Digital Superhighway"
                providing worldwide broadband connectivity
                using commercial aircraft.

 

Airborne Wireless Network
                For its Wholesale Carrier Network,
                AWN intends to use commercial aircraft as "mini-satellites".
                The Network is configured with robust meshed-redundancy.

                The two most significant advantages over traditional single-link
                satellite / cell-tower-based technologies are:

                1. Greater throughput
                2. Nearly 100% real-time (not store and forward)
              














Wholesale Carrier Network
For its Wholesale Carrier Network, AWN intends to use commercial aircraft as “mini-satellites”. The company’s primary target customer-base will be worldwide data and communications service providers. 









AWN's primary advantages






  
Global Service
Upon successful development, AWN’s Wholesale Carrier Network would be the first and only true airborne broadband pipeline, providing connectivity for worldwide broadband carrier services using commercial aircraft.






  
Patented Technology
In 1998, during the pioneering days of wireless data-connectivity, the Network's inventor submitted a patent application to the US patent and trademark office, and on September 4, 2001, US patent number US 6,285,878 B1 was granted. A few days later, an event occurred, which changed the airline industry and which would delay development of this disruptive technology for a number of years. In 2016, AWN acquired this patent and intends to further develop and deploy this technology








  
Advanced Wireless Technology
When AWN’s patent was granted, the wireless (radio) technology to enable implementation of the network did not exist in the commercial realm.  Hence, “in-house development” or prohibitively expensive advanced military communication-equipment were the only options.  Today much of what is required is readily available. The equipment just needs to be packaged “purpose-specific”, to comply with FAA and FCC regulations.






  
A virtual airborne “worldwide web”
Because it is a meshed network, it is like a web where all nodes are connected via multiple links. With traditional “single link-systems”, such as most cell-tower and satellite systems. There are no single points of failure (there is nearly always another aircraft, ship or earth-station within range of an aircraft).








  
Real-time performance - not “store and forward”
Nearly 100% real-time (not store and forward). Traditional technologies suffer from “single points of failure”. In AWN's Network if a link is interrupted, the signal is redirected to the next participating aircraft, ship, or earth-station in the chain. AWN’s system is designed with the security of meshed, redundant data-paths.






  
Easy to update, upgrade or servicing
As new software becomes available, the system can be easily updated.  When new and more efficient data-transmission technologies emerge, upgrading AWN’s system can be as easy as replacing a single module, and the system is ready for “the future”. The Network is never obsolete.  Satellite technology, on the other hand, in most cases, has already been surpassed by the time a satellite is launched.  These cannot be upgraded or serviced once launched.








  
No Space Junk
Unlike satellites, which can be disabled or knocked out of orbit by space-junk, AWN’s system operates in a safe and controlled environment, typically between 20,000 and 40,000 feet (6,000-12,000 m). Space junk has been known to cause serious damage to commercial and military satellites. The proposed launch of thousands more satellites translates to huge amounts of additional space-junk. Scientists estimate that by 2025 over 2 billion pieces of manmade space junk could be orbiting the earth, jeopardizing the future manned space travel.

Space Junk – Critical Density (article)

















Summary of core AWN features
Airborne Wireless Network is developing a fully meshed network, while current technologies only allow for a “single path” solution.
What is the difference between single path and fully meshed networks?












  
Multiple Paths
In a single-path network, there is only one way (path) a signal reaches an aircraft. If this path is interrupted, the system fails. To illustrate this, imagine a single road between the East and West Coasts. If one of the bridges is washed out, one would not be able to reach his/her destination until it was repaired





  
Meshed Network
In a fully meshed network, signals come in from multiple directions. The system will route signals around any “obstructions” and “real-time connectivity” is maintained. In layman’s terms, because we have a choice of many highways between the coasts, we can drive around the washed out bridge and reach our destination.





  
No Single Point Of Failure
Besides mechanical problems which constitute “single points of failure”, Satellites (in aeronautical applications more likely their up-links, than their down-links), and fixed-point ground stations can be affected by heavy rain. The “right size” rain-drops can completely absorb or block a radio signal. The Network dynamically assigns a path around the “obstructions”, providing a solid path, regardless of the presence of weather systems.

TDT's mission is to bring new ideas and cutting-edge technologies to the world market to create revolutionary new products and services. 
About Airborne Wireless Network 
The Company intends to create a high-speed broadband airborne wireless network by linking commercial aircraft in flight.  It is projected that each aircraft participating in the network will act as an airborne repeater or router, sending and receiving broadband signals from one aircraft to the next and creating a digital information superhighway in the sky.   The Company intends the network to be a high-speed broadband internet pipeline to improve coverage and connectivity.  The Company does not intend to provide retail customer coverage to end users, but, instead, act as a wholesale carrier with target customers, such as internet service providers and telephone companies.
Currently, the world's connectivity is achieved by use of undersea cables, ground based fiber and satellites. The Company believes that the Company's airborne digital highway may be a solution to fill the world's connectivity void.  Once the network is developed and fully implemented, its uses may be limitless.  The Company's network, once developed, should provide low cost, high-speed connectivity to rural areas, island nations, ships at sea, oil platforms, in addition to connectivity to commercial and private aircraft in flight.

AIRBORNE WIRELESS NETWORK FILES FAA CERTIFICATION APPLICATION FOR ITS INFINITUS 
AIRBORNE BROADBAND DIGITAL SUPERHIGHWAY   
 

SIMI VALLEY, CA - October 31, 2016 / Airborne Wireless Network (OTCQB:
ABWN), is pleased 
to announce that on October 28, 2016 it submitted its application and related 
documentation with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for initial 
certification. The application outlines a civilian air-to-air communication 
system, a first of its kind.

The company’s application cover letter states “Airborne Wireless Network is 
making application for a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) for a broadband 
transceiver system to be installed in Boeing 757-200 aircraft. This new patented 
broadband system will provide light weight, low power, low cost, microwave relay 
stations on equipped aircraft. The new system provides a chain of airborne 
repeaters providing communications along the entire flight paths. The purpose of 
the new project is to replace low-earth orbit (LEO) communication satellites 
with broadband wireless communications networks linking aircraft to aircraft and 
ground stations”.

This FAA application is significant as the company intends to expand on this 
initial certification program to include multiple aircraft types, including all 
major airframes actively flying in the worlds airline fleets.
Since our system is to be deployed on existing commercial aircraft, and not on 
unmanned platforms, there are no limitations on flights over populated areas, 
making it the most affordable and practical way to achieve future global 
connectivity. 

This initial FAA certification has been submitted on a non-interfering basis; 
meaning that the system will not interfere with existing onboard aircraft 
systems. Looking to the future, the company intends to cross into the cockpit 
and provide essential services with true broadband data to the flight crews, the 
FAA, and airlines. This would enable unprecedented aircraft location services as 
well as other aviation safety applications independent of satellite coverage.

AIRBORNE WIRELESS NETWORK (OTCQB: ABWN) 
APPOINTS MARIUS DE MOS VP OF TECHNICAL AFFAIRS AND DEVELOPMENT  
 

SIMI VALLEY, CA - August 25, 2016 / Airborne Wireless Network (OTCQB:
ABWN), is pleased 
to announce the appointment of airborne wireless communications pioneer Marius 
de Mos as its Vice President of Technical Affairs and Development. 

On August 19, 2016, the Company and Mr. de Mos entered into a written Employment 
Agreement, pursuant to which Mr. de Mos will serve as the Company’s Vice 
President of Technical Affairs and Development.

Mr. de Mos past experience makes him one of the first pioneers of today’s 
airborne in-cabin radio systems, which paved the way for wireless inflight 
entertainment, Wi-Fi systems and the use of cellular technology in flight.

Mr. de Mos has been involved since the conceptual stages of the Company’s patent 
and its airborne meshed network. He was approached by the patent’s inventor to 
evaluate the concept and assist in diminishing any conceptual problems. Airborne 
Wireless Network believes Mr. de Mos is a valuable asset crucial to the 
development of the world’s first airborne digital highway. 

Mr. de Mos has an extensive background in worldwide telecommunications, ranging 
from the development and commissioning of long and short-range terrestrial 
systems, to satellite and cutting-edge airborne technologies. Many of these 
systems were installed globally and are/were owned and/or managed by local or 
central governments and well-known companies such as GTE, Verizon, Motorola, 
AT&T, UK-based Cable and Wireless and others. 

Although Mr. de Mos’ college major was aeronautical electronic systems, his 
first “true aeronautical project” was his involvement in the development of the 
world’s first wireless airborne public telephone, “Airfone.” Before the FAA’s 
certification of Airfone, transmitting radio frequencies inside of an airborne 
aircraft was considered “dangerous” and, “for safety’s sake,” was prohibited.

Airborne Wireless Network Retains FAA 
Consultant, C. Neal Monte, as it Prepares for FAA Certification 
 

SIMI VALLEY, CA - August, 2016 / Airborne Wireless Network (OTCQB:
ABWN), a Nevada 
corporation (the "Company"), is pleased to announce that it has retained C. Neal 
Monte, as its lead FAA Designated Engineering Representative.
As one of the most experienced and well respected experts in the industry, Mr. 
Monte's background includes work with airframe manufacturers such as Boeing, 
McDonnel Douglass, and Airbus Industries. Mr. Monte will be spearheading the FAA 
certification process for the Company's, "Airborne Digital Super Highway." Mr. 
Monte holds numerous FAA qualifications and during his career has obtained just 
under 250 supplemental type certificates and parts manufacturing approvals.
The Company intends to achieve FAA certification of its Airborne Digital Super 
Highway system on a non-interfering basis, meaning that system will not 
interfere with critical onboard aircraft systems. Once successful certification 
is achieved, that system will be poised to become the world's first civilian 
"Air to Air High-Speed Broadband Digital Super Highway" utilizing commercial 
aircraft in flight as its platform.

A major milestone for the Company, the initial FAA certification will allow the 
Company's Airborne Digital Super Highway system to be placed on commercial 
aircraft of a type approved on the supplemental type certificate. The Company 
intends to expand on this initial certification to include approvals for 
additional aircraft types. This will enable the Company to begin assembling its 
Airborne Digital Super Highway one aircraft type approval, or supplemental type 
certificate, at a time. The Company intends to establish relationships with 
airlines and aircraft operators. With each, a reliable, redundant, more robust 
communications network will be developed. Using commercial aircraft as signal 
repeaters, or routers, is the most practical, efficient, and cost effective 
solution to achieve true high speed connectivity. Current proposals, as well as 
most in design, are repeats of high cost, inefficient, older technologies such 
as satellites and ground based infrastructures.

Airborne Wireless Network Completes Asset 
Acquisition 
 

SIMI VALLEY, CA - August, 2016 / Airborne Wireless Network (OTCQB:
ABWN), is pleased 
to announce that it has completed its acquisition of Patent Number US 6,285,878 
B1 and the Trademark "INFINITUS SUPER HIGHWAY". These acquired assets serve as a 
blueprint and road map for the company to develop its "Airborne Wireless 
Network". The company intends to create a high-speed broadband airborne wireless 
network by linking commercial aircraft in flight. Each aircraft participating in 
the network will act as an airborne repeater or router sending and receiving 
broadband signals from one aircraft to the next creating a digital superhighway 
in the sky. The company intends is to be a high-speed broadband internet 
pipeline to improve coverage connectivity currently lacking.

The company does not intend to provide retail customer coverage to end users, 
but, instead, will act as a wholesale carrier with target customers, such as 
internet service providers and telephone companies. Currently, the world's 
connectivity is achieved by use of undersea cables, ground based fiber and 
satellites. We believe that Airborne Wireless Network's airborne digital highway 
is the logical solution to fill the world's connectivity void. Once the network 
is developed and fully 
implemented, its uses are limitless. Airborne Wireless Network, once developed, 
should provide low cost, high speed connectivity to rural areas, island nations, 
ships at sea, oil platforms, in addition to connectivity to commercial and 
private aircraft in flight.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS:

This release includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the 
safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform 
Act of 1995. These statements are based upon the current beliefs and 
expectations of the company's management and are subject to significant risks 
and uncertainties. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or 
uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set 
forth in the forward looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but 
are not limited to, availability of capital, general industry conditions and 
competition; general economic factors; the impact of industry regulation; 
technological advances; new products and patents attained by competitors; 
challenges in new product development; manufacturing difficulties or delays; 
dependence on the effectiveness of the company's patents; and the exposure to 
litigation, including patent litigation, and/or regulatory actions.

About Airborne Wireless Network
AWN's primary advantages

Global Service

Upon successful development, AWN’s Wholesale Carrier Network would be the first 
and only true airborne broadband pipeline, providing connectivity for worldwide 
broadband carrier services using commercial aircraft.

Advanced Wireless Technology

When AWN’s patent was granted, the wireless (radio) technology to enable 
implementation of the network did not exist in the commercial realm. Hence, 
“in-house development” or prohibitively expensive advanced military 
communication-equipment were the only options. Today much of what is required is 
readily available. The equipment just needs to be packaged “purpose-specific”, 
to comply with FAA and FCC regulations.

Real-time performance - not “store and forward”

Nearly 100% real-time (not store and forward). Traditional technologies suffer 
from “single points of failure”. In AWN's Network if a link is interrupted, the 
signal is redirected to the next participating aircraft, ship, or earth-station 
in the chain. AWN’s system is designed with the security of meshed, redundant 
data-paths.

No Space Junk

Unlike satellites, which can be disabled or knocked out of orbit by space-junk, 
AWN’s system operates in a safe and controlled environment, typically between 
20,000 and 40,000 feet (6,000-12,000 m). Space junk has been known to cause 
serious damage to commercial and military satellites. The proposed launch of 
thousands more satellites translates to huge amounts of additional space-junk. 
Scientists estimate that by 2025 over 2 billion pieces of manmade space junk 
could be orbiting the earth, jeopardizing the future manned space travel.

Patented Technology

In 1998, during the pioneering days of wireless data-connectivity, the Network's 
inventor submitted a patent application to the US patent and trademark office, 
and on September 4, 2001, US patent number US 6,285,878 B1 was granted. A few 
days later, an event occurred, which changed the airline industry and which 
would delay development of this disruptive technology for a number of years. In 
2016, AWN acquired this patent and intends to further develop and deploy this 
technology

A virtual airborne “worldwide web”

Because it is a meshed network, it is like a web where all nodes are connected 
via multiple links. With traditional “single link-systems”, such as most 
cell-tower and satellite systems. There are no single points of failure (there 
is nearly always another aircraft, ship or earth-station within range of an 
aircraft).

Easy to update, upgrade or servicing

As new software becomes available, the system can be easily updated. When new 
and more efficient data-transmission technologies emerge, upgrading AWN’s system 
can be as easy as replacing a single module, and the system is ready for “the 
future”. The Network is never obsolete. Satellite technology, on the other hand, 
in most cases, has already been surpassed by the time a satellite is launched. 
These cannot be upgraded or serviced once launched..

 Airborne Wireless Wants to Create a Flying Wireless Broadband Network

Airborne Wireless Network has asked the FCC for permission to move ahead with experimental air-to-air and air-to-ground meshed network system evaluations in the 15 GHz band in an effort to prove out a concept to take wireless broadband skyward.
According to its mission statement, the company is working to create a high-speed airborne broadband wireless network by linking commercial aircraft in flight. Airborne Wireless said it plans to use each aircraft in the network as a flying repeater or router, with signals being passed from aircraft to aircraft to create a mesh network in the sky.

In a Tuesday filing with the FCC, the company asked for special permission to conduct radio link tests between two planes and from those aircraft to the ground. Airborne Wireless currently has its eye on spectrum between 14.6-14.8 and 15.15-15.35 GHz using equipment from Intellicom, but said in its application “future systems may be based on other frequencies.” Technical details of Airborne Wireless’ test plan can be found here.
The test duration would span the course of two weeks, with experiments conducted for several hours each day, the company indicated. UFO and alien fans will appreciate the fact that Airborne Wireless is seeking to run its tests in Roswell, N.M.
But what does it want to do with this airborne network?
The goal, the company said, isn’t to provide retail coverage to end users, but act as a wholesale carrier with customers such as internet service providers and telcos.
