Mr. Metzold joined Eaton Vance in 1987 as a high-yield municipal bond analyst covering health care and hospital sectors and became a portfolio manager in 1991.

"Tom has been instrumental in building and strengthening Eaton Vance's leadership role in the municipal bond market," said Payson F. Swaffield, Chief Income Investment Officer for Eaton Vance. "He has been a strong and consistent voice in the industry highlighting the benefits of municipal bonds, specifically, their ability to provide investors with tax-exempt income, diversification and relative credit stability, while at the same time providing states and diverse municipalities with cost effective financing."  
Mr. Metzold plans to join a municipal bond insurance company following his retirement from Eaton Vance.  
Effective July 31, 2015, Mr. Metzold's portfolio management responsibilities will be transitioned to other Eaton Vance municipal portfolio managers as follows:
