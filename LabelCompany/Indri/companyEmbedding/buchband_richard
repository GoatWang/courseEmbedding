"His deep in-house experience with public company issues will serve our company well and I would like to formally welcome Richard to the ManpowerGroup family."
Buchband succeeds Ken Hunt, who will retire after serving as legal counsel for ManpowerGroup in various capacities for the past 30 years. 
"I would also like to thank Ken for the long and distinguished service he has dedicated to ManpowerGroup for over three decades," added Joerres.
