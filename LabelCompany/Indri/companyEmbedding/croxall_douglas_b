Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Job Details
               LVL acquires intellectual property for the innovation and commercialization of the underlying patented technology.  Inventors and patent owners, from Fortune 500 to individual inventors, have long recognized the value in the granting and the ownership of the United States Patent. LVL assists in the creation and commercialization of that underlying value. INVENT - Inventors invent, employees of companies invent, individuals in their garage invent. LVL does NOT invent. INNOVATE - LVL and its partner companies in conjunction with the inventor or patent-owner will fund and assist in the innovation of the underlying patents and technology. COMMERCIALIZE - Many great ideas die before they make any financial return.  LVL and its partner companies are in business to make patents valuable and profitable.  We are driven by results and bottom line growth. When appropriate, LVL and its affiliates will fund the development and commercialization of the patented-technology. If you are interested in learning more, or if you have patents that you feel might be valuable but under-utilized.  Please feel free to contact us by sending an email to info@lvlpg.com, or by visiting our Contact Us tab.
