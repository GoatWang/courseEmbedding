In-house Programs







Benitec's own programs
Benitec Biopharma’s in-house programs target chronic and life-threatening conditions which are gene-associated, and for which there is no effective treatment or cure.
Our in-house pipeline, based on our proprietary ddRNAi gene-silencing technology, is summarized below, with links to
        individual program details. Successful development of therapeutic
        products in just one of these
        programs would be a major breakthrough in medical therapy.

We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the ADSs and Warrants in this
offering will be US$11.0 million, or up to US$13.0 million if the underwriter
exercises its option to purchase additional ADSs and/or Warrants in full, based
on an initial public offering price of US$9.21 per ADS, which is the price set
forth on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately US$5.5 million for development of Hepbarna for hepatitis B,  
  for pre-clinical studies intended to establish in vivo proof of concept and
  through to submission of an IND application;                               

• approximately US$3.5 million for pre-clinical studies intended to establish
  in vivo proof of concept of the AMD program and through to submission of an
  IND application and initiation of a clinical trial;                        

• approximately US$2 million for development of the OPMD program, for
  pre-clinical studies intended to establish in vivo proof of concept and
  through to submission of an IND application; and                           

• the remainder for the discovery, development and acquisition of complementary
  targets and technologies, and for working capital and general corporate
  purposes.                                                        

We believe that the proceeds from this offering, together with our cash and cash
equivalents, will be sufficient to advance our product candidate for hepatitis C
through Phase I/IIa clinical trials; to advance our product candidates for
hepatitis B and OPMD through completion of pre-clinical proof of concept trials
and to submission of IND applications; and to advance our product candidate for
AMD through completion of pre-clinical trials, submission of an IND application
and initiation of a clinical trial. Advancing our product candidate for NSCLC
through completion of pre-clinical trials, and advancing our product candidates
for hepatitis B and OPMD into clinical trials, would require additional
financing apart from this offering. As of June 30, 2015, our cash and cash
equivalents were A$21.8 million.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing
of our actual expenditures may vary significantly from our expectations
depending upon numerous factors, including the progress of our research and
development efforts, the progress of our clinical trials, our operating costs.
Accordingly, we retain the discretion to allocate the net proceeds of this
offering and we reserve the right to change the allocation of the net proceeds
described above.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
investment grade, interest-bearing instruments, securities or certificates of
deposit.


The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense and dynamic
competition to develop new technologies and proprietary therapies. Any product
candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete
with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the
future. While we believe that our proprietary technology estate and scientific
expertise in gene silencing using ddRNAi provide us with competitive advantages,
we face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and
better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies, as well as from academic institutions and governmental agencies and
public and private research institutions that may develop potentially
competitive products or technologies. We are aware of several companies focused
on developing gene therapy or gene silencing product candidates, including:

• Alnylam, Tekmira and Arrowhead—developing siRNA-based therapeutics for     
  hepatitis B;                                                               

• Avalanche Biotechnologies, Inc., Applied Genetic Technologies Corporation  
  and Oxford Biomedica—developing gene therapies for wet AMD                 

We are not aware of any companies developing a gene therapy or gene silencing
approach for HCV, NSCLC, or OPMD. There are other therapies either being
marketed or currently in development for all of these diseases, some of which
already have significant market share.

Our product candidates, if approved, would also compete with treatments that
have already been approved and accepted by the medical community, patients and
third-party payors. For example, with respect to hepatitis C, our product
candidate would compete with small molecule treatments such as Sovaldi and
Harvoni, each of which was developed by Gilead Sciences, Inc., and Viekira Pak,
a regimen consisting of four medications developed by Abbvie Inc.

Many of our competitors and potential competitors, alone or with their strategic
partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources
than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development
of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of
treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Mergers and
acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in
even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our
competitors.

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors
develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or
less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any
products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other
regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval
for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market
position before we are able to enter the market.

Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may
result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our
competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining
qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study
sites and subject registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring
technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or
early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly
through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.

We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new
products enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect
any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of,
among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and
delivery, price, the level of competition and the availability of reimbursement
from government and other third-party payors.

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors
develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or
less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any
products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other
regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval
for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market
position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, we expect that our
therapeutic products, if approved, will be priced at a significant premium over
competitive products and our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by
insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of competitive
products including biosimilar or generic products.


Company Description
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a novel, proprietary
therapeutic technology platform that combines gene silencing and gene therapy
with a goal of providing sustained, long- lasting silencing of disease-causing
genes from a single administration. We believe our technology


 has the potential
to be a “one shot” cure for a wide range of diseases that are currently
addressed by strict ongoing treatment regimens or that have no effective
treatment or only palliative care options. We are using our technology, called
DNA-directed RNA interference, or ddRNAi, to develop our pipeline of product
candidates for the treatment of numerous chronic and life-threatening human
diseases, such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B, age-related macular degeneration, or
AMD, drug-resistant non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and oculopharyngeal
muscular dystrophy, or OPMD. We will require additional financing apart from
this offering to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates for
hepatitis B, AMD and OPMD, and to conclude pre-clinical trials for our product
candidate for NSCLC. These diseases have large patient populations, with the
exception of OPMD which is a rare disease. In addition, we have licensed our
ddRNAi technology to other biopharmaceutical companies whose pipeline programs
are progressing towards, or are in, clinical development for applications
including HIV/AIDS, retinitis pigmentosa, Huntington’s disease, cancer
immunotherapy and intractable neuropathic pain.

Our Technology

Standard RNAi approach

Many diseases are known to be caused by the inappropriate expression of a gene
or multiple genes. It has been observed since 1998 that RNA interference, or
RNAi, is a mechanism that can potentially be used to specifically turn off, or
silence, genes whose sequences are known. Thus, RNAi can potentially be used to
treat or cure diseases with a genetic basis by targeting a specific region of
the molecular sequence of the disease-causing gene. RNAi is potentially
applicable to over 20,000 human genes and a large number of disease-causing
microorganism-specific genes. The mechanism of action of RNAi involves the
introduction of short interfering RNA, or siRNA, into a cell. The siRNA’s
sequence is constructed to match a short region of the target gene. The siRNA is
processed by the cell’s own enzymes to destroy the target gene’s messenger RNA,
or mRNA, thus preventing the disease-causing gene from being expressed. This
occurs as long as the siRNA remains prevalent in the cell.

Our ddRNAi approach

Our approach differs from the standard RNAi approach, which is commonly referred
to as siRNA, which is being developed by several other companies, including
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Alnylam, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation,
or Tekmira, and Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Dicerna. In this standard RNAi
approach, double-stranded siRNA is produced synthetically and subsequently
introduced into the target cell either by chemical modification of the RNA or by
a range of other delivery methods. While clinical efficacy has been demonstrated
for a number of indications utilizing this approach, it has a number of
limitations, which include:

• treatment requires repeat administration for multiple cycles in order to   
  maintain its efficacy;                                                     

• patient adherence challenges due to dosing frequency and treatment duration;

• therapeutic concentrations of siRNA are not stably maintained because the  
  levels of synthetic siRNA in the cells decrease over time;                 

• novel chemical modifications or novel delivery materials are typically
  required to introduce the siRNA into the target cells, making it complicated
  to develop therapeutics;                                       

• limited ability to target diseases of tissues other than the liver;

• can have an adverse immune response, or interferon response, potentially   
  resulting in serious adverse effects;                                      

• requirement for specialized delivery formulations for those diseases caused
  by multiple disease-causing genes; and                                     

• siRNA only acts to silence genes, but cannot be used to replace defective
  genes with normally functioning genes.                                     

Our ddRNAi technology is designed to utilize the specificity and gene silencing
effect of RNA interference while overcoming many of the limitations associated
with the ongoing administration of siRNA. Our ddRNAi approach combines RNA
interference with gene therapy. Unlike siRNA, our ddRNAi technology starts with
a DNA construct. Gene therapy vectors, which are carrier molecules, often
viruses, that deliver genetic material into the cell, are used to deliver the
DNA construct to the nucleus of the targeted cells. The DNA construct then
generates double-stranded short hairpin RNAs, or shRNAs, which are processed by
the cell into siRNAs, which in turn silence the disease-associated genes.
Advantages of our ddRNAi approach include:

• ddRNAi is designed to produce sustained, long-lasting silencing of the     
  disease-causing gene, following a single administration, leading to the    
  potential for “one shot” cures for a wide range of diseases, which could   
  eliminate the requirement for patient compliance to take regular doses of  
  medicine for long-term management of their disease;                        

• ddRNAi technology can target a wide range of tissues, including, but not   
  limited to, the liver;                                                     

• ddRNAi uses the cell’s own transcriptional mechanisms to produce a constant
  level of shRNA so that intracellular levels of siRNA do not fall below
  threshold levels required for disease suppression;                         

• the level of shRNA in the cells can potentially be fine-tuned to achieve
  optimal concentrations;                                                    

• off-tissue effects can be minimized;

• the DNA constructs are shielded in gene therapy vectors that are designed to
  avoid activating the interferon response;                               

• ddRNAi provides the option to both silence the defective gene and replace the
  defective gene with a normal version;                                  

• ddRNAi can be designed to express multiple siRNAs in the same cell, targeting
  either a single gene at several different sites to minimize the risk of viral
  resistance, or multiple genes in distinct cellular pathways, potentially
  enabling treatment of complex genetic diseases such as cancer, diabetes and
  heart disease; and                                            

• ddRNAi can elicit long-term response by continued expression of siRNA from a
  single administration, potentially preventing viral reinfection.         

Our Pipeline

Proceeds from this offering, with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will
advance our product candidates for hepatitis C, hepatitis B, AMD and OPMD.
Additional financing apart from this offering will be needed to advance our
product candidates for hepatitis C, hepatitis B, AMD and OPMD through clinical
trials, and to conclude pre-clinical trials for our product candidate for NSCLC.

Our lead product candidate, TT-034, which currently is in a Phase I/IIa
first-in-human clinical trial, is being developed to treat patients chronically
infected with the most common genotype, GT-1, of the hepatitis C virus, or HCV.
We expect to receive efficacy data in the fourth quarter of 2015. If the results
of the trial are favorable, we anticipate commencing a Phase IIb/III trial in
the second quarter of 2017, subject to obtaining additional funding outside this
offering. Of the six patients who have been dosed thus far in the Phase I/IIa
trial, there have been no treatment-related serious adverse effects observed.
All six patients have been biopsied and we have seen shRNA expression in the
three patients for whom results have been reported. We believe, based on
preliminary results from three patients, that TT-034 has clinical proof of
concept for the production of shRNA in the liver from a single administration.
According to the World Health Organization, or the WHO, 130 million to
150 million individuals worldwide have chronic hepatitis C. Hepatitis C is a
leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, which often requires a
liver transplant. Patients suffering from HCV have limited treatment options
that require adherence to strict recurrent treatment regimens, cause
debilitating side effects that can cause patients to deviate from their
prescribed treatment regimen, and lack the ability to prevent reinfection. We
believe TT-034 represents the first systemic administration of a ddRNAi-based
therapeutic, making us the only company to date to advance into a clinical trial
an RNAi therapeutic for systemic administration by gene therapy vectors.

We are also developing Hepbarna, which currently is in preclinical studies, for
the treatment of the hepatitis B virus, or HBV. We plan to file an
investigational new drug, or IND, application in the first quarter of 2017. HBV
is a small DNA virus that, according to the WHO, infects up to 240 million
people worldwide, resulting in up to 780,000 deaths per year. Infection with HBV
occurs in phases ranging from a silent, acute phase that can be resolved by the
immune system, to a persistent chronic infection requiring life-long therapy. In
the case of a chronic HBV infection, the presence of viral particles and
proteins, particularly the s-antigen, causes hepatic inflammation leading to
liver dysfunction, acute hepatic failure, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.
Patients suffering from HBV have limited treatment options from therapies
consisting of antivirals and, less commonly, interferon therapy. These
treatments require adherence to strict recurrent treatment regimens, may cause
the hepatitis B virus to mutate and develop antiviral drug resistance, and may
only provide viral suppression through the course of administration, and not a
cure. The long-term use of interferon, particularly in high doses, may also be
associated with significant side effects, including nausea, vomiting, shortness
of breath, dizziness and fatigue, that can cause patients to deviate from the
course of treatment. Hepbarna is designed to be a single administration
ddRNAi-based monotherapy that is delivered using a gene therapy vector that
targets the liver and inhibits viral replication and s-antigen production on a
long-term basis. As both HBV and HCV replicate in the liver, we have designed
Hepbarna to mimic the design elements of TT-034, which we believe could help
expedite Hepbarna’s regulatory pathway.

In addition to TT-034 for HCV and Hepbarna for HBV, we are focusing on
developing product candidates to treat AMD and OPMD. We will require additional
financing apart from this offering to conduct clinical trials for our product
candidates for HBV, AMD and OPMD and to conclude pre-clinical trials for our
product candidate for NSCLC. For selected product candidates, at the appropriate
stage, we may collaborate with large pharmaceutical companies to further develop
and, if approved, commercialize them to achieve broad product distribution. For
certain products we deem to be outside of our immediate focus, we will continue
to out-license, where appropriate, applications of our ddRNAi technology for the
development of a range of therapeutics, which we believe could provide further
validation of our technology’s potential to address numerous diseases.

ADR Trading FAQ



























































ADR Trading







ADR Trading in Benitec Biopharma 
Following Benitec’s entry to the NASDAQ, any American Depositary Receipts (ADR) shares have been automatically converted to an American Depositary Share (ADS) which is traded on the NASDAQ capital market under the symbol “BNTC”.
 Each ADS represents 20 ordinary shares of Benitec.  For more information about the NASDAQ listing and IPO please visit our NASDAQ page. 
How do I know if my ADR shares have been converted to ADS?
The conversion will happen automatically. You will not receive a new holding statement / share certificate. If there are any problems with your shares, we recommend you contact the broker who sold you the original shareholding
What if I hold BNIKF shares?
BNIKF are the foreign ordinary shares of Benitec traded on the U.S. Over-the-Counter market. The status of these shares does not change as a result of the NASDAQ listing, but it is probable that the liquidity of these shares could decrease, as fewer buyers and sellers of that security may exist, given it is possible to trade on the NASDAQ.  
We recommend you speak to your broker if you wish to sell these shares  and purchase a BNTC ADS. 
How do I transfer holding from BNIKF to BNTC?
You can sell your BNIKF shares and purchase BNTC or you can contact the broker who arranged your original BKINF investment and have them contact BNY Mellon’s issuance desk on 
        +1 212 815 5951 / 4245 / 2213 during US EST business hours.
Will it cost me any money to switch over from BNIKF to BNTC?
It is expected you would pay the normal brokerage fees charged by your broker. 
Who do I ask with other questions about my F shares, ADR or ADS shares?

For any holdings in BNIKF, investors should contact the broker who originally arranged this investment. 


For investors holding BNTC shares (or who previously held ADR shares), you can contact BNY Mellon’s issuance desk on +1 212 815 5951 / 4245 / 2213 during US EST business hours

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.88      Net Money Flow ($)  -2,621    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

	ASX/NASDAQ ANNOUNCEMENT






	Interim Report for the Nine Months
	Ended March 31, 2016






	 








	 





	 





	Sydney, Australia - May 24, 2016
	-

	Benitec Biopharma Limited (ASX: BLT; NASDAQ: BNTC; NASDAQ: BNTCW) today lodged its Interim Report for the nine months ended
	March 31, 2016. The report includes the financial results and a review of operations for the period.





	 






	Summary of the key points from the
	Interim Report:





	 








	·




	The
	net loss for the nine months was $A18.5 million and included research and development
	spending of AU$11.1 million. Benitec's current assets at March 31, 2016 were A$26.5 million.






	 








	·




	In
	March 2016 Benitec announced encouraging results of its recent

	in vivo

	efficacy
	study of BB-HB-331. Key findings indicate that a single BB-HB-331 treatment in the PhoenixBio
	mouse model can result in suppression of hepatitis B (HBV). These results demonstrate
	the potential utility of an approach that combines RNAi with gene therapy to treat HBV,
	and the Company intends to advance the HBV program towards the clinic.






	 








	·




	On
	February 26, 2016 Benitec announced that it would wind-down its hepatitis C program and
	terminate the program upon completion of patients in Cohort 4 in its Phase I/IIa clinical
	trial for TT-034.






	 








	·




	In
	December 2015, Benitec announced positive

	in vitro

	data demonstrating the efficacy
	of BB-HB-331 and supporting the progression of BB-HB-331 into

	in vivo

	preclinical
	testing. The data was presented at the HEPDART 2015 conference in the US in December
	2015.






	 








	·




	In
	August 2015, Benitec completed a NASDAQ listing raising A$18.8 million (US$13.8 million)
	before costs.






	 








	·




	In
	July 2015, Benitec announced it acquired full rights to its preclinical DNA-directed
	RNA interference based hepatitis B therapeutic program for $2.5 million. The program
	was previously a joint development collaboration between Benitec and Biomics.






	 








	·




	Benitec
	anticipates completing

	in vivo

	preclinical proof of concept studies for age-related
	macular degeneration (‘AMD’) and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (‘OPMD’)
	by the end of calendar year 2016

	host a live audio webcast and conference call on Wednesday, March 25 at 8:00am AEST (Australian Eastern) and simultaneously on

	Company History



	 


	Benitec Biopharma Limited was incorporated
	under the laws of Australia in 1995 and has been listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, or ASX, since 1997. Since then,
	we have devoted the majority of our resources to development of therapeutic agents related to DNA-directed RNA interference (ddRNAi).
	While we have established some licensing arrangements, we do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any
	revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily from private placements of ordinary shares, including A$31.5
	million of gross proceeds raised in February 2014, and our U.S. initial public offering in August 2015, the gross proceeds from
	which equalled A$18.8 million (U.S.$13.8 million). We have also received research and development grants from the Australian federal
	government, totalling A$2.3 million in fiscal year 2015 and have earned licensing revenue from licensing our ddRNAi technology
	to five biopharmaceutical companies, totalling A$0.3 million in the same period.


	 


	In October 2012, we acquired Tacere Therapeutics,
	Inc., an RNA interference therapeutics company based in California with a development program focused on hepatitis C and age related
	macular degeneration (AMD). As consideration for the acquisition, we issued a total of 4,092,854 ordinary shares (taking into account
	a 25:1 share consolidation that became effective in July 2013), representing 9.8% of our issued capital immediately after the transaction,
	having an aggregate value of A$1.5 million.


	 


	In August 2015, we completed our US initial
	public offering in which we issued 30,000,000 ordinary shares (represented by 1,500,000 ADSs) and 575,000 Warrants, and we listed
	the ADSs and Warrants on The NASDAQ Capital Market.

	St, Balmain, New South Wales, 2041, Australia. Our telephone number is +61 2 9555 6986. Our website address is www.benitec.com.

	spending of A$11.1 million compared to A$4.2 million in the previous corresponding period. Benitec acquired full rights to its
	preclinical hepatitis B program from its collaborator, Biomics Biotechnologies, for A$2.5 million with plans to independently progress
	the product candidate in this therapeutic field.


	 


	Benitec's current assets at March 31, 2016
	were A$26.5 million (June 30, 2015: A$25.1 million), with current liabilities of A$2.2 million (June 30, 2015: A$1.6 million).


	 



	REVIEW OF OPERATIONS



	 


	Benitec’s novel, proprietary therapeutic
	technology combines gene silencing and gene therapy with a goal of providing sustained, long-lasting silencing of disease-causing
	genes from a single administration. DNA-directed RNA interference (‘ddRNAi’) is being used to develop a pipeline of
	product candidates for the treatment of numerous chronic and life-threatening human diseases, such as hepatitis B (‘HBV’),
	age-related macular degeneration (‘AMD’), and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (‘OPMD’).


	 


	By combining the specificity and gene silencing
	effect of RNA interference with gene therapy, ddRNAi has the potential to produce long-lasting silencing of disease-causing genes
	from a single administration, which could eliminate the requirement for patient compliance to take regular doses of medicine for
	long-term management of their disease.


	 


	The Company has set the following priorities:


	 







	·



	Progress its pipeline of proprietary ddRNAi-based therapeutics




	 







	o



	On February 26, 2016 the Company announced that it would wind-down its hepatitis C program and
	terminate the program upon completion of patients in Cohort 4 in its Phase I/IIa clinical trial for TT-034. Further detail on the
	termination of the program is included in ‘in house Programs’ later in this report.




	 







	BENITEC BIOPHARMA LIMITED



	Interim Report for the nine months ended March 31, 2016

	Benitec is committed to completing
	the collection of trial data and monitoring patients through the required four and a half year long-term safety follow-up period.
	Final data supporting the primary and secondary endpoints of the study will be reported in Q4 2016 when the study is completed.
	Although the hepatitis C program is being discontinued, it is important to note that early stage TT-034 clinical trial results
	indicated TT-034 was safe and well tolerated, meeting the primary endpoint of the study and, as such, will assist in other programs.


	 







	o



	The other three therapeutic indications (HBV, AMD and OPMD) are being progressed through their
	respective stages in the development pathway. The Company anticipates having completed

	in vivo

	preclinical proof of concept
	studies for all three indications by the end of calendar year 2016. The Company will require additional financing to conduct clinical
	trials with these product candidates. Further detail of individual programs is provided in subsequent sections of this Review and
	Results of Operations.




	 







	·



	Continue the Company’s leadership position in ddRNAi-based therapeutics




	 







	o



	Benitec remains the only company to date to advance an RNAi therapeutic via systemic administration
	by gene therapy vectors.




	 







	·



	Further develop and improve the ddRNAi platform technology and its associated intellectual property
	position




	 







	o



	Develop in-house, ddRNAi platform technology and program related intellectual property, and in-license
	complementary technologies, as appropriate, to support the product pipeline. One such example is the Company’s relationship
	with 4D Molecular Therapeutics LLC (4DMT) to develop a suitable vector to deliver the Company’s ddRNAi constructs to a large
	majority of the retinal cells of the eye from a single intravitreal injection to treat human ocular diseases.




	 







	·



	Develop drug candidates in Benitec’s core disease areas and partner selectively to commercialise
	and expand the Company’s pipeline




	 







	o



	Selectively form collaborations to expand the Company’s capabilities and product offerings
	into a range of diseases and potentially to accelerate the development and commercialisation of ddRNAi therapeutics more broadly.




	 







	o



	Advance programs in core disease areas to appropriate stage of proof of concept to commercialise
	with pharmaceutical companies. As an example, Benitec acquired full rights to its preclinical hepatitis B program from its collaborator,
	Biomics Biotechnologies, to enable the independent progression of the product candidate and simplify partnering negotiations.




	 







	o



	Where appropriate we seek to progress one or more programs through to commercialisation. For example,
	Benitec’s pipeline program to treat an orphan indication, OPMD, is seen as a candidate for this approach.




	 







	o



	Out-license use of ddRNAi for applications and therapeutics outside of the Company’s immediate
	focus to expand Benitec’s franchise of ddRNAi-based therapeutics. As an example, Benitec licensed ddRNAi to Circuit Therapeutics
	to develop the technology in the area of intractable pain.




	 







	·



	Pursue indications with high unmet medical need or large patient populations




	 







	o



	Programs currently being pursued at Benitec are severe diseases with high unmet medical need or
	large patient populations that have well characterised gene targets that can be silenced, thus preventing the disease-causing gene
	from being expressed.




	 







	o



	The Company also intends to develop ddRNAi applications in novel technologies, such as chimeric
	antigen receptor T cells, or CAR -T, for a range of additional disease areas.

	In-house Programs




	 



Click to enlarge


	 


	As of March 31, 2016, Benitec has three pipeline
	programs in development. Using the capital raised from the successful NASDAQ listing in August 2015 and the capital raised in April
	2014, the Company continues to progress these development programs. Highlights of progress over the previous 9 months include:


	 






	(1)



	Hepatitis B – BB-HB-331:

	The Company is developing BB-HB-331 for the treatment of
	HBV, which infects up to 240 million people worldwide, resulting in up to 780,000 deaths per year. The key features and milestones
	of the HBV program are as follows:




	 







	o



	BB-HB-331 is designed to be a single administration ddRNAi-based monotherapy or to be used in combination
	therapy with other anti-viral medications. BB-HB-331 is delivered using a gene therapy vector that targets the liver and inhibits
	viral replication as well as restricts viral RNA levels and subsequent HBV protein production on a long-term basis. As both HBV
	and HCV replicate in the liver, Benitec has designed BB-HB-331 to mimic the design elements of TT-034, which might expedite the
	regulatory pathway of this drug;




	 







	o



	In July 2015 the Company acquired full rights to BB-HB-331 from China-based Biomics Biotechnologies.
	To facilitate independent development and simplify partnering opportunities, Benitec made the decision to develop BB-HB-331 as
	a solely-owned program;




	 







	o



	In October 2015 the Company entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement with Lonza, Inc. to
	develop a scalable manufacturing process for Benitec’s ddRNAi products delivered by Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) capsids;




	 







	o



	In December 2015 the Company announced positive

	in vitro

	data demonstrating the efficacy
	of BB-HB-331 and supporting the progression of BB-HB-331 into

	in vivo

	preclinical testing. The data was presented at the
	HEPDART 2015 conference in the US in December 2015;

	o



	In March 2016 the Company announced results of its recent

	in vivo

	efficacy study of BB-HB-331.
	Key findings of the

	in vivo

	study indicate that a single BB-HB-331 treatment in the PhoenixBio (PXB) mouse model can result
	in suppression of HBV. These results


	demonstrate the potential utility of an approach that combines RNAi with gene therapy
	to treat HBV, and the Company intends to advance the HBV program towards the clinic. The hepatitis B program continues to attract
	considerable interest from pharmaceutical companies; and




	 







	o



	Subject to additional financing, the Company plans to file an investigational new drug (‘IND’)
	application in the third calendar quarter of 2017.




	 






	(2)



	Age-related macular degeneration (‘AMD’):

	AMD is the leading cause of irreversible
	vision loss in the United States, affecting an estimated 1.75 million people and it is estimated that 196 million people will be
	affected by AMD worldwide by 2020. The aim of this program is to develop a therapeutic that provides long-term treatment of AMD
	from a single intravitreal injection. The Company believes this could replace the need for regular injections of therapeutics into
	the eye, which is the current standard of care. The key milestones achieved over the last 12 months and next steps include:




	 







	o



	Three ddRNAi-based therapies are in development – BB-AMD-211 and BB-AMD-233 for the treatment
	of wet AMD and BB-AMD-231 for the treatment of both wet and dry AMD;




	 







	o



	The Company has entered into collaboration with 4D Molecular Therapeutics (4DMT) for the development
	of the delivery vector for ocular-based ddRNAi products. Due to the need for an extra round of screening, vector development is
	now expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2016 but continues to show excellent progress towards identifying novel capsids;




	 







	o




	In


	vivo

	proof of concept studies are expected to be completed by the end of calendar
	year 2016; and




	 







	o



	Subject to additional financing, the Company plans to file an IND application by the end of calendar
	year 2017.




	 






	(3)



	Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD):

	Benitec is developing a ddRNAi treatment for
	the treatment of OPMD. In this novel treatment the Company is developing a “knock down & replace” approach, silencing
	a mutant gene in conjunction with its replacement with healthy wild type gene. OPMD is an autosomal-dominant inherited, slow-progressing,
	late-onset degenerative muscle disorder that usually starts in patients during their 40s or 50s. The disease is manifested by progressive
	swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) and eyelid drooping (ptosis). OPMD is caused by a specific mutation in the poly(A)-binding
	protein nuclear 1, or PABPN1, gene. OPMD is a rare disease and has been reported in at least 33 countries. Patients suffering with
	OPMD are well identified and are aggregated in particular regions, which we believe should simplify clinical development and in
	house commercialisation. Key milestones achieved over the last 12 months and next steps include:




	 







	o



	Preliminary

	in vivo

	studies in an animal model of OPMD have been completed and the results
	support the proof of concept of this approach with individual components. This data was presented at the 13th Annual Meeting of
	the British Society for Gene and Cell Therapy that was held in London, U.K. on April 15, 2016;




	 







	o



	In August 2015 the Company signed an extension to the Collaboration Agreement with Royal Holloway
	University of London. Work is ongoing to finalise the proposed clinical candidate and to optimise the

	in vivo

	delivery;
	and




	 







	o



	The Company plans to progress the program through

	in vivo

	proof of concept with the proposed
	clinical candidate by the end of calendar year 2016.

	Hepatitis C – ‘TT-034’:

	On February 26, 2016 the Company announced that, due to a lack of a sustainable commercial path, it would wind-down a partially
	completed Phase I/IIa clinical trial for its now discontinued product candidate, TT-034.





	 



	Early data from the clinical trial of TT-034
	indicated that TT-034 was safe and well-tolerated, meeting the primary endpoint of the study. However, as a result of the increasingly
	competitive landscape among available HCV therapies, in February 2016 the Company concluded that the TT-034 program no longer offered
	the commercial value necessary to attract a worthwhile commercial partnership deal and, as a result, did not warrant additional
	expenditure or focus of its resources beyond completion of the existing patients. The Company believes the early stage TT-034 clinical
	trial results provide valuable data that supports and validates the company’s ddRNAi technology platform and other pipeline
	programs, particularly liver-based indications. Benitec is committed to completing the collection of trial data and monitoring
	patients through the required long-term safety follow-up period.


	 



	The key achievements over the reporting
	period for the HCV program are as follows:



	 







	o



	The four clinical sites participating in the study include the Duke Clinical Research Unit, University
	of California San Diego, the Texas Liver Institute and Methodist Health System Clinical Research Institute in Dallas;




	 







	o



	Nine patients have been dosed to date; and




	 







	o



	Data from patients in the early cohorts were presented at the American Association for the Study
	of Liver Diseases (AASLD) conference in San Francisco in December 2015. This data indicates that a single infusion of TT-034 is
	reaching the liver and has a favourable safety profile. These interim results on safety and clinical activity are in line with
	expectations.




	 


	Benitec remains focused on advancing its other
	pipeline programs, including hepatitis B, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD).
	The Company believes that each of these programs presents attractive commercial opportunities. In particular, the hepatitis B program
	is attracting considerable interest from pharmaceutical companies. Based on this interest, the promising

	in vivo

	data announced
	in March, and the significant potential market opportunity, Benitec will now prioritise the hepatitis B program as its next candidate
	for clinical development.


	 


	Benitec is committed to completing the collection
	of all trial data and monitoring patients through the required long-term safety follow-up period for the HCV trial. In addition,
	final data supporting the primary and secondary endpoints of the study will be reported in the last quarter of 2016 calendar year
	once the study is completed.

	Licensed programs




	 



	In addition to the Company’s in-house
	development programs, Benitec has licensed its ddRNAi technology to companies who are developing therapeutic programs in five disease
	areas. Each of them provides a potential opportunity for further clinical validation of the technology and potential revenue opportunity.
	These licenses have been granted to small early-stage biotechnology companies with modest upfront and early development milestone
	payments and greater milestone payments due upon later-stage program success.


	 


	The following table sets forth our out-licensed
	product candidates and their development status.

	·




	HIV/AIDS:

	In March 2012, Benitec granted a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide license
	to a U.S.-based biotechnology company, Calimmune, Inc., (Calimmune). Under the agreement, Calimmune can develop, use and commercialize
	ddRNAi to silence up to three targets for the treatment or prevention of HIV/AIDS. Calimmune’s approach was developed with
	core technology from the laboratory of Dr. David Baltimore, a Nobel Laureate in the area of HIV/AIDS, and involves silencing
	the gene that codes for a receptor protein known as CCR5. Calimmune’s HIV/AIDS treatment is known as Cal-1.




	 


	In 2014, Calimmune commenced a Phase
	I/IIa clinical trial of Cal-1. The goal of the trial is to assess the safety of the therapy, to determine the ease of use and feasibility
	of the approach for HIV/AIDS patients and to evaluate what, if any, side effects there may be. As of early 2016 Calimmune reported
	that, following review by the DSMB of the first cohort of patients for the trial, a second patient cohort was dosed, consisting
	of four patients, who received a preconditioning regimen designed to make the treatment more effective.


	 







	·




	Cancer Immunotherapy:

	In August 2013, Benitec granted an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide
	license to a U.S.-based biotechnology company, Regen Biopharma Inc., (Regen), to use ddRNAi for silencing expression of indoleamine
	2,3—dioxygenase, or IDO, in dendritic cells. Regen is developing a cancer immunotherapy using the licensed technology. IDO
	is associated with immune-suppression and is overexpressed in some cancers. Regen has reported preclinical evidence that modification
	of these cells using RNAi targeting the silencing of IDO may significantly enhance their efficacy in cancer immunotherapy. Regen’s
	first treatment, which is for breast cancer, is called dCellVax.

	In November 2014, Regen announced
	the FDA had issued an IND number for a proposed Phase I/II clinical trial assessing safety with signals of efficacy for dCellVax.


	 







	·




	Retinitis Pigmentosa:

	In July 2012, Benitec granted an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide
	license to an Ireland-based biotechnology company, Genable Technologies Limited (Genable), to use, develop or commercialise RNAi
	for treatment or prevention of retinitis pigmentosa. Genable’s treatment involves suppression of the mutant and normal genes,
	and replacement with a normal RHO gene that has been modified to be resistant to ddRNAi gene silencing. Genable has reported that
	it established proof of concept in an

	in vivo

	model of the disease. Genable’s treatment for retinitis pigmentosa,
	GT308, is named RhoNova.




	 


	In October 2014, the European Medicines
	Agency, (EMA), granted RhoNova Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product classification. The classification enables Genable to procure
	centralized scientific advice and guidance from EMA regulators on RhoNova’s ongoing development. In 2013, the FDA granted
	Genable orphan drug designation for RhoNova. In March 2016, Genable announced that Spark Therapeutics had acquired the company
	for a combination of cash and common stock. Spark Therapeutics has indicated support for continuing the development of RhoNova.


	 







	·




	Huntington’s disease:

	In December 2012, Benitec granted a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing,
	worldwide license to a Netherlands-based biotechnology company, uniQure biopharma B.V. (uniQure), to use, develop or commercialize
	RNAi for treatment of Huntington’s disease. Our license grants to uniQure rights to develop, use and commercialize an AAV
	vector with a ddRNAi cassette targeting the gene associated with Huntington’s disease, or the Htt gene, or an AAV-RNAi-based
	product for Huntington’s disease directed to up to three gene targets specific to Huntington’s disease.




	 


	In May 2013, uniQure announced that
	it, along with its partners in a pan-European consortium devoted to finding a gene therapy cure for Huntington’s disease,
	were awarded a 2.5 million Euros grant for use in the development of a RNAi-based approach. uniQure has reported that it is using
	RNAi to non-specifically knock down all expression of the HTT gene and to specifically inhibit the mutant allele of the HTT gene.
	Evaluation of these two approaches is in progress.


	 







	·




	Intractable Neuropathic Pain:

	U.S.-based biotechnology company, Circuit Therapeutics, is
	using ddRNAi to develop treatments for the prevention of pain. Under the licensing agreement, the company has the rights to develop
	and commercialise treatments that use ddRNAi to silence Nav1.7, a sodium ion channel that is exclusively expressed in certain sensory
	nerves and is critical for generation of pain. In November 2014, we granted an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide license to
	a US-based biotechnology company, Circuit Therapeutics, Inc. (Circuit Therapeutics), to use ddRNAi for the development of treatments
	for and the prevention of pain. Under the licensing agreement, Circuit Therapeutics has rights to develop, use and commercialize
	treatments that use ddRNAi to silence Nav1.7.







	 




	Intellectual property



	 


	Benitec’s objective is to protect the
	intellectual property and proprietary technology that is important to the Company’s business, which includes seeking and
	maintaining patents for the ddRNAi platform technology that is licensed from CSIRO, and other inventions relating to products in
	development, or otherwise commercially and/or strategically important to the development of the Company’s business. The patent
	estate of technology and program-specific patents continues to progress with patents being granted in existing patent families,
	and with new patent filings to capture inventions as programs develop.


	 


	Key developments:


	 







	·



	International patent filing for AMD program entered National Phase in multiple jurisdictions that
	were identified as key markets for age-related macular degeneration, including Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Japan,
	Korea, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, and the U.S.;

	·



	The decision of the European patent office to revoke Graham patent EP1555317 was jointly appealed
	by Benitec and CSIRO. An appeal was heard by the European patent office on May 13, 2016 and a decision is pending. Once issued,
	the decision will be communicated by the Company;




	 







	·



	Patents have been granted in the US, Canada, and Europe (validated in Denmark, France, Germany,
	Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the U.K.) in the patent family entitled “RNAi expression constructs”; the
	invention in this family is directed to the triple short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) of TT-034 expressed by a single promoter;




	 







	·



	Patent has been granted in the US, with allowances also published in the U.S. and Europe in the
	patent family entitled “HBV treatment”; the invention in this family is directed to HBV sequences that were jointly
	developed with Biomics Biotechnologies; the patent family is now assigned to Benitec;




	 







	·



	Provisional patent application was filed in the US for new sequences developed at Benitec in the
	HBV program, capturing

	in vitro

	and

	in vivo

	data generated using Benitec’s constructs; and




	 







	·



	New patent filings are in preparation for the HBV and OPMD programs.




	 



	Commercialisation




	 



	Business development remains a major focus
	for Benitec, consistent with the Company’s strategy to:


	 







	·



	Partner pipeline programs with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies at major value
	inflection points,




	 







	·



	Establish co-development and collaboration arrangements for non-pipeline projects with pharmaceutical
	companies using the ddRNAi platform, and




	 







	·



	Out-license ddRNAi to companies who are developing therapeutics independently.




	 


	During the last nine months there has been
	a significant increase in engagement with ‘Big Pharma’. The Company continues to generate strong interest from a number
	of potential partners with a particular focus on hepatitis B, AMD and the ddRNAi platform.

	BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT





	 


	The condensed interim consolidated financial
	statements (the interim financial statements) of the Group are for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 and are presented in Australian
	dollars ($), which is the functional currency of the parent company. These general purpose interim financial statements have been
	prepared in accordance with the requirements of the

	Corporations Act 2001

	and

	AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting

	.
	They do not include all of the information required in annual financial statements in accordance with International Accounting
	Standards, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended June 30,
	2015 and any public announcements made by the Group during the nine months in accordance with continuous disclosure requirements
	arising under the Australian Stock Exchange Listing Rules and the

	Corporations Act 2001

	.


	 


	The interim financial statements have been
	approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on May 24, 2016.


	 








	(a)





	Basis of accounting





	 


	The nine month financial report is a general-purpose
	financial report, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, applicable Accounting
	Standards including AASB 134 “Interim Financial Reporting” and other mandatory professional reporting requirements.


	 


	This financial report has been prepared on
	a going concern basis.


	 


	During the nine months ended March 31, 2016,
	the consolidated entity incurred a loss of $18,528k (2015 comparative period: loss $6,282k) and had net operating cash outflows
	of $18,456k (2015 comparative period $5,500k)


	 


	The ability of the Group to continue as a going
	concern has been determined by directors on the following basis:


	 






	 

	i.



	consistent with early stage biotechnology companies, the
	Group’s operations are subject to considerable risks, primarily due to the nature of program development and commercialisation
	being undertaken; and




	 







	ii.



	to allow the Group to execute its long term plans, it may
	be necessary to raise additional capital, and generate further income from commercialising the consolidated entity's intellectual
	property.




	 


	The financial report does not contain any adjustments
	to the amounts or classifications of recorded assets or liabilities that might be necessary if the Group does not continue as a
	going concern.


	 


	The financial statements take no account of
	the consequences, if any, of the effects of unsuccessful product development or commercialisation, nor of the inability of the
	Group to obtain adequate funding in the future.


	 


	The financial report has been prepared in accordance
	with the historical cost convention. For the purpose of preparing the financial report, the nine months has been treated as a discrete
	reporting period.


	 








	(b)





	Summary of significant accounting policies





	 


	The interim financial statements have been
	prepared in accordance with the accounting policies adopted in the Group’s last annual financial statements for the year
	ended June 30, 2015.

	FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2016



	 








	(c)





	Estimates





	 


	When preparing the interim financial statements,
	management undertakes a number of judgements, estimates and assumptions about recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities,
	income and expenses. The actual results may differ from the judgements, estimates and assumptions made by management, and will
	seldom equal the estimated results.


	 


	The judgements, estimates and assumptions applied
	in the interim financial statements, including the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied in the
	consolidated entity's last annual financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2015.


	 


	Grant revenue is generated through the Australian
	federal government’s Research and Development Tax Incentive program, under which the government provides a cash refund for
	the 45% of eligible research and development expenditures. Because the grants are determined by the Australian government following
	the completion of a fiscal year based upon eligible research and development expenditures, grants are recorded in the fiscal year
	received, or anticipated to be received, (when a reliable estimate can be made) rather than the fiscal year to which they relate.


	 








	(d)





	Significant events and transactions





	 


	Key highlights of the interim reporting period to March 31, 2016
	include the following:






	 







	·





	Closed an Initial Public Offering in the United States with listing on the NASDAQ






	 


	In August, Benitec closed its U.S. initial
	public offering. The gross proceeds from the offering were A$18.8 million (U.S.$13.8 million), before deducting underwriting discounts
	and commissions and other offering expenses. Net proceeds from the offering will be used primarily to advance Benitec's therapeutic
	programs.


	 







	·





	Acquired full rights to hepatitis B program and announced positive in vitro and in vivo data
	with HB-BB-331






	 


	In July, Benitec acquired the full rights to
	its pre-clinical ddRNAi-based hepatitis B therapeutic program which was previously a joint development between Benitec and Biomics.
	The initial collaboration allowed Benitec to make significant advances in the program. Based on promising

	in vitro

	data,
	Benitec made the decision to develop BB-HB-331 as a wholly owned pipeline program by acquiring Biomics’ share in exchange
	for ordinary shares and cash consideration. Since acquiring full rights, Benitec has continued to progress the program.


	 







	·





	Entered into a manufacturing services agreement with Lonza






	 


	In October, Benitec entered into a Manufacturing
	Services Agreement with Lonza Houston, Inc. to develop a scalable manufacturing process for Benitec’s ddRNAi-based, Adeno-Associated
	Virus (AAV)-delivered products intended for therapeutic use in humans.


	 







	·





	Ceased further development of TT-034 for the treatment of hepatitis C






	 


	On February 26, 2016 the Company announced
	that it would wind-down its hepatitis C program and terminate the program upon completion of patients in Cohort 4 in its Phase
	I/IIa clinical trial for TT-034. Further detail on the termination of the program is included in ‘in house Programs’
	earlier in this report.


	 


	Benitec is committed to completing the collection
	of trial data and monitoring patients through the required long-term safety follow-up period for the HCV trail. In addition, final
	data supporting the primary and secondary endpoints of the study will be reported in the last quarter of 2016 calendar year once
	the study is completed. Although the hepatitis C program has been discontinued, it is important to note that early stages of the
	TT-034 clinical trial indicated that TT-034 was safe and well tolerated, meeting the primary endpoint of the study and, as such,
	will assist in other programs.

	OPERATING SEGMENTS (continued)







	 






	Accounting Policies




	 


	Segment revenues and expenses are directly
	attributable to the identified segments and include joint venture revenue and expenses where a reasonable allocation basis exists.
	Segment assets include all assets used by a segment and consist mainly of cash, receivables, inventories, intangibles and property,
	plant and equipment, net of any allowances, accumulated depreciation and amortisation. Where joint assets correspond to two or
	more segments, allocation of the net carrying amount has been made on a reasonable basis to a particular segment. Segment liabilities
	include mainly accounts payable, employee entitlements, accrued expenses, provisions and borrowings. Deferred income tax provisions
	are not included in segment assets and liabilities.

	EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE





	 


	There were no significant events after the
	March 31, 2016 balance date.

	* Benitec announced
	on June 3, 2013 its intention to progress its non-small cell lung cancer therapeutic into clinical development. Benitec advised
	it had reached agreement to use European-based clinical research organisation CTGCRO to manage clinical trials and negotiated favourable
	commercial terms which included prepayment for the clinical trial and consulting services.

	As a result of feedback from
	pharmaceutical companies and investors, the Company has recently decided to discontinue the non-small cell lung cancer program,
	allowing resources to be focused on developing the other preclinical programs. The non-small cell lung cancer program provided
	information into optimising ddRNAi design and delivery.

	The Company is currently negotiating with
	CTGCRO to apply the prepayment to support the development of other programs.



	 


	** IPO costs were incurred during the year
	for the public offer in the United States and the associated listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. These were held as a prepayment
	at June 30, 2015. They were subsequently transferred to equity once the capital raise to which they related was finalised.

	CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS




	 



	On December
	18, 2012, the Group announced the appointment of Synteract, Inc. as its Clinical Research Organisation responsible for the progression
	of TT-034 into Phase I/IIa clinical trials in the U.S.. The Group has negotiated a contract with favourable commercial terms, in
	some instances requiring prepayment, for Synteract to continue to manage the Phase I/IIa clinical trial and the follow-up clinical
	trial through 2016 and beyond.




	 




	Benitec announced
	on June 3, 2013 its intention to progress its non-small cell lung cancer therapeutic into clinical development. Benitec advised
	it had reached agreement to use European-based clinical research organisation CTGCRO to manage clinical trials and negotiated favourable
	commercial terms which included prepayment for the clinical trial and consulting services. As a result of feedback from pharma
	companies and investors, the Company has recently decided to discontinue the non-small cell lung cancer program, allowing resources
	to be focused on developing the other preclinical programs. The non-small cell lung cancer program provided information into optimising
	ddRNAi design and delivery. The Company is currently negotiating with CTGCRO to apply the prepayment against other programs.




	 




	On November
	11, 2014, the Group entered into a Collaborative Research and License Agreement with 4D Molecular Therapeutics (4DMT) to identify
	and develop adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) vector variants optimized for gene delivery to tissues within the eye using
	4D technology and products combining such optimized AAV vector variants with Benitec’s ddRNAi technology, for further development
	and commercialization by Benitec under license from 4D Molecular. Under this agreement the Group shall fund 4DMT for the studies
	to be carried out by 4DMT according to the research plan that was agreed between the parties.




	 




	The Group
	has contracted for scientific work on the therapeutic programs, as described above, and payments due within the next 12 months
	total approximately $2,300,000 (December 31, 2015 $2,320,000).

	Operating Results





	 



	We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company
	with a pipeline of in-house and partnered therapeutic programs based on our patented gene-silencing technology, ddRNAi. We are
	developing treatments for chronic and life-threatening human diseases such as hepatitis B, age-related macular degeneration and
	oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy based on this technology. In addition, we have licensed ddRNAi technology to other biopharmaceutical
	companies that are progressing their programs towards, or are in, clinical development for applications, including HIV/AIDS, retinitis
	pigmentosa, Huntington’s disease, cancer immunotherapy and intractable neuropathic pain.


	 


	Our focus has been validating our ddRNAi platform
	technology, including the Phase I/IIa clinical trial of TT-034, a therapy for hepatitis C. We reported in February 2016 our plans
	to discontinue the TT-034 program for commercial reasons. Early stages of the clinical trial indicated TT-034 was safe and well-tolerated
	in the nine patients dosed in the clinical trial. The success of this “first in human” trial is a key step in validating
	ddRNAi for therapeutic use, providing the opportunity to progress Benitec’s other in-house programs in similar manner, applying
	the key lessons learned by advancing TT-034 to the clinic. In the near future, we expect to earn revenue from partnering in-house
	programs with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, forming strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical companies, and out-licensing
	the ddRNAi platform for therapeutic areas outside of the Company’s in-house pipeline. There can be no assurance, however,
	as to whether we will enter into any additional such arrangement or what the terms of any such arrangement could be.


	 


	During the first part of 2016 the Company focused
	on internal changes to position it for future success. This included an in-depth review of its scientific pipeline to ensure efforts
	are focused on those areas with a high probability of return on investment and commercial success. In parallel to this review and
	reprioritisation of programs, the Company restructured and consolidated internal and external resources to reduce annual expenses
	and extend the cash runway. Project management practices have been enhanced to ensure that future activities are outcome driven
	and that there is improved control over timelines, deliverables and cash management.


	 


	We have incurred losses from operations in
	each year since inception. Our net loss in the 9 months to March 31, 2016 was A$18.5 million and in the previous corresponding
	period to March 31, 2015 A$6.3 million. Our net losses were A$11.5 million, A$7.0 million and A$3.5 million for the fiscal years
	ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The majority of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with
	our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue
	to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years and over future fiscal years
	we expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities as we:


	 






	•


	pursue clinical proof of concept across our programs, including treatments for hepatitis B, AMD
	and OPMD;




	 






	•


	continue preclinical development of cell therapy and immunotherapy programs through preclinical
	proof of concept;




	 






	•


	continue our research and development efforts for the refinement of ddRNAi-based technology;




	 






	•


	seek regulatory approval for our product candidates; and




	 






	•


	add additional personnel and resources to support our product development and commercialisation
	efforts.




	 


	We may generate revenue from licensing programs,
	strategic alliances or collaboration arrangement with pharmaceutical companies. These arrangements are likely to be more appealing
	to them when our pipeline is more advanced. We do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully
	complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we expect will take
	a number of years, is subject to significant uncertainty and may never occur.

	Management’s discussion
	and analysis of financial condition and review of operations (continued)





	 



	We will continue to pursue licensing programs,
	strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical companies and we regard this as our key value creation opportunity
	unless and until we are able to gain regulatory approval for one of our product candidates and decide to commercialise it ourselves.
	If we were to decide to take one or more product candidates to commercialization on our own, the process of obtaining regulatory
	approval for the selected programs and building the commercial infrastructure that would be necessary to commercialise them, if
	approved, would require substantial additional funding.


	 


	Our current operating plan may change as a
	result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. These additional
	funds could be raised through public or private equity or debt financings (although debt financings are unlikely to be available
	until we have significant revenue and cash flow to service debt we may incur), government or other third-party funding, strategic
	alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds
	or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favourable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such
	other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and compromise our ability to develop
	our product candidates and pursue our strategy.


	 


	We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable
	future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product
	candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development in our field, we are unable to
	predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when or if we will be able to generate product revenue or achieve or maintain
	profitability. Our ability to generate revenue from licensing, strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements and product sales
	will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, obtaining and maintaining adequate coverage and reimbursement from
	third-party payors for any of our product candidates that may receive regulatory approval. Even if we are able to generate revenues
	from licensing programs, strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements or commercial sale of our products, we may not become
	profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable
	to continue our operations at planned levels and we could be forced to reduce our operations.


	 




	Financial
	operations overview






	 




	Revenue




	 


	To date, we have derived revenues from licensing
	fees, the Australian federal government’s Research and Development Tax Incentive program and interest income. We have not
	generated any revenues from the sales of products. Revenues from licensing fees and the tax incentive program are included in the
	revenue line item on our statements of profit or loss.


	 


	Our licensing fees have been generated through
	the licensing of our ddRNAi technology to biopharmaceutical companies.




	 


	Our grant revenue is generated through the
	Australian federal government’s Research and Development Tax Incentive program, under which the government provides a cash
	refund for the 45% of eligible research and development expenditures, including salaries, by small Australian entities having a
	tax loss. For this purpose, small Australian entities are defined as those with less than A$20 million in revenue. This grant is
	available for our research and development activities in Australia, as well as activities in the United States to the extent such
	US-based expenses relate to our activities in Australia, do not exceed half the expenses for the relevant activities and are approved
	by the Australian government. Because the grants are determined by the Australian government following the completion of a fiscal
	year based upon eligible research and development expenditures, grants are recorded in the fiscal year received, or anticipated
	to be received (when a reliable estimate can be made) rather than the fiscal year to which they relate.


	 


	We also record interest and other financial
	income earned from bank accounts, term deposits and short-term investments as other revenue in our statements of profit or loss.

	Financial
	operations overview (continued)




	 




	Employment related costs




	 


	Employment related costs include salaries for
	all our employees and related benefits, including the grant of share options, which are valued and included in the statements of
	profit or loss and other comprehensive income as share based expenses.


	 




	Impairment




	 


	We assess at the end of each fiscal year and
	half year whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment
	testing is required for an asset, such as goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet
	available for use, we make an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher
	of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not
	generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and the asset’s value in
	use cannot be estimated to be close to its fair value. In such cases, the asset is tested for impairment as part of the cash generating
	unit to which it belongs. When the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset
	or cash-generating unit is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.


	 


	In assessing value in use, the estimated future
	cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the
	time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses relating to continuing operations are recognized in
	those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset unless the asset is carried at revalued amount (in
	which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease).


	 




	Royalties and license fees




	 


	Benitec pays royalties and license fees in
	connection with our licensing of intellectual property from third parties. In connection with our acquisition of Tacere in 2012,
	we agreed to pay to the former shareholders of Tacere royalties on certain licensing revenue earned by us through the license of
	certain products, including TT-034, covered by a patent controlled by Tacere in October 2012. Any such royalties would be calculated
	as follows: 15% if the license is entered into prior to commencement of a Phase III clinical study and 2.5% if the license is entered
	into after commencement of a Phase III clinical study. Also, if we were to directly sell these products, then we would pay a royalty
	of 2.5% on net sales to the former shareholders of Tacere.


	 


	In August 2009, Benitec entered into a collaborative
	agreement with Biomics Biotech Co., Ltd., or Biomics, pursuant to which we agreed to share any revenue generated from commercializing
	our jointly filed patents which relate to single-stranded RNA and shRNA sequences for treatment of hepatitis B. In July 2015,
	we entered into an earn-out agreement with Biomics pursuant to which we acquired all rights, title and interest in these patents
	in exchange for upfront and milestone payments. At the time of signing the agreement, we paid Biomics A$2.5 million consisting
	of A$2.0 million in cash and 647,333 ordinary shares (having a value of A$500,000 at the time the agreement was entered into).
	These shares could not be traded until October 1, 2015 and thereafter Biomics may only sell up to A$100,000 in value of those shares
	in any calendar month. Upon out-licensing a patent in this patent family we will also pay Biomics 50% of the initial licensing
	revenue received by us up to a maximum of A$3.5 million and, in the event we receive licensing revenue greater than a$6 million,
	we would pay Biomics 1.5% of licensing revenue on any such additional amounts.


	 


	In August 2013, Benitec entered into a commercial
	license arrangement with NewSouth Innovations Pty Limited, or NSi, of University of New South Wales for the patent portfolio relating
	to our therapy product candidate for NSCLC. The license provides for modest up-front and ongoing license fees, and also milestone
	and single digit percentage royalty payments on net sales. A percentage of sub-licensing revenue is also payable to NSi. We may
	terminate the license at will, and in the event of certain breaches by NSi. NSi may terminate the license in the event of certain
	breaches by Benitec. Although Benitec recently decided to discontinue the NSCLC program, the license has not been terminated by
	either party.

	Foreign exchange translation





	 



	The foreign currency translation reserve represents
	the currency translation movements of subsidiary company balances denominated in foreign currencies at year end. Foreign currency
	monetary items are translated at the period exchange rate. Non-monetary items measured at historical cost continue to be carried
	at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value are reported at the exchange rate
	at the date when fair values were determined. Movements in the foreign currency translation reserve are shown in our Statement
	of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.


	 


	Foreign currency transactions are translated
	into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. Exchange rate differences are recognized
	in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.


	 




	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates





	 



	The preparation of our financial statements
	requires us to make estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
	as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. We analyse our estimates
	and judgments and we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to
	be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may vary from our estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described
	in note 1 to these periodic financial statements and are detailed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal
	year ended June 30, 2015 (which are available on the company website and at ASX:BLT NASDAQ: BNTC; NASDAQ: BNTCW). We have summarised
	below the accounting policies of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and
	that require the application of significant judgment or estimates by our management.


	 




	Share-based payments transactions




	 


	We measure the cost of equity-settled transactions
	with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is
	determined using a Black-Scholes model.


	 




	Tax losses





	 



	Given our history of recent losses, we have
	not recognised a deferred tax asset with regard to unused tax losses and other temporary differences, as it has not been determined
	whether we or our subsidiaries will generate sufficient taxable income against which the unused tax losses and other temporary
	differences can be utilized. We note that the availability of tax losses is subject to an Australian continuity of ownership test
	or, if we fail that test, the same business test. If we continue to obtain funding from new shareholders, then we may not comply
	with the continuity of ownership test.


	 




	Certain differences between IFRS and
	U.S. GAAP






	 




	IFRS differs from U.S. GAAP in a few respects.
	While we have not assessed the materiality of differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP, we note in particular that IFRS permits the
	recording of finance income and research and development grants as revenue, unlike U.S. GAAP, under which interest and other finance
	income would not be recorded as revenue but instead as net finance income and research and development grants would be recorded
	as an offsetting reduction to research and development expenses. In addition, under IFRS, all employment-related expenses are reported
	in their own line item in our Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, unlike U.S. GAAP, under which employment-related
	expenses are generally allocated to line items such as research and development expense or general and administrative expense based
	on the functions performed by each applicable employee.


	 


	The following discussion relates to our consolidated
	results of operations, financial condition and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated
	financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report.

	(558


	)





	 


	Licensing revenue and royalties increased very
	slightly from the nine months ended March 31, 2015 to the nine months ended March 31, 2016 primarily due to timing differences
	in the recognition of such revenue.


	 


	Finance income decreased by A$0.2 million from
	A$0.4 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2015 to A$0.2million in the nine months ended March 31, 2016, as a result of holding
	cash in low yielding U.S. dollar bank accounts.


	 


	* Net foreign exchange gain is due to a high
	U.S. dollar cash balance in fiscal 2015 following an equity placement in April 2014, coupled with a significant appreciation of
	the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar calendar 2015. The net foreign exchange loss in the nine months to March 31, 2016
	of A$0.8 million reflect the adverse currency movement on the cash held in U.S. dollars. The significant increase in the Australian
	Government R&D claim reflects the increased eligible expenditure on R&D in fiscal 2015.


	 



	Expenses




	 




	Research and development expense.

	Research
	and development expense increased by A$6.9 million, from A$4.2 million in the nine months year March 31, 2015 to A$11.1 million
	in the nine months ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to:


	 







	·




	acquiring for A$2.5 million, the full
	rights to its pre-clinical ddRNAi-based hepatitis B therapeutic program which was previously a joint development collaboration
	between Benitec and Biomics;





	 







	·




	the higher research and development activity
	in 2015, including the dosing of patients in our Phase I/IIa clinical trial for TT-034; and





	 







	·




	the execution of an agreement with 4D
	Molecular Therapeutics LLC, or 4DMT, to develop vectors.





	 



	Employment related expenses.

	Employment-related
	expenses increased by A$2.6 million, in the nine months ended March 31, 2016 compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2015,
	due to increased staff levels, particularly at Tacere's laboratory, in 2015.

	Results of
	Operations (continued)




	 



	Share based expenses.  

	Share
	based expenses increased by A$0.5 million, from A$1 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2015 to A$1.5 million in the nine
	months ended March 31, 2016 largely due to the Share based expense costs for options granted to Directors on November 12, 2015
	at the Company’s Annual General Meeting. Share based expenses are calculated using a Black-Scholes model. The share based
	expense model uses a data set that includes share price and exercise price, exercise probability, volatility, exercise time and
	interest rates. Variation in these factors and an increased level of option grants to staff were the major contributors to this
	expense increase. We recognize share based expenses over the service period in which the employee earns the award, which is the
	vesting period of the award.


	 



	Travel related costs.  

	Travel
	related costs increased by A$0.1 million from A$0.8 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2015 to A$0.9 million in the nine
	months ended March 31, 2016 due to travel related to the IPO, an increase in staff levels and more participation in international
	conferences, in addition to meetings with pharmaceutical companies.


	 



	Consultants’ costs.  

	Consultants’
	costs increased by A$0.3 million from A$0.6 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2015, to A$0.9 million in the nine months
	ended March 31, 2016. We retain specialist advisers in relation to our key product candidate programs and for media and shareholder
	relations capabilities.


	 



	Occupancy costs.  

	Occupancy
	costs increased from A$0.2 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2015 to A$0.4 million in the nine months ended March 31,
	2016 due to a new expanded lease for the laboratory in California and increased space under lease in Australia.


	 



	Corporate expenses.  

	Corporate
	expenses increased from A$0.6 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2015 to A$0.9 million in the nine months ended March 31,
	2016 due to an increase in the size of our company and increases in consequent expenses.


	 



	IPO costs.  

	We expensed legal,
	accounting and other costs of A$1.0 million in the nine month period in relation to our US initial public offering which was completed
	in August 2015.


	 



	Loss for the period




	 



	As a result of the foregoing, our loss for
	the period after tax benefit increased by A$12.2 million from A$6.3 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2015 to A$18.5 million
	in the nine months ended March 31, 2016.


	 


	Given our and our subsidiaries’ history
	of recent losses, we have not recognized a deferred tax asset with regard to unused tax losses and other temporary differences,
	as it has not been determined whether we or our subsidiaries will generate sufficient taxable income against which the unused tax
	losses and other temporary differences can be utilized.


	 







	B.





	Liquidity and Capital Resources







	 



	We have incurred cumulative losses and negative
	cash flows from operations since our inception in 1995, and as of June 30, 2015 we had accumulated losses of A$107.8 million and
	at March 31, 2016 we had accumulated losses of A$125.1 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for at least
	the next several years. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase
	and, as a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may raise through a combination of equity offerings,
	debt financings, other third-party funding and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements.


	 


	We have had no borrowings in fiscal 2013, fiscal
	2014, fiscal 2015 or in this nine months to March 31, 2016 and do not currently have a credit facility.



	 



	As at March 31, 2016 we had cash and cash equivalents
	of A$19.9 million (June 30, 2015 A$21.8 million). Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment
	policy, primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation. Currently, our cash and cash equivalents are held in bank
	accounts. Our short-term investments consist of term deposits with maturity within 180 days.

	Operating capital requirements




	 


	To date, our sources of liquidity have been
	licensing revenue and royalties, Australian government research and development grants, interest on invested cash in excess of
	immediate requirements and proceeds of the issuance of equity securities.


	 


	In the future, we expect our revenue stream
	will be generated mostly from licensing, strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical companies. While
	we continue to progress discussions and advance opportunities to engage with pharmaceutical companies and continue to seek licensing
	partners for ddRNAi in disease areas that are not our focus, there can be no assurance as to whether we will enter into such arrangements
	or what the terms of any such arrangement could be.


	 


	While we have established some licensing arrangements,
	we do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We do not know when, or if,
	we will generate any revenue from product sales. We do not expect to generate significant revenue from product sales unless and
	until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize one of our current or future product candidates.


	 


	Unless and until we establish significant revenues
	from licensing programs, strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical companies, or from product sales,
	we anticipate that we will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue
	the development of product candidates and begin to prepare to commercialize any product that receives regulatory approval. We are
	subject to the risks inherent in the development of new gene therapy products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties,
	complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business.


	 


	We have based our
	projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all of our available
	capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development
	and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements.
	Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:


	 






	•


	the timing and costs of our planned clinical trials for
	our product candidates;




	 






	•


	the timing and costs of our planned preclinical studies
	for our product candidates;




	 






	•


	the number and characteristics of product candidates that
	we pursue;




	 






	•


	the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals;




	 






	•


	revenue received from commercial sales of any of our product candidates that may receive regulatory
	approval;




	 






	•


	the terms and timing of any future collaborations, licensing, consulting or other arrangements
	that we may establish;




	 






	•


	the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection
	with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defence and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;




	 






	•


	the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting
	our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims; and




	 






	•


	the extent to which we need to in-license or acquire other
	products and technologies.

	Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc

	.






	 



	Research and development expenses consist primarily
	of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:


	 






	•


	expenses incurred under agreements with academic research centres, clinical research organizations
	and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials; and




	 


	•	the cost of acquiring, developing,
	and manufacturing clinical trial materials.


	 


	Research and development expenses do not include
	employment related expenses, which are included in our Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income as a separate
	line item.


	 


	Research and development costs are expensed
	as incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific
	tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites.


	 


	We cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs
	of the current or future product development, preclinical studies or clinical trials of our product candidates. The duration, costs,
	and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:


	 






	•


	the scope, rate of progress, and expense of our ongoing as well as any additional clinical trials
	and other research and development activities;




	 






	•


	the countries in which trials are conducted;




	 






	•


	future clinical trial results;




	 






	•


	uncertainties in clinical trial enrolment rates or drop-out
	or discontinuation rates of patients;




	 






	•


	potential additional safety monitoring or other studies
	requested by regulatory agencies;




	 






	•


	significant and changing government regulation; and




	 






	•


	the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.




	 


	A change in the outcome of any of these variables
	with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with
	the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA, or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct
	clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required to complete clinical development of a product candidate or if
	we experience significant delays in enrolment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional
	financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.


	 


	We plan to increase our research and development
	expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of ddRNAi product candidates and explore further potential applications
	of our technology.

	Trend Information







	 



	Our objective is to become the leader in discovering,
	developing, clinically validating and commercializing ddRNAi-based therapeutics for a range of human diseases with high unmet clinical
	need or large patient populations, and to thereby provide a better life for patients with these diseases. Our strategy to accomplish
	this goal is to progress our pipeline of proprietary ddRNAi-based therapeutics, continue our leadership position in ddRNAi-based
	therapeutics, develop drugs in our core disease area, partner selectively to commercialize and expand our pipeline and pursue indications
	with high unmet medical need or a large patient population.

	Results of
	Operations (continued)




	 


	The scientific research that forms the basis
	of our efforts to develop product candidates is based on the therapeutic use of ddRNAi, and the identification, optimization and
	delivery of ddRNAi-based product candidates is relatively new. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of successfully
	developing therapeutic treatments based on ddRNAi is preliminary and limited. There can be no assurance that any development and
	technical problems we experience in the future will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development
	problems can be solved.


	 


	We are currently working to advance our product
	candidates for hepatitis B and OPMD through completion of pre-clinical

	in vivo

	proof of concept studies and to submission
	of IND applications; and to advance our product candidate for AMD through completion of pre-clinical proof of concept studies,
	submission of an IND application and initiation of a clinical trial. We intend to advance our product candidates for hepatitis B
	and OPMD into clinical trials, with additional financing. Although we have decided to terminate our hepatitis C program, we are
	currently completing our Phase I/IIa clinical trial for hepatitis C.


	 







	E.





	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

	.






	 



	We did not have over the past three fiscal
	years and this nine months year to March 31, 2016, and we currently do not have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined
	in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.



	 




	Risk Factors




	 



	In addition to the other information set forth
	in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report
	on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. The risks disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 20-F could materially affect
	our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 20-F are not the only risks
	facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially
	adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results in the future.

	Independent Auditor’s Review Report




	To the Members of Benitec Biopharma Limited




	 



	We have reviewed the accompanying nine months financial report
	of Benitec Biopharma Limited (“Company”), which comprises the consolidated financial statements being the statement
	of financial position as at 31 March 2016, and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes

	report



	The directors of Benitec Biopharma Limited are responsible for

	Auditor’s responsibility



	Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the nine month
	period financial report based on our review. We conducted our review in accordance with the Auditing Standard on Review Engagements
	ASRE 2410 Review of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state whether, on the basis
	of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes us believe that the nine month period financial report
	is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: giving a true and fair view of the Benitec Biopharma Limited consolidated
	entity’s financial position as at 31 March 2016 and its performance for the nine months ended on that date; and complying
	with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of Benitec

	A review of a nine month period financial report consists of making
	enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.
	A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards and consequently
	does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.
	Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.



	 




	Independence



	In conducting our review, we complied with the independence requirements
	of the Corporations Act 2001.





	 




	Conclusion



	Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become
	aware of any matter that makes us believe that the nine month period financial report of Benitec Biopharma Limited is not in accordance
	with the Corporations Act 2001, including:



	 







	a


	giving a true and fair
	view of the financial position as at 31 March 2016 and of its performance for the nine
	months ended on that date;


	and





	 







	b


	complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial
	Reporting and Corporations Regulations 2001.

"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
