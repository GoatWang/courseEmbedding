This allows you to create a workflow sequence that is most efficient for you. The Asure ID Enterprise 7 Live Link wizard unravels the mystery of how connections are made to external data sources.

Compare Asure ID Editions   HID Asure ID 86412 Express Software Details Asure ID Express 7 is the most popular edition in the Asure ID family because it is a perfect fit for the needs of most small- to medium-sized companies. Asure ID Express 7 is designed for those who need: a standalone software that is intuitive for users of any skill level the ability to produce professional-looking cards with easy-to-use tools and templatesbatch printing capabilities built-in database functionality (Microsoft Access) basic external database connectivity (a single database, single sheet) with real-time data exchangeAn easy-to-use interface inspired by Microsoft OfficeAsure ID 7 Express is a powerful, feature-rich, easy-to-use ID software program. If you're familiar with Microsoft Office, using Asure ID Express 7 will be a snap! It includes a Microsoft "ribbon"-inspired toolbar with frequently-used features and tabbed navigation for quick access to design and data entry tools. Asure ID 7 Express can also help you store cardholder information within a 1-D or 2-D barcode or magnetic stripe, or add a signature.   Powerful design tools  Asure ID 7 Express makes designing ID cards a breeze. Pop-out control palettes keep your workspace clean and allow you to hide colors and attributes until they are needed. You'll know exactly how your card will look when printed with the what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) display. You can also set conditional design and print rules to ensure a consistent card design. Plus, at start-up, Asure ID Express 7 loads the last template you used so you can pick up right where you left off! Easy access to your cardholder data with an internal database or basic external database connectivity The built-in Microsoft Access database included with Asure ID 7 provides quick and easy access to your templates and cardholder data. Asure ID 7 Express's Live Link™ also allows you to access real-time data from most third party database applications. You can populate card data fields directly from the internal database and access any field within the database with the Quick Filter option. Asure ID 7 Express also offers compound data fields and batch printing. You're able to view and edit your records in the Data Entry Center in a couple of different ways:  Cover Flow View allows you to visually rummage through your data records via its three-dimensional interface. The look and feel of Cover Flow is quite similar to that of iTunes, where album covers are displayed and you're able to browse through your digital library.     Records are also accessible and editable via a grid or table view:   Asure ID Express 7 takes the guesswork out of building complex SQL queries so that you can easily create and save database filters that are often used. You can also easily build conditional design and print rules so that objects print only when certain database conditions are met. For example, you can print a different color bar based on a user's access rights into secured areas.   Plus, the Data Entry Center allows you to set up how your data is sequenced and entered - independent of how the data appears on a card or is structured in the database. This allows you to create a workflow sequence that is most efficient for you. The Asure ID Express 7 Live Link wizard unravels the mystery of how connections are made to external data sources. Live Link sets up a real time data exchange in just a few mouse clicks, and allows you to mix information from internal and external sources on the same card.    Standard and custom reporting With Asure ID 7 Express, you can create and save standard and custom reports, allowing you to quickly and easily manipulate data with filtering, sorting and grouping.Enhanced security with password protection Asure ID Express ID software has built-in password protection to ensure only authorized users have access to your software. Plus, you can define access privileges for each user.Stay up-to-date!You'll always have access to the Asure ID 7's latest features with automatic notifications of free software updates. With this, your Asure ID Express 7 software will never be outdated. Asure ID is simple to learn. See how!

SmartMove is accessible across all devices from computers to tablets. Whether you’re a smaller agency or a large organization, never waste time on moves again!

Scenario Planning Capabilities
SmartMove's sandboxing and scenario planning functions enable you to create and review multiple moving options before making final decisions for your space.



Manage people in your space

From COBRA to HSA, Asure Benefits Administration has you covered
Asure is an ultra-modern Human Capital Management company. Our benefits administration capabilities allow you to streamline and efficiently manage your company’s processes with integrated HCM tracking from day one on the job all the way until retirement.






HIPAA Compliance
Don’t struggle to keep current with HIPAA rights and protections—let Asure do it for you! We provide complete and accurate certificate issuance to any employee or dependent, ensuring COBRA coverage.


Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)
Flexible Spending Accounts allow employees to set money aside from each paycheck before payroll tax deduction. Employees get more take-home pay and your organization pays less in FICA and FUTA payroll taxes. Asure’s FSA is a win-win for employers and employees.



Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRA)
With HRAs, employers can offer their employees more choices and better benefits per dollar. HRAs let employees see their biggest spending categories to make more informed healthcare decisions. Asure’s HRA solution allows organizations to list HRA as a business expense, improving their bottom line.



Commuter Reimbursement Account (CRA)
Take the pain out of reimbursing commuter and transit expenses. Asure’s Commuter Reimbursement Account allows employees to pay for transit, parking, and travel expenses with tax-free dollars. Employees contribute to their account with pre-tax payroll deductions and can access those funds with Asure Benefits Cards.








Meeting room scheduling has never been simpler
Schedule the rooms, resources and services you need, quickly and easily. Better manage last minute changes, keeping your cool with information at the ready. Whether you need to schedule hundreds of rooms and thousands of desks or a few meeting rooms and a handful of desks, we can help.






Cloud & Mobile Solutions
Connect to your system from any device—desktop, tablet, or mobile—then use touch panels and kiosks to reserve rooms and workspaces. Since everything is cloud-based, your system is updated and reflects changes in real-time.



Outlook Integration
Make the most of your calendars by integrating them with our resource scheduling systems. You get the best of both worlds with a robust scheduling system accessed through calendaring software already familiar to your employees.



Event & Visitor Management
Ensure events and visitors are managed properly from start to finish. Set up new events and capture critical information with a few simple clicks. Track guest arrival and departure for improved service and security.








Align your workspace with your mobile workforce and corporate culture
Office hoteling and mobile workforce programs offer the perfect balance of employee flexibility and cost efficiency. Whether your corporate culture includes a mobile workforce or you are introducing a new hoteling program, the key to success lies in proper implementation of user friendly tools and focus on employee change management.







Search & People Finder
Whether looking for a window seat or one near a co-worker with whom you need to collaborate Asure’s graphical floor plan allows you to search for available spaces and find colleagues. 


Integration with Outlook
Make the most of your calendaring systems by integrating them with our resource scheduling systems. You get the best of both worlds with a robust scheduling system accessed through calendaring software your employees are already familiar with.


Alternative Work Spaces
While some organizations are easily making the shift to alternative workspaces, others aren’t quite sure where to begin. We think a great starting place is a full understanding of how your current space is used. Once you know that, making space-related decisions is much easier.




Mobile Workspace Scheduling
With NowSpace, your mobile workforce will never be in a position where they don’t have the ability to schedule meeting rooms or workspaces as long as they have their phone!







Human Capital. Simply Managed.
You probably know human resource systems by one of their many names: HRIS, HRM, HRMS, HCM, etc. The bottom line is that you need a single-database system to provide a centralized location for all your workforce and HR management needs. Asure’s industry-leading solution is a comprehensive answer designed to help you focus on what matters: your people and your strategic business initiatives.







Single Master Employee Record
Asure’s Employee Master Record allows you to capture as much or as little data as you want for each employee in one secured, centralized location.


Automated Notifications
HR Management has never been easier. Set up automated notifications for all employees including new hires and off-site employees. Get updates on all important aspects of employee management.


Compliance Reporting
Manage and report on all of your required government documentation in one system with cloud-based SaaS tools that give your HR team secure, 24/7 access.








Supercharge your payroll and tax management
Asure's Payroll and Tax Management is a user-friendly payroll solution, offering complete access to tax filing and reporting, helping you effectively manage your workforce. Simple navigation helps you access the many innovative features






Payroll Wizard
Whether you have 50 or 50,000 employees, Asure's got you covered. Our system can handle simple or complex calculations without extra programming or steps. The Wizard gives you step-by-step directions and logically sorts out potential errors before payroll processing so you know you're in good hands.



Automated Filing and Reporting
With Asure, distributing, filing, and tax reporting are easy. Our Automated Tax Filing and Reporting takes the pain out of keeping up with taxes—no matter your company's size. We have you covered on all tax jurisdictions—whether it's federal, state, city, or geo-based taxes, we have them all.


General Ledger
Our General Ledger interface will map directly to your chart of accounts and the data can be imported into your accounting system, helping you keep up with the latest business happenings—so you're prepared for whatever's thrown at you.



Real-Time Reports
Asure’s payroll system provides you with access to over 450 standard reports and two skilled report writers—both analytical and ad hoc, keeping vital information at your fingertips.







Hire better employees with integrated recruiting tools
Our solution allows you to determine what you need to be successful. Make performance reviews and employee assessment simple with a completely customizable system, helping you and your employees get the most out of your work.






Create Job Requisitions
Using Asure's integrated recruitment tools your team can download and secure resumes, schedule interviews, and hire the most qualified applicants available. Creating and managing job requisitions is easy, and the data is carried throughout the hiring process, allowing you access to everything you need.



Paperless On-boarding
Asure's intuitive on-boarding wizard carries over candidate data, provides automated notifications for applicant acceptance, and eliminates all excess paperwork. Manual data entry is essentially eliminated. 







Track company time & labor any time, anywhere.
AsureForce® Time & Labor Management helps you easily capture time and attendance data for accurate payroll processing and labor law compliance. You also gain insight into workforce productivity trends, delivering the information you need to make smart decisions. Access AsureForce® Time wherever you are through the cloud, Web browsers, and mobile devices.







Mobile time tracking
GeoPunch™ mobile time tracking allows your mobile, agile workforce to work from anywhere at anytime, increasing productivity and adoption rates with devices they're already familiar with.


Time & Attendance
Accurate time collection is just the beginning. AsureForce Time also reduces your overall cost of ownership by automating processes and increasing productivity. You can eliminate time-consuming and error-prone manual calculations while still choosing the time entry methods that meet your employees' needs.


Easy Time Reporting
AsureForce Time reporting provides critical employee payroll, scheduling, and historical trend information. Users have the ability to create ad hoc reports tailored to their needs and "favorite" commonly used reports.


Employee Scheduling
Streamline staff scheduling, enabling supervisors to develop schedules around workforce requirements. Measure actual hours worked against the plan through intuitive calendar views.







Don't let your office space go to waste. Optimize your real estate footprint today!
SmartView is a comprehensive workplace utilization analysis solution that empowers you to make educated, cost-effective decisions about your workspace. It uses state of the art occupancy and presence detection devices with in-depth, interactive reporting dashboards to track, measure, and analyze space throughout your entire facility including individual workspaces.







Desk To Employee Ratios
Most organizations still use a 1-to-1 desk to employee ratio. Achieving a higher ratio like 5-to-1 is not only possible—it can also save you millions in overhead costs.


Occupancy Detection System
SmartView is a complete, automated, and integrated space utilization measurement system. This revolutionary system of activity sensors and analytic tools help you understand and manage available real estate and workstations. 


Passive Detection
Discover actual space use—meeting rooms to individual workspaces—by passively capturing occupancy and utilization with unobtrusive sensors. Employees go about their regular work activities while SmartView collects data.

508 Compliance - Asure Software






























































508 Compliance










A Quick Overview
Section 508, an amendment to the United States Workforce Rehabilitation Act of 1973, is a federal law mandating that all electronic and information technology developed, procured, maintained, or used by the federal government be accessible to people with disabilities. We are proud to offer VPATs (Voluntary Product Assessment Template) for our two primary scheduling applications: Resource Scheduler and Meeting Room Manager.

What does 508 compliance do?
Eliminates obstacles to information access
Brings new opportunities to people with disabilities
Provides people with disabilities access to information that is comparable to the access available to others
Encourages developing technologies accessible by people with disabilities
Ensures that agencies comply with accessibility requirements when procuring, developing, using, and maintaining electronic or information technology, unless it causes an unwarranted burden in effort or expense.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Records are also accessible and editable via a grid or table view:     Plus, the Data Entry Center allows you to set up how your data is sequenced and entered—independent of how the data appears on a card or is structured in the database—so that you have a workflow sequence that is most efficient for you.

HIPAA Compliance

Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)
Flexible Spending Accounts allow employees to set money aside from each paycheck before payroll tax deduction. Employees get more take-home pay and your organization pays less in FICA and FUTA payroll taxes. Asure’s FSA is a win-win for employers and employees.



Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRA)
With HRAs, employers can offer their employees more choices and better benefits per dollar. HRAs let employees see their biggest spending categories to make more informed healthcare decisions. Asure’s HRA solution allows organizations to list HRA as a business expense, improving their bottom line.



Commuter Reimbursement Account (CRA)
Take the pain out of reimbursing commuter and transit expenses. Asure’s Commuter Reimbursement Account allows employees to pay for transit, parking, and travel expenses with tax-free dollars. Employees contribute to their account with pre-tax payroll deductions and can access those funds with Asure Benefits Cards.








Meeting room scheduling has never been simpler
Schedule the rooms, resources and services you need, quickly and easily. Better manage last minute changes, keeping your cool with information at the ready. Whether you need to schedule hundreds of rooms and thousands of desks or a few meeting rooms and a handful of desks, we can help.






Cloud & Mobile Solutions
Connect to your system from any device—desktop, tablet, or mobile—then use touch panels and kiosks to reserve rooms and workspaces. Since everything is cloud-based, your system is updated and reflects changes in real-time.



Outlook Integration
Make the most of your calendars by integrating them with our resource scheduling systems. You get the best of both worlds with a robust scheduling system accessed through calendaring software already familiar to your employees.



Event & Visitor Management
Ensure events and visitors are managed properly from start to finish. Set up new events and capture critical information with a few simple clicks. Track guest arrival and departure for improved service and security.








Align your workspace with your mobile workforce and corporate culture
Office hoteling and mobile workforce programs offer the perfect balance of employee flexibility and cost efficiency. Whether your corporate culture includes a mobile workforce or you are introducing a new hoteling program, the key to success lies in proper implementation of user friendly tools and focus on employee change management.







Search & People Finder
Whether looking for a window seat or one near a co-worker with whom you need to collaborate Asure’s graphical floor plan allows you to search for available spaces and find colleagues. 


Integration with Outlook
Make the most of your calendaring systems by integrating them with our resource scheduling systems. You get the best of both worlds with a robust scheduling system accessed through calendaring software your employees are already familiar with.


Alternative Work Spaces
While some organizations are easily making the shift to alternative workspaces, others aren’t quite sure where to begin. We think a great starting place is a full understanding of how your current space is used. Once you know that, making space-related decisions is much easier.




Mobile Workspace Scheduling
With NowSpace, your mobile workforce will never be in a position where they don’t have the ability to schedule meeting rooms or workspaces as long as they have their phone!







Human Capital. Simply Managed.

JPEG[edit]
In 2002, while known as Forgent, the company claimed that through its subsidiary, Compression Labs, it owned the patent rights on the JPEG image compression standard (U.S. Patent 4,698,672), which is widely used on the World Wide Web.
Critics claim that the legal principle of laches, hence not asserting one's rights in a timely manner, invalidates Forgent's claims on the patent. Critics also noted the similarity to Unisys' attempts to assert rights over the GIF image compression standard via LZW patent enforcement.[2] The JPEG committee responded to Forgent's claims, stating that it believes prior art exists that would invalidate Forgent's claims, and launched a search for prior art evidence.[3]
In April 2004, Forgent stated that 30 companies had already paid US$90 million in royalties. On April 23, lawsuits were filed against 31 companies, including Adobe Systems, Apple Computer and IBM, for infringement of their patent. On September 26, 2005, Axis Communications, one of the defendants, announced a settlement with Compression Labs Inc.; the terms were not disclosed. As of late October 2005, six companies were known to have licensed the patent from Forgent including Adobe, Macromedia, Axis, Color Dreams, and Research In Motion.
On May 25, 2006, the United States Patent and Trademark Office rejected the broadest part of Forgent Networks claims, stating prior art submitted by the Public Patent Foundation invalidated those claims.[4] PubPat's Executive Director, Dan Ravicher, says that the submitters knew about the prior art but failed to tell the USPTO about it.[5] On August 11, 2006 Forgent Networks received notice from the NASDAQ stock market regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price rule, which can lead to delisting, before coming back into compliance in January 2007.[6]
The company issued a press release on November 1, 2006 stating that they settled their remaining claims against roughly 60 companies. It was reported that the settlement came to $8 million and was paid by, among other companies, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems.[citation needed]
Digital video recorders[edit]
Forgent Networks shifted its focus to U.S. Patent 6,285,746, relating to a computer controlled video system allowing playback during recording. This technology is very common in modern-day digital video recorders. While the patent was filed in 1991, the first litigation was initiated in 2005. On May 21, 2007, U.S. District Court of Eastern Texas ruled in favor of EchoStar Communications Corporation, on grounds that the patent is invalid.[7]
Asure Software[edit]
After Forgent Networks acquired iEmployee and subsequently changed its name to Asure Software, the website of the combined company no longer listed information related to the two patents - '672 and '746, compared to the old Forgent Networks website.[8]
Acquisitions[edit]
On September 13, 2007, Forgent acquired iEmployee.[9]
On March 21, 2016, Asure Software announced that it had acquired Mangrove Employer Services, which developed software relating to human resource management. Asure began massive layoffs in June 2016 of previous Mangrove employees.[10]
In May 2017, Asure Software acquired the Tampa-based company Compass HRM Inc., for $6 million. Compass HRM Inc. provides services focused on human resources and payroll.[11]

Alternative Work Spaces
While some organizations are easily making the shift to alternative workspaces, others aren’t quite sure where to begin. We think a great starting place is a full understanding of how your current space is used. Once you know that, making space-related decisions is much easier.




Mobile Workspace Scheduling
With NowSpace, your mobile workforce will never be in a position where they don’t have the ability to schedule meeting rooms or workspaces as long as they have their phone!







Human Capital. Simply Managed.

As of late October 2005, six companies were known to have licensed the patent from Forgent including Adobe, Macromedia, Axis, Color Dreams, and Research In Motion.
On May 25, 2006, the United States Patent and Trademark Office rejected the broadest part of Forgent Networks claims, stating prior art submitted by the Public Patent Foundation invalidated those claims.[4] PubPat's Executive Director, Dan Ravicher, says that the submitters knew about the prior art but failed to tell the USPTO about it.[5] On August 11, 2006 Forgent Networks received notice from the NASDAQ stock market regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price rule, which can lead to delisting, before coming back into compliance in January 2007.[6]
The company issued a press release on November 1, 2006 stating that they settled their remaining claims against roughly 60 companies. It was reported that the settlement came to $8 million and was paid by, among other companies, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems.[citation needed]
Digital video recorders[edit]
Forgent Networks shifted its focus to U.S. Patent 6,285,746, relating to a computer controlled video system allowing playback during recording. This technology is very common in modern-day digital video recorders. While the patent was filed in 1991, the first litigation was initiated in 2005. On May 21, 2007, U.S. District Court of Eastern Texas ruled in favor of EchoStar Communications Corporation, on grounds that the patent is invalid.[7]
Asure Software[edit]
After Forgent Networks acquired iEmployee and subsequently changed its name to Asure Software, the website of the combined company no longer listed information related to the two patents - '672 and '746, compared to the old Forgent Networks website.[8]
Acquisitions[edit]
On September 13, 2007, Forgent acquired iEmployee.[9]
On March 21, 2016, Asure Software announced that it had acquired Mangrove Employer Services, which developed software relating to human resource management. Asure began massive layoffs in June 2016 of previous Mangrove employees.[10]
In May 2017, Asure Software acquired the Tampa-based company Compass HRM Inc., for $6 million. Compass HRM Inc. provides services focused on human resources and payroll.[11]

JPEG[edit]
In 2002, while known as Forgent, the company claimed that through its subsidiary, Compression Labs, it owned the patent rights on the JPEG image compression standard (U.S. Patent 4,698,672), which is widely used on the World Wide Web.
Critics claim that the legal principle of laches, hence not asserting one's rights in a timely manner, invalidates Forgent's claims on the patent. Critics also noted the similarity to Unisys' attempts to assert rights over the GIF image compression standard via LZW patent enforcement.[2] The JPEG committee responded to Forgent's claims, stating that it believes prior art exists that would invalidate Forgent's claims, and launched a search for prior art evidence.[3]
In April 2004, Forgent stated that 30 companies had already paid US$90 million in royalties. On April 23, lawsuits were filed against 31 companies, including Adobe Systems, Apple Computer and IBM, for infringement of their patent. On September 26, 2005, Axis Communications, one of the defendants, announced a settlement with Compression Labs Inc.; the terms were not disclosed. As of late October 2005, six companies were known to have licensed the patent from Forgent including Adobe, Macromedia, Axis, Color Dreams, and Research In Motion.
On May 25, 2006, the United States Patent and Trademark Office rejected the broadest part of Forgent Networks claims, stating prior art submitted by the Public Patent Foundation invalidated those claims.[4] PubPat's Executive Director, Dan Ravicher, says that the submitters knew about the prior art but failed to tell the USPTO about it.[5] On August 11, 2006 Forgent Networks received notice from the NASDAQ stock market regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price rule, which can lead to delisting, before coming back into compliance in January 2007.[6]
The company issued a press release on November 1, 2006 stating that they settled their remaining claims against roughly 60 companies. It was reported that the settlement came to $8 million and was paid by, among other companies, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems.[citation needed]
Digital video recorders[edit]
Forgent Networks shifted its focus to U.S. Patent 6,285,746, relating to a computer controlled video system allowing playback during recording. This technology is very common in modern-day digital video recorders. While the patent was filed in 1991, the first litigation was initiated in 2005. On May 21, 2007, U.S. District Court of Eastern Texas ruled in favor of EchoStar Communications Corporation, on grounds that the patent is invalid.[7]
Asure Software[edit]
After Forgent Networks acquired iEmployee and subsequently changed its name to Asure Software, the website of the combined company no longer listed information related to the two patents - '672 and '746, compared to the old Forgent Networks website.[8]
Acquisitions[edit]
On September 13, 2007, Forgent acquired iEmployee.[9]
On March 21, 2016, Asure Software announced that it had acquired Mangrove Employer Services, which developed software relating to human resource management. Asure began massive layoffs in June 2016 of previous Mangrove employees.[10]
In May 2017, Asure Software acquired the Tampa-based company Compass HRM Inc., for $6 million. Compass HRM Inc. provides services focused on human resources and payroll.[11]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
