Needless to say, I was more than pleasantly surprised.The second I walked in the store, I was greeted with a "Welcome to Ulta!" even though the cashiers were busy. Two in particular, Stacy (a quiet, tall person), and Emily (shorter, dark hair) were extremely friendly and helped me find a new mascara I absolutely ADORE as well as a few other things (the store still has a tendency to be a little confusing at times, unfortunately, but I know it's not the fault of the people there).The best person there was a quieter girl (unfortunately, I can't remember her name at the moment... I'm sure it'll come back to me later...) who worked as the skin therapist. Emily directed me to her at one point when I asked her a question about skin care products, and I'm honestly so glad I got the chance to talk to this wonderful girl. She smiled and asked me what I was looking for before making recommendations, most of which I was unsure about until she started explaining the benefits and differences of each one. She even asked me about what I am using at home to see if there was anything I should change about my routine.I eventually decided to get the $20 "microzone" she recommended (they're like mini-facials), and have discovered that it was not only more than I expected, but well worth every penny spent and more. I have never felt my skin so soft and smooth before, and in only 20 minutes! I made another appointment with her in just another couple of weeks, and will definitely be keeping it!Hair NookTerr P. ratedAlex is awesome and cares about here clients.  She always give 200% in making you look your best.  She has always done the impossible with my fine hair.  When I let her color it I look 20 years younger and my husband goes wild.    I'm never late for my appointment, in fact I'm early.  I know Alex has lots of client and that is why I book appointments and show up early.  If she get finished with someone else early I'm already their and good to go.  If I were to show up late for my appointment it would be me taking a risk of loosing my slot and someone else more considerate getting it.  The grown up thing to do is apologize that I was late and see when is the next best time she can fit me in.  After all she is running  business and we need to show here professional respect and show up on time.  At best we should call and let her know your running behind and ask what is the next timeslot she has open, that why we both come out happy..I've never had an issues since I show up early.  I don't like making wait on me and I was taught to appreciate others time, especially a professional like Alex.Blonde Faith Salondood4ad ratedI came across this salon from word of mouth and I'm so thankful that I did! Alyssa saved my hair! I had a major hair crisis about 2 weeks ago and I was able to book with Alyssa a week ago. She was able to bring my dry, damaged hair back to life. I had a great time at the salon while I was under hair construction. My experience was great. The staff was friendly and they have the most comfortable shampoo chairs. I am so excited to book my next appointment! I also have to mention that EVERYONE walked out of the salon looking fabulous. That's how it should be and I'm impressed by the owners set up of the entire salon and have already recommended this salon to many friends!! PS- Y'all are doing a wonderful job on your social media accounts. Keep it up because had I not seen the endless before and after photos I would have been hesitant. I love seeing your hairstylists work.Quality Roofingronnypalacios121 ratedWorking with Quality Roofing w...Working with Quality Roofing with regards to my hail claim for my home located in Buchanan Dam, TX was a great experience over all. In today's world, the meaning of customer service is poor at best and you have to do all the work just to get things done in a timely manner. But you guys answered all my questions in a timely manner and kept me informed with regards to scheduled tasks that pertained to the project and gave me a great looking roof as well. Overall, I enjoyed working with your company and would highly recommend you to all who where in the market for a roof replacement. So thanks to you Tyler and Quality Roofing for a job well done and feel free to utilize me as a reference for your future customers if you so desire.Texas Showcase Roofingkmartin77 ratedExcellent Customer ServiceI knew I had hail damage, but knew nothing about the claims process. The owner, Mr. Vasquez explained the whole claims process to me and handled everything. He was present while the insurance adjuster inspected my roof and made sure that I got my roof bought, including the gutters, windows, and siding. He even pointed out city code upgrades that I needed done such as metal drip edge installation. When the work started, his crew was on time and got everything done including the clean-up in one day! I was amazed at their skill and knowledge of roofing. Not only were they professional, but their pricing was very fair. I highly recommend Austin Roof Repair Co. to anyone needing roof work.   Austin Massage ClinicJesse C. ratedBarbara was amazing. I reluctantly made an appointment after my Chiropractor told me that my issue was muscular and I should schedule a massage. I arrived and met Barbara, she is such an awesome person. She made me feel very comfortable and we discussed what was bothering me and how she was going to go about treating my shoulder. It was one of the most amazing things I have ever experienced and I know that sounds nuts. She fixed my shoulder pain and over the next couple days it was completely gone. Had another appointment with her yesterday to help my other shoulder and it was wonderful. I absolutely recommend Barbara, she is a huge blessing to our community!Blonde Faith SalonMe M. ratedI went in as a natural dark blonde, and made it clear I wanted to be a light blonde I came out with my hair barely lightened due to the fact there was not enough heat on my hair .  It cost over $260 that included a trim $200 for highlights $60 for a trim that's the most money I've ever paid in my life. I'm 50 years old, so that's a lot of hair jobs. This is a nice place but the prices are beyond rock star cost. I go to Hollywood (celebrity hair stylist) and have my hair done by a true experienced hair dresser of 35 years and he charges $150 with a complete color change includes trim and a express keratin blow out. Crazy! Be sure to talk to them about cost!Quality Austin Roofing SvcAdam P. ratedWhen it comes to roof repairs, you're looking for three things: a good job, a good price; and a good experience.Quality Austin Roofing Services deliver on all three. I appreciated the expertise they brought to the job by conducting a thorough walk through (complete with digital photos) and careful explanation of what they would do. It was also refreshing to see that they just doesn't quote the work -- they do it as well. They were very professional and met our needs at a reasonable and fair price. While I'm not looking forward to the next time I need roofing services, I know who I'll call when that happens.Faye Hair Design Incsarahpmpro ratedFay had cut my hair today. I l...Fay had cut my hair today. I love my haircut. It’s beautiful when I wear my hair curly it’s perfect &amp; when I pressed it. My last haircut was seven months ago maybe longer. I have thick curly hair. I do like to wear my hair curly &amp; smooth press. I had haircuts were if I wear it press smooth you can see mistakes the stylist had made. I truly hate that when it happeneds ...Which is why I waited so long.She understood curly hair shrinks when dry so she took caution to cut less so when my hair is dry the length will be what I want as well. Thank you Fay for listening &amp; the haircut. Hailey Design Salonfudy53 ratedI walked in with bad hair and ...I walked in with bad hair and came out with a great new haircut.  Fariba has been at the recently reopened shop for about 4 months and she is fabulous!  She examined my bad haircut and she listened to what I wanted.  As she worked, she explained what she was doing and asked for my feedback.  Fariba kept saying she does not speak english very well, but I totally disagree!  She is amazing. The price was inexpensive for a shampoo and cut. I didn't request styling so do not feel I can give the 5 star rating.  I'll definitely return and also plan to take my dad next time he needs a cut! Did You Know?Different Types of Roofing ServicesThe type of roofer you will need will depend on whether you require a brand new roof or small repairs. You need to find a contractor with a history of excellent service in a particular roofing project.Installation - A roofer can put a brand new roof on your home or commercial building. When this is done as part of original construction, the main contractor will probably perform the task, or may hire a specialist. This is a big project so you may want to find a company who can offer a crew to install your roof over a shorter time period.Since this is a more involved process, it is also more expensive. Home Advisor says you should expect to pay between $4,000 to $9,000 for a roof installation. This, of course, depends on what type of material the roofer uses, the size of your roof, the code requirements of your area and even the angle - or pitch - of your roof.Replacement - If you want to replace your current roof, you can hire a company or individual to strip your roof and install new shingles or panels. Some roofing options, such as metal tiles, can be placed on top of existing shingles and are easy enough to install that a single contractor can perform the task efficiently.If the contractor can install the new roof without removing the old one, it is going to cost you less than a complete replacement. Installing lighter materials will also save you money because it requires fewer people and can be completed faster.Repair - When you have a leak, it may be time to contact a local roofer. Some problems are obvious and you'll want to call a contractor quickly before damage spreads. A roofer will replace holes in your roof after severe weather or fix your gutters when they stop draining properly.The average roof repair project will cost you a few hundred dollars. Each tasks is different and you should get a price breakdown for each roof repair project. Make sure you are charged a fair price for materials and time.Maintenance - There are a variety of tasks that can help maintain the quality of your roofing materials. You may want to invest in sealant or coatings that prevent moisture accumulation or reflect sunlight.A popular project these days is installing solar panels or other environmentally conscious solutions to save money and make your property greener. When pricing these options, make sure to compare how much the project costs to how much the contractor projects you should save on utilities and heating expesnes.Inspection - If you are selling your home or business, you'll probably want to contact a roofer to inspect your property for any issues that may affect the value. Whatever your reason for inspections, a roofing expert can tell you possible causes for concerns or provide ideas for future maintenance.Depending on your area, you may be able to find a roofing contractor who will give you a free evaluation, but you should expect to pay a couple hundred dollars for a full inspection.When is a New Roof or Repair Necessary?Certain events demand you reach out to a roofing expert - such as when a tree crashes through your home. If, however, you're unsure a visit from a contractor is warranted, here are a few signs it's time to give your roof some attention:Obvious Damage
The easiest way to tell if your roof needs repair or replacement is to look at it. You should be able to spot broken or missing shingles. Look for subtler signs, such as roof tiles curling or damage around corners and chimneys. Inconsistent coloring could indicate moss or water damage.If you really want to give your roof a thorough inspection, Good Housekeeping advises property owners to check gutters for broken down granules or interiors for structural sagging.Not Doing its Job
Your roof is supposed to protect you from environmental elements. If you find water in your home after a rainstorm or feel a draft on cold days, it may mean there are gaps in your roof panels or other problems. A good place to check is your basement or the uppermost level of your property. Try turning out the lights during the day and checking for signs of sunlight breaking through your roof.You can also check your energy bill. When you feel like you pay too much for heat or cooling, roof repairs could help you cut costs.After a Major Weather Event
You should always inspect your roof for signs of damage after a major weather event. Wind can blow shingles off your property and hail is a common cause of dents or breakage. If your home suffers from a fire, you need to check for internal structural damage.Warranty Expires
All roof materials - even metal shingles and panels - have an expiration date. If you've had your roof for over 20 years, you should consider having a professional give it a full inspection. Problems aren't always obvious, but you can check your original contractor statements for when it's time to reevaluate the work.Questions to Ask Before Hiring Roofing ContractorAfter doing your research, you should talk to a roofer in person and ask specific questions before hiring him or her for your project:What Are Your Qualifications?
The first thing you need to check for is a local address. Its easier to trust a roofer with a history in the community that proudly displays contact information. Not all states require a roofing license, but you should at least check to see if a company or contractor belongs to a national roofing organization or the local chamber of commerce. Ask about any award or certifications the company has earned in previous years.Can I Have a Cost Report?
No matter how dependable a roofer may seem, never depend on a verbal agreement. You want to get every promise down in writing. An extensive job cost report shows you exactly what work a roofer will perform and how much each service will cost you.Go line by line and ask about every expense. You should also check to make sure the job completely covers the necessary task, so ask about additional services the contractor could perform for water protection or extended warranty.What Are Your Plans for Emergencies?
Roofing can be dangerous. You need to make sure that the company or contractor carries liability insurance so you are not held responsible for accidents. Ask to see the proper paperwork and inquire about safety precautions. You should also check if the roofer has contingencies for smaller emergencies, such as rain delays.How Will You Protect My Property?
Roofing projects can lead to debris and even structural damage. You should invite a roofer to inspect your property before beginning a project so you can point out landscaping or other external features they should look out for. If the contractor doesn't seem to care about aesthetical concerns, you shouldn't expect the finished product to help your curb appeal.What's Your Warranty?
You need to inquire about how long the work should last. A major factor in longevity will be the materials used. You should research online about how long metal or concrete shingles should perform and make sure the business's guaranteed warranty is in line with industry standards.Can I Get a Reference?
Not only should you ask to get in contact with past clients, Time Magazine advises homeowners to visit projects currently underway to see how the contractor or company actually performs during a job. You can also go online and check out other customer reviews.How Does One Know What Type of Roof is Suitable?Roofing materials are made out of concrete, metal, plastic and a variety of other substances. Before you settle on material and a design, you should consider these factors:Environmental Concerns
If you live in an area prone to wildfires, you may want to avoid flammable roofing materials. You have to be aware of your risks for damage and prevent common causes of trouble in your initial buying. This doesn't disqualify all materials. For example, if you worry about moisture but want asphalt shingles, you can purchase algae-resistant versions. If you are designing a home, a pitched roof is better at preventing moisture acclimation than a flat one.Duration
The longer you plan to live in your current home or occupy a commercial space, the more you should invest in a durable roof. The roof of your structure will be a major selling point should you decide to move.Aesthetics
Some roofing materials, such as metal and plastic, have a variety of available looks and designs, while clay tile is very popular for an authentic appearance. You must consider how the roof should look alongside the rest of your architecture and talk to your contractor about the aesthetic values of high-quality materials. You should also consider skylights, chimneys or other obstacles to consistent patterns when planning a design.Cost
Once you consider your regional area, necessary durability and aesthetic appeal, you should take your needs to a roofer who can give you the most cost-efficient option that will satisfy your concerns. You should always create a budget for your roof installation or repair.Prevention TipsIf you wish to keep visits from a professional roofer to a minimum, there are some steps you can take to maintain your roof on your own:Perform Simple Maintenance
Water in your roof is a major cause of mold and leaks. Regularly cleaning your gutters to prevent debris build-up is a best practice. You should also check your flashing and shingle alignment for holes or cracks in the surface. When a roofer installs new materials, ask about specific maintenance you should perform.Be Aware of Your Risks
If you have a tree near your home, you have to look out for wet leaves accumulating on your roof and the potential danger of falling branches. Homes in colder climates may suffer from freezing, so you want to make sure your roof is properly insulated and prevent heavy snows from weighing down your structure. Before any major weather event, you should inspect your home for possible weaknesses and contact a roofer to prevent trouble.Stay Vigilant
The primary solution for any possible roof damage is prevention. You can't take your property for granted. You should inspect your roof at regular intervals. Have a professional roofing contractor evaluate your structure after major incidents and well before your warranty expires.
