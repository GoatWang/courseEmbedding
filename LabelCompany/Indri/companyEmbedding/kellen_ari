Valeant Makes Bausch + Lomb a Reportable Segment Led by Ari Kellen

	August 12, 2016:	By Joan McKenna 

Valeant is reorganizing into three segments, one titled Bausch + Lomb/International, the company announced Aug. 9 during an earnings call. The move marks a big departure from the firm’s former regional structure.
The Bausch + Lomb/International segment, made up of products with “durable growth,” will account for about 50 percent of Valeant revenues.
The segment encompasses global vision care, surgical, consumer, prescription ophthalmic, and international products.
Dr. Ari Kellen
Dr. Ari Kellen will lead the segment, expanding his duties as executive vice president and company group chairman. Kellen joined Valeant in January 2014. Previously, he spent 22 years with McKinsey & Company and worked in senior hospital management and emergency trauma in South Africa. He received his MBBCh and MBA degrees from the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa.
Valeant said it expects revenue growth for the segment of 6 to 8 percent through 2018.
The other two segments are Branded Rx (“growth” products) and US Diversified Products (“cash generating” products).
Third-quarter earnings will be reported based on the new segments.
Also, Valeant said it expects to quickly resolve FDA concerns over Vesneo (latanoprostene bunod), the firm’s glaucoma drug candidate. Valeant received a Complete Response Letter on July 21 listing FDA concerns related to the manufacturing of Vesneo at the firm’s Tampa, FL, facility. Valeant is working toward reinspection of the plant in six months.
As for Q2-2016 earnings, Valeant’s sales of ophthalmic surgical products increased 7 percent year over year, and contact lenses were up 8 percent, but ophthalmic prescription drugs decreased 25 percent.
Ophthalmic surgical product revenues totaled $60.5 million in Q2-2016, up from $56.5 million in Q2-2015.
Contact lens sales were $55.3 million, up from $51.2 million in Q2-2015.
And ophthalmic drugs accounted for $101.7 million in revenues, down from $135.4 in Q2-2015.
The company’s revenues across all segments totaled $2.4 billion in Q2-2016, a decrease of 11 percent from Q2-2015.
Valeant reaffirmed its 2016 full-year guidance of $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion in revenues.
As part of the firm’s restructuring, Laurie Little, who has led investor and public relations for the past nine years, will be leaving.

Bausch + LombImage: bausch.com
Holding a leadership position with Valeant Pharmaceuticals since 2014, Dr. Ari Kellen’s responsibilities extend to oversight of Latin America, U.S. Dermatology, and U.S. Bausch + Lomb businesses. Under Dr. Ari Kellen’s guidance, U.S. Bausch + Lomb maintains robust research and development capacities and stands at the leading edge of the industry.
In February 2016 Bausch + Lomb announced the introduction of ULTRA for Presbyopia contact lenses. These lenses are designed to take the place of silicone hydrogel lenses, which are not ideal for people who spend prolonged periods working on computers and other digital devices, especially if they experience vision issues or dryness of the eyes.
The innovative new daily disposable contacts combine the 3-Zone Progressive multifocal design with proprietary MoistureSeal® technologies that ensure comfort until the end of the day. Presbyopic patients enjoy a combination of predictable, easy-to-use lenses and a wearing experience that enables excellent distance, near, and intermediate vision. Simplified fitting guidelines streamline the process of delivering outstanding multi-focal vision.

Disruptive InnovationImage: entrepreneur.com
As a business executive tasked with overseeing strategic growth and management of large health care business sectors, Dr. Ari Kellen is well versed in business growth strategies. As executive vice president for Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Ari Kellen oversees business with several United States and Latin American companies, including Bausch & Lomb, and his past experience includes work leading studies to inform corporate strategies at McKinsey & Company.
Businesses employ a range of strategies in an attempt to grow and compete with other business in a similar market. Often, the strategy selected is based on the condition and position of the company, finances, competitors, and regulations. Two business approaches for strategic growth are the disruptive innovation strategy and innovation at scale strategy.
Disruptive innovation refers to growth through the creation of completely new products, services, or models of doing business. In a co-authored 2012 article, Dr. Kellen and McKinsey colleagues cited Apple, and discussed Innovation at scale, which refers to organizing growth and innovation that builds on the core offerings of a company.

Factoring the Competition Into Product Development Planning

Ari Kellen, Competition, Planning, Product Development 


Ari KellenImage: mckinsey.com
Currently an executive with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., Dr. Ari Kellen was a consultant with McKinsey & Company for more than two decades. Dr. Ari Kellen’s work with the latter firm included extensive engagements in the corporate innovation sphere, and coauthoring the article Battle-test Your Innovation Strategy for the December 2012 McKinsey Quarterly.
The scenario presented in the article is one in which a company has taken all the right steps prior to product or service launch: brainstorming, prototyping, testing, and incorporating extensive market research and financial modeling. Despite a solid pathway to success, the product fails to catch on and the development team is left with a failure on its hands.
One common reason given for lack of anticipated sales is “the competition,” with rivals often taking unanticipated steps to counter the product, from discounting to tying up distribution channels. These threats are often difficult to detect before they actually emerge, partly because the competitors keep them hidden.
In overcoming this, a number of companies integrate “war games” simulations into their planning strategies, with an aim of getting into the strategic mindset of rivals. Competitive insights generated can help companies adjust product and service offerings at an early stage, when the outcome is malleable and changes are relatively easy to carry out.
