The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

When Daniel Freedman decided to co-found his newest exercise startup, BurnAlong, he says he was one of the lucky ones.
Being an experienced entrepreneur and having spent time in Baltimore's technology sector, he already had plenty of connections when looking for angel and seed investors for his app. BurnAlong allows users to virtually connect with workout partners — something that may keep users more motivated to exercise than doing so on their own.

BurnAlong completed a $1 million round of fundraising this summer, hoping to use the cash infusion to bring on more area gyms as partners.
But Freedman says he's one of the lucky ones. Baltimore is not quite the hotbed for investing as other markets are, such as Boston and San Francisco.





In Baltimore, Freedman says early-stage investors are looking for products and early-stage growth, rather than concepts and ideas.
"What people call angel investors in Baltimore are really seed investors in other cities. You speak to an angel in Baltimore and they say they want to see a product in the market and user growth. Typically angels in different cities are investing in an idea and people before product has launched," Freedman said.
On this week's episode of the BaltBizCast, Freedman talked about what he's seeing in the Baltimore venture capital landscape, but why he has hope that Baltimore will continue to thrive as a hub for technology startups.




 


Freedman's concerns come at a time when venture capital funding in Maryland has started to fall. Venture capitalists invested $19.6 million in Maryland companies in the third quarter of this year, the lowest total in any quarter since 1997.
After starting out his career as a journalist for the Wall Street Journal and other publications, Freedman eventually transferred over to the technology sector, working for Apploi, a hiring platform, and co-founding anti-espionage software company Cyecure Box.
Listen to Freedman and I's full conversation above, or over at our SoundCloud account here.
Topics discussed include:

His new app, BurnAlong (0:43) How he went from being a journalist to working in the tech industry (2:03) How difficult it's been for him to secure financing (4:45) What advice he gives to other entrepreneurs (7:41) Why he chose to establish Baltimore as his base of operations (8:42) Why Baltimore lacks a strong venture capital network compared to other cities (10:23) What advice he'd given to potential investors who have money to invest — but don't know where to go (11:51) What pitch he gives to potential investors (13:35) Why he thinks the IPO market in Maryland has dried up (14:15) How listeners can try out BurnAlong (16:15)

Jonathan Munshaw is the digital editor of the Baltimore Business Journal.
