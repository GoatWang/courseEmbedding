 Educational Background



 
Class of 1989 


Purdue University

                  Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, is the flagship university of the six-campus Purdue University system. Purdue was founded on May 6, 1869, as a land-grant university when the Indiana General Assembly, taking advantage of the Morrill Act, accepted a donation of land and money from Lafayette businessman John Purdue to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture in his name. The first classes were held on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.

The university was founded with the gift of $150,000 from John Purdue, a Lafayette business leader and philanthropist, along with $50,000 from Tippecanoe County, and 150 acres (0.6 km²) of land from Lafayette residents in support of the project. In 1869, it was decided that the new school would be built near the city of Lafayette and established as Purdue University, in the name of the institution’s principal benefactor.

The West Lafayette campus offers more than 200 majors for undergraduates, over 70 master’s and doctoral programs, and professional degrees in pharmacy and veterinary medicine. In addition, Purdue has 18 intercollegiate sports teams and more than 850 student organizations. Today, Purdue is a member of the Big Ten Conference. Purdue enrolls the second largest student body of any university in Indiana as well as the fourth largest international student population of any university in the United States.                




 
Class of 1986 


University of Michigan

                  The University of Michigan (UM, U-M, UMich, or U of M), frequently referred to as simply Michigan, is a public research university located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States. It is the state's oldest university and the flagship campus of the University of Michigan. It is one of the original eight Public Ivy universities and is one of the founding members of the Association of American Universities. It has been ranked among the top five research universities in the US, and among the top 20 universities in the world. U-M also has satellite campuses in Flint and Dearborn.                




 
Class of 1984 


The University of Texas at Austin

                  The University of Texas at Austin is one of the largest public universities in the United States and is the largest institution of The University of Texas System. Founded in 1883, the university has grown from a single building, eight teachers, two departments and 221 students to a 350-acre main campus with 17 colleges and schools, about 24,000 faculty and staff, and more than 50,000 students.

Timeless Lee Jeans for Women
Take part in a legend with our diverse selection of Lee Jeans for women—they’ve been making fine denim for over a hundred years, so they know exactly what they’re doing. From the fabric to the construction, Lee jeans are made with longevity and style in mind. Do yourself a favor and check out the results of this hard-earned heritage, including pants, shorts, and all types of denim that come in every style and wash under the sun!

Grab a pair of classic-fit jeans that both flatter your figure while keeping you comfy all day long. If you’re wanting to give those new boots a whirl around town, be sure to pick up a pair of dark indigo bootcut jeans to complement them. For looking hip and edgy, there’s nothing quite like a pair of skinny cut jeans with just the right amount of distressing for that lived-in look—then wear them with one of your sweet new infinity scarves and a pair of aviator sunglasses to complete your outfit!

Lee collection doesn’t stop a jeans. They have an exciting selection of cargo pants, trousers, and chinos. Their trousers and essential chinos are flattering cuts that will look great on any shape. They are the both work well for numerous occasions. The chinos in particular are excellent for casual events too!

Lee has over 100 years of stylish excellence under their belt. You won’t regret getting yourself a pair of Lee pants for women!

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.
