Skyworks Names Liam K. Griffin as CEO; David J. Aldrich to Become Executive Chairman | Business Wire
























































Skyworks Names Liam K. Griffin as CEO; David J. Aldrich to Become 
      Executive Chairman




Multi-Year Succession Plan Effective Post Annual Stockholder Meeting






May 12, 2016 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



WOBURN, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: SWKS), an innovator of high 
      performance analog semiconductors connecting people, places and things, 
      today announced that its board of directors has appointed Liam K. 
      Griffin as chief executive officer. Mr. Griffin was also elected to the 
      board of directors of Skyworks effective May 11, 2016. David J. Aldrich, 
      Skyworks’ chief executive officer since 2000, will assume the newly 
      established role of executive chairman and, in that position, will 
      continue to serve as the chairman of Skyworks’ board of directors.
    


      Skyworks has substantially outpaced the broader semiconductor market: 
      growing the top line at a 25 percent annual rate from $1.1 billion in 
      fiscal 2010 to over $3.2 billion in fiscal 2015. In parallel, the 
      company has maintained a rigorous leadership succession planning process 
      to ensure the organization continues to follow this path of success 
      going forward.
    

      “I am delighted to announce that Liam Griffin has become Skyworks’ chief 
      executive officer as we capitalize on the enormous global mobility and 
      Internet of Things opportunities ahead of us,” said Aldrich. “Liam has a 
      demonstrated track record of success and our proven partnership over 15 
      years makes him my logical successor. He is a highly energetic and 
      motivating leader who is widely respected amongst our customers, 
      partners, suppliers and investors as well as the entire Skyworks 
      employee base. Liam has the unique ability to translate challenging 
      operational plans into market outperformance through his intense focus 
      and unyielding tenacity. I am confident Liam is the right person at the 
      right time to lead Skyworks into the next frontier and I look forward to 
      supporting him in my new capacity as executive chairman.”
    

      As executive chairman, Mr. Aldrich, 59, will devote his time to 
      supporting the management transition and working with the leadership 
      team to develop Skyworks’ long term strategy. Mr. Aldrich has served as 
      CEO of Skyworks and its predecessor Alpha Industries, since 2000. During 
      that time, annual company revenue grew from $126 million in 1999, when 
      he became president and chief operating officer, to over $3.2 billion as 
      of fiscal 2015, while operating income increased 7,477 percent.
    

      Mr. Griffin, 49, joined Skyworks in August 2001 as head of sales and 
      marketing. Since that time his responsibilities have continuously 
      expanded with his leadership of Skyworks’ business units, R&D efforts 
      and operations. In 2011, he was promoted to executive vice president and 
      in May 2014 was named company president. Mr. Griffin has been a key 
      architect of the company’s strategy to cement its leadership position in 
      mobile communications while diversifying across the Internet of Things.
    

      Before joining Skyworks, Mr. Griffin was the vice president of worldwide 
      sales at Dover Corporation and held product management and process 
      engineering positions at AT&T's Microelectronics and Network Systems’ 
      businesses. Mr. Griffin received a Bachelor of Science degree in 
      mechanical engineering from the University of Massachusetts and a Master 
      of Business Administration degree from Boston University.
    

      “I am honored to have been chosen by Dave and the Skyworks board to lead 
      our great company,” said Griffin. “Over the past 17 years, Dave 
      Aldrich’s vision and leadership have built Skyworks into one of the 
      largest and fastest growing semiconductor companies in the world. We 
      have created an awesome platform for analog, mixed signal and RF product 
      integration leveraging our OEM relationships and operational scale. I 
      assume this new leadership role deeply humbled yet highly confident in 
      Skyworks’ future. I look forward to continuing to work closely with Dave 
      and building upon all of his achievements while ultimately realizing our 
      vision of connecting everyone and everything, all the time.”

Industry Champions Profile: Liam Griffin

Industry Champions Profile – Liam Griffin
Liam Griffin is MD of the Griffin Group, a business he runs with his two sons. He has spent all his life in the tourism and hospitality business, since being involved in his family’s guesthouse in Rosslare from an early age. He spent time abroad working in the hospitality trade and he also worked for a period on his return to Ireland with Bord Failte.
While tourism is in his blood hurling has been his passion. He is also known as the last man to manage Wexford to an All-Ireland Senior Hurling Title in 1996. His 5 Star Monart Destination Spa, in Enniscorthy, opened in 2005 and was recently voted as the second best spa in the world, that is some achievement for Liam and his team and speaks volumes for the ethos he adopts to his business: “provide the best in class products with unbeatable service standards.”
Liam is the Industry Champion for Tourism for the South East APJ and we asked him to give us his thoughts on his involvement so far.
 
Why did you get involved?
I had seen the decimation of rural Ireland and GAA clubs in particular, brought about by the recession. Kids that I had coached at a young age were leaving for Australia and elsewhere, so it was a huge issue and it affected a lot of families. When I was asked to be involved I thought straight away that I would because I was very conscious of the issues involved. With this being called the ‘Action Plan for Jobs’, anything that could create jobs in the region would be pushing an open door for me.
What do you think is the key challenge? 
We’ve never been united before as a region in the South East. There is a disconnect between a lot of the counties. To start with Kilkenny, Wexford and Carlow are in Leinster and Tipperary and Waterford are in Munster and that creates its own sense of division. Also the land connection between Wexford and Waterford is a single narrow bridge in New Ross. I think with Waterford being the regional capital and a lot of the regional centres and authorities going there, you even had a sense that certain parts of the region were marginalised by regionalisation. And we are used to competing with each other through our hurling rivalries. There’s always been a sense of the region being disconnected. So the key challenge is uniting a region that hasn’t always acted together or felt united.
Have there been any achievements so far?
The coming together of the county councils around the Greenway project is a good force that can maximise the strength of the region. We have found common ground rather than competing ground around a project that can do so much for the region. If you think of all of the benefits that a linked Greenway/Blueway route will bring in terms of counteracting rural decimation, connecting the entire country, and creating jobs in rural areas. Before we might have looked at these Greenway projects parochially, and we might have even competed against each other regarding them, but now we are working towards a plan and we are connected. And I think all the regional stakeholders will see the benefit of that.

You’re excited about the Greenway project overall?
It could do wonders in terms of tourism. And it also will attract a better type of tourism and a more sustainable tourism. The tourism product it will create will be very difficult to replicate anywhere in the world, when you think that we could link from Rosslare to Donegal. And it’s in our hands to do so given the amount of land that is in state ownership. We have great weather in the region in comparison to other regions in the country and that is a selling point as well. It has huge potential. And it can create jobs in non high-tech sectors as well which is important to do. So it’s very exciting and there are so many opportunities that can spring up around it.
What can we learn from the approach taken to the Greenway/Blueway project?
If we can think collaboratively across all of the actions in the plan we will be in a strong position. We can leave our competition to the sports field and come together when it comes to job creation. The Greenway/Blueway projects have been a great starting point to unite the region and we need to carry that across the entire action plan now.
Finally, as Industry Champion for Tourism, are you concerned about Brexit?
There will obviously be both opportunities and challenges with Brexit but it is still early days. You’d be hoping the UK might still row back on it. The exchange rate will be vital because we actually received a huge benefit from the devaluation of the euro around the time of the recession because it made it cheaper to travel here. But in terms of what we need to do ourselves, it’s really building quality tourism products like we are with the Greenway so that we can attract a better quality tourism into the region and also from markets other than the UK. If we can do that we can protect ourselves from whatever happens with Brexit.
