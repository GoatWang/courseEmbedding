Welcome to Alexco Resource Corp.

Alexco owns the Keno Hill Silver District in Canada's Yukon Territory,  historically one of the highest grade silver districts in the world, producing more than 200 million ounces of silver at an average grade of approximately 1,250 grams per tonne ("g/t") silver. Alexco commenced commercial production in the Keno Hill Silver District in 2011, producing approximately two million ounces of silver and more than 20 million pounds of lead and zinc concentrate per year into 2013 when production was suspended in the face of collapsing silver and base metal prices. Since then, Alexco has made two significant exploration discoveries and renegotiated a number of third party agreements. The Flame & Moth and Bermingham deposit discoveries have added more than 20 million ounces of silver at an average grade of 800 g/t silver to Alexco's indicated resource base in the district. These additions have led to a new and expanded multi-mine production plan reflecting significantly increased resources, a longer life and reduced all-in sustaining costs. In 2017 Alexco is focused on moving the district back to an operations start-up in the second half of 2018 by initially executing an advanced underground exploration program at its Bermingham deposit, followed by underground development of the Flame & Moth deposit along with recommissioning of all surface plant and infrastructure. In addition, in 2017 Alexco will continue with surface exploration programs in proximity to existing resources in anticipation of adding to a growing resource base. Employing a unique business model, Alexco also provides mine-related environmental services, remediation technologies and reclamation and mine closure services to both government and industry clients through the Alexco Environmental Group, its wholly-owned environmental services division.

Bellekeno Mine





Description
CANADA'S ONLY PRIMARY SILVER MINE
Long Section

MINING
Bellekeno began commercial production at the beginning of 2011 and produced about 2 million ounces of silver during its startup year. Mine production was approximately 1.4 million ounces of silver in the first three quarters of 2013. Alexco recently announced an interim suspension of operations at Bellekeno in order to decrease costs and reposition the District for long-term, sustainable operations.  Significant amounts of lead and zinc are also mined at Bellekeno. 

Successful exploration in 2012 and 2013 has indicated good potential to replace some of the resource already mined and extend the mine plan, once operations are re-initiated. An updated recalculation of the resource at Bellekeno is anticipated during 2013.

It took just three years from initial exploration, through permitting, construction and development for Alexco to put Bellekeno into operation, a feat rarely seen in the mining industry. As a result, the Company's founders, Chief Executive Officer Clynt Nauman and Chief Operating Officer Brad Thrall, were named the recipients of the 2011 E.A. Scholz Award for Excellence in Mine Development. This prestigious AME BC award recognized them for their technical skills, environmental control expertise and cooperative relationship with the local Na-Cho Nyak Dun First Nation.

Bellekeno's initial mine plan was to utilize the cut-and-fill method of mining, however, the mine began to transition over to long-hole mining once enough field experience with the ground conditions was obtained.  Bellekeno began producing ore from long-hole stopes in 2011, which was the first time this mining method was attempted in the history of the District.

In places where large blocks of ore are identified and the adjoining rock is relatively competent, then a long-hole mining method is generally the lowest-cost mining technique.  Alexco was able to begin using this method with a targeted approach in some areas of the mine, successfully lowering costs and increasing production output at Bellekeno in the latter part of 2012. 

MILLING
The processing mill at Keno Hill has been ramping up toward full capacity over the past two and a half years of operations, and in the third quarter of 2013 hit a record average throughput of 321 tonnes per day.  The nameplate capacity of the mill is 400 tonnes per day, with the Bellekeno mine expected to provide around 200 to 250 tonnes per day of feed, when in operation.
 
The mill, located approximately 4.5 kilometers from the Bellekeno mine, uses conventional crushing, grinding and flotation processes, followed by concentrate and tailings dewatering. The tailings are filtered and either used as backfill for the mine or stored in a dry stack tailings facility, ensuring the highest environmental integrity at the site. The mill produces both lead and zinc concentrates, which are transported by truck in specially designed, environmentally protective metal pods to Alaska, shipped by barge to Seattle and then taken by truck to a smelter in southern British Columbia for treatment and refining.

SILVER PURCHASE AGREEMENT
The Bellekeno mine and mill were built at a cost of C$61 million, including US$50 million provided by Silver Wheaton Corp. as part of its 2008 silver purchase agreement with Alexco.  In return, Alexco is selling Silver Wheaton 25% of the payable silver produced from the Keno Hill District at a price of $3.90 per ounce. The agreement does not include any of the lead, zinc or other by-product production.

Elsa Tailings





Description
Historical Elsa Tailings
Historical milling operations at Elsa started in the 1930s and continued until 1988. Over that period, the Elsa mill processed ore from ten major mines in the area, resulting in an estimated 3.67 million tonnes of tailings deposited at the Elsa tailings site. In 2009 sonic drilling was used to complete 283 drill holes in the Elsa tailings, with the objective of generating an estimate of mineral resources. The average thickness of tailings drilled was 2.3 meters. As a result of the encouraging data gathered from the Elsa tailings, engineering and feasibility related work is underway to determine the viability of recovering the silver in this valuable resource.
Based on assays of tailings samples, indicated mineral resources for the Elsa tailings have been estimated at 2.49 million tonnes at 119 gpt silver (9,526,000 total ounces of silver), 0.99% lead and 0.70% zinc. The Elsa tailings resource also includes an estimated 9,600 ounces of gold.

Detailed Resource Estimate

Alexco's 2012 exploration program at its Keno Hill Silver District properties was its most aggressive to date, with more than 25,000 meters of surface drilling and about 4,700 meters of underground drilling completed. The year was without precedent on the exploration front with a 52% increase announced by the end of 2012 in the District-wide Indicated silver resources to 40.2 million ounces of Indicated silver resource and 10.5 million ounces of Inferred resource, plus more than 5 million ounces of historical silver resource.  In early 2013, Alexco released new resource calculations for its Flame & Moth deposit, further ramping up the total consolidated silver resource for the District to 51.3 million ounces of Indicated silver resource and 7.7 million ounces of Inferred silver resource.

FLAME & MOTH
The Flame & Moth deposit is a new discovery in the Keno Hill District, a target first unearthed by Alexco's exploration team in 2010 after thorough interpretation of the District's geological trends. The Flame & Moth is located next to the District processing mill. Additional positive drill results were announced in January 2013, underscoring the robust nature of the deposit, and by the end of January 2013, the Flame & Moth resource estimate was nearly 23 million ounces of Indicated and 1 million ounces of Inferred silver resource and growing. 

The mineralization here is wider than many of the historical mines in the District, comes nearly to the surface, and could represent a paradigm change in the type of mining for the District. Depending upon final results, this deposit could potentially lend itself to more economic bulk mining with lower dilution. Mineralization now extends 600 meters along strike and 350 meters down dip, while remaining open to the south and east, and westerly toward the surface.

The Flame and Moth deposit is divided into two zones, the Lightning and the Christal Zones, southwest and northeast of the Mill Fault, respectively. The results from both zones continue to increase the confidence in the Flame & Moth deposit, which could represent the most significant near-term production growth opportunities in the Keno Hill District. In addition, exploration drilling has identified a new discovery similar in appearance to the Flame Vein about 600 meters to the west-southwest of the Flame & Moth deposit, with a single drill hole intersecting 10.7 ounces per ton silver over a 0.85 meter interval, significantly expanding the area of potential mineralization likely related in some manner to the Flame & Moth deposit.

In 2013, Alexco plans to initiate baseline geotechnical, metallurgical and environmental work as well as preliminary engineering on the Flame & Moth deposit. This work is expected to include studies of future potential production options in context with existing mines and other opportunities in the District.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM)  $-0.04      Market Cap $158.02 M     Shares Outstanding 96.95 M     Public Float 91.83 M     Yield AXU has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest (06/30/17)    Shares Sold Short 2.26 M     Change from Last  4.63%      Percent of Float 2.46%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.57      Net Money Flow ($)  -9,165    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
