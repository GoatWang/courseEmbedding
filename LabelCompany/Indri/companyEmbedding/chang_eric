About


Eric Chang joined Microsoft Research Asia (MSR Asia) in July, 1999 to work in the area of speech technologies. Eric is currently the Senior Director of Technology Strategy and Communications of MSR Asia, where his responsibilities include communications, IP portfolio management, and driving new research themes such as eHealth and urban informatics.
Prior to his new responsibilities at MSR Asia, Eric co-founded Microsoft Advanced Technology Center (ATC) in 2003 as the Assistant Managing Director. At ATC, Eric led teams to ship features for Windows and Windows Mobile and started a multi-disciplinary incubation team. Previously, Eric was the research manager of the speech group at MSR Asia and the acting University Relations Director for one year. A technology transfer result from his group is the Chinese version of Office XP, which incorporates the Mandarin speech recognition engine developed at Microsoft Research Asia.
Prior to joining Microsoft Research, Eric was one of the founding members of the Research group at Nuance Communications, a pioneer in natural speech interface software for telecommunication systems. While at Nuance, Eric worked on various projects involving confidence score generation, acoustic modeling, and robust speech detection. He also led the technical effort to develop the Japanese version of the Nuance product. This project led to the world’s first deployed Japanese natural language speech recognition system.
Eric has also developed speech recognition algorithms at M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratory, invented a new circuit optimization technique at Toshiba ULSI Research Center, and conducted pattern recognition research at General Electric Corporate Research and Development Center.
Eric graduated from M.I.T. with Ph.D., Master and Bachelor degrees, all in the field of electrical engineering and computer science. While at M.I.T., he was inducted into the honorary societies Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Xi.
Eric has published papers in the fields of eHealth, speech processing, and machine learning in various journals and conferences. He is the author of several granted and pending patents. His research interests are spoken language understanding, machine learning, and signal processing.

About Eric Chang | Bresslergroup




























































Work With Us




















Eric Chang
Mechanical Engineer



            Legos, K'nex, and Erector sets fueled Eric's fascination with building while he was growing up.           
Play also taught him about not cutting corners — and how the maximal return on effort is gained with adequate research and planning. He still likes working with his hands and making prototypes. Today, his satisfaction comes from seeing a completed project working as designed in the real world. 
At Bresslergroup, Eric works on ideation, mechanical design, manufacturing support, and engineering analysis. He believes products should incorporate the simplest and most beautiful designs possible without sacrificing function or durability. His ultimate goal for each project? To make the end user happy.
Before joining the team, Eric — who has a BS in Biomedical Engineering from Rutgers University — was a project engineer at Stryker Orthopaedics where he designed deformity correction implants and surgical trauma instruments. His top areas of expertise include electro-mechanical ideation, medical device development, and biomechanical systems. 
Even outside of work Eric spends most of his time on design — his personal projects are catalogued at fourbardesign.com. When he’s not designing, he’s thrill-seeking outdoors, building FPV racing drones, or making music, photographs, and videos.

Q&A with Eric Chang of Hellman-Chang
Eric Chang of Brooklyn-based furniture line, Hellman-Chang, answers our questions on their handcrafted wood furniture. 

by New York Spaces









Dan Hellman & Eric Chang

NYS: How and when did you both meet and decide to start Hellman-Chang?
Eric Chang of Hellman-Chang: Dan and I met in the 6th grade at the age of 10. We quickly became best friends, and learned we shared a lot of interests beyond the same circle of friends. This included things like art, design, tropical fish, and most importantly, grade-school woodshop. We ended up getting more involved in the craft when we bought woodworking books, and started teaching ourselves how to build solid-wood furniture in Dan's dad's garage during the summers of high school and college.
It wasn't until we both lived in New York after graduating college, that we reminisced about our woodworking days, and decided that we would pursue the hobby again. Shortly thereafter, Hellman-Chang was born. We found a listing on craigslist for a shared co-op woodworking studio where we could rent a 5x10 square foot space that we could go to on weeknights and weekends. We would meet up after work and build furniture in the shop until one in the morning every night, and all day on Saturdays and Sundays. After a couple of months of designing and building our own pieces, we realized that this was becoming a very expensive hobby to have, and that's when we decided to make a business out of it.
A brand developed along with a design language, and we ended up winning a Best of Year Award with Interior Design magazine. After its publication, our first client, the Four Seasons Hotel, called - and we suddenly had an order for 20 pieces for their new Seattle hotel. That's when we knew we had developed something with legs.
NYS: What were your respective backgrounds?
Eric Chang of Hellman-Chang:  We are both self-taught in design. I went to New York University's Stern School

Eric Chang

of Business and studied Finance and Marketing. Dan went to Northwestern's School of Music and majored in Classical Guitar performance.
NYS: What was the goal you had in mind when you began your luxury furniture line?
Eric Chang of Hellman-Chang: The goal has always been to design the most beautiful, clean, simple, yet timeless furniture in the world, while building the finest-made furniture in the world. What our clients found interesting was that it is all made in Brooklyn, New York-not a location synonymous with those characteristics. We had fallen in love with the traditional handcrafted process of woodworking back in those days as teenagers in the garage. When we started building furniture for clients, we never wanted to stray from that process. Each Hellman-Chang piece is built with passion and integrity of the craft. Simply as a result of that uncompromising craftsmanship, our pieces were labor intensive and built from quality materials, and therefore had to demand a high price point and fall within the luxury market.
NYS: What kind of old-world techniques do you use when creating your handcrafted furniture?
Eric Chang of Hellman-Chang: We use as much solid wood as we can, and where it makes sense. And traditional joinery techniques like mortise-and-tenon, which is meant to last for generations. Much of the dynamic shaping you see in our lines, which we're known for, are also cut and sculpted by hand with old-world hand-tools like spoke shaves, rasps and hand-planes.
NYS: Where do you craft your furniture?
Eric Chang of Hellman-Chang: Our furniture is made-to-order, and bench-made in our 11,000 square foot Brooklyn studio.


Sternum Chaise by Don Howell for Hellman-Chang

 
NYS: What are the advantages of working in a space that also houses a woodworkers' co-op?
Eric Chang of Hellman-Chang: When Dan and I started out in the woodworking co-op, we were a couple of young guys sharing space and learning from other artists, woodworkers, and cabinetmakers. It was an invaluable experience and a wonderful environment to cut our teeth and make long-lasting friendships. When we started our own studio, we felt it was important to dedicate a space to a similar co-op. Doing so has allowed us to remained immersed in the creative energy that has defined Brooklyn in the past few years. It's great to exchange ideas, see new things and continue to grow those relationships as well as help foster young talent. Our new Sternum Chaise was a great by-product of our co-op. A talented craftsman, Don Howell, was a member and created this beautiful piece on his own that we then took into our line-a first for Hellman-Chang.
NYS: Where do you source your materials? Do you ever base your designs on what materials are more readily available?
Eric Chang of Hellman-Chang: Most of our vendors and suppliers are in the New York area. We have a lumber supplier in the Bronx, and our metal and glass vendors are down the street from us. We do have another lumber supplier in Ohio, but most of the woods are North American Hardwoods. We try to stay away from anything exotic and endangered. The materials themselves do not dictate our designs, but they do influence our finishes, which is something we've become known for as well. Our woods include American Black Walnut, White Oak and Sapele, and we now have 18 different finishes in those species. Each wood has its own natural characteristics of grain pattern and tones. I usually pull inspiration from the fashion industry to then develop new colors and stains that can work on these individual wood species.
NYS: What are some of the design aspects unique to Hellman-Chang?
Eric Chang of Hellman-Chang:  There are dynamic lines and hand-cut surfaces and facets that create a sense of movement in our pieces that are recognizable in our line. There's an emotional connection we try to create, as people are usually drawn to want to touch these surfaces. We design with a strong sense of proportion and negative space, with pieces that can change drastically as you view from different angles. Our pieces often grow on you, spending more time with them always reveals things you hadn't noticed earlier.

Z Pedestal Table


 
NYS: What are your favorite pieces, respectively? Why so?
Eric Chang of Hellman-Chang:  The Z pedestal is my favorite because that was the piece that started it all. We won recognition for it from the Best of Year award, and instantly started getting requests to grow it into a full range of new product offerings. My favorite piece in that line would be the Z Quad Dining Table, which is a very dynamic large table with very sleek and memorable lines.

Lin Extension Dining Table

 
NYS: Do you do custom work? Commercial work? Do you work with the trade?

Eric Chang of Hellman-Chang: We are sold through the trade exclusively, and nearly all of the pieces we sell are customized in some way. Our pieces are considered major investment pieces to our clients. Like a made-to-measure tailored suit, we make sure that each piece is exact to the clients' individual needs. That's why interior designers are so important to us, and to the end-client. We have a wide range of options for each of our pieces, and designers help ensure the end result is perfect. This includes both private residential and commercial clients.
NYS: Is there a commercial space outfitted with designs from Hellman-Chang?
Eric Chang of Hellman-Chang: There are a number of executive and CEO offices, lobbies and conference rooms outfitted with our pieces, as well as a number of luxury hotels including the Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, Waldorf Astoria, Mandarin Oriental, Intercontinental, the Cosmopolitan, and the Setai to name a few.
NYS: What is a design you are working on now that has you both excited?
Eric Chang of Hellman-Chang:  I'm most excited about our new seating pieces, including our Tao lounge chair that incorporates our trademark focus on negative space, and also features a strong geometric sensibility, which is softened through the luxurious upholstery.


Z Quad Dining Table

 
NYS: Your furniture line includes many modern yet industrial pieces. What draws you both to the combination of woods and metals?
Eric Chang of Hellman-Chang: Our foundation has always been solid wood-the process we originally fell in love with. There's a romance, history and story to solid wood that everyone can relate to and it cannot be replicated by any other material in the world. One of the great things about wood is its versatility and ability to work well with other materials like glass, stones and metals. The natural touch of wood becomes accentuated and highlighted when it comes in contrast with the other industrial materials. Mixing elevates the beauty of everything.
NYS: Where do you see Hellman-Chang in the future?
Eric Chang of Hellman-Chang: We've been fortunate enough that the Hellman-Chang brand has grown associations larger than furniture. It will allow us to grow into including all things beautiful for the home - including lighting, fabrics, textiles and table top. We are excited to see where the company, and our clients, take us.
NYS: Where can we find you?
Eric Chang of Hellman-Chang: We are found in designer showrooms around the country in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Miami, Boston, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Denver, Scottsdale, Washington DC, and Laguna Beach. And of course, you can learn more about our line at our website, www.hellman-chang.com.
