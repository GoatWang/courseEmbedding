 Bell All-Star Leonard Harvey Nitz: A True Olympian

When Leonard Harvey Nitz attended his first world championships as a junior bike racer in 1975, no American had won a medal at the world or Olympic level in seven decades. As Nitz says: “American bike racing was in the stone ages. At junior worlds, I was warming up in blue jeans. I didn’t even own a pair of tights!” And though he went on to race at three Olympiads and won two medals in the ’84 LA Games, he remained a true amateur. “A lot of people wondered why I never turned pro,” he says. “But I was very happy where I was at.”
Born in Ohio, Nitz moved with his family to Northern California when he was a year old. Today, at age 60, he still lives in the Sacramento area, where he’s a highly respected cycling coach — and masters racer. Nitz says the Olympic spirit is something that’s been with him since childhood: “Every Olympic Games, my whole family would sit in front of the TV. And when I was about 11 and met my first Olympian, speed skater Bill Disney, I was so much in awe. Around the same time, I met another Olympic speed skater, Buddy Campbell, who was also a track cyclist. He said, ‘Anybody can become a world champion if they desire it deep enough and they have the willpower to train hard enough.’ So I wondered if I could too … .”
Nitz saw his first bike race at the Encino Velodrome in Los Angeles. “I was thinking, these guys are nuts,” he says. “I’d never ride a bike without brakes.” A few years later, when Nitz was 15, “a kid down the street talked me into riding the Davis Double Century. It took me like 17 hours — and took me two months to recover from!” But a year later, he repeated that 200-mile ride.
At 17, Nitz and “that kid” began bike racing. “My first race was the Tour of Nevada City, one of the hardest races in California! I was lapped. My second race was the Chico Criterium. I got lapped by a guy on a solo breakaway. I jumped on his wheel, but two laps later he turned around — I looked so bad and had no shaved legs — and he told me to get off his wheel. That gentleman’s name was Jacques Boyer [who’d become the first American to ride the Tour de France].”
Despite his inauspicious start, Nitz raced once more that year, the district road championships. “There were 109 juniors on the line,” he recalls. “It was a dead-flat circuit in the San Joaquin Valley and came down to a field sprint. I ended up getting third. I was pretty excited about that!” Excited enough to start racing every weekend the following year. And despite saying he’d never do track racing, he took it up and promptly won the individual pursuit at the junior worlds trials. Within two years, he raced the individual and team pursuit events at the Montreal Olympics. He was living the dream.
“I was still training without a helmet,” Nitz says. “But I grew up on a motorcycle and always wore a helmet on my dirt bike.” So when he was given one of the first Bell bicycle helmets in 1975, he first used it for mountain biking. “I was falling down a lot,” he says, “so I wore the helmet all the time. And when I got on a road bike, I felt naked.” As a result, Nitz was one of the first road racers to use a hard-shell helmet — a decade before they became mandatory.
That rule didn’t get approved until 1986, so Nitz’s favorite Bell helmet from the ’84 Olympics “was just about aerodynamics.” He wore that aero helmet to win medals in both pursuit events. His opponent in the individual pursuit third-place final was Dean Woods of Australia. “I was a second-and-a-half down on him after three laps,” Nitz says. “So I had to get into my head: ‘This is the Olympics Games — you’ve got to get going.’ With three laps to go, I was still down. It was now or never. I caught him by surprise. I was sprinting, but I was dying, coming apart. My arms were twitching, starting to lose control of the muscles. I was ahead with a lap to go, but he came back — and I won by just five-hundredths of a second. I was ecstatic getting that bronze medal!”



 

 

Nitz again faced Dean, each with their three teammates, in the team pursuit final. Unfortunately, one of the Americans pulled a foot out of his pedal on the start line. “We tried hard,” Nitz remembers, “but with only three guys we couldn’t beat the Aussies.” So it was silver for the home team. Nitz went on to take a bronze medal in the points race at the ’86 worlds in Colorado Springs, and rode his third Olympics at Seoul in 1988.
Through his elite career, Nitz had occasional crashes, including one at the ’87 track nationals. “My front wheel dropped off during the kilo,” he says. “The doctor said he wouldn’t touch me. ‘But I just fell on my face,’ I pleaded. He called in the plastic surgeon, and it turned out to be 100 stitches.”
Nitz says his most serious crash was his own fault. “I got back from a bike race, unpacked my bike from the plane, spun my pedal on, and the telephone rang. I answered the phone and didn’t tighten the pedal. The next day when I’m riding, the pedal starts unspinning. I’m doing 5 miles per hour up a hill, step down, pedal comes off, foot goes down, my whole body rotates and I’m going down, hitting my back and whiplashing my head to the ground. The whole back end of my helmet was caved in. I just said to myself, my helmet just saved my life — and that was a Bell helmet.”
Leonard Harvey Nitz was inducted into the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame in 1996.

History[edit]
Alexion Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1992 at Science Park in New Haven, Connecticut by Leonard Bell.[6] Bell would serve as the company's CEO until 2015.[7] In 2000, Alexion moved its headquarters from New Haven to Cheshire, Connecticut. Alexion moved back to New Haven following the completion of New Haven's Downtown Crossing project in December 2015 - Alexion's new headquarters are located at 100 College Street
Since 2006, Alexion has been a supporter of Healthcare Research and Quality studies at Duke University for aspirin and Clopidogrel (trade name Plavix).[6]
Alexion received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Soliris in 2007. It was initially approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disorder.[4] In 2010, there was an outbreak of hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) in Germany. Soliris was considered as a treatment option due to its effectiveness in treating Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, an illness similar to the one caused by the EHEC infection. As a result, Alexion's German subsidiary provided an unspecified number of Soliris doses at no charge to physicians who requested it.[8]
In April 2011, Alexion was added to the NASDAQ-100, a group composed of the 100 largest non-financial stocks traded on the Nasdaq; with a market value of USD 8.5 billion it replaced Genzyme Corporation.[9]
In April 2015, Bell was replaced as CEO by David Hallal.[7] In 2016, the company became a member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).[10]
In December 2016, Alexion's board of directors announced new leadership. The board identified David Brennan, formerly of AZ and a current board member as the interim CEO to replace David Hallal. David Anderson, formerly the CFO of Honeywell, was appointed as the new CFO replacing Vikas Sinha.[11] In March 2017, Alexion named Ludwig N. Hantson as its new CEO.[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2000, Alexion purchased Proliferon Inc., a San Diego, California based development-stage biopharmaceutical firm, for US$41 million in Alexion stock. Alexion CEO, Leonard Bell, cited Proliferon's ability to produce an "unlimited amount of antibodies" as the reason for the acquisition. At the time Proliferon's annual revenue was about $2.5 million and its assets were valued at $2.1 million.[13][14] The company has since been renamed Alexion Antibody Technologies Inc.
In December 2011, Alexion acquired Montreal-based Enobia Pharma Corp for $610 million upfront and up to another $470 million later, contingent on company sales and regulatory goals. The $610 million includes $300 million in bank debt. Enobia is the developer of asfotase alpha, a drug used to treat the genetic disorder hypophosphatasia.[15]
In May 2015, Alexion announced plans to purchase the Lexington firm Synageva BioPharma, a maker of rare disease treatments run by ex-Genzyme executive Sanj Patel, who negotiated an $8.4 billion stock-and-cash deal.[16] In the deal, each share of Synageva, which is traded on NASDAQ, will be exchanged for $115 in cash and 0.6581 shares of Alexion stock. The price represented more than a 135% premium over Synageva's market cap at the time.[7] It also represents a valuation of about ten times projected peak sales, double what is typical for the biotech industry.[17] Analysis by The Wall Street Journal suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.[7] Alexion is thus seeking a stronger position in the lucrative rare disease market, and is willing to pay a premium to obtain that position. The rare disease market is seen as desirable because insurers have minimal motive to deny claims (due to small population sizes of patients) and are unable to negotiate better drug prices due to lack of competition.[18]
Alexion said it expects to save $150 million in costs by the end of 2017 by combining with Synageva. It does not expect revenue and earnings per share to increase until 2018. The deal would give Alexion a total of eight drugs in clinical trials, and 30 others in preclinical trials. Synageva's main drug, Kanuma, could receive approval in the United States and Europe as early as the third quarter of 2015.[7] The boards of both companies have approved the merger which is expected to complete in mid-2015.[18] Alexion shares fell 8.9% the day after the deal was announced.[7]

Products[edit]
Specialty drugs[edit]
Main article: Specialty drugs
Alexion has employed a strategy of developing drugs to combat rare diseases. Since the targeted user base is small for such drugs, clinical drugs tend to be quicker and cheaper than those for mass market drugs. Additionally, big pharmaceutical companies have tended to ignore these markets, creating a niche with minimal competition for Alexion. Insurance companies have generally been willing to pay high prices for such drugs; since few of their customers need the drugs, a high price does not significantly impact the insurance companies outlays.[17] "The success of specialty drugs for rare diseases comes at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses is in decline...Specialty drugs have gotten more expensive than anyone imagined."[20]
Soliris[edit]
Main article: Eculizumab
Alexion's first drug, Soliris, used to treat the rare disorders atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).[3] It has been approved for use in Canada, the European Union, Japan, and the United States; however, availability in Canada is limited. In Canada, access to the drug is mostly through private clinics; groups such as the Canadian Association of PNH Patients are lobbying to change that.[21] The drug costs roughly $450,000 a year, and is considered the world's most expensive drug.[4][7] The price of the drug is so high that very few individuals can pay the price. As a result, Alexion hires public relations firms to help families institute campaigns to pressure their governments to pay for the drug. Alexion is putting pressure on to governments to receive their payments from the public purse. The prices charged have a very high margin above the cost price. In addition, much of the research for the development of Soliris originates from publicly funded universities. There is an ethical question as to the pricing of the drug and the ethics of the drug manufacturer. Alexion is well on the way to developing a second very high price and high margined drug.[22]
In September 2011, the FDA officially approved the use of Soliris as a treatment for atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome in both adults and children. More than half of people with aHUS end up dying of it as a result of damage to vital organs/organ failure (usually involving the kidneys) caused by uncontrolled complement activation. The FDA's decision to grant approval received a positive response from the medical community with the director of Pediatric Nephrology at Atlanta's Children's hospital calling it "the most important advance that has been made for patients and families with this disease".[23]
By 2010 Soliris was considered to be the most expensive drug in the world.[20] It costs £340,200 per year for treatment in the UK[24][25] and $500,000 a year in Canada.[24][25][26] and US$409,500 a year in the United States (2010).[20] In the case of the rarest diseases that afflict fewer than 10,000 people, biotech companies who own the only approved drugs to treat those diseases "can charge pretty much whatever they want." "Before testing Soliris for PNH, Alexion tested the drug for rheumatoid arthritis, which afflicts 1 million Americans. The trials failed. But if it had worked for arthritis, Alexion would likely have had to charge a much lower price for this use, as it would have to compete against drugs that cost a mere $20,000." Alexion started selling Soliris in 2008 making $295 million in 2007 with its stock price rising to 130% in 2010.[26]
In April and May 2013, a controversy arose in Belgium when the media revealed that the government had refused to pay for a seven-year-old boy's treatment because Soliris was too expensive. The boy's medicine cost 9,000 euros every two weeks.[27] On May 4, 2013, De Standaard reported that a press relations (PR) agency working for Alexion had helped the boy's parents communicate their story to the press.[28] It was also reported that the parents had believed their benefactor was a Dutch organization for patients, and that the PR agency acted with permission from Alexion.[29][30] Several politicians stated that the company was attempting to 'blackmail' the government, charges which Alexion denied.[31] By May 7, 2013 an agreement had been reached to reimburse the medicine.[32][33]
Pharma, the Belgian pharmaceutical industry's association, opened an internal investigation into the affair, for possible breach of the association's ethical standards by Alexion. However, on June 12, Alexion received a court gag order against Pharma, preventing it from communicating its investigation. At the same time, Pharma opened a court case against Alexion Pharma Belgium. The gag order was revoked by the end of September 2013,[34] but the case was still pending in March 2015.[33]
Strensiq[edit]
In October 2015, Alexion's second drug, Strensiq (asfotase alfa), was approved by the US FDA. It is used to treat hypophosphatasia, a rare metabolic disorder.
Kanuma[edit]
Kanuma, which Alexion acquired in its acquisition of Synageva, was approved in 2015 to treat Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency, a fatal genetic disorder that cause fatty material to build up in blood vessel walls, the liver, and other tissues.[7] Alexion estimates that the drug could eventually have annual sales of more than $1 billion.[18]
Financials[edit]
In 2013, 36% Alexion's sales originated in the US, down from 37% the previous year; 33% came from Europe, down from 35%; Japan accounted for just over 10%. Revenue was impacted by higher unit volumes for Soliris (up 40%), and a decreased average price related to rebates in Europe. Acquisition related costs fell significantly from $22 million to just $5 million.[35] R&D spending reached a record high of $317 million in 2013 up 83% from the previous year.[6]
When Soliris was first approved, peak annual sales were estimated at $150 million.[17] However, by September 2013 quarterly sales of Soliris topped $400 million. Sales during the first quarter of 2015 were just over US$600 million, and are still on the rise.[7][17]
Before the Synageva purchase announcement, Alexion was valued at $34 billion.[7] The stock is up roughly 800% in the last five years and is currently trading at 46 times estimated earnings. Due to the niche nature of its market and the high cost of Soliris, the company has enjoyed a high profit margin.[17]

History[edit]
Alexion Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1992 at Science Park in New Haven, Connecticut by Leonard Bell.[6] Bell would serve as the company's CEO until 2015.[7] In 2000, Alexion moved its headquarters from New Haven to Cheshire, Connecticut. Alexion moved back to New Haven following the completion of New Haven's Downtown Crossing project in December 2015 - Alexion's new headquarters are located at 100 College Street
Since 2006, Alexion has been a supporter of Healthcare Research and Quality studies at Duke University for aspirin and Clopidogrel (trade name Plavix).[6]
Alexion received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Soliris in 2007. It was initially approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disorder.[4] In 2010, there was an outbreak of hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) in Germany. Soliris was considered as a treatment option due to its effectiveness in treating Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, an illness similar to the one caused by the EHEC infection. As a result, Alexion's German subsidiary provided an unspecified number of Soliris doses at no charge to physicians who requested it.[8]
In April 2011, Alexion was added to the NASDAQ-100, a group composed of the 100 largest non-financial stocks traded on the Nasdaq; with a market value of USD 8.5 billion it replaced Genzyme Corporation.[9]
In April 2015, Bell was replaced as CEO by David Hallal.[7] In 2016, the company became a member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).[10]
In December 2016, Alexion's board of directors announced new leadership. The board identified David Brennan, formerly of AZ and a current board member as the interim CEO to replace David Hallal. David Anderson, formerly the CFO of Honeywell, was appointed as the new CFO replacing Vikas Sinha.[11] In March 2017, Alexion named Ludwig N. Hantson as its new CEO.[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2000, Alexion purchased Proliferon Inc., a San Diego, California based development-stage biopharmaceutical firm, for US$41 million in Alexion stock. Alexion CEO, Leonard Bell, cited Proliferon's ability to produce an "unlimited amount of antibodies" as the reason for the acquisition. At the time Proliferon's annual revenue was about $2.5 million and its assets were valued at $2.1 million.[13][14] The company has since been renamed Alexion Antibody Technologies Inc.
In December 2011, Alexion acquired Montreal-based Enobia Pharma Corp for $610 million upfront and up to another $470 million later, contingent on company sales and regulatory goals. The $610 million includes $300 million in bank debt. Enobia is the developer of asfotase alpha, a drug used to treat the genetic disorder hypophosphatasia.[15]
In May 2015, Alexion announced plans to purchase the Lexington firm Synageva BioPharma, a maker of rare disease treatments run by ex-Genzyme executive Sanj Patel, who negotiated an $8.4 billion stock-and-cash deal.[16] In the deal, each share of Synageva, which is traded on NASDAQ, will be exchanged for $115 in cash and 0.6581 shares of Alexion stock. The price represented more than a 135% premium over Synageva's market cap at the time.[7] It also represents a valuation of about ten times projected peak sales, double what is typical for the biotech industry.[17] Analysis by The Wall Street Journal suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.[7] Alexion is thus seeking a stronger position in the lucrative rare disease market, and is willing to pay a premium to obtain that position. The rare disease market is seen as desirable because insurers have minimal motive to deny claims (due to small population sizes of patients) and are unable to negotiate better drug prices due to lack of competition.[18]
Alexion said it expects to save $150 million in costs by the end of 2017 by combining with Synageva. It does not expect revenue and earnings per share to increase until 2018. The deal would give Alexion a total of eight drugs in clinical trials, and 30 others in preclinical trials. Synageva's main drug, Kanuma, could receive approval in the United States and Europe as early as the third quarter of 2015.[7] The boards of both companies have approved the merger which is expected to complete in mid-2015.[18] Alexion shares fell 8.9% the day after the deal was announced.[7]

Acquisition related costs fell significantly from $22 million to just $5 million.[35] R&D spending reached a record high of $317 million in 2013 up 83% from the previous year.[6]
When Soliris was first approved, peak annual sales were estimated at $150 million.[17] However, by September 2013 quarterly sales of Soliris topped $400 million. Sales during the first quarter of 2015 were just over US$600 million, and are still on the rise.[7][17]
Before the Synageva purchase announcement, Alexion was valued at $34 billion.[7] The stock is up roughly 800% in the last five years and is currently trading at 46 times estimated earnings. Due to the niche nature of its market and the high cost of Soliris, the company has enjoyed a high profit margin.[17]

History[edit]
Alexion Pharmaceuticals was founded in 1992 at Science Park in New Haven, Connecticut by Leonard Bell.[6] Bell would serve as the company's CEO until 2015.[7] In 2000, Alexion moved its headquarters from New Haven to Cheshire, Connecticut. Alexion moved back to New Haven following the completion of New Haven's Downtown Crossing project in December 2015 - Alexion's new headquarters are located at 100 College Street
Since 2006, Alexion has been a supporter of Healthcare Research and Quality studies at Duke University for aspirin and Clopidogrel (trade name Plavix).[6]
Alexion received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Soliris in 2007. It was initially approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disorder.[4] In 2010, there was an outbreak of hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) in Germany. Soliris was considered as a treatment option due to its effectiveness in treating Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, an illness similar to the one caused by the EHEC infection. As a result, Alexion's German subsidiary provided an unspecified number of Soliris doses at no charge to physicians who requested it.[8]
In April 2011, Alexion was added to the NASDAQ-100, a group composed of the 100 largest non-financial stocks traded on the Nasdaq; with a market value of USD 8.5 billion it replaced Genzyme Corporation.[9]
In April 2015, Bell was replaced as CEO by David Hallal.[7] In 2016, the company became a member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).[10]
In December 2016, Alexion's board of directors announced new leadership. The board identified David Brennan, formerly of AZ and a current board member as the interim CEO to replace David Hallal. David Anderson, formerly the CFO of Honeywell, was appointed as the new CFO replacing Vikas Sinha.[11] In March 2017, Alexion named Ludwig N. Hantson as its new CEO.[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2000, Alexion purchased Proliferon Inc., a San Diego, California based development-stage biopharmaceutical firm, for US$41 million in Alexion stock. Alexion CEO, Leonard Bell, cited Proliferon's ability to produce an "unlimited amount of antibodies" as the reason for the acquisition. At the time Proliferon's annual revenue was about $2.5 million and its assets were valued at $2.1 million.[13][14] The company has since been renamed Alexion Antibody Technologies Inc.
In December 2011, Alexion acquired Montreal-based Enobia Pharma Corp for $610 million upfront and up to another $470 million later, contingent on company sales and regulatory goals. The $610 million includes $300 million in bank debt. Enobia is the developer of asfotase alpha, a drug used to treat the genetic disorder hypophosphatasia.[15]
In May 2015, Alexion announced plans to purchase the Lexington firm Synageva BioPharma, a maker of rare disease treatments run by ex-Genzyme executive Sanj Patel, who negotiated an $8.4 billion stock-and-cash deal.[16] In the deal, each share of Synageva, which is traded on NASDAQ, will be exchanged for $115 in cash and 0.6581 shares of Alexion stock. The price represented more than a 135% premium over Synageva's market cap at the time.[7] It also represents a valuation of about ten times projected peak sales, double what is typical for the biotech industry.[17] Analysis by The Wall Street Journal suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.[7] Alexion is thus seeking a stronger position in the lucrative rare disease market, and is willing to pay a premium to obtain that position. The rare disease market is seen as desirable because insurers have minimal motive to deny claims (due to small population sizes of patients) and are unable to negotiate better drug prices due to lack of competition.[18]
Alexion said it expects to save $150 million in costs by the end of 2017 by combining with Synageva. It does not expect revenue and earnings per share to increase until 2018. The deal would give Alexion a total of eight drugs in clinical trials, and 30 others in preclinical trials. Synageva's main drug, Kanuma, could receive approval in the United States and Europe as early as the third quarter of 2015.[7] The boards of both companies have approved the merger which is expected to complete in mid-2015.[18] Alexion shares fell 8.9% the day after the deal was announced.[7]

Products[edit]
Specialty drugs[edit]
Main article: Specialty drugs
Alexion has employed a strategy of developing drugs to combat rare diseases. Since the targeted user base is small for such drugs, clinical drugs tend to be quicker and cheaper than those for mass market drugs. Additionally, big pharmaceutical companies have tended to ignore these markets, creating a niche with minimal competition for Alexion. Insurance companies have generally been willing to pay high prices for such drugs; since few of their customers need the drugs, a high price does not significantly impact the insurance companies outlays.[17] "The success of specialty drugs for rare diseases comes at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses is in decline...Specialty drugs have gotten more expensive than anyone imagined."[20]
Soliris[edit]
Main article: Eculizumab
Alexion's first drug, Soliris, used to treat the rare disorders atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).[3] It has been approved for use in Canada, the European Union, Japan, and the United States; however, availability in Canada is limited. In Canada, access to the drug is mostly through private clinics; groups such as the Canadian Association of PNH Patients are lobbying to change that.[21] The drug costs roughly $450,000 a year, and is considered the world's most expensive drug.[4][7] The price of the drug is so high that very few individuals can pay the price. As a result, Alexion hires public relations firms to help families institute campaigns to pressure their governments to pay for the drug. Alexion is putting pressure on to governments to receive their payments from the public purse. The prices charged have a very high margin above the cost price. In addition, much of the research for the development of Soliris originates from publicly funded universities. There is an ethical question as to the pricing of the drug and the ethics of the drug manufacturer. Alexion is well on the way to developing a second very high price and high margined drug.[22]
In September 2011, the FDA officially approved the use of Soliris as a treatment for atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome in both adults and children. More than half of people with aHUS end up dying of it as a result of damage to vital organs/organ failure (usually involving the kidneys) caused by uncontrolled complement activation. The FDA's decision to grant approval received a positive response from the medical community with the director of Pediatric Nephrology at Atlanta's Children's hospital calling it "the most important advance that has been made for patients and families with this disease".[23]
By 2010 Soliris was considered to be the most expensive drug in the world.[20] It costs £340,200 per year for treatment in the UK[24][25] and $500,000 a year in Canada.[24][25][26] and US$409,500 a year in the United States (2010).[20] In the case of the rarest diseases that afflict fewer than 10,000 people, biotech companies who own the only approved drugs to treat those diseases "can charge pretty much whatever they want." "Before testing Soliris for PNH, Alexion tested the drug for rheumatoid arthritis, which afflicts 1 million Americans. The trials failed. But if it had worked for arthritis, Alexion would likely have had to charge a much lower price for this use, as it would have to compete against drugs that cost a mere $20,000." Alexion started selling Soliris in 2008 making $295 million in 2007 with its stock price rising to 130% in 2010.[26]
In April and May 2013, a controversy arose in Belgium when the media revealed that the government had refused to pay for a seven-year-old boy's treatment because Soliris was too expensive. The boy's medicine cost 9,000 euros every two weeks.[27] On May 4, 2013, De Standaard reported that a press relations (PR) agency working for Alexion had helped the boy's parents communicate their story to the press.[28] It was also reported that the parents had believed their benefactor was a Dutch organization for patients, and that the PR agency acted with permission from Alexion.[29][30] Several politicians stated that the company was attempting to 'blackmail' the government, charges which Alexion denied.[31] By May 7, 2013 an agreement had been reached to reimburse the medicine.[32][33]
Pharma, the Belgian pharmaceutical industry's association, opened an internal investigation into the affair, for possible breach of the association's ethical standards by Alexion. However, on June 12, Alexion received a court gag order against Pharma, preventing it from communicating its investigation. At the same time, Pharma opened a court case against Alexion Pharma Belgium. The gag order was revoked by the end of September 2013,[34] but the case was still pending in March 2015.[33]
Strensiq[edit]
In October 2015, Alexion's second drug, Strensiq (asfotase alfa), was approved by the US FDA. It is used to treat hypophosphatasia, a rare metabolic disorder.
Kanuma[edit]
Kanuma, which Alexion acquired in its acquisition of Synageva, was approved in 2015 to treat Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency, a fatal genetic disorder that cause fatty material to build up in blood vessel walls, the liver, and other tissues.[7] Alexion estimates that the drug could eventually have annual sales of more than $1 billion.[18]
Financials[edit]
In 2013, 36% Alexion's sales originated in the US, down from 37% the previous year; 33% came from Europe, down from 35%; Japan accounted for just over 10%. Revenue was impacted by higher unit volumes for Soliris (up 40%), and a decreased average price related to rebates in Europe. Acquisition related costs fell significantly from $22 million to just $5 million.[35] R&D spending reached a record high of $317 million in 2013 up 83% from the previous year.[6]
When Soliris was first approved, peak annual sales were estimated at $150 million.[17] However, by September 2013 quarterly sales of Soliris topped $400 million. Sales during the first quarter of 2015 were just over US$600 million, and are still on the rise.[7][17]
Before the Synageva purchase announcement, Alexion was valued at $34 billion.[7] The stock is up roughly 800% in the last five years and is currently trading at 46 times estimated earnings. Due to the niche nature of its market and the high cost of Soliris, the company has enjoyed a high profit margin.[17]

Alexion moved back to New Haven following the completion of New Haven's Downtown Crossing project in December 2015 - Alexion's new headquarters are located at 100 College Street
Since 2006, Alexion has been a supporter of Healthcare Research and Quality studies at Duke University for aspirin and Clopidogrel (trade name Plavix).[6]
Alexion received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Soliris in 2007. It was initially approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disorder.[4] In 2010, there was an outbreak of hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) in Germany. Soliris was considered as a treatment option due to its effectiveness in treating Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, an illness similar to the one caused by the EHEC infection. As a result, Alexion's German subsidiary provided an unspecified number of Soliris doses at no charge to physicians who requested it.[8]
In April 2011, Alexion was added to the NASDAQ-100, a group composed of the 100 largest non-financial stocks traded on the Nasdaq; with a market value of USD 8.5 billion it replaced Genzyme Corporation.[9]
In April 2015, Bell was replaced as CEO by David Hallal.[7] In 2016, the company became a member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).[10]
In December 2016, Alexion's board of directors announced new leadership. The board identified David Brennan, formerly of AZ and a current board member as the interim CEO to replace David Hallal. David Anderson, formerly the CFO of Honeywell, was appointed as the new CFO replacing Vikas Sinha.[11] In March 2017, Alexion named Ludwig N. Hantson as its new CEO.[12]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2000, Alexion purchased Proliferon Inc., a San Diego, California based development-stage biopharmaceutical firm, for US$41 million in Alexion stock. Alexion CEO, Leonard Bell, cited Proliferon's ability to produce an "unlimited amount of antibodies" as the reason for the acquisition. At the time Proliferon's annual revenue was about $2.5 million and its assets were valued at $2.1 million.[13][14] The company has since been renamed Alexion Antibody Technologies Inc.
In December 2011, Alexion acquired Montreal-based Enobia Pharma Corp for $610 million upfront and up to another $470 million later, contingent on company sales and regulatory goals. The $610 million includes $300 million in bank debt. Enobia is the developer of asfotase alpha, a drug used to treat the genetic disorder hypophosphatasia.[15]
In May 2015, Alexion announced plans to purchase the Lexington firm Synageva BioPharma, a maker of rare disease treatments run by ex-Genzyme executive Sanj Patel, who negotiated an $8.4 billion stock-and-cash deal.[16] In the deal, each share of Synageva, which is traded on NASDAQ, will be exchanged for $115 in cash and 0.6581 shares of Alexion stock. The price represented more than a 135% premium over Synageva's market cap at the time.[7] It also represents a valuation of about ten times projected peak sales, double what is typical for the biotech industry.[17] Analysis by The Wall Street Journal suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases.[7] Alexion is thus seeking a stronger position in the lucrative rare disease market, and is willing to pay a premium to obtain that position. The rare disease market is seen as desirable because insurers have minimal motive to deny claims (due to small population sizes of patients) and are unable to negotiate better drug prices due to lack of competition.[18]
Alexion said it expects to save $150 million in costs by the end of 2017 by combining with Synageva. It does not expect revenue and earnings per share to increase until 2018. The deal would give Alexion a total of eight drugs in clinical trials, and 30 others in preclinical trials. Synageva's main drug, Kanuma, could receive approval in the United States and Europe as early as the third quarter of 2015.[7] The boards of both companies have approved the merger which is expected to complete in mid-2015.[18] Alexion shares fell 8.9% the day after the deal was announced.[7]

Products[edit]
Specialty drugs[edit]
Main article: Specialty drugs
Alexion has employed a strategy of developing drugs to combat rare diseases. Since the targeted user base is small for such drugs, clinical drugs tend to be quicker and cheaper than those for mass market drugs. Additionally, big pharmaceutical companies have tended to ignore these markets, creating a niche with minimal competition for Alexion. Insurance companies have generally been willing to pay high prices for such drugs; since few of their customers need the drugs, a high price does not significantly impact the insurance companies outlays.[17] "The success of specialty drugs for rare diseases comes at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses is in decline...Specialty drugs have gotten more expensive than anyone imagined."[20]
Soliris[edit]
Main article: Eculizumab
Alexion's first drug, Soliris, used to treat the rare disorders atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).[3] It has been approved for use in Canada, the European Union, Japan, and the United States; however, availability in Canada is limited. In Canada, access to the drug is mostly through private clinics; groups such as the Canadian Association of PNH Patients are lobbying to change that.[21] The drug costs roughly $450,000 a year, and is considered the world's most expensive drug.[4][7] The price of the drug is so high that very few individuals can pay the price. As a result, Alexion hires public relations firms to help families institute campaigns to pressure their governments to pay for the drug. Alexion is putting pressure on to governments to receive their payments from the public purse. The prices charged have a very high margin above the cost price. In addition, much of the research for the development of Soliris originates from publicly funded universities. There is an ethical question as to the pricing of the drug and the ethics of the drug manufacturer. Alexion is well on the way to developing a second very high price and high margined drug.[22]
In September 2011, the FDA officially approved the use of Soliris as a treatment for atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome in both adults and children. More than half of people with aHUS end up dying of it as a result of damage to vital organs/organ failure (usually involving the kidneys) caused by uncontrolled complement activation. The FDA's decision to grant approval received a positive response from the medical community with the director of Pediatric Nephrology at Atlanta's Children's hospital calling it "the most important advance that has been made for patients and families with this disease".[23]
By 2010 Soliris was considered to be the most expensive drug in the world.[20] It costs £340,200 per year for treatment in the UK[24][25] and $500,000 a year in Canada.[24][25][26] and US$409,500 a year in the United States (2010).[20] In the case of the rarest diseases that afflict fewer than 10,000 people, biotech companies who own the only approved drugs to treat those diseases "can charge pretty much whatever they want." "Before testing Soliris for PNH, Alexion tested the drug for rheumatoid arthritis, which afflicts 1 million Americans. The trials failed. But if it had worked for arthritis, Alexion would likely have had to charge a much lower price for this use, as it would have to compete against drugs that cost a mere $20,000." Alexion started selling Soliris in 2008 making $295 million in 2007 with its stock price rising to 130% in 2010.[26]
In April and May 2013, a controversy arose in Belgium when the media revealed that the government had refused to pay for a seven-year-old boy's treatment because Soliris was too expensive. The boy's medicine cost 9,000 euros every two weeks.[27] On May 4, 2013, De Standaard reported that a press relations (PR) agency working for Alexion had helped the boy's parents communicate their story to the press.[28] It was also reported that the parents had believed their benefactor was a Dutch organization for patients, and that the PR agency acted with permission from Alexion.[29][30] Several politicians stated that the company was attempting to 'blackmail' the government, charges which Alexion denied.[31] By May 7, 2013 an agreement had been reached to reimburse the medicine.[32][33]
Pharma, the Belgian pharmaceutical industry's association, opened an internal investigation into the affair, for possible breach of the association's ethical standards by Alexion. However, on June 12, Alexion received a court gag order against Pharma, preventing it from communicating its investigation. At the same time, Pharma opened a court case against Alexion Pharma Belgium. The gag order was revoked by the end of September 2013,[34] but the case was still pending in March 2015.[33]
Strensiq[edit]
In October 2015, Alexion's second drug, Strensiq (asfotase alfa), was approved by the US FDA. It is used to treat hypophosphatasia, a rare metabolic disorder.
Kanuma[edit]
Kanuma, which Alexion acquired in its acquisition of Synageva, was approved in 2015 to treat Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency, a fatal genetic disorder that cause fatty material to build up in blood vessel walls, the liver, and other tissues.[7] Alexion estimates that the drug could eventually have annual sales of more than $1 billion.[18]
Financials[edit]
In 2013, 36% Alexion's sales originated in the US, down from 37% the previous year; 33% came from Europe, down from 35%; Japan accounted for just over 10%. Revenue was impacted by higher unit volumes for Soliris (up 40%), and a decreased average price related to rebates in Europe. Acquisition related costs fell significantly from $22 million to just $5 million.[35] R&D spending reached a record high of $317 million in 2013 up 83% from the previous year.[6]
When Soliris was first approved, peak annual sales were estimated at $150 million.[17] However, by September 2013 quarterly sales of Soliris topped $400 million. Sales during the first quarter of 2015 were just over US$600 million, and are still on the rise.[7][17]
Before the Synageva purchase announcement, Alexion was valued at $34 billion.[7] The stock is up roughly 800% in the last five years and is currently trading at 46 times estimated earnings. Due to the niche nature of its market and the high cost of Soliris, the company has enjoyed a high profit margin.[17]

Kanuma, which Alexion acquired in its acquisition of Synageva, was approved in 2015 to treat Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency, a fatal genetic disorder that cause fatty material to build up in blood vessel walls, the liver, and other tissues.[7] Alexion estimates that the drug could eventually have annual sales of more than $1 billion.[18]
Financials[edit]
In 2013, 36% Alexion's sales originated in the US, down from 37% the previous year; 33% came from Europe, down from 35%; Japan accounted for just over 10%. Revenue was impacted by higher unit volumes for Soliris (up 40%), and a decreased average price related to rebates in Europe. Acquisition related costs fell significantly from $22 million to just $5 million.[35] R&D spending reached a record high of $317 million in 2013 up 83% from the previous year.[6]
When Soliris was first approved, peak annual sales were estimated at $150 million.[17] However, by September 2013 quarterly sales of Soliris topped $400 million. Sales during the first quarter of 2015 were just over US$600 million, and are still on the rise.[7][17]
Before the Synageva purchase announcement, Alexion was valued at $34 billion.[7] The stock is up roughly 800% in the last five years and is currently trading at 46 times estimated earnings. Due to the niche nature of its market and the high cost of Soliris, the company has enjoyed a high profit margin.[17]

FIRST WATCH THE VIDEO AT THE BEGINNING OF CLASS, THEN READ THE FOLLOWING FACTS ABOUT THE CASE OF LEONARD VERSUS PEPSI. WHO WOULD YOU SIDE WITH AND WHY?
 
Leonard v. Pepsico: Cold Hard Facts
 
Inspired by the commercial, Leonard set out to obtain a Harrier Jet. Leonard explains that he is "typical of the `Pepsi Generation' ... he is young, has an adventurous spirit, and the notion of obtaining a Harrier Jet appealed to him enormously"….
Although Leonard initially set out to collect 7,000,000 Pepsi Points by consuming Pepsi products, it soon became clear to him that he "would not be able to buy (let alone drink) enough Pepsi to collect the necessary Pepsi Points fast enough." Reevaluating his strategy, Leonard "focused for the first time on the packaging materials in the Pepsi Stuff promotion," and realized that buying Pepsi Points would be a more promising option. Through acquaintances, Leonard ultimately raised about $700,000.
On or about March 27, 1996, Leonard submitted a Pepsi Points Order Form, fifteen original Pepsi Points, and a check for $700,008.50. At the bottom of the Order Form, Leonard wrote in "1 Harrier Jet" in the "Item" column and "7,000,000" in the "Total Points" column. In a letter accompanying his submission, Leonard stated that the check was to purchase additional Pepsi Points "expressly for obtaining a new Harrier jet as advertised in your Pepsi Stuff commercial."
Pepsi rejected Leonard's submission and returned the check. Pepsi explained that: “The item that you have requested is not part of the Pepsi Stuff collection. It is not included in the catalogue or on the order form, and only catalogue merchandise can be redeemed under this program. The Harrier jet in the Pepsi commercial is fanciful and is simply included to create a humorous and entertaining ad. We apologize for any misunderstanding or confusion that you may have experienced and are enclosing some free product coupons for your use.”
Leonard’s lawyer responded to Pepsi by writing: “Your letter is totally unacceptable. We have reviewed the video tape of the Pepsi Stuff commercial ... and it clearly offers the new Harrier jet for 7,000,000 Pepsi Points. Our client followed your rules explicitly....This is a formal demand that you honor your commitment and make immediate arrangements to transfer the new Harrier jet to our client. If we do not receive transfer instructions within ten (10) business days of the date of this letter you will leave us no choice but to file an appropriate action against Pepsi....”
Pepsi refused to honor the letter and Leonard filed suit against them to force them to give him a Harrier jet.

 disapointment
 While I love the look, fit and feel of this top all it does is pill. It is to the point after 2 wearing's that it can only be worn under something else it looks so bad .

 Perfect cut tunic
 Love love love it! The cut is absolutely perfect and I love the fabric. Very soft knit. I ordered my usual size small in the purple. The color is gorgeous. I went back and ordered the teal, which I received yesterday and love it as well. I hesitated to ordervthevteal because it looked like a not particularly pretty shade of blue on my iPad, however, it really is a lovely teal in person. Highly recommend.

 Lovely Bell Sleeved Blouse
 Yet this bell sleeve does not get in the way as many with such sleeves can. The perfect arm length, mine in the XXS (105 lbs, 5'4") Got the spotted color and is great with both my black and or brown slacks/jeans. This can look good with any combo of styling. Very nice fit, just as in description. Would love to get in more colors if they become available again, even if is a returned item...worth the price!
 01-03-14
 so comfortable!
 This is exceptionally made, comfortable and can transform from day to night. I love the ease of care, and NO IRON!

 THIS IS A KEEPER!
 I RECEIVED THIS TUNIC, AND I LOVE IT. I AM 5'3, AND A SIZE 14-16. I ORDERED A SIZE LARGE, AND IT FITS, BUT IT'S NOT TIGHT. I HAVE A MUFFIN TOP, & THIS TUNIC GLIDES OVER IT, INSTEAD OF DRAWING ATTENTION TO IT. THE BOTTOM COMES DOWN OVER MY BUTT & IT HAS SIDE SLITS TO HELP WOMEN WITH HIPS. THE MATERIAL IS SOFT, AND & FEELS GOOD. THE SLEEVES ARE A LITTLE LONG, BUT I HAVE THAT PROBLEM WITH MOST LONG SLEEVE TOPS. I WILL HEM THE SLEEVES ABOUT 1/2 INCH & IT WILL BE FINE. CAN'T WAIT TO WEAR THIS TO WORK, OR WITH JEANS & BOOTS. THANKS QVC & NINA LEONARD.

 Disappointed
 After asking a few questions online about this top I decided to place my order. I received my QVC package today and was very disappointed when I saw the top. First of all I am calling this item a top and not a tunic because it is clearly NOT a tunic. A tunic usually covers some of your backside, this top fell to the top of my hips. The reviews I read before ordering stated the bell sleeves are long and come down to the middle of the hand. That was not my case at all. The sleeves did not even come to my wrist. Back to the drawing board for me. I would love to find a tunic that I can wear with my skinny jeans and leggings. Anyone have any suggestions? Don't waste your money on this one.

 Above Average Tunic
 The bell sleeves give this tunic that extra bit of added interest, the fit and fabric are perfect. Got the Solid Teal and the Solid purple and will be wearing them alone, under jackets,sweaters and vests. These tunics can be worn in a casual or dressy way.

 LOVE
 I love this top. I ordered the black and giraffe. I love the bell sleeves and the material. I am going to order the leopard print one. Please make more colors and prints.
 10-08-13
 LOVE it!
 VERY nicely made tunic. The fabric is just the right weight for the shape of the garment, and it isn't too lightweight or doesn't weigh you down when you wear it. It is true to size, and the sleeves are not too long or too 'bell shaped.' The design is different, which is a nice change from the same old, same old long-sleeved black tops and tunics.
 10-07-13
 Nice fit
 I ordered the purple and it is a beautiful deep color. The fit is nice (love the bell sleeves) I'm 5'9" and the sleeve length is good. The only reason it's not a 5 star for me is it will show bumps and lumps (i.e. your pant button). I would recommend smooth front pants (great with leggings)
 09-25-13
 Beautiful shirt
 I absolutely love this shirt especially the bell sleeves. I think it's very sexy! I received the purple and now I'm ordering the black! The fabric glides over your body and feels great!! Love it!
 09-11-13
 Great top
 Got this in leopard and it is darling! The sleeves are flowy and fabulous, and I can wear this with jeans and boots on a saturday or with a black skirt and heels to work. Returned the purple as it was a bit bold for my taste. I've already washed it and it washes/dries easily -- a perfect travel piece.
