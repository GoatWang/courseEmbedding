 Educational Background



 


University of California -  Los Angeles

                  UCLA's primary purpose as a public research university is the creation, dissemination, preservation and application of knowledge for the betterment of our global society. To fulfill this mission, UCLA is committed to academic freedom in its fullest terms: We value open access to information, free and lively debate conducted with mutual respect for individuals, and freedom from intolerance. In all of our pursuits, we strive at once for excellence and diversity, recognizing that openness and inclusion produce true quality. These values underlie our three institutional responsibilities.

Learning and teaching at UCLA are guided by the belief that undergraduate, graduate and professional school students and their teachers belong to a community of scholars. This community is dedicated to providing students with a foundational understanding of a broad range of disciplines followed by the opportunity for in-depth study in a chosen discipline. All members of the community are engaged together in discovering and advancing knowledge and practice. Learning occurs not only in the classroom but also through engagement in campus life and in communities and organizations beyond the university.                




 


University of California - Davis

                  The University of California, Davis (also referred to as UCD, UC Davis, or Davis) is a public teaching and research university located in Davis, California just west of Sacramento. The campus covers 7,309 acres (2,958 ha), making it the largest within the 10 campus University of California system. UC Davis also has the third largest enrollment in the UC System after UCLA and UC Berkeley. The University of California, Davis campus is the largest campus in the UC system by land area, spanning 7,309 acres (2,957.8 ha) across two counties: Yolo and Solano. Though named after the City of Davis, the campus is technically located adjacent to the City of Davis in an unincorporated part of Yolo and Solano counties. The main campus is located 15 miles (24.1 km) west of Sacramento in the Sacramento Valley, part of California's Central Valley, and is adjacent to Interstate Highway 80. The Davis campus is the only school within the UC system with an airport, just west of main campus, and is one of two UC schools with its own fire department; the other being UC Santa Cruz. The campus is also conveniently located approximately an hour away from both San Francisco and the Napa Valley and two hours from Lake Tahoe. It is also one of only three schools in the University of California system, the others being UC Berkeley and UC Irvine, with a nuclear lab.

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Miguel Barbosa has the following 1 area of expertise and  1 specialty.                     General Practice
    A general practitioner is similar to a family practitioner in that they treat patients of all ages with a variety of health concerns. These doctors treat everyday ailments, some acute and chronic diseases, and also provid health checkups, physicals, inoculations and preventative care.


    General practitioners differ from family practitioners because they are not required to complete an additional residency in family medicine after completing their medical school residency. Like family practitioners, general practitioners will also provide referrals to patients who are in need of a specialist.
