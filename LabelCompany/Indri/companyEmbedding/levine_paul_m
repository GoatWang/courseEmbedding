Paul M. Levine, Esq.
Paul M. Levine is the founder and managing partner of McCarthy Holthus & Levine. He has been practicing law in Arizona for 30 years, and has extensive experience in a wide range of practice areas, including real estate, commercial leases, contracts, real estate transactions, business disputes, landlord-tenant and complex litigation. Paul has been lead attorney in numerous bench and jury trials in both state and federal courts in Arizona, California and New Mexico. Paul’s clients include many local businesses and business owners. Paul has represented some of his clients for over 20 years. Paul has also represented lenders and servicers in a variety of real estate, lending and title claims. His long-standing background in the Phoenix Metropolitan area has given Paul the advantage of knowing the community well. 

                Paul’s extensive experience, including trial work, allows him to give strategic planning and pre-litigation advice, as well as the insight to guide clients through the litigation process. Knowing when and how to present and introduce evidence, what is admissible, and presenting a case to a jury or judge are some of Paul’s strengths.

                Paul believes that an attorney should be a problem-solver who is aggressive when necessary and who thinks, communicates and gives advice in a practical and realistic way, is an effective communicator who can give accurate assessments as legal issues are presented, provide objective, realistic solutions, and can anticipate problems and strategize for the best possible results.

                Paul stands out from other attorneys with his unwavering attention to detail, extensive knowledge of courtroom dynamics and his years of experience. 

                When Paul is not practicing law he enjoys attending the theatre, reading and sports, particularly basketball, football and golf.

I met with Dr. Shultz. The staff is effervescent and understanding (no flo...ss shaming there), timely and thoughtful! They pulled together a treatment plan that accommodates my finances, they are quick to respond to messages on here, and Rhonda at the front desk is quite the peach! Parking wasn't an issue and it's easy to get to from 95 and 40. 展开Ariel Harrington · 2017年7月17日Want to thank Dr.Shultz again for fitting me in today. Did an excellent job! Him and the staff are very kind as well. Thanks to Ryan also for helping Dr.Shultz get the job done. I will def be back and recommend this dentist office!Diana Rolfe · 2017年5月4日Dr. Lavine and his staff are all wonderful people. They are very friendly . If your like me..i have bad anxiety and they did everything to make me feel better and comfortable. I wasnt there all day. The procedure took him maybe 6 minutes. I HiGHLY recommend Dr. Lavine.Bryan Brown · 2017年3月8日Dr. Levine is the best in the business.  Flexible and thorough.  I would recommend this group to anyone.  The staff is awesome too.Andrea Gill · 2017年4月13日6/5 ☆☆☆☆☆☆ stars, world class All American #1 100% A+++Antoinette Kristen · 2016年7月13日l am very pleased after calling around for over a week that I was able to get in immediately and have this wisdom tooth taken care of. Everyone was friendly, no...n judgemental and responsive. I was very nervous because I never have had a tooth removed but he was very gentle and fast. I am definitely going to be coming back here for the rest of my needed dental work! 展开Britt Parrack · 2015年4月10日Great practice..i went there today for the first time for an abcessed tooth..the whole staff was friendly & welcoming, answered all my questions taking their time (even though they were very busy)..they made sure i was completely comfortable for my entire procedure.Timothy Watts · 2016年10月1日He is the only Dentist I have had in Delaware since I moved here in 1989.  Fantastic Dentist, great office and support staff.  Highest marks for this Practice.Amber Massimiano · 2016年1月7日Well for starters, I was in his office and his assistant didn't even know how to take an X-ray of my teeth. my friend, who is in school for dental assisting, ha...d to show him how to do it.  I was told I had ONE cavity and Two on watch by Dr Lavine. hating everything about my visit, I decided to go to Dr. Alan Levine in Wilmington. He was very concerned with my mouth health because I have TEN cavities. some of which need root canals. I HAD NO IDEA I NEEDED ANY DENTAL WORK bc dr. Lavine failed to even give me his full attention bc he was more concerned trying to help his staff who did not know what they were doing. this is not to be rude, this is to be useful for anyone PLEASE go see another dentist and make sure you are not having the same problems I am. 展开Timandlisa Richardson · 2016年4月4日Dr. Lavine and his whole staff are amazing.
