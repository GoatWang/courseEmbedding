Michael Boris Green FRS[5] (born 22 May 1946) is a British physicist and one of the pioneers of string theory. Currently a professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics and a Fellow in Clare Hall, Cambridge in England, he was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics from 2009 to 2015.[6][7][8][9]

Education and background[edit]
Green was born the son of Genia Green and Absalom Green. He attended William Ellis School in London and Churchill College, Cambridge[1] where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with first class honours in theoretical physics (1967) and a PhD in elementary particle theory (1970).[2][10][11]
Career[edit]
Following his PhD, Green did postdoctoral research at Princeton University (1970–72), Cambridge and the University of Oxford. Between 1978 and 1993 he was a Lecturer and Professor at Queen Mary College, University of London, and in July 1993 he was appointed John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge. On 19 October 2009 he was confirmed as the next Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, to succeed Stephen Hawking on 1 November 2009,.[6][7] In 2015 was succeeded in that chair by Michael Cates, a specialist in colloids, gels, and particulate materials.
Research[edit]
After many years in collaboration with John Henry Schwarz,[12] he co-discovered the anomaly cancellation in type I string theory in 1984. This insight, named the Green–Schwarz mechanism, initiated the First Superstring Revolution. Green has also worked on Dirichlet boundary conditions in string theory which have led to the postulation of D-branes[13] and instantons.[14]
Awards and honours[edit]
Green has been awarded the Dirac and Maxwell Medals of the Institute of Physics, UK, the Dirac Prize of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (Trieste) and the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics of the American Physical Society. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1989.[5] Green has co-authored more than 150 research papers.[8][15]
His nomination for the Royal Society reads


“
Distinguished for his outstanding contributions to quantum field theory, especially the theory of superstrings. Green's early work was largely on duality in S-matrix theory. He was the first to prove an important result on the dual model – the cancellation of the leading divergences between boson and fermion loops. He has made significant contributions to the theory of phase transitions, but is best known for his trail-blazing work, much of it in collaboration with Schwarz, on superstring theory, including the first covariant formulation of the theory. The most important results are the proofs in 1984 and 1985 of anomaly cancellation for SO (32) and E8xE8 superstring theories and of infinity cancellation in the SO (32) case.
These definitive papers initiated the explosive growth of superstring theory, now one of the most active and exciting areas of fundamental theoretical physics.[5]

Michael Boris Green FRS[5] (born 22 May 1946) is a British physicist and one of the pioneers of string theory. Currently a professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics and a Fellow in Clare Hall, Cambridge in England, he was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics from 2009 to 2015.[6][7][8][9]

Education and background[edit]
Green was born the son of Genia Green and Absalom Green. He attended William Ellis School in London and Churchill College, Cambridge[1] where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with first class honours in theoretical physics (1967) and a PhD in elementary particle theory (1970).[2][10][11]
Career[edit]
Following his PhD, Green did postdoctoral research at Princeton University (1970–72), Cambridge and the University of Oxford. Between 1978 and 1993 he was a Lecturer and Professor at Queen Mary College, University of London, and in July 1993 he was appointed John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge. On 19 October 2009 he was confirmed as the next Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, to succeed Stephen Hawking on 1 November 2009,.[6][7] In 2015 was succeeded in that chair by Michael Cates, a specialist in colloids, gels, and particulate materials.
Research[edit]
After many years in collaboration with John Henry Schwarz,[12] he co-discovered the anomaly cancellation in type I string theory in 1984. This insight, named the Green–Schwarz mechanism, initiated the First Superstring Revolution. Green has also worked on Dirichlet boundary conditions in string theory which have led to the postulation of D-branes[13] and instantons.[14]
Awards and honours[edit]
Green has been awarded the Dirac and Maxwell Medals of the Institute of Physics, UK, the Dirac Prize of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (Trieste) and the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics of the American Physical Society. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1989.[5] Green has co-authored more than 150 research papers.[8][15]
His nomination for the Royal Society reads


“
Distinguished for his outstanding contributions to quantum field theory, especially the theory of superstrings. Green's early work was largely on duality in S-matrix theory. He was the first to prove an important result on the dual model – the cancellation of the leading divergences between boson and fermion loops. He has made significant contributions to the theory of phase transitions, but is best known for his trail-blazing work, much of it in collaboration with Schwarz, on superstring theory, including the first covariant formulation of the theory. The most important results are the proofs in 1984 and 1985 of anomaly cancellation for SO (32) and E8xE8 superstring theories and of infinity cancellation in the SO (32) case.

Michael Boris Green FRS[5] (born 22 May 1946) is a British physicist and one of the pioneers of string theory. Currently a professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics and a Fellow in Clare Hall, Cambridge in England, he was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics from 2009 to 2015.[6][7][8][9]

Education and background[edit]
Green was born the son of Genia Green and Absalom Green. He attended William Ellis School in London and Churchill College, Cambridge[1] where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with first class honours in theoretical physics (1967) and a PhD in elementary particle theory (1970).[2][10][11]
Career[edit]
Following his PhD, Green did postdoctoral research at Princeton University (1970–72), Cambridge and the University of Oxford. Between 1978 and 1993 he was a Lecturer and Professor at Queen Mary College, University of London, and in July 1993 he was appointed John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge. On 19 October 2009 he was confirmed as the next Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, to succeed Stephen Hawking on 1 November 2009,.[6][7] In 2015 was succeeded in that chair by Michael Cates, a specialist in colloids, gels, and particulate materials.
Research[edit]
After many years in collaboration with John Henry Schwarz,[12] he co-discovered the anomaly cancellation in type I string theory in 1984. This insight, named the Green–Schwarz mechanism, initiated the First Superstring Revolution. Green has also worked on Dirichlet boundary conditions in string theory which have led to the postulation of D-branes[13] and instantons.[14]
Awards and honours[edit]
Green has been awarded the Dirac and Maxwell Medals of the Institute of Physics, UK, the Dirac Prize of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (Trieste) and the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics of the American Physical Society. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1989.[5] Green has co-authored more than 150 research papers.[8][15]
His nomination for the Royal Society reads


“
Distinguished for his outstanding contributions to quantum field theory, especially the theory of superstrings. Green's early work was largely on duality in S-matrix theory. He was the first to prove an important result on the dual model – the cancellation of the leading divergences between boson and fermion loops. He has made significant contributions to the theory of phase transitions, but is best known for his trail-blazing work, much of it in collaboration with Schwarz, on superstring theory, including the first covariant formulation of the theory. The most important results are the proofs in 1984 and 1985 of anomaly cancellation for SO (32) and E8xE8 superstring theories and of infinity cancellation in the SO (32) case.
These definitive papers initiated the explosive growth of superstring theory, now one of the most active and exciting areas of fundamental theoretical physics.[5]

”


On 12 December 2013, Michael Green shared the Fundamental Physics Prize with John Henry Schwarz "for opening new perspectives on quantum gravity and the unification of forces."

Peer Reviews




About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

Well versed in legal issues, but did not feel had the ethical facilities to represent my case. I was concerned about fraudulent possibilities which could arise during my case analysis. There are many other attorneys that could better represent a clients needs without compromising values and ethics.

When I first was charged with theft, I was scared of what could happen to me. I called Mr. Shepard's office and he saw me on a Saturday for a free consultation. Speaking with him immediately put my nerves at ease. He was knowledgeable, compassionate, asked the right questions, and seemed to genuinely care about me and my case. I hired Mr. Shepard on the spot. Prior to my court date, Mr. Shepard kept me informed about my case and never left me in the dark. On my court date, my case ended up going to trial and it was clear that Mr. Shepard had done his homework and was well prepared because we won. I cannot thank Mr. Shepard enough for all he did to help me and I highly recommend him.Law Offices of G. Randolph Rice, Jr.Ialexander L. ratedRecently had a case in Essex, and a friend referred me to G. Randolph Rice Jr. with a strong recommendation; and he was so very correct! Mr. Rice was very professional, truly caring and trustworthy. He said what he can do, and did exactly what he said... might think it's rare to find an attorney with real integrity and if that's the case go to Mr. Rice. No better advocate for real people and the legal problem you face. Mr. Rice was recomended to me with full confidence and I'll recommend him to anyone with the same, 100% confidence. #RealTalkRichard M Karceski Law OfficeDanielle D. ratedMr. Karceski is an amazing lawyer. If you have the means to spend and extra little money it is 100% worth every penny. As soon as I had met and talked to him at the first free consultation I knew he was the right lawyer. If you want to stay out of jail he's the one for you! He is very nice, the girls in the office are very nice and they all make you feel extremely comfortable. I would highly reccomend him to anyone and everyone!Law Offices of Kevin M Carr LLCShawn V. ratedI'm a New Jersey resident and I hired the Maryland Law Offices of Kevin M Carr to manage a case in Maryland for me. Mr. Carr was very professional, he explained in depth all the issues to me, and he took the time to thoroughly answer all questions.I would refer Mr. Kevin Carr to anyone because he resolved my matter promptly and to my satisfation. Mr. Carr is truly a five star attorney.ShawnNew JerseyTerlep Susan HMario P. ratedSusan is an excellent lawyer. She is knowledgeable, compassionate and honest. When I found out that my wife wanted to divorce me I hired Susan and that's probably the reason why now I still have a roof over my head and did have to change drastically my life style. I would recommend her highly.Adam J Roa PCThomas B. ratedAdam has been a huge help in working through my fathers estate.  He has been helping us with both our financial planning, estates and Wills.  We could not possibly be happier with his attention to detail or his extremely personalized service.  ~ HL Chaney(Posted on behalf of my father)Law Offices of Kevin M Carr LLCGoodmorning S. ratedGreat attorney. I hired him to help me in a situation with my son. He handled this in two stages both having a positive outcome.  I don't care for attorneys but this man impressed me, with his legal skill.  I also found his honesty to be unique and refreshing.Mark Edward Kelllashes77 ratedMr. Kell is very compassionate, professional and reasonable! I hired him years ago to handle a child support matter and currently a custody matter. He is straight forward, understanding and very thorough when it comes to family law.Law Office of Christine Saverda Nielson, P.A.Steve W. ratedExceptional family law attorney. Incredibly thorough and prepared. She helped me end a 6-year divorce ordeal. I finally have a fair visitation schedule thanks to her very hard work!Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.

Ink Drawings
Using just black ink on white paper, I play with contrast and shape.






























Project: Music and Marathons Logo
My wife's running blog needed a logo for various social media platforms.The initial design was a music note with the rounded part having laces.  The customer pointed out they looked a bit too much like boots.  After redesigning the note to have shoes, the colors and backgrounds were changed to match the branding plans of the customer.


















Project: Playing Cards
As my wife is an avid collector of playing cards, I wanted to try my hand at designing a set.  The goal was to portray my ink drawing style in a way that didn't detract from the feel of a classic deck of cards.  I went with a set of crisp shapes on a white background, without the clutter of numbers or letters, just letting the card designs themselves imply their values.I started by making templates of the four classic suit shapes.  After sketching basic layouts, I cleaned up the images in Photoshop, then used Illustrator to smooth out the patterns.I have include the card back as well as the jokers.
