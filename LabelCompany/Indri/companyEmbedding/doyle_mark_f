It's free!Your colleagues, classmates, and 500 million other professionals are on LinkedIn.View Mark’s Full ProfileSummaryWith specialized focus in Canadian retail pharmacy, we have played a small but significant role in providing high quality programs to enhance a pharmacist’ professional practice to ensure optimal patient outcomes.   Over my years with the company, I have been instrumental in developing the technological aspect of the clinic experience within the pharmacy. I developed our medical device department, which is a fully licensed medical device establishment registered with Health Canada. I enjoy strategizing with medical device suppliers and partnering with other healthcare providers to offer fully turnkey health condition management and screening solutions. It is very rewarding to see my ideas and concepts applied in ways that enhance the health care system.As an inventor, I created the first ambidexterous pill counter.  This was developed after I discovered that pill counting trays on the market were all made for right-handed people and there was no solution available for left-handed pharmacists.  Realizing this and not wanted anyone to be 'left out' I created the ambidexterous pill counter and launched it in Canada.Specialties: Educate Healthcare Professionals, Research & Implement Strategic Partnerships, Computer Programming, Software Engineering, New Product Development, Import and Export, Contract NegotiationExperiencePresidentSolis Healthcare Solutions IncJanuary 2016  –  Present (1 year 7 months)In January 2016 Solis Healthcare Solutions Inc acquired Rx Canada adding another level of dimension to our ability to provide streamlined, turn key, pharmacy solutions.
