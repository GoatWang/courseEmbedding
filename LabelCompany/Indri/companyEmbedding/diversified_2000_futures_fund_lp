AGREEMENT
made as of the 29 th
day of
October, 2010 among CERES MANAGED FUTURES LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (“CMF” or the “General
Partner”), DIVERSIFIED 2000 FUTURES FUND L.P., a New York

LLP, a United Kingdom limited liability partnership
(“PGR” or the “Advisor”).

T N E S S E T
H :

 

WHEREAS,
CMF is the general partner of the Partnership, a limited
partnership organized for the purpose of speculative trading of
commodity interests, including futures contracts, options, swaps
and forward contracts on U.S. and non-U.S. markets with the
objective of achieving substantial capital appreciation, such
trading to be conducted directly or through investment in PGR
Master Fund L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Master
Fund”), of which CMF is the general partner and PGR is the
advisor; and

 

WHEREAS,
the Limited Partnership Agreement establishing the Partnership (the
“Limited Partnership Agreement”) permits CMF to
delegate to one or more commodity trading advisors CMF’s
authority to make trading decisions for the Partnership;
and

 

WHEREAS,
the Advisor is registered as a commodity trading advisor with the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), is a
member of the National Futures Association (“NFA”) and
is authorized and regulated in the United Kingdom by the Financial
Services Authority (“FSA”); and

 

WHEREAS,
CMF is registered as a commodity trading advisor and a commodity
pool operator with the CFTC and is a member of the NFA;
and

 

WHEREAS,
CMF, the Partnership and the Advisor wish to enter into this
Agreement in order to set forth the terms and conditions upon which
the Advisor will render and implement advisory services in
connection with the conduct by the Partnership of its commodity
trading activities during the term of this Agreement;

 

NOW,
THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

 

1.  
DUTIES OF THE ADVISOR .  (a) For the period and on
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Advisor shall have
sole authority and responsibility, as one of the
Partnership’s agents and attorneys-in-fact, for directing the
investment and reinvestment of the assets and funds of the
Partnership allocated to it from time to time by the General
Partner in commodity interests, including commodity futures
contracts, options and forward contracts.  The Advisor
may also engage in swaps transactions and other derivative
transactions on behalf of the Partnership with the prior approval
of CMF.  All such trading on behalf of the Partnership
shall be in accordance with the trading policies set forth in the
Partnership’s Prospectus dated November 25, 2002, as
supplemented from time to time (the “Prospectus”), and
as such trading policies may be changed from time to time upon
receipt by the Advisor of prior written notice of such change, and
pursuant to the trading strategy selected by CMF to be utilized by
the Advisor in managing the Partnership’s
assets.  CMF has initially selected the Advisor’s
PGR Mayfair Program (the “Program”), as described in
Appendix A attached hereto, to manage the

 

 

 

  

 

Partnership’s
assets allocated to it.  Any open positions or other
investments at the time of receipt of such notice of a change in
trading policy shall not be deemed to violate the changed policy
and shall be closed or sold in the ordinary course of
trading.  The Advisor may not deviate from the trading
policies set forth in the Prospectus without the prior written
consent of the Partnership given by CMF.  The Advisor
makes no representation or warranty that the trading to be directed
by it for the Partnership will be profitable or will not incur
losses.

 

(b) CMF
acknowledges receipt of the description of the Program, attached
hereto as Appendix A.  All trades made by the Advisor for
the account of the Partnership shall be made through such commodity
broker or brokers as CMF shall direct, and the Advisor shall have
no authority or responsibility for selecting or supervising any
such broker in connection with the execution, clearance or
confirmation of transactions for the Partnership or for the
negotiation of brokerage rates charged therefor.

 

(c) The
initial allocation of the Partnership’s assets to the Advisor
will be made to the Program as described in Appendix A attached
hereto.  In the event the Advisor wishes to use a trading
system or methodology other than or in addition to the Program in
connection with its trading for the Partnership, either in whole or
in part, it may not do so unless the Advisor gives CMF prior
written notice of its intention to utilize such different trading
system or methodology and CMF consents thereto in
writing.  In addition, the Advisor will provide five
days’ prior written notice to CMF of any change in the
trading system or methodology to be utilized for the Partnership
which the Advisor deems material.  If the Advisor deems
such change in system or methodology or in markets traded to be
material, the changed system or methodology or markets traded will
not be utilized for the Partnership without the prior written
consent of CMF.  In addition, the Advisor will notify CMF
of any changes to the trading system or methodology that would
cause the description of the trading strategy or methods described
in Appendix A to be materially inaccurate.  Further, the
Advisor will provide the Partnership with a current list of all
commodity interests to be traded for the Partnership’s
account and the Advisor will not trade any additional commodity
interests for such account without providing notice thereof to CMF
and receiving CMF’s written approval.  The Advisor
also agrees to provide CMF, on a monthly basis, with a written
report of the assets under the Advisor’s management together
with all other matters deemed by the Advisor to be material changes
to its business not previously reported to CMF.  The
Advisor further agrees that it will convert foreign currency
balances (not required to margin positions denominated in a foreign
currency) to U.S. dollars no less frequently than monthly. U.S.
dollar equivalents in individual foreign currencies of more than
$100,000 will be converted to U.S. dollars within one business day
after such funds are no longer needed to margin foreign
positions.

 

(d) The
Advisor agrees to make all material disclosures to the Partnership
regarding itself and its principals as defined in Part 4 of the
CFTC’s regulations (“principals”), partners,
directors, officers and employees, their trading performance and
general trading methods, its customer accounts (but not the
identities of or identifying information with respect to its
customers) and otherwise as are required in the reasonable judgment
of CMF to be made in any filings required by Federal or State law
or NFA rule or order.  Notwithstanding Sections 1(d) and
4(d) of this Agreement, the Advisor is not required to disclose the
actual trading results of proprietary accounts of the Advisor or
its principals unless CMF reasonably determines that such
disclosure is required in order to fulfill its fiduciary

 

 

-2-

  

 

obligations
to the Partnership or the reporting, filing or other obligations
imposed on it by Federal or State law or NFA rule or
order.  The Partnership and CMF acknowledge that the
trading advice to be provided by the Advisor is a property right
belonging to the Advisor and that they will keep all such advice
confidential.

 

(e)  The
Advisor understands and agrees that CMF may designate other trading
advisors for the Partnership and apportion or reapportion to such
other trading advisors the management of an amount of Net Assets
(as defined in Section 3(b) hereof) as it shall determine in its
absolute discretion.  The designation of other trading
advisors and the apportionment or reapportionment of Net Assets to
any such trading advisors pursuant to this Section 1 shall neither
terminate this Agreement nor modify in any regard the respective
rights and obligations of the parties hereunder.

 

(f) CMF
may, from time to time, in its absolute discretion, select
additional trading advisors and reapportion funds among the trading
advisors for the Partnership as it deems
appropriate.  CMF shall use its best efforts to make
reapportionments, if any, as of the first day of a
month.  The Advisor agrees that it may be called upon at
any time promptly to liquidate positions in CMF’s sole
discretion so that CMF may reallocate the Partnership’s
assets, meet margin calls on the Partnership’s account, fund
redemptions, or for any other reason, except that CMF will not
require the liquidation of specific positions by the
Advisor.  CMF will use its best efforts to give two
days’ prior notice to the Advisor of any reallocations or
liquidations.

 

(g)  The
Advisor will not be liable for trading losses in the
Partnership’s account including losses caused by errors;
provided, however, that the Advisor will be liable to the
Partnership with respect to losses incurred due to errors committed
or caused by it or any of its principals or employees in
communicating improper trading instructions or orders to any broker
on behalf of the Partnership.

 

2.  
INDEPENDENCE OF THE ADVISOR .  For all purposes
herein, the Advisor shall be deemed to be an independent contractor
and, unless otherwise expressly provided or authorized, shall have
no authority to act for or represent the Partnership in any way and
shall not be deemed an agent, promoter or sponsor of the
Partnership, CMF, or any other trading advisor.  The
Advisor shall not be responsible to the Partnership, the General
Partner, any trading advisor or any limited partners for any acts
or omissions of any other trading advisor to the
Partnership.

 

3.  
COMPENSATION .  (a) In consideration of and as
compensation for all of the services to be rendered by the Advisor
to the Partnership under this Agreement, the Partnership shall pay
the Advisor (i) an annual incentive fee equal to 20% of New Trading
Profits (as such term is defined below) earned by the Advisor for
the Partnership and (ii) a monthly fee for professional management
services equal to 1% per year of the month-end Net Assets of the
Partnership allocated to the Advisor (computed monthly by
multiplying the Partnership’s Net Assets allocated to the
Advisor as of the last business day of each month by 1% and
multiplying the result thereof by the ratio which the total number
of calendar days in that month bears to the total number of
calendar days in the year).

 

(b)
“Net Assets” shall have the meaning set forth in
Paragraph 7(d)(1) of the Limited Partnership Agreement dated as of
August 25, 1999 and without regard to further amendments thereto,
provided that in determining the Net Assets of the Partnership on
any date, no adjustment shall be made to reflect any distributions,
redemptions or incentive fees payable as of the date of such
determination.

 

 

 

-3-

  

 

(c)  “New
Trading Profits” shall mean the excess, if any, of Net Assets
managed by the Advisor at the end of the fiscal period over Net
Assets managed by the Advisor at the end of the highest previous
fiscal period or Net Assets allocated to the Advisor at the date
trading by the Advisor on behalf of the Partnership commences,
whichever is higher, and as further adjusted to eliminate the
effect on Net Assets resulting from new capital contributions,
redemptions, reallocations or capital distributions, if any, made
during the fiscal period decreased by interest or other income, not
directly related to trading activity, earned on the
Partnership’s assets during the fiscal period, whether the
assets are held separately or in margin
accounts.  Ongoing expenses will be attributed to the
Advisor based on the Advisor’s proportionate share of Net
Assets.  Ongoing expenses will not include expenses of
litigation not involving the activities of the Advisor on behalf of
the Partnership.  No incentive fee shall be paid until
the end of the first calendar quarter of trading following the date
of this Agreement, which fee shall be based on New Trading Profits
earned from the commencement of trading operations by the Advisor
on behalf of the Partnership.  Interest income earned, if
any, will not be taken into account in computing New Trading
Profits earned by the Advisor.  If Net Assets allocated
to the Advisor are reduced due to redemptions, distributions or
reallocations (net of additions), there will be a corresponding
proportional reduction in the related loss carryforward amount that
must be recouped before the Advisor is eligible to receive another
incentive fee.

 

(d)
Annual incentive fees and monthly management fees shall be paid
within twenty (20) business days following the end of the period
for which such fee is payable.  In the event of the
termination of this Agreement as of any date which shall not be the
end of a calendar year or month, as the case may be, the annual
incentive fee shall be computed as if the effective date of
termination were the last day of the then current year and the
monthly management fee shall be prorated to the effective date of
termination.  If, during any month, the Partnership does
not conduct business operations or the Advisor is unable to provide
the services contemplated herein for more than two successive
business days, the monthly management fee shall be prorated by the
ratio which the number of business days during which CMF conducted
the Partnership’s business operations or utilized the
Advisor’s services bears in the month to the total number of
business days in such month.

 

(e)           The
provisions of this Section 3 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

 

4.  
RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN OTHER ACTIVITIES
.  (a)  The services provided by the Advisor
hereunder are not to be deemed exclusive.  CMF on its own
behalf and on behalf of the Partnership acknowledges that, subject
to the terms of this Agreement, the Advisor and its officers,
directors, employees and partners, may render advisory, consulting
and management services to other clients and accounts. The Advisor
and its officers, directors, employees and partners shall be free
to trade for their own accounts and to advise other investors and
manage other commodity accounts during the term of this Agreement
and to use the same information, computer programs and trading
strategies, programs or formulas which they obtain, produce or
utilize in the performance of services to CMF for the
Partnership.  However, the Advisor represents, warrants
and agrees that it believes the rendering of such consulting,
advisory and management services to other accounts and entities
will not require any

 

 

-4-

  

 

material
change in the Advisor’s basic trading strategies and will not
affect the capacity of the Advisor to continue to render services
to CMF for the Partnership of the quality and nature contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

(b) If,
at any time during the term of this Agreement, the Advisor is
required to aggregate the Partnership’s commodity positions
with the positions of any other person for purposes of applying
CFTC- or exchange-imposed speculative position limits, the Advisor
agrees that it will promptly notify CMF if the Partnership’s
positions are included in an aggregate amount which exceeds the
applicable speculative position limit.  The Advisor
agrees that, if its trading recommendations are altered because of
the application of any speculative position limits, it will not
modify the trading instructions with respect to the
Partnership’s account in such manner as to affect the
Partnership substantially disproportionately as compared with the
Advisor’s other accounts.  The Advisor further
represents, warrants and agrees that under no circumstances will it
knowingly or deliberately use trading programs, strategies or
methods for the Partnership that are inferior to strategies or
methods employed for any other client or account and that it will
not knowingly or deliberately favor any client or account managed
by it over any other client or account in any manner, it being
acknowledged, however, that different trading programs, strategies
or methods may be utilized for differing sizes of accounts,
accounts with different trading policies, accounts experiencing
differing inflows or outflows of equity, accounts that commence
trading at different times, accounts that have different portfolios
or different fiscal years, accounts utilizing different executing
brokers and accounts with other differences, and that such
differences may cause divergent trading results.

 

(c) It is
acknowledged that the Advisor and/or its officers, employees,
directors and partners presently act, and it is agreed that they
may continue to act, as advisor for other accounts managed by them,
and may continue to receive compensation with respect to services
for such accounts in amounts which may be more or less than the
amounts received from the Partnership.

 

(d) The
Advisor agrees that it shall make such information available to CMF
respecting the performance of the Partnership’s account as
compared to the performance of other accounts managed by the
Advisor or its principals, if any, as shall be reasonably requested
by CMF.  The Advisor presently believes and represents
that existing speculative position limits will not materially
adversely affect its ability to manage the Partnership’s
account given the potential size of the Partnership’s account

TRADING METHODS                                                                 

Graham trades actively in both U.S. and foreign markets, primarily in futures   
contracts, forward contracts, spot contracts and associated derivative          
instruments such as options and swaps. Graham engages in exchange for physical  
transactions, which involve the exchange of a futures position for the          
underlying physical commodity without making an open, competitive trade on an   
exchange. Graham at times will trade certain instruments as a substitute for    
futures or options traded on futures exchanges. Instruments and contracts not   
traded on any organized exchange may be entered into with banks, brokerage firms
or other financial institutions as counterparties.                              

Systematic Trading                                              

Graham's trading systems rely primarily on technical rather than fundamental    
information as the basis for their trading decisions. Graham's systems are based
on the expectation that they can over time successfully anticipate market events
using quantitative mathematical models                                          

-5- 

P-->424B37th�Page�of�13TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�7th
to determine their trading activities, as opposed to attempting properly to     
forecast price trends using subjective analysis of supply and demand.           

Graham's core trading systems are primarily very long term in nature and are    
designed to participate selectively in potential profit opportunities that can  
occur during periods of sustained price trends in a diverse number of U.S. and  
international markets. The primary objective of the core trading systems is to  
establish positions in markets where the price action of a particular market    
signals the computerized systems used by Graham that a potential trend in prices
is occurring. The systems are designed to analyze mathematically the recent     
trading characteristics of each market and statistically compare such           
characteristics to the long-term historical trading pattern of the particular   
market. As a result of this analysis, the systems will utilize proprietary risk 
management and trade filter strategies that are intended to benefit from        
sustained price trends while reducing risk and volatility exposure.             

In addition to Graham's core trading systems, Graham has developed various      
trading systems that are not true trend-following systems. The Graham Selective 
Trading Program, which was developed in 1997, relies in part on a pattern       
recognition model based on volatility. The Non-Trend-Based Program, which was   
developed in 1998, relies on macroeconomic and supply and demand data as the    
basis for its trading decisions and has the potential to perform in market      
conditions that are characterized by a lack of long-term trends.                

Discretionary Trading                                           

The Discretionary Trading Group was established at Graham in February 1998.     
Unlike Graham's systematic trading programs, which are based almost entirely on 
computerized mathematical models, the Discretionary Trading Group determines its
trades subjectively on the basis of personal assessment of trading data and     
trading experience. One of the significant advantages Graham's traders benefit  
from is Graham's experience in systematic trading and trend identification. This
experience has proven helpful in enabling the Discretionary Trading Group to    
take advantage of significant market trends when they occur and, equally        
important, the Discretionary Trading Group has the potential to profit from     
trend reversals as well. Additionally, Graham makes available extensive         
technical and fundamental research resources to the Discretionary Trading Group 
in an effort to improve its competitive performance edge over time. Graham      
believes the Discretionary Trading Group's performance results generally are not
highly correlated to the results of other discretionary traders or Graham's     
systematic trading programs. Graham believes the Discretionary Trading Group can
generate successful performance results in trading range type markets where     
there are few long-term trends.                                                 

TRADING PROGRAMS                                                                

Graham will initially trade the Fund's assets allocated to it in accordance with
its Global Diversified Program, as described below, at 1.5 times the standard   
leverage it applies for the program. Margin requirements over time at standard  
leverage are expected to average about 15% to 20% of equity for the accounts    
traded by Graham. Thus, Graham expects aggregate margin for all positions held  
in the Fund's account over time to average about 20% to 30% of the account's net
assets. Increased leverage will alter risk exposure and may lead to greater     
profits and losses and trading volatility.                                      

In extraordinary market conditions Graham may reduce leverage and portfolio risk
if it believes that it is in the best interest of its clients to do so. While   
such actions are anticipated to occur very infrequently, no assurance can be    
given that Graham's actions will enhance performance.                           

Subject to the prior approval of the general partner, Graham may, at any time,  
trade all or a portion of the Fund's assets allocated to it pursuant to one or  
more of Graham's other programs, and at an increased or reduced rate of         
leverage.

Global Diversified Program                                      

The Global Diversified Program utilizes multiple computerized trading models    
designed to participate in potential profit opportunities during sustained price
trends in approximately 80 global markets. This program features broad          
diversification in both financial and non-financial markets.                    

The strategies that are utilized are primarily long-term in nature and are      
intended to generate significant returns over time with an acceptable degree of 
risk and volatility. The computer models on a daily basis analyze the recent    
price action, the relative strength and the risk characteristics of each market 
and compare statistically the quantitative results of this data to years of     
historical data on each market.                                                 

As of January 2001, the allocation of risk exposure for the Global Diversified  
Program is:

Graham rebalances the weighting of each market in the portfolio on a monthly    
basis so as to attempt to maintain, on a volatility and risk adjusted basis,    
consistent exposure to each market over time.                                   

Graham Selective Trading Program                                

The Graham Selective Trading Program was developed in 1997 and utilizes a       
completely different trading system than other Graham programs. The Graham      
Selective Trading Program uses a mathematical model to identify certain price   
patterns that have very specific characteristics indicating that there is a high
probability that a significant directional move will occur. Although the system 
does not trade against the market trend, it is not a true trend-following system
inasmuch as it will only participate in specific types of market moves that meet
the restrictive criteria of the model. In general, the Graham Selective Trading 
Program will participate only in significant market moves that are characterized
by a substantial increase in volatility. As a result, it frequently will not    
participate in market trends in which virtually all trend-following systems     
would have a position.                                                          

The Graham Selective Trading Program trades in approximately 55 markets. As of  
January 2001, the allocation of risk exposure for the Graham Selective Trading  
Program is:                                                                     

                                                                [Download Table]
                                                               
foreign exchange                                            29%
interest rates                                              24%
agriculture                                                 16%
stock indices                                               11%
metals                                                      11%
energy                                                       9%

Due to the extremely selective criteria of the Graham Select Trading model, the 
program will normally maintain a neutral position in approximately 50% to 60% of
the markets in the portfolio.                                                   

K4 Program                                                      

The K4 Program was developed in 1998 and commenced trading operations in January
1999. Similar to the Graham Selective Trading Program, the K4 Program uses a    
mathematical model to identify certain price patterns that have very specific   
characteristics indicating that there is a high probability that a significant  
directional move will occur. The K4 Program differs from the Graham Selective   
Trading Program in many respects, including a tendency to enter markets at      
different times and the use of other significantly different parameters. The K4 
Program will normally enter or exit a position only when a significant price and
volatility spike takes place and is designed to have a high percentage of       
winning trades.

The K4 Program trades in approximately 65 markets. As of January 2001, the      
allocation of risk exposure for the K4 Program is:                              

                                                                [Download Table]

The K4 Program will normally maintain a neutral position in 50% of the markets  
in the portfolio.                                                               

Non-Trend-Based Program                                         

Today's markets include many trend-following and counter-trend traders          
attempting to identify major trends and reversals thereof. Graham's             
Non-Trend-Based Program utilizes multiple computerized trading models that for  
the most part do not rely on price trends. The Non-Trend-Based Program forecasts
market direction based on changes in fundamental data, such as supply and demand
data, inflation rates, interest rates and shifts in the business cycle. By using
non-trend-following methods it is possible to trade with considerable success in
markets irrespective of the existence of price trends.                          

As of January 2001, the allocation of risk exposure for the Non-Trend-Based     
Program is:                                                                     

                                                                [Download Table]
                                                               
currency                                                    45%
energy                                                      22%
interest rates                                              11%
stock indices                                               11%
metals                                                      11%

The Non-Trend Based-Program seeks to capture currency gains based on the        
momentum of interest rate expectations, absolute levels of the interest rate    
differentials and relative shapes of yield curves. The Non-Trend-Based Program  
forecasts energy market direction from changes in supply/demand, the commitment 
of traders' report and other factors.                                           

For trading fixed income markets, the Non-Trend-Based Program creates a         
macroeconomic index based on economic release data, inflation data and interest 
rate sensitive stocks. For base metal trading, the Non-Trend-Based Program seeks
to identify shifts in supply/demand that are consistent with the current        
business cycle to anticipate market direction relying on inputs such as cost of 
carry, supply/demand measures, inflation, currency movement and interest rate   
sensitive stocks. For stock indices, the Non-Trend-Based Program creates a      
composite indicator that positions the system long or short the S&P 500 relying 
on stock market fundamental indicators such as price/earnings ratios, dividend  
yields, inflation, currency movement and interest rates.                        

Discretionary Trading Group Program                             

Unlike Graham's systematic trading programs, which are based almost entirely on 
computerized mathematical models, Graham's Discretionary Trading Group          
determines trades for the Discretionary Trading Group Program subjectively on   
the basis of personal judgment and trading experience. The Discretionary Trading
Group Program generally utilizes fundamental information as well as certain     
technical data as the basis for its trading strategies. Fundamental             
considerations relate to the underlying economic and political forces that      
ultimately determine the true value of a particular financial instrument or     
commodity. Fundamental analysis of the Discretionary Trading Group may involve a
short or long-term time horizon. Technical data considered by the Discretionary 
Trading Group include price patterns, volatility, trading volumes and level of  
open interest.                                                                  

The Discretionary Trading Group Program trades worldwide in fixed income,       
equity, foreign exchange and commodity markets. The Discretionary Trading Group 
Program may take long or short positions in futures, forwards, options and other
financial instruments.

PAST PERFORMANCE OF GRAHAM                                                      

The composite performance records include individual accounts that may have     
materially different rates of return on amounts actually invested, even though  
they are traded according to the same investment program. This is caused by     
material differences among accounts, such as: (1) procedures governing timing   
for the commencement of trading and means of moving toward full funding of new  
accounts; (2) the period during which accounts are active; (3) client trading   
restrictions; (4) ratio of trading size to level of actual funds deposited with 
the futures commission merchant (i.e., the extent of notional equity); (5) the  
degree of leverage employed; (6) the size of the account, which can influence   
the size of positions taken and restrict the account from participating in all  
markets available to an investment program; (7) the amount of interest income   
earned by an account, which will depend on the rates paid by the futures        
commission merchant on equity deposits and the amount of equity invested in     
interest-bearing obligations; (8) the amount of management and incentive fees   
paid to Graham and the amount of brokerage commissions paid; (9) the timing of  
orders to open or close positions; (10) market conditions, which influence the  
quality of trade executions; (11) variations in fill prices; and (12) the timing
of additions and withdrawals. Notwithstanding these material differences, each  
composite performance record is a valid representation of the accounts included 
therein.                                                                        

Whenever this document refers to total assets managed by Graham in a particular 
program or overall, or rate of return on net assets, such assets include any    
notional equity and may include client and proprietary funds. Notional equity   
represents the additional amount of equity that exceeds the amount of equity    
actually committed to Graham for management. Since notionally funded accounts   
are more highly leveraged than fully-funded accounts, they incur magnified gains
and losses on their actual investment (which does not include notional equity)  
compared to fully-funded accounts.                                              

As of December 31, 2000, Graham managed approximately $544 million in assets.   

Table A-1 reflects the composite capsule performance results of all accounts    
traded according to Graham's Global Diversified Program at 150% leverage for the
period May 1997 (inception of client trading) through December 31, 2000.        

Table A-2 reflects the composite capsule performance results for all other      
trading programs (excluding certain exempt accounts) directed by Graham for the 
time period indicated on the table.

GRAHAM CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.P.                                                 
NOTES TO PERFORMANCE TABLES                                                     

(a)"Draw-Down" is defined as losses experienced by an account over a specified  
period of time.                                                                 

(b)"Largest Monthly Draw-Down" is the largest monthly loss experienced by any   
account included in a program composite in any calendar month expressed as a    
percentage of the total equity in the account and includes the month and year of
such draw-down.                                                                 

(c)"Largest Peak-to-Valley Draw-Down" is the greatest cumulative percentage     
decline in month end net asset value (regardless of whether it is continuous)   
due to losses sustained by any account included in a program composite during a 
period in which the initial month-end net asset value of such draw-down has not 
been equaled or exceeded by a subsequent month-end net asset value. The months  
and year(s) of such decline from the initial month end net asset value to the   
lowest month-end net asset value are indicated.                                 

(d)"Monthly Rate of Return" ("Monthly ROR") is calculated by dividing net income
for the month by net asset value as of the beginning of the month (including    
contributions made at the start of the month). In months where asset changes are
made mid-month, rates of return are calculated pursuant to the Compounded Rate  
of Return Method. Rate of return under this method is calculated by dividing the
accounting period, i.e., the month, into smaller periods and compounding the    
rate of return for such sub-period.                                             

(e)"Annual (or Period) Rate of Return" is calculated by compounding the Monthly 
ROR over the months in a given year, i.e., each Monthly ROR, in hundredths, is  
added to one (1) and the result is multiplied by the subsequent Monthly ROR     
similarly expressed. One is then subtracted from the product and the result is  
multiplied by one hundred (100).                                                

(f)"Inception of Trading by CTA" is the date on which Graham began trading      
client accounts.                                                                

(g)"Inception of Trading in Program" is the date on which Graham began trading  
client accounts pursuant to the program shown.                                  

(h)"Aggregate Assets in all Programs" is the aggregate amount of assets in      
accounts under the management of Graham as of December 31, 2000, and includes   
client funds and notional equity. Notional equity represents the additional     
amount of equity that exceeds the amount of equity actually committed to Graham 
for management.                                                                 

(i)"Aggregate Assets in Program" is the aggregate amount of assets in the       
program specified as of December 31, 2000, and included client funds and        
notional equity.                                                                

ADDITIONAL FOOTNOTE FOR QUALIFIED ELIGIBLE PERSON ACCOUNTS                      

Graham advises exempt accounts for Qualified Eligible Persons. The performance  
of certain of these accounts is not included in the composite performance       
record. As of December 31, 2000, the excluded exempt accounts represent         
approximately $178 million of the $544 million then under management.
