Background and History

Berkshire Partners was formed in the mid-1980s with the goal of investing in growth companies and working closely with their management teams to realize the full potential of each business.  For over 30 years, we have worked together to pursue this goal.  Since our founding, we have built a culture of shared governance and collective decision-making that we view as distinctive in our industry.  This philosophy of collaboration has been a key element in our ability to attract and retain professionals who bring relevant experience and perspectives to our firm. As a firm, we have made over 115 investments in companies, beginning in 1984 with our investment in Carlin Foods.  Over the years, we have established deep knowledge and relationships in industries such as consumer products and retail, business services, industrials, transportation and communications.  Our investment mandate has been flexible throughout, allowing us to create value in many ways, from helping to build a leading wireless tower provider like Crown Castle and privatizing railroad systems in the United Kingdom through English, Welsh & Scottish Rail, to supporting significant growth in the cosmetics industry with Bare Escentuals.  While we are more likely to seek investments in our core areas of expertise, we remain opportunistic and regularly consider investments in a variety of sectors.We believe that alignment of interests is essential in fostering a constructive relationship with each company in our portfolio and with our investors.  In both cases, the fact that individuals at Berkshire comprise the firm’s largest investor group makes our commitment to work together with management, and on behalf of our investors, very clear.  By producing strong results at our portfolio companies, we help our management partners, our investors and ourselves achieve success.  Furthermore, we are grateful to have investors, who support long-term equity value creation, which enables us to maintain our focus on building enduring value within each company.For our first 20 years, we focused solely on investing through our private equity funds.  In 2007, we expanded our activities by launching Stockbridge, our fund that invests in marketable securities.  We saw this new initiative as a way of leveraging the skills, relationships and—we hope—wisdom that we have accumulated in the private equity world, while creating another opportunity to provide value to our investors. Today, Stockbridge has over $2.5 billion under management with leading institutions and select individuals investing alongside our team.  We take pride in the collaborative culture we have built across our firm.  Our investment process continues to be one based upon analytical rigor and consensus-based decision-making.  Within private equity, we actively engage with our portfolio companies to identify key strategic priorities and implement necessary operational improvements.  Stockbridge similarly values the wisdom of the team and the importance of deep research and has devoted considerable resources behind this goal. We draw on strong analytical skills of the collective team, our wealth of contacts built over 30 years as well as experience derived from investing over multiple economic cycles to support the management teams of the companies in which we have invested.  Together, we work hard to position our companies for long-term success.

History[edit]

Berkshire Partners LLC Key Developments

NEC Reportedly Considers Buying Civica For £900 million
Jul 13 17
NEC Corporation (TSE:6701) is looking at buying Civica Group Limited for £900 million and has hired advisors to work on an offer, Sky News reported. NEC lines up £900m bid for Civica. An auction of Civica, which began several weeks ago, has drawn initial offers from a trio of private equity firms: BC Partners, Berkshire Partners LLC and Partners Group Holding AG (SWX:PGHN), according to an industry source. It was unclear on July 13, 2017 how serious NEC's interest in Civica was, although it is said to have hired advisers to work on an offer. OMERS Private Equity hired Goldman Sachs to explore a potential sale of Civica earlier this year after noting premium valuations being paid for other companies in the sector. NEC could not be reached for comment on July 13, 2017.

Berkshire Partners and New Balance Holding Complete Acquisition of The Rockport Company | Business Wire


























































Berkshire Partners and New Balance Holding Complete Acquisition of 
      The Rockport Company






August 03, 2015 02:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Berkshire Partners LLC, a Boston-based investment firm, together with 
      New Balance Holding, Inc., the investment arm of New Balance, today 
      announced that they have completed the acquisition of The Rockport 
      Company from the adidas Group. The Rockport Company is a leading 
      designer and marketer of high-quality comfort footwear for men and 
      women. As part of the transaction, Drydock Footwear LLC, currently a New 
      Balance affiliate and home to the Cobb Hill, Aravon and Dunham brands, 
      will join together with The Rockport Company to form The Rockport Group 
      with Bob Infantino serving as CEO. The Rockport Group, which will remain 
      based in the greater Boston area, will be a new stand-alone company 
      offering high-quality dress and casual footwear to customers globally 
      across four brands—Rockport, Cobb Hill, Aravon and Dunham.
    

      Rockport, headquartered in Canton, Massachusetts, was founded more than 
      40 years ago, when father and son, Saul and Bruce Katz, hit the roads of 
      New England, selling shoes out of their trunk. Their vision, which 
      continues to inspire Rockport products today, was to utilize innovative 
      sports technology to create a unique level of comfort in dress and 
      casual shoes. Rockport products are sold through a multi-channel network 
      of leading wholesale partners, as well as through the company’s retail 
      stores and website.
    

      Drydock was founded in May 2011 when Bob Infantino, an industry veteran 
      with a long and successful history of building and leading footwear 
      brands, joined with global athletic leader New Balance to create an 
      independent business committed to delivering innovative, on-trend and 
      comfortable dress and casual shoes across three brands: Cobb Hill, 
      Aravon and Dunham.
    

      Goodwin Procter LLP served as legal counsel to Berkshire Partners and 
      New Balance Holding, Inc.
    

About The Rockport Group:The Rockport Group designs, 
      markets and sells comfort footwear with distribution in premier 
      independent, online and department stores in North America and more than 
      63 markets worldwide. In August 2015, Drydock Footwear Group acquired 
      The Rockport Company to form The Rockport Group, the new home to the 
      companies’ combined portfolio of men’s and women’s brands, including 
      Rockport, Cobb Hill, Aravon and Dunham. Headquartered in the greater 
      Boston area, the Company merges Drydock and Rockport’s collective 
      vision, talent and commitment to innovation, dating back to Rockport’s 
      beginnings in 1971. For more information, visit www.rockport.com.
    

About Berkshire Partners:Berkshire Partners, the 
      Boston-based investment firm, has invested in over 110 middle market 
      companies since 1986 through eight private equity funds with aggregate 
      capital commitments of over $11 billion. Berkshire has developed

      products and retail, business services, industrials, communications and

      management teams to grow the companies in which it invests with the goal 
      of consistently achieving superior investment returns. The firm is

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
