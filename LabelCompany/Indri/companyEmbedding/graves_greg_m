SHE is the physician that you MUST see if you are in need of an endocrinologist. My husband sees her for endocrine issues (hormones). He was being treated by his PCP, which was so WRECKLESS on the part of his primary care physician. A piece of advice, NEVER let your PCP handle any issues with your  Hormones (Testosterone, Thyroid, FSH, TSH, ect ., so on & so forth..) because they simply are NOT equipt to treat, nor manage, the complex & intercrut system of 'Endocrinology'. Leave that up to a SPECIALIST! And if you're looking for the absolute BEST endocrinologist... we highly recommend Dr. ansari! The physicians Assistant, (NP, Nurse Practitioner) is just as amazing as Dr. ansari. These two women know their $h¡t. They're highly educated, very knowledgeable, &have a bedside manor that is hard to find.  .  If you're looking for an endocrinologist., I can assure you that Dr. Ansari, & her wonderful team, will meet, & exceed all your expectations & standards. 10/10.Adeela Ansari MD,  IncRichard W. ratedI would recomend any one who has had their hormone levels or diabetes questioned by General Doctors.Dr Ansari is a specialist in her field and will handle you with a great bed side manner.  Most men do not realize their testerone levels drop as they get older and how easy it is to get a blood test and the products on the market that will help you to ballance your bodily functions that no longer dictate intrusive or painfull proceedures.  Dr. Ansari is very sensitive yet makes sure you understand how important knowing what is actually trigering unwanted symptoms and how to obtain answers and possible remedies.  Best discribed as Gental but Firm and very informativee so it is wise to keep an open mind as she will not try to engage you into any treatment without blood or lab work and then it is always up to you.  One of the few Doctors I have met with an Angelic approach to very hard Q and A’s on the path to ballance.  I trust her more than any other Doctor I have been to and I have been to many.Neubuerger Christopher O MDjudy.jasperson ratedBest back surgeonI had back paid for over 10 years, I had series of epidural injections for pain and for a pinched sciatica which caused numbness and constant debilitating pain. I worked and traveled with this for years.Then I was referred to dr. Neuberger... What a life saver he was. I had my pinched nerve canal cleaned out, a new disc made, my vertebrae lL4&5 straightened and two bars and 4 screws put in place to hold it all together. The surgery took 5-6 hrs. Recovery wasn't pleasant for the first 10 days, but then I stared walking and getting moving and with in  month I was feeling so much better I could not believe what has happened.Now a year and a half later, I work out 3-4 times a week have lost 65 lbs and feel great. I am62 years old and am going to start snow skiing again after 15 years of being in constant pain.Dr. Neuberger is the BEST in Sacramento...Ron James MDKymberly N. ratedI first met Dr. James Feb 2010 in ER recovery room after he did surgery and saved my arm after being attacked by a dog.Then 4yrs later i was refered to a orthopedic surgeon for my knee.Small world in walks Dr. James and I knrw i was in good hands.After a total knee replacement by Dr. James I am now able to spend quality time with my grankids and I havent walked this good in a couple of years. And im only 54yrs old  but i felt like a 80 yr old.Thanks to the most caring and talented surgeon. I would highly recomend him to anyone.Thanks Dr. James!!!Satterfield Denise MD FAAPAmber B. ratedAfter my 8 year old's eye crossed twice, and MRI and CAT scan all came back negative, it was time for surgery. My husband took my son to all his appointments and loved Dr. Satterfield. She was knowledgeable, understanding, and professional. We definitely trusted her with our son's surgery. For lack of better terms, she would need to "tighten the eye muscle" in both eyes. The surgery and scheduling went smooth and my son is doing great!Scott M Wiggginton MDShirley F. ratedMy husband and I have been patients of Dr Wigginton for many years. He is patient, caring and extremely thorough! I've received phone calls at home many times, when it would have been easy and more likely to have been expected to delegate that to a nurse. A few years back, he was voted by his peers as someone they would take their own family members to. A well deserved honor.Hillis Warren MDShirley F. ratedDr Warren was highly recommended to me for cataract surgery. After a thorough examination, he suggested that I see another doctor whose expertise, he felt, would more likely give the best result. I felt he put the success of the procedure for me ahead of his ego. I recommend him for the care of your eyes under routine circumstances.Hu, Billy, MDMeg W. ratedDr Picetti is wonderful with my teen.  He is thorough, makes the follow up convenient and takes time to explain his approach to us.  He taken both a wait and see attitude and as things have changed with her x-rays, decided on a more aggressive treatment approach.  He is so knowledgeable.  We feel like we are in the best hands.McCrimons, Daniel E. - MDJoe S. ratedBoth of my children love Dr Mcrimons. I love that the Dr actually calls you back and getting an emergency appointment is no problem! He has 2 entrances one for sick one for well children so no worries on catching something when your in for a annual check up He genuinely cares about his patients and it is worth the driveFinegan Mary M MDShirley F. ratedDr. Finegan is my ob/gym. If it were possible, I would give Dr. Finegan more stars. My highly prized family doctor recommended her to me when I became his patient several years ago. She has a very busy practice so appointments need to be made a ways in advance. But she s so worth the wait. I highly recommend her.Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
