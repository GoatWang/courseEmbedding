Achillion Reports 2014 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Financial Results
Robust Balance Sheet to Support 2015 Initiation of Sparta and Ithaca Phase 2 Clinical Trials for HCV and Advancement of Complement Factor D Inhibitor Program Into Phase 1

NEW HAVEN, Conn., March 5, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:ACHN) today reported financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014.

	For the three months ended December 31, 2014, the Company reported a net loss of $21.6 million, compared to a net loss of $13.4 million in the three months ended December 31, 2013. For the full year ended December 31, 2014, the Company's net loss was $69.0 million, or $0.70 per share, compared to a net loss of $58.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, or $0.63 per share. Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and interest and subscriptions receivable at December 31, 2014 were $159.2 million.

	"At Achillion, we remain committed to our goals of delivering short duration, widely accessible treatments to all HCV patients, and improving the lives of patients with complement-mediated diseases," commented Milind Deshpande, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Achillion. "We believe that the 100% SVR results we reported with ACH-3102, our NS5A inhibitor, in combination with sofosbuvir after six weeks of treatment, support our belief that ACH-3102 can unleash the potential of a NS5A/nucleotide inhibitor combination to drive down treatment durations. Furthermore, the achievement of proof-of-concept with ACH-3422, our proprietary nucleotide NS5B polymerase inhibitor, and the profile of sovaprevir, our NS3/4A protease inhibitor, leads us to believe that our portfolio is strongly positioned to compete commercially with ultra-short treatments for HCV."

	Dr. Deshpande further commented, "Over the course of 2015, we remain poised to deliver a number of milestones aimed at demonstrating the activity of our proprietary regimens with short treatment durations highlighted by the proprietary doublet regimen of ACH-3102 and ACH-3422 for HCV. Furthermore, we plan to start Phase 1 development with a novel, orally-administered complement factor D inhibitor for complement-mediated diseases, such as PNH, before the end of the year."Anticipated Milestones for 2015Sparta Doublet Regimen for HCV

		Plan to initiate in the first half of 2015 a clinical trial with ACH-3422 in combination with ACH-3102 for patients with treatment-naïve genotype 1 HCV for treatment durations of 6, 8 and 12 weeks. SVR4 results are expected in the second half of 2015.ACH-3422 Phase 1 Proof-of-concept for HCV Genotypes 2 and 3

		Plan to initiate during the first quarter a Phase 1 proof-of-concept trial evaluating the anti-viral activity of ACH-3422 for HCV genotypes 2 and 3. Results are anticipated during the second quarter of 2015. Ithaca Triplet Regimen for HCV

		Expect to initiate during the first half of 2015 a proxy triplet trial evaluating ACH-3102 and sovaprevir with sofosbuvir for a treatment duration of 4 weeks. SVR4 results are expected in the second half of 2015; and

		   

		Expect to initiate by the end of 2015 a pharmacokinetic and viral kinetic study of ACH-3422, ACH-3102 and sovaprevir in patients with treatment-naïve genotype 1 HCV. Complement Factor D Inhibitor Program

		Expect to nominate a novel orally-administered complement factor D inhibitor and advance into a phase I clinical trial by the end of 2015. Fourth Quarter 2014 Financial Results

	The Company reported a net loss of $21.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2014, compared to a net loss of $13.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2013. Research and development expenses were $16.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, compared to $10.1 million for the same period of 2013, the increase primarily resulting from increased clinical and manufacturing costs related to ACH-3422, increased costs related to the ACH-3102 and sofosbuvir combination trial, as well as increased costs related to the complement factor D inhibitor program. Personnel costs and non-cash stock-based compensation also increased.

	For the three months ended December 31, 2014, general and administrative expenses totaled $5.2 million, compared to $3.4 million in the same period in 2013, the increase primarily resulting from increased professional consulting and insurance costs. Personnel costs and non-cash stock-based compensation also increased.Year-end 2014 Financial Results

	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company reported a net loss of $69.0 million, compared to a net loss of $58.9 million in 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, research and development expenses totaled $53.5 million, compared to $46.7 million in 2013. The increase in research and development expenses from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to increased clinical and manufacturing costs related to ACH-3422, and increased costs related to the ACH-3102 and sofosbuvir combination trial, as well as increased costs related to the complement factor D inhibitor program. Personnel costs, consulting, intellectual property and medical affairs related costs also increased.

	General and administrative expenses were $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, the increase primarily resulting from increased professional consulting and corporate legal fees, as well as insurance costs. Personnel costs and non-cash stock-based compensation also increased.2015 Financial Guidance

	At December 31, 2014, Achillion had cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and interest and subscription receivables of approximately $159.2 million. Achillion completed a public offering of common stock on February 18, 2015, and received net proceeds of $132.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.

	The Company expects that research and development expenses during 2015 will be approximately $85 - $95 million and that net cash used in operating activities in 2015 will be approximately $100 - $110 million based on current operating plans, anticipated timelines and the estimated cost of clinical trials and product development programs.

Innovative medicine. Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACHN) is a science-driven, patient-focused company leveraging its strengths across the continuum from drug discovery to commercialization to provide better treatments for people with serious diseases. Achillion’s rational, iterative approach to discovery and development has created a powerful engine for advancing novel small-molecule drugs. Achillion pairs this rigorous science with insights about patients, caregivers, and the healthcare market to choose product candidates with disruptive potential – or the potential to change treatment paradigms. This has already enabled Achillion to generate three clinical-stage oral chronic hepatitis C (HCV) candidates and a proprietary library of over 1,300 potent and specific complement inhibitors. The company’s commitments to scientific excellence and market impact are reinforced by a culture that encourages cross-functional collaboration, organizational nimbleness and resilience, professional courage, and informed risk-taking. By combining great science, a growing commercial capability, and a keen understanding of patient needs, Achillion is rapidly becoming a fully-integrated commercial pharmaceutical company capable of bringing its factor D inhibitors to patients with rare diseases on its own. Achillion is headquartered in New Haven, Connecticut. The company’s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol: ACHN.  Achillion is motivated to be as heroic in all of its efforts as the patients and families we are working to help, as they cope with serious diseases.   Achillion’s Portfolio will Help Redefine Best-in-Class Treatment for HCV Achillion discovered and developed a comprehensive portfolio of antivirals for the treatment of HCV, including a unique second-generation NS5A inhibitor, odalasvir (also known as ACH-3102); a novel nucleotide NS5B polymerase inhibitor, ACH-3422; and a NS3 protease inhibitor, sovaprevir. The potential of Achillion’s three lead HCV candidates has been validated by a worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals worth up to $905 million in milestones plus mid-teen to low-twenties percentage royalties on worldwide sales. Janssen is aggressively pursuing clinical trials with Achillion candidates in combination regimens that may redefine the standard of care for the more than 150 million patients with HCV worldwide. Delivering on the Potential of Alternative Complement Pathway Inhibitors to Provide New Treatments for Rare Diseases and Other Serious Conditions Novel therapeutic approaches that provide potent and targeted suppression of complement, overcome the limitations of current therapy and provide for ease of administration are needed by patients who suffer from complement-mediated diseases. These patients also need improved access to additional treatment options. Potential indications being evaluated for Achillion’s compounds include paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), C3 Glomerulopathy (C3G), dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD), and other therapeutic indications where dysregulation of the complement alternative pathway is implicated. Achillion anticipates that its platform could play a role in addressing the needs of all PNH patients, including patients who have suboptimal response to, or fail to respond to, the currently available treatment, as well as for patients suffering from other complement-mediated diseases.

Style Scores:



F Value | F Growth | B Momentum | F VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Company Summary














ACHILLION PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. is an innovative pharmaceutical company dedicated to bringing important new treatments to patients with infectious disease. The company's proven discovery and development teams have advanced multiple product candidates with novel mechanisms of action. Achillion is focused on solutions for the most challenging problems in infectious disease -- HIV, hepatitis and resistant bacterial infections. Achillion sees significant competitive advantages in developing anti-infective drugs compared to developing drugs in other therapeutic areas. The emergence of drug resistance seen with current antiviral and antibacterial therapies creates a continuing need for new drugs, providing a large and growing potential business opportunity. In addition, development cycle times tend to be somewhat shorter in infectious disease than other therapeutic areas, and early drug development results tend to be more predictive of longer term results.

Achillion Pharmaceutials Announces Key Promotion and Discovery Organization Change




















July 10, 2017 16:05 ET

 | Source: Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.






NEW HAVEN, Conn., July  10, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:ACHN), the leader in complement alternative pathway therapeutics, today announced that Mingjun Huang, Ph.D., is being promoted to Senior Vice President and Head of Research. With this promotion, Dr. Huang broadens her leadership responsibility to all aspects of discovery and non-clinical development. The Company also announced today that Joel Barrish, Ph.D., Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, plans to leave the Company for personal reasons.    Dr. Huang joined Achillion in 2001 as Director of Biology and has advanced through her outstanding contributions to the Company’s discovery efforts and her innovations in building the Company’s drug portfolio. She is a pioneer in the discovery and development of the first oral factor D inhibitor, ACH-4471, as well as the next-generation compounds. "Mingjun's leadership since the inception of the complement program has been fundamental to our understanding of the biology underlying complement factor D inhibition. Her work ethic, scientific acumen, and passion to develop innovative therapies for patients are second to none. I am excited that Mingjun is assuming the leadership of the discovery engine at Achillion," said Milind S. Deshpande, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Achillion. Dr. Huang received her medical training at Shanghai Medical School, Fudan University, her Ph.D. at the University of New Mexico, and her postdoctoral training at the National Institutes of Health. She was a research fellow at National Cancer Institute and also head of antiviral research at Southern Research Institute prior to joining Achillion. Dr. Huang has published over thirty research articles and reviews in prestigious journals, and has presented extensively at international medical and scientific conferences.  Dr. Barrish’s resignation as Chief Scientific Officer is effective as of July 14, 2017. There are no plans to seek a replacement for his position at this time. "In the past year under Joel's tenure, we have significantly expanded the breadth and depth of our Factor D inhibitor library. We wish him the best in his new endeavors," said Deshpande.  Achillion continues to dose PNH patients in a phase 2 study of its first complement factor D inhibitor, ACH-4471, and plans to report interim data during its second quarter 2017 results call. ACH-4471 is also poised to begin a phase 2 clinical study in C3G, a rare kidney disease for which there currently are no approved treatments.  In recent years, Achillion researchers have designed a library of over 2,000 small molecule inhibitors of complement factor D. Factor D occupies a critical position in the complement alternative pathway. Dysregulation of the alternative pathway can induce inflammation and tissue damage and is associated with a variety of diseases, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN) and dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD). Achillion's lead candidate, ACH-4471, entered the clinic last year and is reported to be the first factor D inhibitor to demonstrate complement alternative pathway inhibition in humans after oral dosing. About the Achillion Complement Factor D Platform Achillion has leveraged its internal discovery capabilities and a novel complement-related platform to develop small molecule drug candidates that are oral inhibitors of complement factor D. Factor D is an essential serine protease involved in the complement pathway, a part of the innate immune system. Achillion's complement platform is focused on seeking to advance small molecule compounds that inhibit factor D and can potentially be used in the treatment of immune-related diseases in which complement alternative pathway plays a critical role. Potential indications being evaluated for these compounds include PNH, C3G, IC-MPGN and geographic atrophy (GA), an advanced form of dry AMD. About Achillion Pharmaceuticals Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHN) is a science-driven, patient-focused company seeking to leverage its strengths across the continuum from discovery to commercialization in its goal of providing better treatments for people with serious diseases. The company employs a highly-disciplined discovery and development approach that has allowed it to pursue best-in-class oral antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C (HCV) and build a platform of potent and specific complement inhibitors. Achillion is rapidly advancing its efforts to become a fully-integrated pharmaceutical company with a goal of bringing life-saving medicines to patients with rare diseases.

Achillion Enters Into Worldwide Collaboration for Hepatitis C With Janssen

- Transactions include up to $1.1 billion in potential development, regulatory and sales milestone payments and a separate equity investment -- Achillion eligible for tieredroyalties between mid-teens and low-twenties on future worldwide sales -- Janssen responsible for all development costs within the collaboration and all subsequent costs related to commercialization of the assets -- Conference call scheduled for today at 5:00 p.m. ET -

	NEW HAVEN, Conn., May 19, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:ACHN) announced today that it has entered into a worldwide license and collaboration arrangement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, to develop and commercialize one or more of Achillion's lead hepatitis C virus (HCV) assets which include ACH-3102, ACH-3422, and sovaprevir.

	"We are excited to collaborate with Janssen for the worldwide development of our HCV assets in combination with their HCV portfolio. We believe that Janssen's renowned expertise in HCV development and commercialization enables a synergistic opportunity to rapidly advance our combined HCV assets toward the market while simultaneously achieving an optimized treatment regimen for all HCV patients," said Milind Deshpande, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Achillion. "Furthermore, we believe that their investment in Achillion through Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC allows us to maximize the value from our HCV portfolio and also positions us to become a leader in complement factor D inhibition, applying our broad platform to a wide number of complement-related diseases. We believe this strategy provides an ideal scenario to create further value for our shareholders."

	Under the terms of the agreement, Achillion will grant Janssen an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and, upon regulatory approval, commercialize HCV products and regimens containing one or more of Achillion's HCV assets. Achillion is eligible to receive a number of payments based upon achievement of specified development, regulatory and sales milestones. Achillion is also eligible to receive tiered royalty percentages between mid-teens and low-twenties based upon future worldwide sales. Janssen will be responsible for all of the development costs within the collaboration and all subsequent costs related to commercialization of the HCV assets.

	A key objective of the collaboration will be to develop a short-duration, highly effective, pan-genotypic, oral regimen for the treatment of HCV. An initial regimen that will be explored will feature Achillion's ACH-3102, a second-generation NS5A inhibitor currently in Phase 2 clinical studies that has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in combination with an NS3/4A HCV protease inhibitor plus an NS5B HCV polymerase inhibitor from the collaboration.

	Additionally, in an equity transaction separate to the exclusive license and collaboration arrangement, Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. will invest $225 million in Achillion and, in return, receive approximately 18.4 million newly issued, unregistered shares of Achillion at a price of $12.25 per share.

	The transactions, including the equity sale, are subject to customary closing conditions, including termination or expiration of any applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Transitional clinical development and technology transfer activities under the collaboration are expected to take place over the next several months.

	Centerview Partners acted as exclusive financial advisor to Achillion. Leerink Partners also advised the Company. WilmerHale acted as legal counsel for Achillion in connection with the transactions.Conference Call

	The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the most common causes of viral hepatitis, which is an inflammation of the liver. It is currently estimated that more than 150 million people are infected with HCV worldwide including more than 5 million people in the United States. Three-quarters of the HCV patient population is undiagnosed; it is a silent epidemic and a major global health threat. Chronic hepatitis, if left untreated, can lead to permanent liver damage that can result in the development of liver cancer, liver failure or death. Few therapeutic options currently exist for the treatment of HCV infection.About Achillion Pharmaceuticals

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients.
