Douglas R King's Experience
Title: 
               Company: W.R. Controls
Job Details
               Having been an industry leader since 1981, W.R. Controls has established and built relationships with retail clients, general contractors, electrical contractors, electrical engineers, architects, construction departments, and suppliers. It is through these established relationships, the 25 years in business and the combined personal management experience exceeding 175 years in electrical construction, distribution and controls business, that W.R. Controls has been able to expand our client base and successfully fulfill our promises of lower overall cost and operational efficiency for all accounts. W.R. Controls' primary segment focus and specialties is multi-site retail/commercial accounts and services. We provide power distribution control assemblies to segments such as quick-serve restaurants, specialty retail, convenience stores, and family dining. Through the collaborative efforts of our internal departments of engineering, communication, and national accounts, we currently provide systems for customers that range in store size from 1,000 square feet to 180,000 square feet that open anywhere between 50 - 2,000 stores per year. A key W.R. Controls advantage is our ability to handle any size store, expansion quantity and electrical supply need regardless of the location. W.R. Controls has partnered with industry-leading companies who have also seen how beneficial our specialties collectively can be for multi-site retail stores. We are a division of WESCO Distribution, Inc., a Fortune 500 listed and publicly held $4 billion company. WESCO provides us access to over 1 million power, control and lighting products, national and international distribution locations in excess of 355 branches, and international support organizations.

Douglas R. King, President & CEO, The Museum of Flight, “STEM Initiatives” 

October 14, 2014








      
Doug King leads a team of more than 500 staff members, docents, and volunteers whose mission is to make the Museum of flight the foremost educational air and space museum in the world. He reports to a volunteer Board of Trustees of community and national leaders that defined an extraordinary, world-class long-term vision to accomplish that goal in the decade ahead—Vision 2020. This vision calls for a world-class collection and impactful education program which will deliver an inspirational visitor experience. The Museum of Flight is one of only 900 museums in the nation accredited by the American Alliance of Museums.
King joined the Museum of Flight in January of 2011 after 15 years as President of the St. Louis Science Center, the fourth largest in the country, and one of the nation’s 25 largest museums. While there he built a team that was rewarded with the Association of Science-Technology Center’s highest honor—the Roy L. Shafer Leading Edge Award—three times since 2005.
Prior to his work at the St. Louis Science Center, King served for five years as president of Challenger Center for Space Science Education headquartered in Washington, DC. Founded by the families of the Challenger crew, the center now has established educational facilities in more than 50 cities across North America and England, including St. Louis and Seattle.
Before becoming involved in education, he spent nearly 20 years in the electronics industry. King served as a vice president of the American Electronics Association and president of the Association of Technology Business Councils. He was appointed by the Administrator of NASA to the Agency’s Education and Public Outreach Committee and by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force to the Air Force Civic Leaders Group, where he earned the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal.
He has also served as president of the Association of Museum Directors, Chairman of the NASA Education Advisory Committee, and as a member of the NASA Advisory Council, the Congressional Web-based Education Commission, and the boards of the Association of Science-Technology Centers, the Giant Screen Cinema Association, and the Academy of Science of St. Louis. He is currently an Accreditation Reviewer for the American Alliance of Museums.
A native of Fresno, California, King received his BS degree in engineering from Stanford University and his MBA in finance from the University of Washington. He and his wife Stacy have four adult children and one amazing grandson.
