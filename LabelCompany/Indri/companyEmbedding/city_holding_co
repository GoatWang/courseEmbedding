About City National BankOne of the most profitable publicly traded banks in the U.S., City Holding Company was ranked in the top 10 in its peer group in the country.As City National Bank grows, it is maintaining its identity as a strong, full-service community bank. We offer a range of checking and savings products for both consumer and business customers. Other popular products include competitive mortgages, home equity lines of credit and consumer and business loans. The Trust and Wealth Management division rounds out the financial offerings available for individuals, families and businesses.Financial institutions carry many of the same products, but not all community banks are the same. They differ by their service, priorities and focus. City National Bank employees maintain strong relationships with customers and are in tune with the needs of local citizens. In response to local demand, for instance, we were the first in our markets to introduce an innovative checking option, Bounce Back Checking, for individuals who have been denied the opportunity to open a checking account and are looking for a fresh start.In addition, City National Bank also launched Community Hero Checking, which honors current and retired military personnel, firefighters, police officers, medical professionals and teachers by providing special account benefits.City National Bank is best known for its Simply Free eChecking account. We were the first bank in our region to offer totally free checking. Today, as other banks are discontinuing free checking, it remains our most popular checking option.Our financial institution is among the strongest and most financially sound community banks in the nation. City Holding Company was ranked in the top ten of the Best Banks in America in its peer group by Bank Director Magazine's 2014 Bank Performance Scorecard. Because the company has significant resources – strong earnings, significant capital and considerable talent – we are well positioned to grow beyond our existing geographic, product and customer boundaries. Also, being a community bank, we support our local communities financially. City National Bank contributes generously to the United Way and many other charitable, cultural and civic causes.Headquartered in Charleston, WV, City National Bank has 85 locations throughout West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia and Ohio. Founded in 1957, City Holding today employs approximately 875 professionals.Call or visit a branch today to learn more about how City National Bank stands out from other community banks.

Don’t throw in the towel…establish a towel and apron rental program with ace imagewear instead.Managed Microfiber‎How Microfiber WorksIncredible AbsorbencyMillions‎ of tiny spaces between the fibers collect large amounts of liquids and hold up to 8 times its weight, a 30% improvement over conventional mops. No rinsing or wringing needed, either. You simply replace the soiled microfiber mop pads with pads cleaned by ace imagewear’s special laundered service. A one pad, one room strategy ends cross contamination issues.Wet or Dry Superior CleaningUse the mop dry, and the microfibers have a positive charge that magnetically attract negatively charged elements like dirt, bacteria and dust. When wet, tiny fibers penetrate the microscopic surface pores of flooring materials for better scrubbing. In fact, the ucdmc study found microfiber materials reduced bacteria by 99% compared to just 30% using traditional wet mop cleaning.Our Managed Microfiber ProgramOur Managed Microfiber ProgramThe ace imagewear managed microfiber mop service starts with an in-depth analysis of your organization’s mopping needs. Through this analysis we’ll establish a customized program that includes a complete inventory of specialty microfiber mops, towels and dusters, enough microfiber to last you through a week of cleaning. Then, we'll train your personnel as they transition to this new more cost-effective and ergonomically-friendly cleaning alternative.Send to PhoneHeilman Holding Co Inc4120 E Truman Rd, Kansas City, MO 64127(816) 231-5737Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailHeilman Holding Co Inc4120 E Truman Rd, Kansas City, MO 64127(816) 231-5737Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend
