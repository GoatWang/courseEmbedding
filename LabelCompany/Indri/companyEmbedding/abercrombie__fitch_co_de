            A judge has given final approval to a settlement in a class action lawsuit against Abercrombie & Fitch relating to $25 hard copy promotional gift cards that stated "No expiration date" on the cards. Abercrombie & Fitch, which denies any wrongdoing, has restored 70% of the original remaining value on those promotional gift cards, which Abercrombie & Fitch issued as part of a 2009 winter holiday promotion and a 2010 spring promotion and later voided. The restored value on the cards may be redeemed at any store of the brand that issued the card (or, in the case of Gilly Hicks, at Hollister) until October 18, 2017.

Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) is an American retailer that focuses on upscale casual wear for young consumers, its headquarters are in New Albany, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus.[2] The company operates two other offshoot brands: Abercrombie Kids & Hollister Co. [2] The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands.[citation needed]
Once known for its sexy ad campaigns, the company has toned down its imagery and no longer displays nearly nude models in their advertisements. According to Chairman Arthur Martinez, Abercrombie and Fitch is now targeting an older consumer, from ages 18–25. These changes provide the hopes that the audience will see the company is evolving along with its consumers, and boost sales.[3]
Abercrombie & Fitch is notable for using "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] Its main competitors are Aéropostale and American Eagle Outfitters. Its younger subsidiary, Abercrombie Kids, competes with Aéropostale's P.S., and American Eagle Outfitters's 77kids.

History[edit]
Main article: History of Abercrombie & Fitch




Cover of A&F catalog from 1909.


Founded in 1892 in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, by David T. Abercrombie and Ezra Fitch, Abercrombie & Fitch was an elite outfitter of sporting and excursion goods, particularly noted for its expensive shotguns, fishing rods, fishing boats, and tents.[5] In 1976, Abercrombie & Fitch filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, finally closing its flagship store at Madison Avenue and East 45th Street in 1977.[6]
Shortly thereafter the name was revived in 1978; Oshman's Sporting Goods, a Houston-based chain owned by Jake Oshman,[7] bought the defunct firm's name and mailing list for $1.5 million[8] ($5.2 million in 2013 dollars).[9] Oshman's relaunched A&F as a mail-order retailer specializing in hunting wear and novelty items. It also opened shops in Beverly Hills, Dallas, and (by the mid-1980s) New York City. Finally, in 1988, Oshman's sold the company name and operations to The Limited, a clothing-chain operator based in Columbus, Ohio.[10] Abercrombie & Fitch gradually shifted its focus to young adults, first as a subsidiary of Limited Brands and then as a separate, publicly traded company; and grew to become one of the largest apparel firms in the United States.[11]
Since 1997, the company has consistently kept a high-profile in the public eye, due to its advertising, its philanthropy, and its involvement in legal conflicts over branding, clothing style and employment practices. In the first decade of the 21st century, the Great Recession battered the company's business as teenagers looked to lower-priced fast fashion brands like H&M and Forever 21 for fashion. Abercrombie & Fitch's stock price dropped from an all-time high of $84.23 in October 2007 to a low of $14.64 in November 2008.[12] The company worked to overhaul its merchandise mix and cut underperforming stores,[13] but lackluster performance has continued. Longtime CEO Michael Jeffries stepped down in December 2014, after 22 years with the company.[14]




Abercrombie & Fitch store in New York City


To combat heavy competition from fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21 and H&M, Abercrombie & Fitch announced key changes to change its image. It aims to reduce emphasis on sexualized advertising and focus more on customer service & diversity. Among the changes announced are eliminating sexualized advertising, no longer having shirtless models at new store openings, and eliminating sexualized pictures and advertising on bags, gift cards, and in stores. They are changing the name of store employees from "models" to "brand representatives", and will allow a more individualistic dress code. "Brand representatives" will also focus more on customer service by asking customers for help in stores, as opposed to past policies of aloofness. They also aim to promote more diversity among store employees and executives as well. A&F is signaling it will be implementing changes quickly.[4]
As of May 2015, the changes were already very apparent in stores. All "permanent marketing" images at the cash wrap and fitting rooms have been removed. Also, store models are no longer dressed in Abercrombie clothes.[4]

As of December 9, 2014[update], following the retirement of Mike Jeffries the following were key corporate officials:[15]

Arthur Martinez – Executive Chairman
Diane Chang – Executive Vice President of Sourcing
Leslee K. Herro – Executive Vice President of Planning and Allocation
Ronald A. Robins, Jr. – Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel
Jonathan Ramsden – Chief Operating Officer
Amy Zehrer – Senior Vice President of Stores
Christos Angelides – President of Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands
Fran Horowitz – President of Hollister brand

In April 2017, the company was described by Standard & Poor's as having a market value of $650,000,000 and about $420,000,000 cash on hand. In May 2017, the company was in talks to sell itself. Potential buyers included Express, American Eagle Outfitters and Cerberus Capital Management. Negotiations failed by early July. As a result of the news, on 10 July the firm's stock fell 21%.[16]

Headquarters[edit]
The company's headquarters, referred to by the company as "The Home Office", is located outside of Columbus in New Albany, Ohio.[17] The Home Office is designed as a campus of sorts, and is referred to as such. The company's merchandise-distribution centers (1 million square feet) are located exclusively on campus to help ensure brand protection.[17] Also on campus are mock-up stores, one for each of the company's brands, where store layout, merchandise and atmosphere are determined.[17] In January 2017, the company announced they would be cutting 150 jobs at their corporate headquarters.[18]
The company also has a European office in Mendrisio, Switzerland.[19][20]
Marketing, advertising and brand identity[edit]




The trademark slogan, Casual Luxury.


A&F is known for its racy marketing photography by Bruce Weber.[21] It is rendered to grayscale and features outdoor settings, usually with semi-nude males and females for an increased tone of sexuality. A&F casts only store employees for marketing campaigns. Casting directors from the home office travel to key A&F regional stores in the United States and to London to hold "casting calls" for employees aspiring to become the next "A&F New Face".[22][dead link] The company promotes its casting sessions, models, and photo shoots in the "A&F Casting" feature online at abercrombie.com. The website also provides a gallery of current photography. Framed copies at A&F stores will sometimes name the model and store.
The Abercrombie & Fitch brand image is heavily promoted as an international near-luxury lifestyle concept.[23] The company began cultivating an upscale image after the 2005 opening of its Fifth Avenue flagship store alongside Prada and other upscale retailers.[24] Having for years used high-grade materials in the construction of its merchandise, and pricing them at "near-luxury" levels, A&F introduced the trademark Casual Luxury[24] as a fictional dictionary term with multiple definitions such as "[using] the finest cashmere, pima cottons, and highest quality leather to create the ultimate in casual, body conscious clothing,"[25] and "implementing and/or incorporating time honored machinery ...to produce the most exclusive denim..."[25] This upscale image has allowed A&F to open stores in international high-end locations and further promote the image by pricing its merchandise at almost double the American prices.
Overall, CEO Jeffries calls the A&F image a "movie" because of the "fantasy" that plays out instore.[26] Even some of the clothing is given "story": "You buy into the emotional experience of a movie," Jeffries explains, "And that's what we're creating. Here I am walking into a movie, and I say, 'What's going to be [at] the box office today?'"[26]
Following a dismal earnings announcement on August 2014,[27] the company decided to drop its logo-branded apparel line, arguing that this element of its brand does not resonate with its target market. The company is now shifting its marketing strategy to trendier outfits and faster production processes. Some experts argue the retailer's focus on exclusivity has caused it to fall out of fashion with its target market.[28]




Abercrombie & Fitch models


Store staff[edit]
The company is noted for its use of "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] The models were required to buy and wear A&F clothing, but following a company settlement with California state labor regulators may now wear any no-logo clothing as long as it corresponds with the season and style of the brand. The California settlement also provided $2.2 million to reimburse former employees for their forced purchases of company-branded clothing.[29] An "Impact Team" was created in 2004 to control merchandise within each store and maintain company standards. Bigger and higher volume stores have a "Full Time Stock" who trains Impact associates, processes shipment, maintains stock room standards, and can act as a manager if the store is short on management staffing. The store manager and assistant managers are responsible for forms, lighting, photo marketing, fragrance presentations and to ensure models comply with the "look policy".[30]
Products[edit]

The signature A&F fragrance, FIERCE.


Women's Wear Daily calls Abercrombie & Fitch clothing classically "neo-preppy", with an "edgy tone and imagery".[31] The company's fashions have a reputation for luxury, with the majority of designs trend-driven. There is heavy promotion of "Premium Jeans". In early 2010, the company introduced a leather handbag collection inspired by designs from Ruehl.
Its prices are recognized as the highest in the youth-clothing industry.[32] Internationally, prices are almost double those in its American stores. Retail analyst Chris Boring warns that the company's brands are a "little more susceptible" should recession hit, because their specialties are premium-priced goods rather than necessities.[33] Indeed, as the late-2000s recession continues, A&F has noticeably suffered financially for its refusal to lower prices or offer discounts. A&F argues that doing so would "cheapen" its near-luxury image. Analyst Bruce Watson warns that A&F risks finding itself transformed into "a cautionary tale of a store that was left by the wayside when it declined to change with the times".[32] A&F's year-to-year revenue, a key indicator of a retailer's health, rose 13% in September 2010, aided by strong international sales.[34]
Abercrombie & Fitch has carried men's fragrances Fierce, Colden, and has re-branded the original cologne Woods (Christmas Floorset 2010). Women's fragrances have included 8, Perfume 41, Wakely, and Perfume #1. Fierce and 8 are the most heavily marketed fragrances, as they are the signature scents of the brand overall.[35]
The company also offers the Abercrombie & Fitch Credit Card, issued by the World Financial Network Bank.[36]
Brand protection[edit]
Because of extensive counterfeiting of Abercrombie & Fitch goods, in 2006 the company launched a brand protection program to combat the problem worldwide (focusing more on China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea) by working with legal forces globally.[37] The program is headed by a former FBI Supervisory Special Agent who was part of the FBI's Intellectual Property Rights program, and covers all A&F brands. A&F says that the program "will improve current practices and strategies by focusing on eliminating the supply of illicit Abercrombie & Fitch products."[37]
In August 2011, A&F offered Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino and other cast members of the MTV reality show Jersey Shore a "substantial payment" if they stopped wearing Abercrombie-branded clothes, stating "We are deeply concerned that Mr. Sorrentino's association with our brand could cause significant damage to our image."[38] In November 2011, Sorrentino filed a lawsuit against A&F after the company allegedly violated his copyrights in making shirts that said "The Fitchuation" and "GTL...You Know The Deal."[39]
Stores[edit]

The Modern Canoe store located at the Mall at Millenia in Orlando, Florida with wooden louvers (featuring the Spring Break 2007 marketing campaign picture).


The exterior of the contemporary store design features white molding and formerly black louvers. Starting in mid-2013 and concluding early 2014, the louvers were removed from all locations except flagship stores. The company stated that the louvers were removed in an effort to eliminate the exclusive atmosphere from stores and to experiment with window marketing.[40] The currently featured marketing image directly faces the entrance. The interior is lit with dim ceiling lights and spot lighting. Electronic dance music meant to create an upbeat atmosphere may be played at sound levels as high as 90 decibels, exceeding the corporate policy of 84 decibels and comparable to heavy construction machinery and harmful to the ears.[41]
The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands. The A&F brand has 278[42] locations in the United States, five in Canada (two in Alberta, two in Ontario and one in British Columbia). The company currently operates 25 full-line stores and four outlet stores across sixteen countries.
International expansion[edit]




The Abercrombie & Fitch flagship store in Ginza, Tokyo, Japan – the first one in Asia


The Abercrombie & Fitch brand is believed to have reached its maximum growth potential in the American market. International expansion began in 2005, with the long-term goal of opening flagships for A&F (and eventually all its brands), in high-profile locations worldwide "at a deliberate pace".[43][44] After initially opening at a deliberately slow pace, the company began to accelerate international expansion for its namesake and its Hollister Co. brand in 2012.[45][46]
The first non-U.S. Abercrombie & Fitch stores opened in Toronto and Edmonton in 2005, and then expanded to other major cities in Canada. The company first entered the European market in 2007 with the opening of its flagship London store at 7 Burlington Gardens, Savile Row.[47] Since then, the company has opened stores in Milan, Copenhagen, Paris, Madrid, Brussels Dublin and other major cities in Europe, including six stores in Germany. The company opened its first Asian A&F flagship store in Tokyo in 2009,[48] followed by Fukuoka, Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul.[49] The company would primarily focus on the Chinese and Japanese markets where luxury consumption is high.[50] The company has also entered a franchise agreement with Grupo AXO to open retail stores in Mexico by 2015.[51] The company entered the Middle Eastern market in 2015 with the opening of its flagship store in Kuwait.[52] Since then the company has opened locations in Dubai and plans to expand deeper into the Middle East with stores in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.[53]
Brands[edit]
Abercrombie & Fitch has three concept brands apart from its namesake; they are referred to as subsidiaries, but are operated as divisions under the A&F umbrella.

Abercrombie Kids
Prep-school by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed as "classic cool" for kids 7 through 14,[2] this is the children's version of Abercrombie & Fitch.


Hollister Co.
Southern California by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "SoCal" for teenagers 14 through 18,[2] with significantly lower prices than its parent brand.


Gilly Hicks
The cheeky cousin of Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "Down Under" Sydney, it offered underwear and loungewear for women 18 and up.[55] All stores closed in 2015.[56]


Ruehl No.925
Post-Grad by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after a fictional Greenwich Village heritage, offered clothes for 22 through 35 post-grads. Closed in 2010.[57]

Humanitarian projects[edit]
In recent years, Abercrombie & Fitch has engaged in philanthropic and humanitarian projects. In January 2010, the company launched the "A&F Cares" feature on its website to inform the public about its efforts in the fields of diversity, inclusion, human rights, philanthropy, and sustainability.[58]
The A&F Challenge is an annual fundraising event held on the home office campus in New Albany that features running, walking, biking, entertainment, and food. The funds raised go to the Ohio State University Medical Center's Program for Health, which focuses on "women's cancers and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease."[59]
In 2007, Abercrombie & Fitch partnered with the National Society of High School Scholars at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia to offer US$75,000 scholarships to NSHSS members.[60]
Legal issues[edit]
The company has been involved in legal conflicts over its employment practices, treatment of customers, and clothing styles.
Employment practices[edit]
See also: Employment Practices Liability
In a 2004 lawsuit González v. Abercrombie & Fitch, the company was accused of discriminating against African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women by preferentially offering floor sales positions (called Brand Representatives or Models) and store management positions to Caucasian males.[61] The company agreed to a settlement of the class-action suit, which required the company to (1) pay $40 million to African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women who applied and were not hired or worked in certain store positions, (2) revise its hiring, performance measurement, and promotion policies, (3) revise its internal complaint procedures, (4) appoint a Vice President of Diversity, (5) hire 25 recruiters to seek out minority applicants, (6) discontinue the practice of recruiting employees at primarily white fraternities and sororities, (7) include more minorities in marketing materials, (8) report to a neutral court-appointed monitor twice per year regarding its progress in those areas, and (9) report to the court once per year.[62][63][64]
In June 2009, British law student Riam Dean, who had worked at A&F's flagship store in London's Savile Row, took the company to an employment tribunal. Dean, who was born without a left forearm, claimed that although she was initially given special permission to wear clothing that covered her prosthetic limb, she was soon told that her appearance breached the company's "Look Policy" and sent to work in the stock room, out of sight of customers. Dean sued the company for disability discrimination, and sought up to £20,000 in damages.[65] In August 2009, the tribunal ruled the 22-year-old was wrongfully dismissed and unlawfully harassed. She was awarded £8,013 for loss of earnings and wrongful dismissal.[66][67]
In a lawsuit filed in September 2009, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores,[68] in U.S. District Court by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 17-year-old Samantha Elauf said she applied, in June 2008, for a sales position at the Abercrombie Kids store in the Woodland Hills Mall, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The teen, who wears a hijab in accordance with her religious beliefs, claims the manager told her the headscarf violates the store's "Look Policy".[69] The United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on February 25, 2015,[70] and ruled 8-1 on June 1, 2015 against the company.[71]
In 2010, a Muslim woman working at a Hollister store in San Mateo, California, was fired. Before being dismissed, Hani Khan had refused Abercrombie & Fitch's human-resources representative's demand that she remove her hijab. The representative reportedly stated that the headscarf, which Khan wears for religious reasons, violated the company's "Look Policy". The civil liberties group Council on American-Islamic Relations has stated that the dismissal is a violation of nondiscrimination laws, and filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.[72]
In 2011, the Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism started an investigation into A&F's hiring and remuneration policies. The firm was suspected of only hiring personnel under 25 years old, making heavy demands on the physical appearance of its staff and rewarding a premium to male models that work shirtless.[73]
Customer issues[edit]
In 2009, the company was fined more than $115,000 by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights for refusing to let a teenage girl help her sister, who has autism, try on clothes in a fitting room. The amount of the fine reflected "pushback" by the company according to Michael K. Browne, the legal affairs manager of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.[74]
A 16-year-old is suing the company after discovering that she was being videotaped in an A&F changing room by an employee, Kenneth Applegate II. Applegate denied the claim, but co-workers discovered his camera days later with the video on it.[75]
In 2010, a customer filed a class action relating to a 2009 holiday gift card promotion. The lawsuit alleges that the gift cards said "No Expiration Date" but Abercrombie voided and expired the gift cards in early 2010. In 2012, a judge certified a nationwide class in the case. In May 2013, Class Notice went out to potential class members.[76]
Lawsuits against other parties[edit]
In 2002, the company filed a lawsuit against American Eagle Outfitters, claiming that American Eagle copied A&F garment designs, among other things. The lawsuit was based on a trade-dress claim, stating that American Eagle had very closely mimicked A&F's products' visual appearance and packaging. Specifically, A&F claimed that American Eagle copied particular articles of clothing, in-store displays and advertisements, and even the A&F product catalog. Despite the admission that American Eagle might have utilized very similar materials, designs, in-store displays, symbols, color combinations, and patterns as A&F, the court ruled that there was not an excessive level of similarity to confuse potential customers, and therefore the court ruled in favor of American Eagle.[77]
On October 18, 1999, Abercrombie & Fitch had a lawsuit about making false and misleading statements concerning its growth while knowing the actual growth was less than Wall Street expectations,[78] and paid $6,050,000 for settlement.
Controversy and criticism[edit]
Since its re-establishment in 1988, Abercrombie & Fitch has faced numerous accusations regarding its employment practices, merchandise, and advertising campaigns which have been described as sexually explicit and racist.[21][79]
Advertising[edit]
The company has received criticism over its provocative advertising.[80] The company has been accused of promoting the sexualization of pre-teen girls, for example by marketing thongs to 10-year-olds and padded bikini tops to 7-year-olds.[81]
Employment and labor practices[edit]
Lawsuits have been filed against the company due to alleged discriminatory employment practices. In 2004, in Gonzalez v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores (see "Legal issues" and "Controversy and Criticism" below), the company was sued for giving desirable positions to white applicants, to the exclusion of minorities.[62][82]
In November 2009, Abercrombie & Fitch was added to the "Sweatshop Hall of Shame 2010" by the worker advocacy group International Labor Rights Forum.[83]
A&F Quarterly[edit]
Main article: A&F Quarterly
Conservative and religious groups called for boycotts of the original American publication of A&F Quarterly (published from 1997 to 2003) for its sexually explicit nature.[84] The magazine contained nude photography by Bruce Weber, articles about sex, and recipes for alcoholic beverages. Also acting as a catalog, the Quarterly displayed the brand's merchandise with information and prices. Advertisements for the A&F Quarterly appeared in Interview, Out, Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair.[85]
Despite a company policy restricting sale of the publication to minors, critics charged that the publication was readily sold to minors. In 2003, an array of religious organizations, women's rights activists, and Asian American groups organized boycotts and protests over the publication, and the "Christmas Edition" of the catalog was removed from stores.[86] Although Jeffries said he chose to discontinue the catalog, because "Frankly, [he] was getting sick of the old one; it was getting boring," on June 17, 2010, the company made the announcement, "The Return of the A&F Quarterly" and invited email subscribers to reserve their $10 copy for a July 17, 2010, in-store release date.[87]
Product criticism[edit]
In 2002, A&F sold a shirt that featured the slogan "Wong Brothers Laundry Service – Two Wongs Can Make It White" with smiling figures in conical Asian hats, a depiction of early Chinese immigrants. The company discontinued the designs and apologized after a boycott started by an Asian American student group at Stanford University.[88] That same year, abercrombie kids removed a line of thong underwear sold for girls in pre-teen children's sizes after parents mounted nationwide storefront protests. The underwear included phrases like "Eye Candy" and "Wink Wink" printed on the front.[89]
More T-shirt controversies occurred in 2004. The first incident involved a shirt featuring the phrase, "It's All Relative in West Virginia," a jab at alleged incestuous relationships in rural America. West Virginia Governor Bob Wise spoke out against the company for depicting "an unfounded, negative stereotype of West Virginia", but the shirts were not removed.[90] Later, another T-shirt that said "L is for Loser" next to a picture of a male gymnast on the rings gathered publicity. The company stopped selling the shirt in October 2004 after USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi announced a boycott of A&F for mocking the sport.[91]
In 2005, the Women and Girls Foundation of Southwest Pennsylvania launched a "Girlcott" of the store to protest the sale of T-shirts displaying sexist messages such as "Who needs brains when you have these?", "Available for parties," and "I had a nightmare I was a brunette." The campaign received national coverage on The Today Show, and the company pulled the shirts from stores on November 5, 2005.[92] Five days after this media coverage, A&F pulled two of the shirts from its shelves, released an apology to girls for producing the T-shirts, and agreed to have corporate executives meet with the "Girlcott" girls at the company's headquarters.[93]
Bob Jones University, a non-denominational Protestant university located in Greenville, South Carolina, and its affiliated pre-collegiate schools, along with other Christian schools, have prohibited A&F and Hollister clothing from being "worn, carried, or displayed" on its campuses because of "an unusual degree of antagonism to the name of Christ and an unusual display of wickedness" in the company's promotions.[94]
After A&F raised its price points in 2004, its products have been described as overpriced.[87] After the company opened its flagship store in London, England and Paris, France, the brand was criticized in the United Kingdom and France because the merchandise that was offered to the customers cost double (or a direct $/£ - $/€ swap) compared to prices found in the U.S.[95]
A T-shirt controversy arose again over A&F's Back-to-School 2009 collection of "humor tees".[96] One shirt proclaims "Show the twins" above a picture of a young woman with her blouse open to two men. Two other shirts state "Female streaking encouraged" and "Female Students Wanted for Sexual Research".[96] The American Family Association disapproved of the influence of the "sex-as-recreation" lifestyle shirts, and asked the brand to remove its "sexualized shirts" from display.[96]
Renaming of trauma center[edit]
In 2008, Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio agreed to rename its emergency room to the Abercrombie & Fitch Emergency Department and Trauma Center in exchange for a $10 million donation.[97] A letter written by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, signed by over 100 doctors and children's advocacy groups, argued against the renaming, for the "company's appalling history of targeting children with sexualized marketing and clothing."[98]
Remembrance poppy prohibition in the UK[edit]
In November 2010, the Southampton, England, A&F store prevented 18-year-old Harriet Phipps from wearing a remembrance poppy, which is worn as part of the Remembrance Day commemorations in the United Kingdom and Canada every November. The official A&F reason for the refusal was reported to be that the poppy is not considered part of the corporate approved uniform, and is therefore prohibited.[99] The ban drew criticisms, and on November 8 the company posted on its Facebook page the following statement: "As an American company that has been around since 1892, we appreciate the sacrifices of the British and American servicemen/women in the World Wars and in military conflicts that continue today. Our company policy is to allow associates to wear a poppy as a token of this appreciation on Remembrance Day. Going forward, ...we will revisit this policy to the days/weeks leading up to Remembrance Day."
Abercrombie Kids shop on Savile Row[edit]
In 2012, A&F announced plans that it would open its Abercrombie Kids shop at No. 3 on Savile Row, next door to Gieves & Hawkes.[100] The plans drew criticism and opposition from the tailors of the Row, who were already unhappy about the presence of the main A&F store on Burlington Gardens at the end of the Row to begin with, which eventually led to a protest organized by The Chap magazine on April 23, 2012.[101][102] During the consultation period, objections were lodged to Westminster City Council and in February 2013 the Council rejected many of A&F's proposals for the store, and branded the entire plans "utterly unacceptable."[103][104] A&F appealed, managed to overcome the obstacles and opened the store in September 2014.[105] The following year, A&F was subject to nearly £16,000 in fines and legal costs when it was ruled that changes it had made to the Grade II-listed building were illegal.[106]
Jeffries' 2006 target demographic quote[edit]
In 2013, a 2006 Salon interview with the CEO Mike Jeffries went viral and caused widespread outcry over Abercrombie's marketing practices.[107][108][109] The comments made by Mike Jeffries, stating that his brand is only suitable for "the good-looking, cool kids," and that there are people who do not belong in his clothes – namely overweight people, came under fire.[110][111]

That's why we hire good-looking people in our stores. Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don't market to anyone other than that. ... In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids. Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.[112]

These quotes, which were the basis for the article's "youth, sex and casual superiority" headline, went largely unnoticed when the article was published in 2006, until they resurfaced in May 2013 after former Jenny Craig weight-loss spokesperson Kirstie Alley brought them up in an Entertainment Tonight interview.[113] Prominent talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres also later spoke out against the company.[114][115] As the article gained momentum via social media, the company's official Facebook site was bombarded by comments and posts against this strategy.[116]
Jeffries issued an official statement on May 17, 2013, regarding the news articles, saying, "I want to address some of my comments that have been circulating from a 2006 interview. While I believe this 7-year-old, resurrected quote has been taken out of context, I sincerely regret that my choice of words was interpreted in a manner that has caused offense." He also stated, "We are completely opposed to any discrimination, bullying, derogatory characterizations or other anti-social behavior based on race, gender, body type or other individual characteristics."[117]

Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) is an American retailer that focuses on upscale casual wear for young consumers, its headquarters are in New Albany, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus.[2] The company operates two other offshoot brands: Abercrombie Kids & Hollister Co. [2] The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands.[citation needed]
Once known for its sexy ad campaigns, the company has toned down its imagery and no longer displays nearly nude models in their advertisements. According to Chairman Arthur Martinez, Abercrombie and Fitch is now targeting an older consumer, from ages 18–25. These changes provide the hopes that the audience will see the company is evolving along with its consumers, and boost sales.[3]
Abercrombie & Fitch is notable for using "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] Its main competitors are Aéropostale and American Eagle Outfitters. Its younger subsidiary, Abercrombie Kids, competes with Aéropostale's P.S., and American Eagle Outfitters's 77kids.

History[edit]
Main article: History of Abercrombie & Fitch




Cover of A&F catalog from 1909.


Founded in 1892 in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, by David T. Abercrombie and Ezra Fitch, Abercrombie & Fitch was an elite outfitter of sporting and excursion goods, particularly noted for its expensive shotguns, fishing rods, fishing boats, and tents.[5] In 1976, Abercrombie & Fitch filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, finally closing its flagship store at Madison Avenue and East 45th Street in 1977.[6]
Shortly thereafter the name was revived in 1978; Oshman's Sporting Goods, a Houston-based chain owned by Jake Oshman,[7] bought the defunct firm's name and mailing list for $1.5 million[8] ($5.2 million in 2013 dollars).[9] Oshman's relaunched A&F as a mail-order retailer specializing in hunting wear and novelty items. It also opened shops in Beverly Hills, Dallas, and (by the mid-1980s) New York City. Finally, in 1988, Oshman's sold the company name and operations to The Limited, a clothing-chain operator based in Columbus, Ohio.[10] Abercrombie & Fitch gradually shifted its focus to young adults, first as a subsidiary of Limited Brands and then as a separate, publicly traded company; and grew to become one of the largest apparel firms in the United States.[11]
Since 1997, the company has consistently kept a high-profile in the public eye, due to its advertising, its philanthropy, and its involvement in legal conflicts over branding, clothing style and employment practices. In the first decade of the 21st century, the Great Recession battered the company's business as teenagers looked to lower-priced fast fashion brands like H&M and Forever 21 for fashion. Abercrombie & Fitch's stock price dropped from an all-time high of $84.23 in October 2007 to a low of $14.64 in November 2008.[12] The company worked to overhaul its merchandise mix and cut underperforming stores,[13] but lackluster performance has continued. Longtime CEO Michael Jeffries stepped down in December 2014, after 22 years with the company.[14]




Abercrombie & Fitch store in New York City


To combat heavy competition from fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21 and H&M, Abercrombie & Fitch announced key changes to change its image. It aims to reduce emphasis on sexualized advertising and focus more on customer service & diversity. Among the changes announced are eliminating sexualized advertising, no longer having shirtless models at new store openings, and eliminating sexualized pictures and advertising on bags, gift cards, and in stores. They are changing the name of store employees from "models" to "brand representatives", and will allow a more individualistic dress code. "Brand representatives" will also focus more on customer service by asking customers for help in stores, as opposed to past policies of aloofness. They also aim to promote more diversity among store employees and executives as well. A&F is signaling it will be implementing changes quickly.[4]
As of May 2015, the changes were already very apparent in stores. All "permanent marketing" images at the cash wrap and fitting rooms have been removed. Also, store models are no longer dressed in Abercrombie clothes.[4]

As of December 9, 2014[update], following the retirement of Mike Jeffries the following were key corporate officials:[15]

Arthur Martinez – Executive Chairman
Diane Chang – Executive Vice President of Sourcing
Leslee K. Herro – Executive Vice President of Planning and Allocation
Ronald A. Robins, Jr. – Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel
Jonathan Ramsden – Chief Operating Officer
Amy Zehrer – Senior Vice President of Stores
Christos Angelides – President of Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands
Fran Horowitz – President of Hollister brand

In April 2017, the company was described by Standard & Poor's as having a market value of $650,000,000 and about $420,000,000 cash on hand. In May 2017, the company was in talks to sell itself. Potential buyers included Express, American Eagle Outfitters and Cerberus Capital Management. Negotiations failed by early July. As a result of the news, on 10 July the firm's stock fell 21%.[16]

Headquarters[edit]
The company's headquarters, referred to by the company as "The Home Office", is located outside of Columbus in New Albany, Ohio.[17] The Home Office is designed as a campus of sorts, and is referred to as such. The company's merchandise-distribution centers (1 million square feet) are located exclusively on campus to help ensure brand protection.[17] Also on campus are mock-up stores, one for each of the company's brands, where store layout, merchandise and atmosphere are determined.[17] In January 2017, the company announced they would be cutting 150 jobs at their corporate headquarters.[18]
The company also has a European office in Mendrisio, Switzerland.[19][20]
Marketing, advertising and brand identity[edit]




The trademark slogan, Casual Luxury.


A&F is known for its racy marketing photography by Bruce Weber.[21] It is rendered to grayscale and features outdoor settings, usually with semi-nude males and females for an increased tone of sexuality. A&F casts only store employees for marketing campaigns. Casting directors from the home office travel to key A&F regional stores in the United States and to London to hold "casting calls" for employees aspiring to become the next "A&F New Face".[22][dead link] The company promotes its casting sessions, models, and photo shoots in the "A&F Casting" feature online at abercrombie.com. The website also provides a gallery of current photography. Framed copies at A&F stores will sometimes name the model and store.
The Abercrombie & Fitch brand image is heavily promoted as an international near-luxury lifestyle concept.[23] The company began cultivating an upscale image after the 2005 opening of its Fifth Avenue flagship store alongside Prada and other upscale retailers.[24] Having for years used high-grade materials in the construction of its merchandise, and pricing them at "near-luxury" levels, A&F introduced the trademark Casual Luxury[24] as a fictional dictionary term with multiple definitions such as "[using] the finest cashmere, pima cottons, and highest quality leather to create the ultimate in casual, body conscious clothing,"[25] and "implementing and/or incorporating time honored machinery ...to produce the most exclusive denim..."[25] This upscale image has allowed A&F to open stores in international high-end locations and further promote the image by pricing its merchandise at almost double the American prices.
Overall, CEO Jeffries calls the A&F image a "movie" because of the "fantasy" that plays out instore.[26] Even some of the clothing is given "story": "You buy into the emotional experience of a movie," Jeffries explains, "And that's what we're creating. Here I am walking into a movie, and I say, 'What's going to be [at] the box office today?'"[26]
Following a dismal earnings announcement on August 2014,[27] the company decided to drop its logo-branded apparel line, arguing that this element of its brand does not resonate with its target market. The company is now shifting its marketing strategy to trendier outfits and faster production processes. Some experts argue the retailer's focus on exclusivity has caused it to fall out of fashion with its target market.[28]




Abercrombie & Fitch models


Store staff[edit]
The company is noted for its use of "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] The models were required to buy and wear A&F clothing, but following a company settlement with California state labor regulators may now wear any no-logo clothing as long as it corresponds with the season and style of the brand. The California settlement also provided $2.2 million to reimburse former employees for their forced purchases of company-branded clothing.[29] An "Impact Team" was created in 2004 to control merchandise within each store and maintain company standards. Bigger and higher volume stores have a "Full Time Stock" who trains Impact associates, processes shipment, maintains stock room standards, and can act as a manager if the store is short on management staffing. The store manager and assistant managers are responsible for forms, lighting, photo marketing, fragrance presentations and to ensure models comply with the "look policy".[30]
Products[edit]

The signature A&F fragrance, FIERCE.


Women's Wear Daily calls Abercrombie & Fitch clothing classically "neo-preppy", with an "edgy tone and imagery".[31] The company's fashions have a reputation for luxury, with the majority of designs trend-driven. There is heavy promotion of "Premium Jeans". In early 2010, the company introduced a leather handbag collection inspired by designs from Ruehl.
Its prices are recognized as the highest in the youth-clothing industry.[32] Internationally, prices are almost double those in its American stores. Retail analyst Chris Boring warns that the company's brands are a "little more susceptible" should recession hit, because their specialties are premium-priced goods rather than necessities.[33] Indeed, as the late-2000s recession continues, A&F has noticeably suffered financially for its refusal to lower prices or offer discounts. A&F argues that doing so would "cheapen" its near-luxury image. Analyst Bruce Watson warns that A&F risks finding itself transformed into "a cautionary tale of a store that was left by the wayside when it declined to change with the times".[32] A&F's year-to-year revenue, a key indicator of a retailer's health, rose 13% in September 2010, aided by strong international sales.[34]
Abercrombie & Fitch has carried men's fragrances Fierce, Colden, and has re-branded the original cologne Woods (Christmas Floorset 2010). Women's fragrances have included 8, Perfume 41, Wakely, and Perfume #1. Fierce and 8 are the most heavily marketed fragrances, as they are the signature scents of the brand overall.[35]
The company also offers the Abercrombie & Fitch Credit Card, issued by the World Financial Network Bank.[36]
Brand protection[edit]
Because of extensive counterfeiting of Abercrombie & Fitch goods, in 2006 the company launched a brand protection program to combat the problem worldwide (focusing more on China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea) by working with legal forces globally.[37] The program is headed by a former FBI Supervisory Special Agent who was part of the FBI's Intellectual Property Rights program, and covers all A&F brands. A&F says that the program "will improve current practices and strategies by focusing on eliminating the supply of illicit Abercrombie & Fitch products."[37]
In August 2011, A&F offered Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino and other cast members of the MTV reality show Jersey Shore a "substantial payment" if they stopped wearing Abercrombie-branded clothes, stating "We are deeply concerned that Mr. Sorrentino's association with our brand could cause significant damage to our image."[38] In November 2011, Sorrentino filed a lawsuit against A&F after the company allegedly violated his copyrights in making shirts that said "The Fitchuation" and "GTL...You Know The Deal."[39]
Stores[edit]

The Modern Canoe store located at the Mall at Millenia in Orlando, Florida with wooden louvers (featuring the Spring Break 2007 marketing campaign picture).


The exterior of the contemporary store design features white molding and formerly black louvers. Starting in mid-2013 and concluding early 2014, the louvers were removed from all locations except flagship stores. The company stated that the louvers were removed in an effort to eliminate the exclusive atmosphere from stores and to experiment with window marketing.[40] The currently featured marketing image directly faces the entrance. The interior is lit with dim ceiling lights and spot lighting. Electronic dance music meant to create an upbeat atmosphere may be played at sound levels as high as 90 decibels, exceeding the corporate policy of 84 decibels and comparable to heavy construction machinery and harmful to the ears.[41]
The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands. The A&F brand has 278[42] locations in the United States, five in Canada (two in Alberta, two in Ontario and one in British Columbia). The company currently operates 25 full-line stores and four outlet stores across sixteen countries.
International expansion[edit]




The Abercrombie & Fitch flagship store in Ginza, Tokyo, Japan – the first one in Asia


The Abercrombie & Fitch brand is believed to have reached its maximum growth potential in the American market. International expansion began in 2005, with the long-term goal of opening flagships for A&F (and eventually all its brands), in high-profile locations worldwide "at a deliberate pace".[43][44] After initially opening at a deliberately slow pace, the company began to accelerate international expansion for its namesake and its Hollister Co. brand in 2012.[45][46]
The first non-U.S. Abercrombie & Fitch stores opened in Toronto and Edmonton in 2005, and then expanded to other major cities in Canada. The company first entered the European market in 2007 with the opening of its flagship London store at 7 Burlington Gardens, Savile Row.[47] Since then, the company has opened stores in Milan, Copenhagen, Paris, Madrid, Brussels Dublin and other major cities in Europe, including six stores in Germany. The company opened its first Asian A&F flagship store in Tokyo in 2009,[48] followed by Fukuoka, Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul.[49] The company would primarily focus on the Chinese and Japanese markets where luxury consumption is high.[50] The company has also entered a franchise agreement with Grupo AXO to open retail stores in Mexico by 2015.[51] The company entered the Middle Eastern market in 2015 with the opening of its flagship store in Kuwait.[52] Since then the company has opened locations in Dubai and plans to expand deeper into the Middle East with stores in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.[53]
Brands[edit]
Abercrombie & Fitch has three concept brands apart from its namesake; they are referred to as subsidiaries, but are operated as divisions under the A&F umbrella.

Abercrombie Kids
Prep-school by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed as "classic cool" for kids 7 through 14,[2] this is the children's version of Abercrombie & Fitch.


Hollister Co.
Southern California by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "SoCal" for teenagers 14 through 18,[2] with significantly lower prices than its parent brand.


Gilly Hicks
The cheeky cousin of Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "Down Under" Sydney, it offered underwear and loungewear for women 18 and up.[55] All stores closed in 2015.[56]


Ruehl No.925
Post-Grad by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after a fictional Greenwich Village heritage, offered clothes for 22 through 35 post-grads. Closed in 2010.[57]

Humanitarian projects[edit]
In recent years, Abercrombie & Fitch has engaged in philanthropic and humanitarian projects. In January 2010, the company launched the "A&F Cares" feature on its website to inform the public about its efforts in the fields of diversity, inclusion, human rights, philanthropy, and sustainability.[58]
The A&F Challenge is an annual fundraising event held on the home office campus in New Albany that features running, walking, biking, entertainment, and food. The funds raised go to the Ohio State University Medical Center's Program for Health, which focuses on "women's cancers and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease."[59]
In 2007, Abercrombie & Fitch partnered with the National Society of High School Scholars at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia to offer US$75,000 scholarships to NSHSS members.[60]
Legal issues[edit]
The company has been involved in legal conflicts over its employment practices, treatment of customers, and clothing styles.
Employment practices[edit]
See also: Employment Practices Liability
In a 2004 lawsuit González v. Abercrombie & Fitch, the company was accused of discriminating against African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women by preferentially offering floor sales positions (called Brand Representatives or Models) and store management positions to Caucasian males.[61] The company agreed to a settlement of the class-action suit, which required the company to (1) pay $40 million to African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women who applied and were not hired or worked in certain store positions, (2) revise its hiring, performance measurement, and promotion policies, (3) revise its internal complaint procedures, (4) appoint a Vice President of Diversity, (5) hire 25 recruiters to seek out minority applicants, (6) discontinue the practice of recruiting employees at primarily white fraternities and sororities, (7) include more minorities in marketing materials, (8) report to a neutral court-appointed monitor twice per year regarding its progress in those areas, and (9) report to the court once per year.[62][63][64]
In June 2009, British law student Riam Dean, who had worked at A&F's flagship store in London's Savile Row, took the company to an employment tribunal. Dean, who was born without a left forearm, claimed that although she was initially given special permission to wear clothing that covered her prosthetic limb, she was soon told that her appearance breached the company's "Look Policy" and sent to work in the stock room, out of sight of customers. Dean sued the company for disability discrimination, and sought up to £20,000 in damages.[65] In August 2009, the tribunal ruled the 22-year-old was wrongfully dismissed and unlawfully harassed. She was awarded £8,013 for loss of earnings and wrongful dismissal.[66][67]
In a lawsuit filed in September 2009, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores,[68] in U.S. District Court by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 17-year-old Samantha Elauf said she applied, in June 2008, for a sales position at the Abercrombie Kids store in the Woodland Hills Mall, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The teen, who wears a hijab in accordance with her religious beliefs, claims the manager told her the headscarf violates the store's "Look Policy".[69] The United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on February 25, 2015,[70] and ruled 8-1 on June 1, 2015 against the company.[71]
In 2010, a Muslim woman working at a Hollister store in San Mateo, California, was fired. Before being dismissed, Hani Khan had refused Abercrombie & Fitch's human-resources representative's demand that she remove her hijab. The representative reportedly stated that the headscarf, which Khan wears for religious reasons, violated the company's "Look Policy". The civil liberties group Council on American-Islamic Relations has stated that the dismissal is a violation of nondiscrimination laws, and filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.[72]
In 2011, the Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism started an investigation into A&F's hiring and remuneration policies. The firm was suspected of only hiring personnel under 25 years old, making heavy demands on the physical appearance of its staff and rewarding a premium to male models that work shirtless.[73]
Customer issues[edit]
In 2009, the company was fined more than $115,000 by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights for refusing to let a teenage girl help her sister, who has autism, try on clothes in a fitting room. The amount of the fine reflected "pushback" by the company according to Michael K. Browne, the legal affairs manager of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.[74]
A 16-year-old is suing the company after discovering that she was being videotaped in an A&F changing room by an employee, Kenneth Applegate II. Applegate denied the claim, but co-workers discovered his camera days later with the video on it.[75]
In 2010, a customer filed a class action relating to a 2009 holiday gift card promotion. The lawsuit alleges that the gift cards said "No Expiration Date" but Abercrombie voided and expired the gift cards in early 2010. In 2012, a judge certified a nationwide class in the case. In May 2013, Class Notice went out to potential class members.[76]
Lawsuits against other parties[edit]
In 2002, the company filed a lawsuit against American Eagle Outfitters, claiming that American Eagle copied A&F garment designs, among other things. The lawsuit was based on a trade-dress claim, stating that American Eagle had very closely mimicked A&F's products' visual appearance and packaging. Specifically, A&F claimed that American Eagle copied particular articles of clothing, in-store displays and advertisements, and even the A&F product catalog. Despite the admission that American Eagle might have utilized very similar materials, designs, in-store displays, symbols, color combinations, and patterns as A&F, the court ruled that there was not an excessive level of similarity to confuse potential customers, and therefore the court ruled in favor of American Eagle.[77]
On October 18, 1999, Abercrombie & Fitch had a lawsuit about making false and misleading statements concerning its growth while knowing the actual growth was less than Wall Street expectations,[78] and paid $6,050,000 for settlement.
Controversy and criticism[edit]
Since its re-establishment in 1988, Abercrombie & Fitch has faced numerous accusations regarding its employment practices, merchandise, and advertising campaigns which have been described as sexually explicit and racist.[21][79]
Advertising[edit]
The company has received criticism over its provocative advertising.[80] The company has been accused of promoting the sexualization of pre-teen girls, for example by marketing thongs to 10-year-olds and padded bikini tops to 7-year-olds.[81]
Employment and labor practices[edit]
Lawsuits have been filed against the company due to alleged discriminatory employment practices. In 2004, in Gonzalez v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores (see "Legal issues" and "Controversy and Criticism" below), the company was sued for giving desirable positions to white applicants, to the exclusion of minorities.[62][82]
In November 2009, Abercrombie & Fitch was added to the "Sweatshop Hall of Shame 2010" by the worker advocacy group International Labor Rights Forum.[83]

Conservative and religious groups called for boycotts of the original American publication of A&F Quarterly (published from 1997 to 2003) for its sexually explicit nature.[84] The magazine contained nude photography by Bruce Weber, articles about sex, and recipes for alcoholic beverages. Also acting as a catalog, the Quarterly displayed the brand's merchandise with information and prices. Advertisements for the A&F Quarterly appeared in Interview, Out, Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair.[85]
Despite a company policy restricting sale of the publication to minors, critics charged that the publication was readily sold to minors. In 2003, an array of religious organizations, women's rights activists, and Asian American groups organized boycotts and protests over the publication, and the "Christmas Edition" of the catalog was removed from stores.[86] Although Jeffries said he chose to discontinue the catalog, because "Frankly, [he] was getting sick of the old one; it was getting boring," on June 17, 2010, the company made the announcement, "The Return of the A&F Quarterly" and invited email subscribers to reserve their $10 copy for a July 17, 2010, in-store release date.[87]
Product criticism[edit]
In 2002, A&F sold a shirt that featured the slogan "Wong Brothers Laundry Service – Two Wongs Can Make It White" with smiling figures in conical Asian hats, a depiction of early Chinese immigrants. The company discontinued the designs and apologized after a boycott started by an Asian American student group at Stanford University.[88] That same year, abercrombie kids removed a line of thong underwear sold for girls in pre-teen children's sizes after parents mounted nationwide storefront protests. The underwear included phrases like "Eye Candy" and "Wink Wink" printed on the front.[89]
More T-shirt controversies occurred in 2004. The first incident involved a shirt featuring the phrase, "It's All Relative in West Virginia," a jab at alleged incestuous relationships in rural America. West Virginia Governor Bob Wise spoke out against the company for depicting "an unfounded, negative stereotype of West Virginia", but the shirts were not removed.[90] Later, another T-shirt that said "L is for Loser" next to a picture of a male gymnast on the rings gathered publicity. The company stopped selling the shirt in October 2004 after USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi announced a boycott of A&F for mocking the sport.[91]
In 2005, the Women and Girls Foundation of Southwest Pennsylvania launched a "Girlcott" of the store to protest the sale of T-shirts displaying sexist messages such as "Who needs brains when you have these?", "Available for parties," and "I had a nightmare I was a brunette." The campaign received national coverage on The Today Show, and the company pulled the shirts from stores on November 5, 2005.[92] Five days after this media coverage, A&F pulled two of the shirts from its shelves, released an apology to girls for producing the T-shirts, and agreed to have corporate executives meet with the "Girlcott" girls at the company's headquarters.[93]
Bob Jones University, a non-denominational Protestant university located in Greenville, South Carolina, and its affiliated pre-collegiate schools, along with other Christian schools, have prohibited A&F and Hollister clothing from being "worn, carried, or displayed" on its campuses because of "an unusual degree of antagonism to the name of Christ and an unusual display of wickedness" in the company's promotions.[94]
After A&F raised its price points in 2004, its products have been described as overpriced.[87] After the company opened its flagship store in London, England and Paris, France, the brand was criticized in the United Kingdom and France because the merchandise that was offered to the customers cost double (or a direct $/£ - $/€ swap) compared to prices found in the U.S.[95]
A T-shirt controversy arose again over A&F's Back-to-School 2009 collection of "humor tees".[96] One shirt proclaims "Show the twins" above a picture of a young woman with her blouse open to two men. Two other shirts state "Female streaking encouraged" and "Female Students Wanted for Sexual Research".[96] The American Family Association disapproved of the influence of the "sex-as-recreation" lifestyle shirts, and asked the brand to remove its "sexualized shirts" from display.[96]
Renaming of trauma center[edit]
In 2008, Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio agreed to rename its emergency room to the Abercrombie & Fitch Emergency Department and Trauma Center in exchange for a $10 million donation.[97] A letter written by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, signed by over 100 doctors and children's advocacy groups, argued against the renaming, for the "company's appalling history of targeting children with sexualized marketing and clothing."[98]
Remembrance poppy prohibition in the UK[edit]
In November 2010, the Southampton, England, A&F store prevented 18-year-old Harriet Phipps from wearing a remembrance poppy, which is worn as part of the Remembrance Day commemorations in the United Kingdom and Canada every November. The official A&F reason for the refusal was reported to be that the poppy is not considered part of the corporate approved uniform, and is therefore prohibited.[99] The ban drew criticisms, and on November 8 the company posted on its Facebook page the following statement: "As an American company that has been around since 1892, we appreciate the sacrifices of the British and American servicemen/women in the World Wars and in military conflicts that continue today. Our company policy is to allow associates to wear a poppy as a token of this appreciation on Remembrance Day. Going forward, ...we will revisit this policy to the days/weeks leading up to Remembrance Day."
Abercrombie Kids shop on Savile Row[edit]
In 2012, A&F announced plans that it would open its Abercrombie Kids shop at No. 3 on Savile Row, next door to Gieves & Hawkes.[100] The plans drew criticism and opposition from the tailors of the Row, who were already unhappy about the presence of the main A&F store on Burlington Gardens at the end of the Row to begin with, which eventually led to a protest organized by The Chap magazine on April 23, 2012.[101][102] During the consultation period, objections were lodged to Westminster City Council and in February 2013 the Council rejected many of A&F's proposals for the store, and branded the entire plans "utterly unacceptable."[103][104] A&F appealed, managed to overcome the obstacles and opened the store in September 2014.[105] The following year, A&F was subject to nearly £16,000 in fines and legal costs when it was ruled that changes it had made to the Grade II-listed building were illegal.[106]
Jeffries' 2006 target demographic quote[edit]
In 2013, a 2006 Salon interview with the CEO Mike Jeffries went viral and caused widespread outcry over Abercrombie's marketing practices.[107][108][109] The comments made by Mike Jeffries, stating that his brand is only suitable for "the good-looking, cool kids," and that there are people who do not belong in his clothes – namely overweight people, came under fire.[110][111]

That's why we hire good-looking people in our stores. Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don't market to anyone other than that. ... In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids. Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.[112]

These quotes, which were the basis for the article's "youth, sex and casual superiority" headline, went largely unnoticed when the article was published in 2006, until they resurfaced in May 2013 after former Jenny Craig weight-loss spokesperson Kirstie Alley brought them up in an Entertainment Tonight interview.[113] Prominent talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres also later spoke out against the company.[114][115] As the article gained momentum via social media, the company's official Facebook site was bombarded by comments and posts against this strategy.[116]
Jeffries issued an official statement on May 17, 2013, regarding the news articles, saying, "I want to address some of my comments that have been circulating from a 2006 interview. While I believe this 7-year-old, resurrected quote has been taken out of context, I sincerely regret that my choice of words was interpreted in a manner that has caused offense." He also stated, "We are completely opposed to any discrimination, bullying, derogatory characterizations or other anti-social behavior based on race, gender, body type or other individual characteristics."[117]

Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) is an American retailer that focuses on upscale casual wear for young consumers, its headquarters are in New Albany, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus.[2] The company operates two other offshoot brands: Abercrombie Kids & Hollister Co. [2] The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands.[citation needed]
Once known for its sexy ad campaigns, the company has toned down its imagery and no longer displays nearly nude models in their advertisements. According to Chairman Arthur Martinez, Abercrombie and Fitch is now targeting an older consumer, from ages 18–25. These changes provide the hopes that the audience will see the company is evolving along with its consumers, and boost sales.[3]
Abercrombie & Fitch is notable for using "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] Its main competitors are Aéropostale and American Eagle Outfitters. Its younger subsidiary, Abercrombie Kids, competes with Aéropostale's P.S., and American Eagle Outfitters's 77kids.

History[edit]
Main article: History of Abercrombie & Fitch




Cover of A&F catalog from 1909.


Founded in 1892 in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, by David T. Abercrombie and Ezra Fitch, Abercrombie & Fitch was an elite outfitter of sporting and excursion goods, particularly noted for its expensive shotguns, fishing rods, fishing boats, and tents.[5] In 1976, Abercrombie & Fitch filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, finally closing its flagship store at Madison Avenue and East 45th Street in 1977.[6]
Shortly thereafter the name was revived in 1978; Oshman's Sporting Goods, a Houston-based chain owned by Jake Oshman,[7] bought the defunct firm's name and mailing list for $1.5 million[8] ($5.2 million in 2013 dollars).[9] Oshman's relaunched A&F as a mail-order retailer specializing in hunting wear and novelty items. It also opened shops in Beverly Hills, Dallas, and (by the mid-1980s) New York City. Finally, in 1988, Oshman's sold the company name and operations to The Limited, a clothing-chain operator based in Columbus, Ohio.[10] Abercrombie & Fitch gradually shifted its focus to young adults, first as a subsidiary of Limited Brands and then as a separate, publicly traded company; and grew to become one of the largest apparel firms in the United States.[11]
Since 1997, the company has consistently kept a high-profile in the public eye, due to its advertising, its philanthropy, and its involvement in legal conflicts over branding, clothing style and employment practices. In the first decade of the 21st century, the Great Recession battered the company's business as teenagers looked to lower-priced fast fashion brands like H&M and Forever 21 for fashion. Abercrombie & Fitch's stock price dropped from an all-time high of $84.23 in October 2007 to a low of $14.64 in November 2008.[12] The company worked to overhaul its merchandise mix and cut underperforming stores,[13] but lackluster performance has continued. Longtime CEO Michael Jeffries stepped down in December 2014, after 22 years with the company.[14]




Abercrombie & Fitch store in New York City


To combat heavy competition from fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21 and H&M, Abercrombie & Fitch announced key changes to change its image. It aims to reduce emphasis on sexualized advertising and focus more on customer service & diversity. Among the changes announced are eliminating sexualized advertising, no longer having shirtless models at new store openings, and eliminating sexualized pictures and advertising on bags, gift cards, and in stores. They are changing the name of store employees from "models" to "brand representatives", and will allow a more individualistic dress code. "Brand representatives" will also focus more on customer service by asking customers for help in stores, as opposed to past policies of aloofness. They also aim to promote more diversity among store employees and executives as well. A&F is signaling it will be implementing changes quickly.[4]
As of May 2015, the changes were already very apparent in stores. All "permanent marketing" images at the cash wrap and fitting rooms have been removed. Also, store models are no longer dressed in Abercrombie clothes.[4]

As of December 9, 2014[update], following the retirement of Mike Jeffries the following were key corporate officials:[15]

Arthur Martinez – Executive Chairman
Diane Chang – Executive Vice President of Sourcing
Leslee K. Herro – Executive Vice President of Planning and Allocation
Ronald A. Robins, Jr. – Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel
Jonathan Ramsden – Chief Operating Officer
Amy Zehrer – Senior Vice President of Stores
Christos Angelides – President of Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands
Fran Horowitz – President of Hollister brand

In April 2017, the company was described by Standard & Poor's as having a market value of $650,000,000 and about $420,000,000 cash on hand. In May 2017, the company was in talks to sell itself. Potential buyers included Express, American Eagle Outfitters and Cerberus Capital Management. Negotiations failed by early July. As a result of the news, on 10 July the firm's stock fell 21%.[16]

Headquarters[edit]
The company's headquarters, referred to by the company as "The Home Office", is located outside of Columbus in New Albany, Ohio.[17] The Home Office is designed as a campus of sorts, and is referred to as such. The company's merchandise-distribution centers (1 million square feet) are located exclusively on campus to help ensure brand protection.[17] Also on campus are mock-up stores, one for each of the company's brands, where store layout, merchandise and atmosphere are determined.[17] In January 2017, the company announced they would be cutting 150 jobs at their corporate headquarters.[18]
The company also has a European office in Mendrisio, Switzerland.[19][20]
Marketing, advertising and brand identity[edit]




The trademark slogan, Casual Luxury.


A&F is known for its racy marketing photography by Bruce Weber.[21] It is rendered to grayscale and features outdoor settings, usually with semi-nude males and females for an increased tone of sexuality. A&F casts only store employees for marketing campaigns. Casting directors from the home office travel to key A&F regional stores in the United States and to London to hold "casting calls" for employees aspiring to become the next "A&F New Face".[22][dead link] The company promotes its casting sessions, models, and photo shoots in the "A&F Casting" feature online at abercrombie.com. The website also provides a gallery of current photography. Framed copies at A&F stores will sometimes name the model and store.
The Abercrombie & Fitch brand image is heavily promoted as an international near-luxury lifestyle concept.[23] The company began cultivating an upscale image after the 2005 opening of its Fifth Avenue flagship store alongside Prada and other upscale retailers.[24] Having for years used high-grade materials in the construction of its merchandise, and pricing them at "near-luxury" levels, A&F introduced the trademark Casual Luxury[24] as a fictional dictionary term with multiple definitions such as "[using] the finest cashmere, pima cottons, and highest quality leather to create the ultimate in casual, body conscious clothing,"[25] and "implementing and/or incorporating time honored machinery ...to produce the most exclusive denim..."[25] This upscale image has allowed A&F to open stores in international high-end locations and further promote the image by pricing its merchandise at almost double the American prices.
Overall, CEO Jeffries calls the A&F image a "movie" because of the "fantasy" that plays out instore.[26] Even some of the clothing is given "story": "You buy into the emotional experience of a movie," Jeffries explains, "And that's what we're creating. Here I am walking into a movie, and I say, 'What's going to be [at] the box office today?'"[26]
Following a dismal earnings announcement on August 2014,[27] the company decided to drop its logo-branded apparel line, arguing that this element of its brand does not resonate with its target market. The company is now shifting its marketing strategy to trendier outfits and faster production processes. Some experts argue the retailer's focus on exclusivity has caused it to fall out of fashion with its target market.[28]




Abercrombie & Fitch models


Store staff[edit]
The company is noted for its use of "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] The models were required to buy and wear A&F clothing, but following a company settlement with California state labor regulators may now wear any no-logo clothing as long as it corresponds with the season and style of the brand. The California settlement also provided $2.2 million to reimburse former employees for their forced purchases of company-branded clothing.[29] An "Impact Team" was created in 2004 to control merchandise within each store and maintain company standards. Bigger and higher volume stores have a "Full Time Stock" who trains Impact associates, processes shipment, maintains stock room standards, and can act as a manager if the store is short on management staffing. The store manager and assistant managers are responsible for forms, lighting, photo marketing, fragrance presentations and to ensure models comply with the "look policy".[30]
Products[edit]

The signature A&F fragrance, FIERCE.


Women's Wear Daily calls Abercrombie & Fitch clothing classically "neo-preppy", with an "edgy tone and imagery".[31] The company's fashions have a reputation for luxury, with the majority of designs trend-driven. There is heavy promotion of "Premium Jeans". In early 2010, the company introduced a leather handbag collection inspired by designs from Ruehl.
Its prices are recognized as the highest in the youth-clothing industry.[32] Internationally, prices are almost double those in its American stores. Retail analyst Chris Boring warns that the company's brands are a "little more susceptible" should recession hit, because their specialties are premium-priced goods rather than necessities.[33] Indeed, as the late-2000s recession continues, A&F has noticeably suffered financially for its refusal to lower prices or offer discounts. A&F argues that doing so would "cheapen" its near-luxury image. Analyst Bruce Watson warns that A&F risks finding itself transformed into "a cautionary tale of a store that was left by the wayside when it declined to change with the times".[32] A&F's year-to-year revenue, a key indicator of a retailer's health, rose 13% in September 2010, aided by strong international sales.[34]
Abercrombie & Fitch has carried men's fragrances Fierce, Colden, and has re-branded the original cologne Woods (Christmas Floorset 2010). Women's fragrances have included 8, Perfume 41, Wakely, and Perfume #1. Fierce and 8 are the most heavily marketed fragrances, as they are the signature scents of the brand overall.[35]
The company also offers the Abercrombie & Fitch Credit Card, issued by the World Financial Network Bank.[36]
Brand protection[edit]
Because of extensive counterfeiting of Abercrombie & Fitch goods, in 2006 the company launched a brand protection program to combat the problem worldwide (focusing more on China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea) by working with legal forces globally.[37] The program is headed by a former FBI Supervisory Special Agent who was part of the FBI's Intellectual Property Rights program, and covers all A&F brands. A&F says that the program "will improve current practices and strategies by focusing on eliminating the supply of illicit Abercrombie & Fitch products."[37]
In August 2011, A&F offered Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino and other cast members of the MTV reality show Jersey Shore a "substantial payment" if they stopped wearing Abercrombie-branded clothes, stating "We are deeply concerned that Mr. Sorrentino's association with our brand could cause significant damage to our image."[38] In November 2011, Sorrentino filed a lawsuit against A&F after the company allegedly violated his copyrights in making shirts that said "The Fitchuation" and "GTL...You Know The Deal."[39]
Stores[edit]

The Modern Canoe store located at the Mall at Millenia in Orlando, Florida with wooden louvers (featuring the Spring Break 2007 marketing campaign picture).


The exterior of the contemporary store design features white molding and formerly black louvers. Starting in mid-2013 and concluding early 2014, the louvers were removed from all locations except flagship stores. The company stated that the louvers were removed in an effort to eliminate the exclusive atmosphere from stores and to experiment with window marketing.[40] The currently featured marketing image directly faces the entrance. The interior is lit with dim ceiling lights and spot lighting. Electronic dance music meant to create an upbeat atmosphere may be played at sound levels as high as 90 decibels, exceeding the corporate policy of 84 decibels and comparable to heavy construction machinery and harmful to the ears.[41]
The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands. The A&F brand has 278[42] locations in the United States, five in Canada (two in Alberta, two in Ontario and one in British Columbia). The company currently operates 25 full-line stores and four outlet stores across sixteen countries.
International expansion[edit]




The Abercrombie & Fitch flagship store in Ginza, Tokyo, Japan – the first one in Asia


The Abercrombie & Fitch brand is believed to have reached its maximum growth potential in the American market. International expansion began in 2005, with the long-term goal of opening flagships for A&F (and eventually all its brands), in high-profile locations worldwide "at a deliberate pace".[43][44] After initially opening at a deliberately slow pace, the company began to accelerate international expansion for its namesake and its Hollister Co. brand in 2012.[45][46]
The first non-U.S. Abercrombie & Fitch stores opened in Toronto and Edmonton in 2005, and then expanded to other major cities in Canada. The company first entered the European market in 2007 with the opening of its flagship London store at 7 Burlington Gardens, Savile Row.[47] Since then, the company has opened stores in Milan, Copenhagen, Paris, Madrid, Brussels Dublin and other major cities in Europe, including six stores in Germany. The company opened its first Asian A&F flagship store in Tokyo in 2009,[48] followed by Fukuoka, Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul.[49] The company would primarily focus on the Chinese and Japanese markets where luxury consumption is high.[50] The company has also entered a franchise agreement with Grupo AXO to open retail stores in Mexico by 2015.[51] The company entered the Middle Eastern market in 2015 with the opening of its flagship store in Kuwait.[52] Since then the company has opened locations in Dubai and plans to expand deeper into the Middle East with stores in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.[53]
Brands[edit]
Abercrombie & Fitch has three concept brands apart from its namesake; they are referred to as subsidiaries, but are operated as divisions under the A&F umbrella.

Abercrombie Kids
Prep-school by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed as "classic cool" for kids 7 through 14,[2] this is the children's version of Abercrombie & Fitch.


Hollister Co.
Southern California by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "SoCal" for teenagers 14 through 18,[2] with significantly lower prices than its parent brand.


Gilly Hicks
The cheeky cousin of Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "Down Under" Sydney, it offered underwear and loungewear for women 18 and up.[55] All stores closed in 2015.[56]


Ruehl No.925
Post-Grad by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after a fictional Greenwich Village heritage, offered clothes for 22 through 35 post-grads. Closed in 2010.[57]

Humanitarian projects[edit]
In recent years, Abercrombie & Fitch has engaged in philanthropic and humanitarian projects. In January 2010, the company launched the "A&F Cares" feature on its website to inform the public about its efforts in the fields of diversity, inclusion, human rights, philanthropy, and sustainability.[58]
The A&F Challenge is an annual fundraising event held on the home office campus in New Albany that features running, walking, biking, entertainment, and food. The funds raised go to the Ohio State University Medical Center's Program for Health, which focuses on "women's cancers and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease."[59]
In 2007, Abercrombie & Fitch partnered with the National Society of High School Scholars at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia to offer US$75,000 scholarships to NSHSS members.[60]
Legal issues[edit]
The company has been involved in legal conflicts over its employment practices, treatment of customers, and clothing styles.
Employment practices[edit]
See also: Employment Practices Liability
In a 2004 lawsuit González v. Abercrombie & Fitch, the company was accused of discriminating against African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women by preferentially offering floor sales positions (called Brand Representatives or Models) and store management positions to Caucasian males.[61] The company agreed to a settlement of the class-action suit, which required the company to (1) pay $40 million to African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women who applied and were not hired or worked in certain store positions, (2) revise its hiring, performance measurement, and promotion policies, (3) revise its internal complaint procedures, (4) appoint a Vice President of Diversity, (5) hire 25 recruiters to seek out minority applicants, (6) discontinue the practice of recruiting employees at primarily white fraternities and sororities, (7) include more minorities in marketing materials, (8) report to a neutral court-appointed monitor twice per year regarding its progress in those areas, and (9) report to the court once per year.[62][63][64]
In June 2009, British law student Riam Dean, who had worked at A&F's flagship store in London's Savile Row, took the company to an employment tribunal. Dean, who was born without a left forearm, claimed that although she was initially given special permission to wear clothing that covered her prosthetic limb, she was soon told that her appearance breached the company's "Look Policy" and sent to work in the stock room, out of sight of customers. Dean sued the company for disability discrimination, and sought up to £20,000 in damages.[65] In August 2009, the tribunal ruled the 22-year-old was wrongfully dismissed and unlawfully harassed. She was awarded £8,013 for loss of earnings and wrongful dismissal.[66][67]
In a lawsuit filed in September 2009, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores,[68] in U.S. District Court by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 17-year-old Samantha Elauf said she applied, in June 2008, for a sales position at the Abercrombie Kids store in the Woodland Hills Mall, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The teen, who wears a hijab in accordance with her religious beliefs, claims the manager told her the headscarf violates the store's "Look Policy".[69] The United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on February 25, 2015,[70] and ruled 8-1 on June 1, 2015 against the company.[71]
In 2010, a Muslim woman working at a Hollister store in San Mateo, California, was fired. Before being dismissed, Hani Khan had refused Abercrombie & Fitch's human-resources representative's demand that she remove her hijab. The representative reportedly stated that the headscarf, which Khan wears for religious reasons, violated the company's "Look Policy". The civil liberties group Council on American-Islamic Relations has stated that the dismissal is a violation of nondiscrimination laws, and filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.[72]
In 2011, the Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism started an investigation into A&F's hiring and remuneration policies. The firm was suspected of only hiring personnel under 25 years old, making heavy demands on the physical appearance of its staff and rewarding a premium to male models that work shirtless.[73]
Customer issues[edit]
In 2009, the company was fined more than $115,000 by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights for refusing to let a teenage girl help her sister, who has autism, try on clothes in a fitting room. The amount of the fine reflected "pushback" by the company according to Michael K. Browne, the legal affairs manager of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.[74]
A 16-year-old is suing the company after discovering that she was being videotaped in an A&F changing room by an employee, Kenneth Applegate II. Applegate denied the claim, but co-workers discovered his camera days later with the video on it.[75]
In 2010, a customer filed a class action relating to a 2009 holiday gift card promotion. The lawsuit alleges that the gift cards said "No Expiration Date" but Abercrombie voided and expired the gift cards in early 2010. In 2012, a judge certified a nationwide class in the case. In May 2013, Class Notice went out to potential class members.[76]
Lawsuits against other parties[edit]
In 2002, the company filed a lawsuit against American Eagle Outfitters, claiming that American Eagle copied A&F garment designs, among other things. The lawsuit was based on a trade-dress claim, stating that American Eagle had very closely mimicked A&F's products' visual appearance and packaging. Specifically, A&F claimed that American Eagle copied particular articles of clothing, in-store displays and advertisements, and even the A&F product catalog. Despite the admission that American Eagle might have utilized very similar materials, designs, in-store displays, symbols, color combinations, and patterns as A&F, the court ruled that there was not an excessive level of similarity to confuse potential customers, and therefore the court ruled in favor of American Eagle.[77]
On October 18, 1999, Abercrombie & Fitch had a lawsuit about making false and misleading statements concerning its growth while knowing the actual growth was less than Wall Street expectations,[78] and paid $6,050,000 for settlement.
Controversy and criticism[edit]
Since its re-establishment in 1988, Abercrombie & Fitch has faced numerous accusations regarding its employment practices, merchandise, and advertising campaigns which have been described as sexually explicit and racist.[21][79]
Advertising[edit]
The company has received criticism over its provocative advertising.[80] The company has been accused of promoting the sexualization of pre-teen girls, for example by marketing thongs to 10-year-olds and padded bikini tops to 7-year-olds.[81]
Employment and labor practices[edit]
Lawsuits have been filed against the company due to alleged discriminatory employment practices. In 2004, in Gonzalez v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores (see "Legal issues" and "Controversy and Criticism" below), the company was sued for giving desirable positions to white applicants, to the exclusion of minorities.[62][82]
In November 2009, Abercrombie & Fitch was added to the "Sweatshop Hall of Shame 2010" by the worker advocacy group International Labor Rights Forum.[83]
A&F Quarterly[edit]
Main article: A&F Quarterly
Conservative and religious groups called for boycotts of the original American publication of A&F Quarterly (published from 1997 to 2003) for its sexually explicit nature.[84] The magazine contained nude photography by Bruce Weber, articles about sex, and recipes for alcoholic beverages. Also acting as a catalog, the Quarterly displayed the brand's merchandise with information and prices. Advertisements for the A&F Quarterly appeared in Interview, Out, Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair.[85]
Despite a company policy restricting sale of the publication to minors, critics charged that the publication was readily sold to minors. In 2003, an array of religious organizations, women's rights activists, and Asian American groups organized boycotts and protests over the publication, and the "Christmas Edition" of the catalog was removed from stores.[86] Although Jeffries said he chose to discontinue the catalog, because "Frankly, [he] was getting sick of the old one; it was getting boring," on June 17, 2010, the company made the announcement, "The Return of the A&F Quarterly" and invited email subscribers to reserve their $10 copy for a July 17, 2010, in-store release date.[87]
Product criticism[edit]
In 2002, A&F sold a shirt that featured the slogan "Wong Brothers Laundry Service – Two Wongs Can Make It White" with smiling figures in conical Asian hats, a depiction of early Chinese immigrants. The company discontinued the designs and apologized after a boycott started by an Asian American student group at Stanford University.[88] That same year, abercrombie kids removed a line of thong underwear sold for girls in pre-teen children's sizes after parents mounted nationwide storefront protests. The underwear included phrases like "Eye Candy" and "Wink Wink" printed on the front.[89]
More T-shirt controversies occurred in 2004. The first incident involved a shirt featuring the phrase, "It's All Relative in West Virginia," a jab at alleged incestuous relationships in rural America. West Virginia Governor Bob Wise spoke out against the company for depicting "an unfounded, negative stereotype of West Virginia", but the shirts were not removed.[90] Later, another T-shirt that said "L is for Loser" next to a picture of a male gymnast on the rings gathered publicity. The company stopped selling the shirt in October 2004 after USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi announced a boycott of A&F for mocking the sport.[91]
In 2005, the Women and Girls Foundation of Southwest Pennsylvania launched a "Girlcott" of the store to protest the sale of T-shirts displaying sexist messages such as "Who needs brains when you have these?", "Available for parties," and "I had a nightmare I was a brunette." The campaign received national coverage on The Today Show, and the company pulled the shirts from stores on November 5, 2005.[92] Five days after this media coverage, A&F pulled two of the shirts from its shelves, released an apology to girls for producing the T-shirts, and agreed to have corporate executives meet with the "Girlcott" girls at the company's headquarters.[93]
Bob Jones University, a non-denominational Protestant university located in Greenville, South Carolina, and its affiliated pre-collegiate schools, along with other Christian schools, have prohibited A&F and Hollister clothing from being "worn, carried, or displayed" on its campuses because of "an unusual degree of antagonism to the name of Christ and an unusual display of wickedness" in the company's promotions.[94]
After A&F raised its price points in 2004, its products have been described as overpriced.[87] After the company opened its flagship store in London, England and Paris, France, the brand was criticized in the United Kingdom and France because the merchandise that was offered to the customers cost double (or a direct $/£ - $/€ swap) compared to prices found in the U.S.[95]
A T-shirt controversy arose again over A&F's Back-to-School 2009 collection of "humor tees".[96] One shirt proclaims "Show the twins" above a picture of a young woman with her blouse open to two men. Two other shirts state "Female streaking encouraged" and "Female Students Wanted for Sexual Research".[96] The American Family Association disapproved of the influence of the "sex-as-recreation" lifestyle shirts, and asked the brand to remove its "sexualized shirts" from display.[96]
Renaming of trauma center[edit]
In 2008, Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio agreed to rename its emergency room to the Abercrombie & Fitch Emergency Department and Trauma Center in exchange for a $10 million donation.[97] A letter written by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, signed by over 100 doctors and children's advocacy groups, argued against the renaming, for the "company's appalling history of targeting children with sexualized marketing and clothing."[98]
Remembrance poppy prohibition in the UK[edit]
In November 2010, the Southampton, England, A&F store prevented 18-year-old Harriet Phipps from wearing a remembrance poppy, which is worn as part of the Remembrance Day commemorations in the United Kingdom and Canada every November. The official A&F reason for the refusal was reported to be that the poppy is not considered part of the corporate approved uniform, and is therefore prohibited.[99] The ban drew criticisms, and on November 8 the company posted on its Facebook page the following statement: "As an American company that has been around since 1892, we appreciate the sacrifices of the British and American servicemen/women in the World Wars and in military conflicts that continue today. Our company policy is to allow associates to wear a poppy as a token of this appreciation on Remembrance Day. Going forward, ...we will revisit this policy to the days/weeks leading up to Remembrance Day."
Abercrombie Kids shop on Savile Row[edit]
In 2012, A&F announced plans that it would open its Abercrombie Kids shop at No. 3 on Savile Row, next door to Gieves & Hawkes.[100] The plans drew criticism and opposition from the tailors of the Row, who were already unhappy about the presence of the main A&F store on Burlington Gardens at the end of the Row to begin with, which eventually led to a protest organized by The Chap magazine on April 23, 2012.[101][102] During the consultation period, objections were lodged to Westminster City Council and in February 2013 the Council rejected many of A&F's proposals for the store, and branded the entire plans "utterly unacceptable."[103][104] A&F appealed, managed to overcome the obstacles and opened the store in September 2014.[105] The following year, A&F was subject to nearly £16,000 in fines and legal costs when it was ruled that changes it had made to the Grade II-listed building were illegal.[106]
Jeffries' 2006 target demographic quote[edit]
In 2013, a 2006 Salon interview with the CEO Mike Jeffries went viral and caused widespread outcry over Abercrombie's marketing practices.[107][108][109] The comments made by Mike Jeffries, stating that his brand is only suitable for "the good-looking, cool kids," and that there are people who do not belong in his clothes – namely overweight people, came under fire.[110][111]

That's why we hire good-looking people in our stores. Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don't market to anyone other than that. ... In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids. Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.[112]

These quotes, which were the basis for the article's "youth, sex and casual superiority" headline, went largely unnoticed when the article was published in 2006, until they resurfaced in May 2013 after former Jenny Craig weight-loss spokesperson Kirstie Alley brought them up in an Entertainment Tonight interview.[113] Prominent talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres also later spoke out against the company.[114][115] As the article gained momentum via social media, the company's official Facebook site was bombarded by comments and posts against this strategy.[116]
Jeffries issued an official statement on May 17, 2013, regarding the news articles, saying, "I want to address some of my comments that have been circulating from a 2006 interview. While I believe this 7-year-old, resurrected quote has been taken out of context, I sincerely regret that my choice of words was interpreted in a manner that has caused offense." He also stated, "We are completely opposed to any discrimination, bullying, derogatory characterizations or other anti-social behavior based on race, gender, body type or other individual characteristics."[117]

Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) is an American retailer that focuses on upscale casual wear for young consumers, its headquarters are in New Albany, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus.[2] The company operates two other offshoot brands: Abercrombie Kids & Hollister Co. [2] The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands.[citation needed]
Once known for its sexy ad campaigns, the company has toned down its imagery and no longer displays nearly nude models in their advertisements. According to Chairman Arthur Martinez, Abercrombie and Fitch is now targeting an older consumer, from ages 18–25. These changes provide the hopes that the audience will see the company is evolving along with its consumers, and boost sales.[3]
Abercrombie & Fitch is notable for using "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] Its main competitors are Aéropostale and American Eagle Outfitters. Its younger subsidiary, Abercrombie Kids, competes with Aéropostale's P.S., and American Eagle Outfitters's 77kids.

History[edit]
Main article: History of Abercrombie & Fitch




Cover of A&F catalog from 1909.


Founded in 1892 in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, by David T. Abercrombie and Ezra Fitch, Abercrombie & Fitch was an elite outfitter of sporting and excursion goods, particularly noted for its expensive shotguns, fishing rods, fishing boats, and tents.[5] In 1976, Abercrombie & Fitch filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, finally closing its flagship store at Madison Avenue and East 45th Street in 1977.[6]
Shortly thereafter the name was revived in 1978; Oshman's Sporting Goods, a Houston-based chain owned by Jake Oshman,[7] bought the defunct firm's name and mailing list for $1.5 million[8] ($5.2 million in 2013 dollars).[9] Oshman's relaunched A&F as a mail-order retailer specializing in hunting wear and novelty items. It also opened shops in Beverly Hills, Dallas, and (by the mid-1980s) New York City. Finally, in 1988, Oshman's sold the company name and operations to The Limited, a clothing-chain operator based in Columbus, Ohio.[10] Abercrombie & Fitch gradually shifted its focus to young adults, first as a subsidiary of Limited Brands and then as a separate, publicly traded company; and grew to become one of the largest apparel firms in the United States.[11]
Since 1997, the company has consistently kept a high-profile in the public eye, due to its advertising, its philanthropy, and its involvement in legal conflicts over branding, clothing style and employment practices. In the first decade of the 21st century, the Great Recession battered the company's business as teenagers looked to lower-priced fast fashion brands like H&M and Forever 21 for fashion. Abercrombie & Fitch's stock price dropped from an all-time high of $84.23 in October 2007 to a low of $14.64 in November 2008.[12] The company worked to overhaul its merchandise mix and cut underperforming stores,[13] but lackluster performance has continued. Longtime CEO Michael Jeffries stepped down in December 2014, after 22 years with the company.[14]




Abercrombie & Fitch store in New York City


To combat heavy competition from fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21 and H&M, Abercrombie & Fitch announced key changes to change its image. It aims to reduce emphasis on sexualized advertising and focus more on customer service & diversity. Among the changes announced are eliminating sexualized advertising, no longer having shirtless models at new store openings, and eliminating sexualized pictures and advertising on bags, gift cards, and in stores. They are changing the name of store employees from "models" to "brand representatives", and will allow a more individualistic dress code. "Brand representatives" will also focus more on customer service by asking customers for help in stores, as opposed to past policies of aloofness. They also aim to promote more diversity among store employees and executives as well. A&F is signaling it will be implementing changes quickly.[4]
As of May 2015, the changes were already very apparent in stores. All "permanent marketing" images at the cash wrap and fitting rooms have been removed. Also, store models are no longer dressed in Abercrombie clothes.[4]

As of December 9, 2014[update], following the retirement of Mike Jeffries the following were key corporate officials:[15]

Arthur Martinez – Executive Chairman
Diane Chang – Executive Vice President of Sourcing
Leslee K. Herro – Executive Vice President of Planning and Allocation
Ronald A. Robins, Jr. – Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel
Jonathan Ramsden – Chief Operating Officer
Amy Zehrer – Senior Vice President of Stores
Christos Angelides – President of Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands
Fran Horowitz – President of Hollister brand

In April 2017, the company was described by Standard & Poor's as having a market value of $650,000,000 and about $420,000,000 cash on hand. In May 2017, the company was in talks to sell itself. Potential buyers included Express, American Eagle Outfitters and Cerberus Capital Management. Negotiations failed by early July. As a result of the news, on 10 July the firm's stock fell 21%.[16]

Headquarters[edit]
The company's headquarters, referred to by the company as "The Home Office", is located outside of Columbus in New Albany, Ohio.[17] The Home Office is designed as a campus of sorts, and is referred to as such. The company's merchandise-distribution centers (1 million square feet) are located exclusively on campus to help ensure brand protection.[17] Also on campus are mock-up stores, one for each of the company's brands, where store layout, merchandise and atmosphere are determined.[17] In January 2017, the company announced they would be cutting 150 jobs at their corporate headquarters.[18]
The company also has a European office in Mendrisio, Switzerland.[19][20]
Marketing, advertising and brand identity[edit]




The trademark slogan, Casual Luxury.


A&F is known for its racy marketing photography by Bruce Weber.[21] It is rendered to grayscale and features outdoor settings, usually with semi-nude males and females for an increased tone of sexuality. A&F casts only store employees for marketing campaigns. Casting directors from the home office travel to key A&F regional stores in the United States and to London to hold "casting calls" for employees aspiring to become the next "A&F New Face".[22][dead link] The company promotes its casting sessions, models, and photo shoots in the "A&F Casting" feature online at abercrombie.com. The website also provides a gallery of current photography. Framed copies at A&F stores will sometimes name the model and store.
The Abercrombie & Fitch brand image is heavily promoted as an international near-luxury lifestyle concept.[23] The company began cultivating an upscale image after the 2005 opening of its Fifth Avenue flagship store alongside Prada and other upscale retailers.[24] Having for years used high-grade materials in the construction of its merchandise, and pricing them at "near-luxury" levels, A&F introduced the trademark Casual Luxury[24] as a fictional dictionary term with multiple definitions such as "[using] the finest cashmere, pima cottons, and highest quality leather to create the ultimate in casual, body conscious clothing,"[25] and "implementing and/or incorporating time honored machinery ...to produce the most exclusive denim..."[25] This upscale image has allowed A&F to open stores in international high-end locations and further promote the image by pricing its merchandise at almost double the American prices.
Overall, CEO Jeffries calls the A&F image a "movie" because of the "fantasy" that plays out instore.[26] Even some of the clothing is given "story": "You buy into the emotional experience of a movie," Jeffries explains, "And that's what we're creating. Here I am walking into a movie, and I say, 'What's going to be [at] the box office today?'"[26]
Following a dismal earnings announcement on August 2014,[27] the company decided to drop its logo-branded apparel line, arguing that this element of its brand does not resonate with its target market. The company is now shifting its marketing strategy to trendier outfits and faster production processes. Some experts argue the retailer's focus on exclusivity has caused it to fall out of fashion with its target market.[28]




Abercrombie & Fitch models


Store staff[edit]
The company is noted for its use of "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] The models were required to buy and wear A&F clothing, but following a company settlement with California state labor regulators may now wear any no-logo clothing as long as it corresponds with the season and style of the brand. The California settlement also provided $2.2 million to reimburse former employees for their forced purchases of company-branded clothing.[29] An "Impact Team" was created in 2004 to control merchandise within each store and maintain company standards. Bigger and higher volume stores have a "Full Time Stock" who trains Impact associates, processes shipment, maintains stock room standards, and can act as a manager if the store is short on management staffing. The store manager and assistant managers are responsible for forms, lighting, photo marketing, fragrance presentations and to ensure models comply with the "look policy".[30]
Products[edit]

The signature A&F fragrance, FIERCE.


Women's Wear Daily calls Abercrombie & Fitch clothing classically "neo-preppy", with an "edgy tone and imagery".[31] The company's fashions have a reputation for luxury, with the majority of designs trend-driven. There is heavy promotion of "Premium Jeans". In early 2010, the company introduced a leather handbag collection inspired by designs from Ruehl.
Its prices are recognized as the highest in the youth-clothing industry.[32] Internationally, prices are almost double those in its American stores. Retail analyst Chris Boring warns that the company's brands are a "little more susceptible" should recession hit, because their specialties are premium-priced goods rather than necessities.[33] Indeed, as the late-2000s recession continues, A&F has noticeably suffered financially for its refusal to lower prices or offer discounts. A&F argues that doing so would "cheapen" its near-luxury image. Analyst Bruce Watson warns that A&F risks finding itself transformed into "a cautionary tale of a store that was left by the wayside when it declined to change with the times".[32] A&F's year-to-year revenue, a key indicator of a retailer's health, rose 13% in September 2010, aided by strong international sales.[34]
Abercrombie & Fitch has carried men's fragrances Fierce, Colden, and has re-branded the original cologne Woods (Christmas Floorset 2010). Women's fragrances have included 8, Perfume 41, Wakely, and Perfume #1. Fierce and 8 are the most heavily marketed fragrances, as they are the signature scents of the brand overall.[35]
The company also offers the Abercrombie & Fitch Credit Card, issued by the World Financial Network Bank.[36]
Brand protection[edit]
Because of extensive counterfeiting of Abercrombie & Fitch goods, in 2006 the company launched a brand protection program to combat the problem worldwide (focusing more on China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea) by working with legal forces globally.[37] The program is headed by a former FBI Supervisory Special Agent who was part of the FBI's Intellectual Property Rights program, and covers all A&F brands. A&F says that the program "will improve current practices and strategies by focusing on eliminating the supply of illicit Abercrombie & Fitch products."[37]
In August 2011, A&F offered Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino and other cast members of the MTV reality show Jersey Shore a "substantial payment" if they stopped wearing Abercrombie-branded clothes, stating "We are deeply concerned that Mr. Sorrentino's association with our brand could cause significant damage to our image."[38] In November 2011, Sorrentino filed a lawsuit against A&F after the company allegedly violated his copyrights in making shirts that said "The Fitchuation" and "GTL...You Know The Deal."[39]
Stores[edit]

The Modern Canoe store located at the Mall at Millenia in Orlando, Florida with wooden louvers (featuring the Spring Break 2007 marketing campaign picture).


The exterior of the contemporary store design features white molding and formerly black louvers. Starting in mid-2013 and concluding early 2014, the louvers were removed from all locations except flagship stores. The company stated that the louvers were removed in an effort to eliminate the exclusive atmosphere from stores and to experiment with window marketing.[40] The currently featured marketing image directly faces the entrance. The interior is lit with dim ceiling lights and spot lighting. Electronic dance music meant to create an upbeat atmosphere may be played at sound levels as high as 90 decibels, exceeding the corporate policy of 84 decibels and comparable to heavy construction machinery and harmful to the ears.[41]
The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands. The A&F brand has 278[42] locations in the United States, five in Canada (two in Alberta, two in Ontario and one in British Columbia). The company currently operates 25 full-line stores and four outlet stores across sixteen countries.
International expansion[edit]




The Abercrombie & Fitch flagship store in Ginza, Tokyo, Japan – the first one in Asia


The Abercrombie & Fitch brand is believed to have reached its maximum growth potential in the American market. International expansion began in 2005, with the long-term goal of opening flagships for A&F (and eventually all its brands), in high-profile locations worldwide "at a deliberate pace".[43][44] After initially opening at a deliberately slow pace, the company began to accelerate international expansion for its namesake and its Hollister Co. brand in 2012.[45][46]
The first non-U.S. Abercrombie & Fitch stores opened in Toronto and Edmonton in 2005, and then expanded to other major cities in Canada. The company first entered the European market in 2007 with the opening of its flagship London store at 7 Burlington Gardens, Savile Row.[47] Since then, the company has opened stores in Milan, Copenhagen, Paris, Madrid, Brussels Dublin and other major cities in Europe, including six stores in Germany. The company opened its first Asian A&F flagship store in Tokyo in 2009,[48] followed by Fukuoka, Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul.[49] The company would primarily focus on the Chinese and Japanese markets where luxury consumption is high.[50] The company has also entered a franchise agreement with Grupo AXO to open retail stores in Mexico by 2015.[51] The company entered the Middle Eastern market in 2015 with the opening of its flagship store in Kuwait.[52] Since then the company has opened locations in Dubai and plans to expand deeper into the Middle East with stores in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.[53]
Brands[edit]
Abercrombie & Fitch has three concept brands apart from its namesake; they are referred to as subsidiaries, but are operated as divisions under the A&F umbrella.

Abercrombie Kids
Prep-school by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed as "classic cool" for kids 7 through 14,[2] this is the children's version of Abercrombie & Fitch.


Hollister Co.
Southern California by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "SoCal" for teenagers 14 through 18,[2] with significantly lower prices than its parent brand.


Gilly Hicks
The cheeky cousin of Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "Down Under" Sydney, it offered underwear and loungewear for women 18 and up.[55] All stores closed in 2015.[56]


Ruehl No.925
Post-Grad by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after a fictional Greenwich Village heritage, offered clothes for 22 through 35 post-grads. Closed in 2010.[57]

Humanitarian projects[edit]
In recent years, Abercrombie & Fitch has engaged in philanthropic and humanitarian projects. In January 2010, the company launched the "A&F Cares" feature on its website to inform the public about its efforts in the fields of diversity, inclusion, human rights, philanthropy, and sustainability.[58]
The A&F Challenge is an annual fundraising event held on the home office campus in New Albany that features running, walking, biking, entertainment, and food. The funds raised go to the Ohio State University Medical Center's Program for Health, which focuses on "women's cancers and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease."[59]
In 2007, Abercrombie & Fitch partnered with the National Society of High School Scholars at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia to offer US$75,000 scholarships to NSHSS members.[60]
Legal issues[edit]
The company has been involved in legal conflicts over its employment practices, treatment of customers, and clothing styles.
Employment practices[edit]
See also: Employment Practices Liability
In a 2004 lawsuit González v. Abercrombie & Fitch, the company was accused of discriminating against African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women by preferentially offering floor sales positions (called Brand Representatives or Models) and store management positions to Caucasian males.[61] The company agreed to a settlement of the class-action suit, which required the company to (1) pay $40 million to African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women who applied and were not hired or worked in certain store positions, (2) revise its hiring, performance measurement, and promotion policies, (3) revise its internal complaint procedures, (4) appoint a Vice President of Diversity, (5) hire 25 recruiters to seek out minority applicants, (6) discontinue the practice of recruiting employees at primarily white fraternities and sororities, (7) include more minorities in marketing materials, (8) report to a neutral court-appointed monitor twice per year regarding its progress in those areas, and (9) report to the court once per year.[62][63][64]
In June 2009, British law student Riam Dean, who had worked at A&F's flagship store in London's Savile Row, took the company to an employment tribunal. Dean, who was born without a left forearm, claimed that although she was initially given special permission to wear clothing that covered her prosthetic limb, she was soon told that her appearance breached the company's "Look Policy" and sent to work in the stock room, out of sight of customers. Dean sued the company for disability discrimination, and sought up to £20,000 in damages.[65] In August 2009, the tribunal ruled the 22-year-old was wrongfully dismissed and unlawfully harassed. She was awarded £8,013 for loss of earnings and wrongful dismissal.[66][67]
In a lawsuit filed in September 2009, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores,[68] in U.S. District Court by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 17-year-old Samantha Elauf said she applied, in June 2008, for a sales position at the Abercrombie Kids store in the Woodland Hills Mall, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The teen, who wears a hijab in accordance with her religious beliefs, claims the manager told her the headscarf violates the store's "Look Policy".[69] The United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on February 25, 2015,[70] and ruled 8-1 on June 1, 2015 against the company.[71]
In 2010, a Muslim woman working at a Hollister store in San Mateo, California, was fired. Before being dismissed, Hani Khan had refused Abercrombie & Fitch's human-resources representative's demand that she remove her hijab. The representative reportedly stated that the headscarf, which Khan wears for religious reasons, violated the company's "Look Policy". The civil liberties group Council on American-Islamic Relations has stated that the dismissal is a violation of nondiscrimination laws, and filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.[72]
In 2011, the Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism started an investigation into A&F's hiring and remuneration policies. The firm was suspected of only hiring personnel under 25 years old, making heavy demands on the physical appearance of its staff and rewarding a premium to male models that work shirtless.[73]
Customer issues[edit]
In 2009, the company was fined more than $115,000 by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights for refusing to let a teenage girl help her sister, who has autism, try on clothes in a fitting room. The amount of the fine reflected "pushback" by the company according to Michael K. Browne, the legal affairs manager of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.[74]
A 16-year-old is suing the company after discovering that she was being videotaped in an A&F changing room by an employee, Kenneth Applegate II. Applegate denied the claim, but co-workers discovered his camera days later with the video on it.[75]
In 2010, a customer filed a class action relating to a 2009 holiday gift card promotion. The lawsuit alleges that the gift cards said "No Expiration Date" but Abercrombie voided and expired the gift cards in early 2010. In 2012, a judge certified a nationwide class in the case. In May 2013, Class Notice went out to potential class members.[76]
Lawsuits against other parties[edit]
In 2002, the company filed a lawsuit against American Eagle Outfitters, claiming that American Eagle copied A&F garment designs, among other things. The lawsuit was based on a trade-dress claim, stating that American Eagle had very closely mimicked A&F's products' visual appearance and packaging. Specifically, A&F claimed that American Eagle copied particular articles of clothing, in-store displays and advertisements, and even the A&F product catalog. Despite the admission that American Eagle might have utilized very similar materials, designs, in-store displays, symbols, color combinations, and patterns as A&F, the court ruled that there was not an excessive level of similarity to confuse potential customers, and therefore the court ruled in favor of American Eagle.[77]
On October 18, 1999, Abercrombie & Fitch had a lawsuit about making false and misleading statements concerning its growth while knowing the actual growth was less than Wall Street expectations,[78] and paid $6,050,000 for settlement.
Controversy and criticism[edit]
Since its re-establishment in 1988, Abercrombie & Fitch has faced numerous accusations regarding its employment practices, merchandise, and advertising campaigns which have been described as sexually explicit and racist.[21][79]
Advertising[edit]
The company has received criticism over its provocative advertising.[80] The company has been accused of promoting the sexualization of pre-teen girls, for example by marketing thongs to 10-year-olds and padded bikini tops to 7-year-olds.[81]
Employment and labor practices[edit]
Lawsuits have been filed against the company due to alleged discriminatory employment practices. In 2004, in Gonzalez v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores (see "Legal issues" and "Controversy and Criticism" below), the company was sued for giving desirable positions to white applicants, to the exclusion of minorities.[62][82]
In November 2009, Abercrombie & Fitch was added to the "Sweatshop Hall of Shame 2010" by the worker advocacy group International Labor Rights Forum.[83]
A&F Quarterly[edit]
Main article: A&F Quarterly
Conservative and religious groups called for boycotts of the original American publication of A&F Quarterly (published from 1997 to 2003) for its sexually explicit nature.[84] The magazine contained nude photography by Bruce Weber, articles about sex, and recipes for alcoholic beverages. Also acting as a catalog, the Quarterly displayed the brand's merchandise with information and prices. Advertisements for the A&F Quarterly appeared in Interview, Out, Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair.[85]
Despite a company policy restricting sale of the publication to minors, critics charged that the publication was readily sold to minors. In 2003, an array of religious organizations, women's rights activists, and Asian American groups organized boycotts and protests over the publication, and the "Christmas Edition" of the catalog was removed from stores.[86] Although Jeffries said he chose to discontinue the catalog, because "Frankly, [he] was getting sick of the old one; it was getting boring," on June 17, 2010, the company made the announcement, "The Return of the A&F Quarterly" and invited email subscribers to reserve their $10 copy for a July 17, 2010, in-store release date.[87]
Product criticism[edit]
In 2002, A&F sold a shirt that featured the slogan "Wong Brothers Laundry Service – Two Wongs Can Make It White" with smiling figures in conical Asian hats, a depiction of early Chinese immigrants. The company discontinued the designs and apologized after a boycott started by an Asian American student group at Stanford University.[88] That same year, abercrombie kids removed a line of thong underwear sold for girls in pre-teen children's sizes after parents mounted nationwide storefront protests. The underwear included phrases like "Eye Candy" and "Wink Wink" printed on the front.[89]
More T-shirt controversies occurred in 2004. The first incident involved a shirt featuring the phrase, "It's All Relative in West Virginia," a jab at alleged incestuous relationships in rural America. West Virginia Governor Bob Wise spoke out against the company for depicting "an unfounded, negative stereotype of West Virginia", but the shirts were not removed.[90] Later, another T-shirt that said "L is for Loser" next to a picture of a male gymnast on the rings gathered publicity. The company stopped selling the shirt in October 2004 after USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi announced a boycott of A&F for mocking the sport.[91]
In 2005, the Women and Girls Foundation of Southwest Pennsylvania launched a "Girlcott" of the store to protest the sale of T-shirts displaying sexist messages such as "Who needs brains when you have these?", "Available for parties," and "I had a nightmare I was a brunette." The campaign received national coverage on The Today Show, and the company pulled the shirts from stores on November 5, 2005.[92] Five days after this media coverage, A&F pulled two of the shirts from its shelves, released an apology to girls for producing the T-shirts, and agreed to have corporate executives meet with the "Girlcott" girls at the company's headquarters.[93]
Bob Jones University, a non-denominational Protestant university located in Greenville, South Carolina, and its affiliated pre-collegiate schools, along with other Christian schools, have prohibited A&F and Hollister clothing from being "worn, carried, or displayed" on its campuses because of "an unusual degree of antagonism to the name of Christ and an unusual display of wickedness" in the company's promotions.[94]
After A&F raised its price points in 2004, its products have been described as overpriced.[87] After the company opened its flagship store in London, England and Paris, France, the brand was criticized in the United Kingdom and France because the merchandise that was offered to the customers cost double (or a direct $/£ - $/€ swap) compared to prices found in the U.S.[95]
A T-shirt controversy arose again over A&F's Back-to-School 2009 collection of "humor tees".[96] One shirt proclaims "Show the twins" above a picture of a young woman with her blouse open to two men. Two other shirts state "Female streaking encouraged" and "Female Students Wanted for Sexual Research".[96] The American Family Association disapproved of the influence of the "sex-as-recreation" lifestyle shirts, and asked the brand to remove its "sexualized shirts" from display.[96]
Renaming of trauma center[edit]
In 2008, Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio agreed to rename its emergency room to the Abercrombie & Fitch Emergency Department and Trauma Center in exchange for a $10 million donation.[97] A letter written by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, signed by over 100 doctors and children's advocacy groups, argued against the renaming, for the "company's appalling history of targeting children with sexualized marketing and clothing."[98]
Remembrance poppy prohibition in the UK[edit]
In November 2010, the Southampton, England, A&F store prevented 18-year-old Harriet Phipps from wearing a remembrance poppy, which is worn as part of the Remembrance Day commemorations in the United Kingdom and Canada every November. The official A&F reason for the refusal was reported to be that the poppy is not considered part of the corporate approved uniform, and is therefore prohibited.[99] The ban drew criticisms, and on November 8 the company posted on its Facebook page the following statement: "As an American company that has been around since 1892, we appreciate the sacrifices of the British and American servicemen/women in the World Wars and in military conflicts that continue today. Our company policy is to allow associates to wear a poppy as a token of this appreciation on Remembrance Day. Going forward, ...we will revisit this policy to the days/weeks leading up to Remembrance Day."
Abercrombie Kids shop on Savile Row[edit]
In 2012, A&F announced plans that it would open its Abercrombie Kids shop at No. 3 on Savile Row, next door to Gieves & Hawkes.[100] The plans drew criticism and opposition from the tailors of the Row, who were already unhappy about the presence of the main A&F store on Burlington Gardens at the end of the Row to begin with, which eventually led to a protest organized by The Chap magazine on April 23, 2012.[101][102] During the consultation period, objections were lodged to Westminster City Council and in February 2013 the Council rejected many of A&F's proposals for the store, and branded the entire plans "utterly unacceptable."[103][104] A&F appealed, managed to overcome the obstacles and opened the store in September 2014.[105] The following year, A&F was subject to nearly £16,000 in fines and legal costs when it was ruled that changes it had made to the Grade II-listed building were illegal.[106]
Jeffries' 2006 target demographic quote[edit]
In 2013, a 2006 Salon interview with the CEO Mike Jeffries went viral and caused widespread outcry over Abercrombie's marketing practices.[107][108][109] The comments made by Mike Jeffries, stating that his brand is only suitable for "the good-looking, cool kids," and that there are people who do not belong in his clothes – namely overweight people, came under fire.[110][111]

That's why we hire good-looking people in our stores. Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don't market to anyone other than that. ... In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids. Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.[112]

These quotes, which were the basis for the article's "youth, sex and casual superiority" headline, went largely unnoticed when the article was published in 2006, until they resurfaced in May 2013 after former Jenny Craig weight-loss spokesperson Kirstie Alley brought them up in an Entertainment Tonight interview.[113] Prominent talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres also later spoke out against the company.[114][115] As the article gained momentum via social media, the company's official Facebook site was bombarded by comments and posts against this strategy.[116]
Jeffries issued an official statement on May 17, 2013, regarding the news articles, saying, "I want to address some of my comments that have been circulating from a 2006 interview. While I believe this 7-year-old, resurrected quote has been taken out of context, I sincerely regret that my choice of words was interpreted in a manner that has caused offense." He also stated, "We are completely opposed to any discrimination, bullying, derogatory characterizations or other anti-social behavior based on race, gender, body type or other individual characteristics."[117]

Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) is an American retailer that focuses on upscale casual wear for young consumers, its headquarters are in New Albany, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus.[2] The company operates two other offshoot brands: Abercrombie Kids & Hollister Co. [2] The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands.[citation needed]
Once known for its sexy ad campaigns, the company has toned down its imagery and no longer displays nearly nude models in their advertisements. According to Chairman Arthur Martinez, Abercrombie and Fitch is now targeting an older consumer, from ages 18–25. These changes provide the hopes that the audience will see the company is evolving along with its consumers, and boost sales.[3]
Abercrombie & Fitch is notable for using "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] Its main competitors are Aéropostale and American Eagle Outfitters. Its younger subsidiary, Abercrombie Kids, competes with Aéropostale's P.S., and American Eagle Outfitters's 77kids.

Abercrombie and Ezra Fitch, Abercrombie & Fitch was an elite outfitter of sporting and excursion goods, particularly noted for its expensive shotguns, fishing rods, fishing boats, and tents.[5] In 1976, Abercrombie & Fitch filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, finally closing its flagship store at Madison Avenue and East 45th Street in 1977.[6]
Shortly thereafter the name was revived in 1978; Oshman's Sporting Goods, a Houston-based chain owned by Jake Oshman,[7] bought the defunct firm's name and mailing list for $1.5 million[8] ($5.2 million in 2013 dollars).[9] Oshman's relaunched A&F as a mail-order retailer specializing in hunting wear and novelty items. It also opened shops in Beverly Hills, Dallas, and (by the mid-1980s) New York City. Finally, in 1988, Oshman's sold the company name and operations to The Limited, a clothing-chain operator based in Columbus, Ohio.[10] Abercrombie & Fitch gradually shifted its focus to young adults, first as a subsidiary of Limited Brands and then as a separate, publicly traded company; and grew to become one of the largest apparel firms in the United States.[11]
Since 1997, the company has consistently kept a high-profile in the public eye, due to its advertising, its philanthropy, and its involvement in legal conflicts over branding, clothing style and employment practices. In the first decade of the 21st century, the Great Recession battered the company's business as teenagers looked to lower-priced fast fashion brands like H&M and Forever 21 for fashion. Abercrombie & Fitch's stock price dropped from an all-time high of $84.23 in October 2007 to a low of $14.64 in November 2008.[12] The company worked to overhaul its merchandise mix and cut underperforming stores,[13] but lackluster performance has continued. Longtime CEO Michael Jeffries stepped down in December 2014, after 22 years with the company.[14]




Abercrombie & Fitch store in New York City


To combat heavy competition from fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21 and H&M, Abercrombie & Fitch announced key changes to change its image. It aims to reduce emphasis on sexualized advertising and focus more on customer service & diversity. Among the changes announced are eliminating sexualized advertising, no longer having shirtless models at new store openings, and eliminating sexualized pictures and advertising on bags, gift cards, and in stores. They are changing the name of store employees from "models" to "brand representatives", and will allow a more individualistic dress code. "Brand representatives" will also focus more on customer service by asking customers for help in stores, as opposed to past policies of aloofness. They also aim to promote more diversity among store employees and executives as well. A&F is signaling it will be implementing changes quickly.[4]
As of May 2015, the changes were already very apparent in stores. All "permanent marketing" images at the cash wrap and fitting rooms have been removed. Also, store models are no longer dressed in Abercrombie clothes.[4]

As of December 9, 2014[update], following the retirement of Mike Jeffries the following were key corporate officials:[15]

Arthur Martinez – Executive Chairman
Diane Chang – Executive Vice President of Sourcing
Leslee K. Herro – Executive Vice President of Planning and Allocation
Ronald A. Robins, Jr. – Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel
Jonathan Ramsden – Chief Operating Officer
Amy Zehrer – Senior Vice President of Stores
Christos Angelides – President of Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands
Fran Horowitz – President of Hollister brand

In April 2017, the company was described by Standard & Poor's as having a market value of $650,000,000 and about $420,000,000 cash on hand. In May 2017, the company was in talks to sell itself. Potential buyers included Express, American Eagle Outfitters and Cerberus Capital Management. Negotiations failed by early July. As a result of the news, on 10 July the firm's stock fell 21%.[16]

Headquarters[edit]
The company's headquarters, referred to by the company as "The Home Office", is located outside of Columbus in New Albany, Ohio.[17] The Home Office is designed as a campus of sorts, and is referred to as such. The company's merchandise-distribution centers (1 million square feet) are located exclusively on campus to help ensure brand protection.[17] Also on campus are mock-up stores, one for each of the company's brands, where store layout, merchandise and atmosphere are determined.[17] In January 2017, the company announced they would be cutting 150 jobs at their corporate headquarters.[18]
The company also has a European office in Mendrisio, Switzerland.[19][20]
Marketing, advertising and brand identity[edit]




The trademark slogan, Casual Luxury.


A&F is known for its racy marketing photography by Bruce Weber.[21] It is rendered to grayscale and features outdoor settings, usually with semi-nude males and females for an increased tone of sexuality. A&F casts only store employees for marketing campaigns. Casting directors from the home office travel to key A&F regional stores in the United States and to London to hold "casting calls" for employees aspiring to become the next "A&F New Face".[22][dead link] The company promotes its casting sessions, models, and photo shoots in the "A&F Casting" feature online at abercrombie.com. The website also provides a gallery of current photography. Framed copies at A&F stores will sometimes name the model and store.
The Abercrombie & Fitch brand image is heavily promoted as an international near-luxury lifestyle concept.[23] The company began cultivating an upscale image after the 2005 opening of its Fifth Avenue flagship store alongside Prada and other upscale retailers.[24] Having for years used high-grade materials in the construction of its merchandise, and pricing them at "near-luxury" levels, A&F introduced the trademark Casual Luxury[24] as a fictional dictionary term with multiple definitions such as "[using] the finest cashmere, pima cottons, and highest quality leather to create the ultimate in casual, body conscious clothing,"[25] and "implementing and/or incorporating time honored machinery ...to produce the most exclusive denim..."[25] This upscale image has allowed A&F to open stores in international high-end locations and further promote the image by pricing its merchandise at almost double the American prices.
Overall, CEO Jeffries calls the A&F image a "movie" because of the "fantasy" that plays out instore.[26] Even some of the clothing is given "story": "You buy into the emotional experience of a movie," Jeffries explains, "And that's what we're creating. Here I am walking into a movie, and I say, 'What's going to be [at] the box office today?'"[26]
Following a dismal earnings announcement on August 2014,[27] the company decided to drop its logo-branded apparel line, arguing that this element of its brand does not resonate with its target market. The company is now shifting its marketing strategy to trendier outfits and faster production processes. Some experts argue the retailer's focus on exclusivity has caused it to fall out of fashion with its target market.[28]




Abercrombie & Fitch models


Store staff[edit]
The company is noted for its use of "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] The models were required to buy and wear A&F clothing, but following a company settlement with California state labor regulators may now wear any no-logo clothing as long as it corresponds with the season and style of the brand. The California settlement also provided $2.2 million to reimburse former employees for their forced purchases of company-branded clothing.[29] An "Impact Team" was created in 2004 to control merchandise within each store and maintain company standards. Bigger and higher volume stores have a "Full Time Stock" who trains Impact associates, processes shipment, maintains stock room standards, and can act as a manager if the store is short on management staffing. The store manager and assistant managers are responsible for forms, lighting, photo marketing, fragrance presentations and to ensure models comply with the "look policy".[30]
Products[edit]

Women's Wear Daily calls Abercrombie & Fitch clothing classically "neo-preppy", with an "edgy tone and imagery".[31] The company's fashions have a reputation for luxury, with the majority of designs trend-driven. There is heavy promotion of "Premium Jeans". In early 2010, the company introduced a leather handbag collection inspired by designs from Ruehl.
Its prices are recognized as the highest in the youth-clothing industry.[32] Internationally, prices are almost double those in its American stores. Retail analyst Chris Boring warns that the company's brands are a "little more susceptible" should recession hit, because their specialties are premium-priced goods rather than necessities.[33] Indeed, as the late-2000s recession continues, A&F has noticeably suffered financially for its refusal to lower prices or offer discounts. A&F argues that doing so would "cheapen" its near-luxury image. Analyst Bruce Watson warns that A&F risks finding itself transformed into "a cautionary tale of a store that was left by the wayside when it declined to change with the times".[32] A&F's year-to-year revenue, a key indicator of a retailer's health, rose 13% in September 2010, aided by strong international sales.[34]
Abercrombie & Fitch has carried men's fragrances Fierce, Colden, and has re-branded the original cologne Woods (Christmas Floorset 2010). Women's fragrances have included 8, Perfume 41, Wakely, and Perfume #1. Fierce and 8 are the most heavily marketed fragrances, as they are the signature scents of the brand overall.[35]
The company also offers the Abercrombie & Fitch Credit Card, issued by the World Financial Network Bank.[36]
Brand protection[edit]
Because of extensive counterfeiting of Abercrombie & Fitch goods, in 2006 the company launched a brand protection program to combat the problem worldwide (focusing more on China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea) by working with legal forces globally.[37] The program is headed by a former FBI Supervisory Special Agent who was part of the FBI's Intellectual Property Rights program, and covers all A&F brands. A&F says that the program "will improve current practices and strategies by focusing on eliminating the supply of illicit Abercrombie & Fitch products."[37]
In August 2011, A&F offered Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino and other cast members of the MTV reality show Jersey Shore a "substantial payment" if they stopped wearing Abercrombie-branded clothes, stating "We are deeply concerned that Mr. Sorrentino's association with our brand could cause significant damage to our image."[38] In November 2011, Sorrentino filed a lawsuit against A&F after the company allegedly violated his copyrights in making shirts that said "The Fitchuation" and "GTL...You Know The Deal."[39]
Stores[edit]

The exterior of the contemporary store design features white molding and formerly black louvers. Starting in mid-2013 and concluding early 2014, the louvers were removed from all locations except flagship stores. The company stated that the louvers were removed in an effort to eliminate the exclusive atmosphere from stores and to experiment with window marketing.[40] The currently featured marketing image directly faces the entrance. The interior is lit with dim ceiling lights and spot lighting. Electronic dance music meant to create an upbeat atmosphere may be played at sound levels as high as 90 decibels, exceeding the corporate policy of 84 decibels and comparable to heavy construction machinery and harmful to the ears.[41]
The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands. The A&F brand has 278[42] locations in the United States, five in Canada (two in Alberta, two in Ontario and one in British Columbia). The company currently operates 25 full-line stores and four outlet stores across sixteen countries.
International expansion[edit]




The Abercrombie & Fitch flagship store in Ginza, Tokyo, Japan – the first one in Asia


The Abercrombie & Fitch brand is believed to have reached its maximum growth potential in the American market. International expansion began in 2005, with the long-term goal of opening flagships for A&F (and eventually all its brands), in high-profile locations worldwide "at a deliberate pace".[43][44] After initially opening at a deliberately slow pace, the company began to accelerate international expansion for its namesake and its Hollister Co. brand in 2012.[45][46]
The first non-U.S. Abercrombie & Fitch stores opened in Toronto and Edmonton in 2005, and then expanded to other major cities in Canada. The company first entered the European market in 2007 with the opening of its flagship London store at 7 Burlington Gardens, Savile Row.[47] Since then, the company has opened stores in Milan, Copenhagen, Paris, Madrid, Brussels Dublin and other major cities in Europe, including six stores in Germany. The company opened its first Asian A&F flagship store in Tokyo in 2009,[48] followed by Fukuoka, Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul.[49] The company would primarily focus on the Chinese and Japanese markets where luxury consumption is high.[50] The company has also entered a franchise agreement with Grupo AXO to open retail stores in Mexico by 2015.[51] The company entered the Middle Eastern market in 2015 with the opening of its flagship store in Kuwait.[52] Since then the company has opened locations in Dubai and plans to expand deeper into the Middle East with stores in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.[53]
Brands[edit]
Abercrombie & Fitch has three concept brands apart from its namesake; they are referred to as subsidiaries, but are operated as divisions under the A&F umbrella.

Abercrombie Kids
Prep-school by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed as "classic cool" for kids 7 through 14,[2] this is the children's version of Abercrombie & Fitch.


Hollister Co.
Southern California by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "SoCal" for teenagers 14 through 18,[2] with significantly lower prices than its parent brand.


Gilly Hicks
The cheeky cousin of Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "Down Under" Sydney, it offered underwear and loungewear for women 18 and up.[55] All stores closed in 2015.[56]


Ruehl No.925
Post-Grad by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after a fictional Greenwich Village heritage, offered clothes for 22 through 35 post-grads. Closed in 2010.[57]

Humanitarian projects[edit]
In recent years, Abercrombie & Fitch has engaged in philanthropic and humanitarian projects. In January 2010, the company launched the "A&F Cares" feature on its website to inform the public about its efforts in the fields of diversity, inclusion, human rights, philanthropy, and sustainability.[58]
The A&F Challenge is an annual fundraising event held on the home office campus in New Albany that features running, walking, biking, entertainment, and food. The funds raised go to the Ohio State University Medical Center's Program for Health, which focuses on "women's cancers and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease."[59]
In 2007, Abercrombie & Fitch partnered with the National Society of High School Scholars at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia to offer US$75,000 scholarships to NSHSS members.[60]
Legal issues[edit]
The company has been involved in legal conflicts over its employment practices, treatment of customers, and clothing styles.
Employment practices[edit]
See also: Employment Practices Liability
In a 2004 lawsuit González v. Abercrombie & Fitch, the company was accused of discriminating against African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women by preferentially offering floor sales positions (called Brand Representatives or Models) and store management positions to Caucasian males.[61] The company agreed to a settlement of the class-action suit, which required the company to (1) pay $40 million to African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women who applied and were not hired or worked in certain store positions, (2) revise its hiring, performance measurement, and promotion policies, (3) revise its internal complaint procedures, (4) appoint a Vice President of Diversity, (5) hire 25 recruiters to seek out minority applicants, (6) discontinue the practice of recruiting employees at primarily white fraternities and sororities, (7) include more minorities in marketing materials, (8) report to a neutral court-appointed monitor twice per year regarding its progress in those areas, and (9) report to the court once per year.[62][63][64]
In June 2009, British law student Riam Dean, who had worked at A&F's flagship store in London's Savile Row, took the company to an employment tribunal. Dean, who was born without a left forearm, claimed that although she was initially given special permission to wear clothing that covered her prosthetic limb, she was soon told that her appearance breached the company's "Look Policy" and sent to work in the stock room, out of sight of customers. Dean sued the company for disability discrimination, and sought up to £20,000 in damages.[65] In August 2009, the tribunal ruled the 22-year-old was wrongfully dismissed and unlawfully harassed. She was awarded £8,013 for loss of earnings and wrongful dismissal.[66][67]
In a lawsuit filed in September 2009, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores,[68] in U.S. District Court by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 17-year-old Samantha Elauf said she applied, in June 2008, for a sales position at the Abercrombie Kids store in the Woodland Hills Mall, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The teen, who wears a hijab in accordance with her religious beliefs, claims the manager told her the headscarf violates the store's "Look Policy".[69] The United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on February 25, 2015,[70] and ruled 8-1 on June 1, 2015 against the company.[71]
In 2010, a Muslim woman working at a Hollister store in San Mateo, California, was fired. Before being dismissed, Hani Khan had refused Abercrombie & Fitch's human-resources representative's demand that she remove her hijab. The representative reportedly stated that the headscarf, which Khan wears for religious reasons, violated the company's "Look Policy". The civil liberties group Council on American-Islamic Relations has stated that the dismissal is a violation of nondiscrimination laws, and filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.[72]
In 2011, the Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism started an investigation into A&F's hiring and remuneration policies. The firm was suspected of only hiring personnel under 25 years old, making heavy demands on the physical appearance of its staff and rewarding a premium to male models that work shirtless.[73]
Customer issues[edit]
In 2009, the company was fined more than $115,000 by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights for refusing to let a teenage girl help her sister, who has autism, try on clothes in a fitting room. The amount of the fine reflected "pushback" by the company according to Michael K. Browne, the legal affairs manager of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.[74]
A 16-year-old is suing the company after discovering that she was being videotaped in an A&F changing room by an employee, Kenneth Applegate II. Applegate denied the claim, but co-workers discovered his camera days later with the video on it.[75]
In 2010, a customer filed a class action relating to a 2009 holiday gift card promotion. The lawsuit alleges that the gift cards said "No Expiration Date" but Abercrombie voided and expired the gift cards in early 2010. In 2012, a judge certified a nationwide class in the case. In May 2013, Class Notice went out to potential class members.[76]
Lawsuits against other parties[edit]
In 2002, the company filed a lawsuit against American Eagle Outfitters, claiming that American Eagle copied A&F garment designs, among other things. The lawsuit was based on a trade-dress claim, stating that American Eagle had very closely mimicked A&F's products' visual appearance and packaging. Specifically, A&F claimed that American Eagle copied particular articles of clothing, in-store displays and advertisements, and even the A&F product catalog. Despite the admission that American Eagle might have utilized very similar materials, designs, in-store displays, symbols, color combinations, and patterns as A&F, the court ruled that there was not an excessive level of similarity to confuse potential customers, and therefore the court ruled in favor of American Eagle.[77]
On October 18, 1999, Abercrombie & Fitch had a lawsuit about making false and misleading statements concerning its growth while knowing the actual growth was less than Wall Street expectations,[78] and paid $6,050,000 for settlement.
Controversy and criticism[edit]
Since its re-establishment in 1988, Abercrombie & Fitch has faced numerous accusations regarding its employment practices, merchandise, and advertising campaigns which have been described as sexually explicit and racist.[21][79]
Advertising[edit]
The company has received criticism over its provocative advertising.[80] The company has been accused of promoting the sexualization of pre-teen girls, for example by marketing thongs to 10-year-olds and padded bikini tops to 7-year-olds.[81]
Employment and labor practices[edit]
Lawsuits have been filed against the company due to alleged discriminatory employment practices. In 2004, in Gonzalez v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores (see "Legal issues" and "Controversy and Criticism" below), the company was sued for giving desirable positions to white applicants, to the exclusion of minorities.[62][82]
In November 2009, Abercrombie & Fitch was added to the "Sweatshop Hall of Shame 2010" by the worker advocacy group International Labor Rights Forum.[83]
A&F Quarterly[edit]
Main article: A&F Quarterly
Conservative and religious groups called for boycotts of the original American publication of A&F Quarterly (published from 1997 to 2003) for its sexually explicit nature.[84] The magazine contained nude photography by Bruce Weber, articles about sex, and recipes for alcoholic beverages. Also acting as a catalog, the Quarterly displayed the brand's merchandise with information and prices. Advertisements for the A&F Quarterly appeared in Interview, Out, Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair.[85]
Despite a company policy restricting sale of the publication to minors, critics charged that the publication was readily sold to minors. In 2003, an array of religious organizations, women's rights activists, and Asian American groups organized boycotts and protests over the publication, and the "Christmas Edition" of the catalog was removed from stores.[86] Although Jeffries said he chose to discontinue the catalog, because "Frankly, [he] was getting sick of the old one; it was getting boring," on June 17, 2010, the company made the announcement, "The Return of the A&F Quarterly" and invited email subscribers to reserve their $10 copy for a July 17, 2010, in-store release date.[87]
Product criticism[edit]
In 2002, A&F sold a shirt that featured the slogan "Wong Brothers Laundry Service – Two Wongs Can Make It White" with smiling figures in conical Asian hats, a depiction of early Chinese immigrants. The company discontinued the designs and apologized after a boycott started by an Asian American student group at Stanford University.[88] That same year, abercrombie kids removed a line of thong underwear sold for girls in pre-teen children's sizes after parents mounted nationwide storefront protests. The underwear included phrases like "Eye Candy" and "Wink Wink" printed on the front.[89]
More T-shirt controversies occurred in 2004. The first incident involved a shirt featuring the phrase, "It's All Relative in West Virginia," a jab at alleged incestuous relationships in rural America. West Virginia Governor Bob Wise spoke out against the company for depicting "an unfounded, negative stereotype of West Virginia", but the shirts were not removed.[90] Later, another T-shirt that said "L is for Loser" next to a picture of a male gymnast on the rings gathered publicity. The company stopped selling the shirt in October 2004 after USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi announced a boycott of A&F for mocking the sport.[91]
In 2005, the Women and Girls Foundation of Southwest Pennsylvania launched a "Girlcott" of the store to protest the sale of T-shirts displaying sexist messages such as "Who needs brains when you have these?", "Available for parties," and "I had a nightmare I was a brunette." The campaign received national coverage on The Today Show, and the company pulled the shirts from stores on November 5, 2005.[92] Five days after this media coverage, A&F pulled two of the shirts from its shelves, released an apology to girls for producing the T-shirts, and agreed to have corporate executives meet with the "Girlcott" girls at the company's headquarters.[93]
Bob Jones University, a non-denominational Protestant university located in Greenville, South Carolina, and its affiliated pre-collegiate schools, along with other Christian schools, have prohibited A&F and Hollister clothing from being "worn, carried, or displayed" on its campuses because of "an unusual degree of antagonism to the name of Christ and an unusual display of wickedness" in the company's promotions.[94]
After A&F raised its price points in 2004, its products have been described as overpriced.[87] After the company opened its flagship store in London, England and Paris, France, the brand was criticized in the United Kingdom and France because the merchandise that was offered to the customers cost double (or a direct $/£ - $/€ swap) compared to prices found in the U.S.[95]
A T-shirt controversy arose again over A&F's Back-to-School 2009 collection of "humor tees".[96] One shirt proclaims "Show the twins" above a picture of a young woman with her blouse open to two men. Two other shirts state "Female streaking encouraged" and "Female Students Wanted for Sexual Research".[96] The American Family Association disapproved of the influence of the "sex-as-recreation" lifestyle shirts, and asked the brand to remove its "sexualized shirts" from display.[96]
Renaming of trauma center[edit]
In 2008, Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio agreed to rename its emergency room to the Abercrombie & Fitch Emergency Department and Trauma Center in exchange for a $10 million donation.[97] A letter written by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, signed by over 100 doctors and children's advocacy groups, argued against the renaming, for the "company's appalling history of targeting children with sexualized marketing and clothing."[98]
Remembrance poppy prohibition in the UK[edit]
In November 2010, the Southampton, England, A&F store prevented 18-year-old Harriet Phipps from wearing a remembrance poppy, which is worn as part of the Remembrance Day commemorations in the United Kingdom and Canada every November. The official A&F reason for the refusal was reported to be that the poppy is not considered part of the corporate approved uniform, and is therefore prohibited.[99] The ban drew criticisms, and on November 8 the company posted on its Facebook page the following statement: "As an American company that has been around since 1892, we appreciate the sacrifices of the British and American servicemen/women in the World Wars and in military conflicts that continue today. Our company policy is to allow associates to wear a poppy as a token of this appreciation on Remembrance Day. Going forward, ...we will revisit this policy to the days/weeks leading up to Remembrance Day."
Abercrombie Kids shop on Savile Row[edit]
In 2012, A&F announced plans that it would open its Abercrombie Kids shop at No. 3 on Savile Row, next door to Gieves & Hawkes.[100] The plans drew criticism and opposition from the tailors of the Row, who were already unhappy about the presence of the main A&F store on Burlington Gardens at the end of the Row to begin with, which eventually led to a protest organized by The Chap magazine on April 23, 2012.[101][102] During the consultation period, objections were lodged to Westminster City Council and in February 2013 the Council rejected many of A&F's proposals for the store, and branded the entire plans "utterly unacceptable."[103][104] A&F appealed, managed to overcome the obstacles and opened the store in September 2014.[105] The following year, A&F was subject to nearly £16,000 in fines and legal costs when it was ruled that changes it had made to the Grade II-listed building were illegal.[106]
Jeffries' 2006 target demographic quote[edit]
In 2013, a 2006 Salon interview with the CEO Mike Jeffries went viral and caused widespread outcry over Abercrombie's marketing practices.[107][108][109] The comments made by Mike Jeffries, stating that his brand is only suitable for "the good-looking, cool kids," and that there are people who do not belong in his clothes – namely overweight people, came under fire.[110][111]

That's why we hire good-looking people in our stores. Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don't market to anyone other than that. ... In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids. Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.[112]

These quotes, which were the basis for the article's "youth, sex and casual superiority" headline, went largely unnoticed when the article was published in 2006, until they resurfaced in May 2013 after former Jenny Craig weight-loss spokesperson Kirstie Alley brought them up in an Entertainment Tonight interview.[113] Prominent talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres also later spoke out against the company.[114][115] As the article gained momentum via social media, the company's official Facebook site was bombarded by comments and posts against this strategy.[116]
Jeffries issued an official statement on May 17, 2013, regarding the news articles, saying, "I want to address some of my comments that have been circulating from a 2006 interview. While I believe this 7-year-old, resurrected quote has been taken out of context, I sincerely regret that my choice of words was interpreted in a manner that has caused offense." He also stated, "We are completely opposed to any discrimination, bullying, derogatory characterizations or other anti-social behavior based on race, gender, body type or other individual characteristics."[117]

Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) is an American retailer that focuses on upscale casual wear for young consumers, its headquarters are in New Albany, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus.[2] The company operates two other offshoot brands: Abercrombie Kids & Hollister Co. [2] The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands.[citation needed]
Once known for its sexy ad campaigns, the company has toned down its imagery and no longer displays nearly nude models in their advertisements. According to Chairman Arthur Martinez, Abercrombie and Fitch is now targeting an older consumer, from ages 18–25. These changes provide the hopes that the audience will see the company is evolving along with its consumers, and boost sales.[3]
Abercrombie & Fitch is notable for using "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] Its main competitors are Aéropostale and American Eagle Outfitters. Its younger subsidiary, Abercrombie Kids, competes with Aéropostale's P.S., and American Eagle Outfitters's 77kids.

History[edit]
Main article: History of Abercrombie & Fitch




Cover of A&F catalog from 1909.


Founded in 1892 in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, by David T. Abercrombie and Ezra Fitch, Abercrombie & Fitch was an elite outfitter of sporting and excursion goods, particularly noted for its expensive shotguns, fishing rods, fishing boats, and tents.[5] In 1976, Abercrombie & Fitch filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, finally closing its flagship store at Madison Avenue and East 45th Street in 1977.[6]
Shortly thereafter the name was revived in 1978; Oshman's Sporting Goods, a Houston-based chain owned by Jake Oshman,[7] bought the defunct firm's name and mailing list for $1.5 million[8] ($5.2 million in 2013 dollars).[9] Oshman's relaunched A&F as a mail-order retailer specializing in hunting wear and novelty items. It also opened shops in Beverly Hills, Dallas, and (by the mid-1980s) New York City. Finally, in 1988, Oshman's sold the company name and operations to The Limited, a clothing-chain operator based in Columbus, Ohio.[10] Abercrombie & Fitch gradually shifted its focus to young adults, first as a subsidiary of Limited Brands and then as a separate, publicly traded company; and grew to become one of the largest apparel firms in the United States.[11]
Since 1997, the company has consistently kept a high-profile in the public eye, due to its advertising, its philanthropy, and its involvement in legal conflicts over branding, clothing style and employment practices. In the first decade of the 21st century, the Great Recession battered the company's business as teenagers looked to lower-priced fast fashion brands like H&M and Forever 21 for fashion. Abercrombie & Fitch's stock price dropped from an all-time high of $84.23 in October 2007 to a low of $14.64 in November 2008.[12] The company worked to overhaul its merchandise mix and cut underperforming stores,[13] but lackluster performance has continued. Longtime CEO Michael Jeffries stepped down in December 2014, after 22 years with the company.[14]




Abercrombie & Fitch store in New York City


To combat heavy competition from fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21 and H&M, Abercrombie & Fitch announced key changes to change its image. It aims to reduce emphasis on sexualized advertising and focus more on customer service & diversity. Among the changes announced are eliminating sexualized advertising, no longer having shirtless models at new store openings, and eliminating sexualized pictures and advertising on bags, gift cards, and in stores. They are changing the name of store employees from "models" to "brand representatives", and will allow a more individualistic dress code. "Brand representatives" will also focus more on customer service by asking customers for help in stores, as opposed to past policies of aloofness. They also aim to promote more diversity among store employees and executives as well. A&F is signaling it will be implementing changes quickly.[4]
As of May 2015, the changes were already very apparent in stores. All "permanent marketing" images at the cash wrap and fitting rooms have been removed. Also, store models are no longer dressed in Abercrombie clothes.[4]

As of December 9, 2014[update], following the retirement of Mike Jeffries the following were key corporate officials:[15]

Arthur Martinez – Executive Chairman
Diane Chang – Executive Vice President of Sourcing
Leslee K. Herro – Executive Vice President of Planning and Allocation
Ronald A. Robins, Jr. – Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel
Jonathan Ramsden – Chief Operating Officer
Amy Zehrer – Senior Vice President of Stores
Christos Angelides – President of Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands
Fran Horowitz – President of Hollister brand

In April 2017, the company was described by Standard & Poor's as having a market value of $650,000,000 and about $420,000,000 cash on hand. In May 2017, the company was in talks to sell itself. Potential buyers included Express, American Eagle Outfitters and Cerberus Capital Management. Negotiations failed by early July. As a result of the news, on 10 July the firm's stock fell 21%.[16]

Headquarters[edit]
The company's headquarters, referred to by the company as "The Home Office", is located outside of Columbus in New Albany, Ohio.[17] The Home Office is designed as a campus of sorts, and is referred to as such. The company's merchandise-distribution centers (1 million square feet) are located exclusively on campus to help ensure brand protection.[17] Also on campus are mock-up stores, one for each of the company's brands, where store layout, merchandise and atmosphere are determined.[17] In January 2017, the company announced they would be cutting 150 jobs at their corporate headquarters.[18]
The company also has a European office in Mendrisio, Switzerland.[19][20]
Marketing, advertising and brand identity[edit]




The trademark slogan, Casual Luxury.


A&F is known for its racy marketing photography by Bruce Weber.[21] It is rendered to grayscale and features outdoor settings, usually with semi-nude males and females for an increased tone of sexuality. A&F casts only store employees for marketing campaigns. Casting directors from the home office travel to key A&F regional stores in the United States and to London to hold "casting calls" for employees aspiring to become the next "A&F New Face".[22][dead link] The company promotes its casting sessions, models, and photo shoots in the "A&F Casting" feature online at abercrombie.com. The website also provides a gallery of current photography. Framed copies at A&F stores will sometimes name the model and store.
The Abercrombie & Fitch brand image is heavily promoted as an international near-luxury lifestyle concept.[23] The company began cultivating an upscale image after the 2005 opening of its Fifth Avenue flagship store alongside Prada and other upscale retailers.[24] Having for years used high-grade materials in the construction of its merchandise, and pricing them at "near-luxury" levels, A&F introduced the trademark Casual Luxury[24] as a fictional dictionary term with multiple definitions such as "[using] the finest cashmere, pima cottons, and highest quality leather to create the ultimate in casual, body conscious clothing,"[25] and "implementing and/or incorporating time honored machinery ...to produce the most exclusive denim..."[25] This upscale image has allowed A&F to open stores in international high-end locations and further promote the image by pricing its merchandise at almost double the American prices.
Overall, CEO Jeffries calls the A&F image a "movie" because of the "fantasy" that plays out instore.[26] Even some of the clothing is given "story": "You buy into the emotional experience of a movie," Jeffries explains, "And that's what we're creating. Here I am walking into a movie, and I say, 'What's going to be [at] the box office today?'"[26]
Following a dismal earnings announcement on August 2014,[27] the company decided to drop its logo-branded apparel line, arguing that this element of its brand does not resonate with its target market. The company is now shifting its marketing strategy to trendier outfits and faster production processes. Some experts argue the retailer's focus on exclusivity has caused it to fall out of fashion with its target market.[28]




Abercrombie & Fitch models


Store staff[edit]
The company is noted for its use of "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] The models were required to buy and wear A&F clothing, but following a company settlement with California state labor regulators may now wear any no-logo clothing as long as it corresponds with the season and style of the brand. The California settlement also provided $2.2 million to reimburse former employees for their forced purchases of company-branded clothing.[29] An "Impact Team" was created in 2004 to control merchandise within each store and maintain company standards. Bigger and higher volume stores have a "Full Time Stock" who trains Impact associates, processes shipment, maintains stock room standards, and can act as a manager if the store is short on management staffing. The store manager and assistant managers are responsible for forms, lighting, photo marketing, fragrance presentations and to ensure models comply with the "look policy".[30]
Products[edit]

Women's Wear Daily calls Abercrombie & Fitch clothing classically "neo-preppy", with an "edgy tone and imagery".[31] The company's fashions have a reputation for luxury, with the majority of designs trend-driven. There is heavy promotion of "Premium Jeans". In early 2010, the company introduced a leather handbag collection inspired by designs from Ruehl.
Its prices are recognized as the highest in the youth-clothing industry.[32] Internationally, prices are almost double those in its American stores. Retail analyst Chris Boring warns that the company's brands are a "little more susceptible" should recession hit, because their specialties are premium-priced goods rather than necessities.[33] Indeed, as the late-2000s recession continues, A&F has noticeably suffered financially for its refusal to lower prices or offer discounts. A&F argues that doing so would "cheapen" its near-luxury image. Analyst Bruce Watson warns that A&F risks finding itself transformed into "a cautionary tale of a store that was left by the wayside when it declined to change with the times".[32] A&F's year-to-year revenue, a key indicator of a retailer's health, rose 13% in September 2010, aided by strong international sales.[34]
Abercrombie & Fitch has carried men's fragrances Fierce, Colden, and has re-branded the original cologne Woods (Christmas Floorset 2010). Women's fragrances have included 8, Perfume 41, Wakely, and Perfume #1. Fierce and 8 are the most heavily marketed fragrances, as they are the signature scents of the brand overall.[35]
The company also offers the Abercrombie & Fitch Credit Card, issued by the World Financial Network Bank.[36]
Brand protection[edit]
Because of extensive counterfeiting of Abercrombie & Fitch goods, in 2006 the company launched a brand protection program to combat the problem worldwide (focusing more on China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea) by working with legal forces globally.[37] The program is headed by a former FBI Supervisory Special Agent who was part of the FBI's Intellectual Property Rights program, and covers all A&F brands. A&F says that the program "will improve current practices and strategies by focusing on eliminating the supply of illicit Abercrombie & Fitch products."[37]
In August 2011, A&F offered Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino and other cast members of the MTV reality show Jersey Shore a "substantial payment" if they stopped wearing Abercrombie-branded clothes, stating "We are deeply concerned that Mr. Sorrentino's association with our brand could cause significant damage to our image."[38] In November 2011, Sorrentino filed a lawsuit against A&F after the company allegedly violated his copyrights in making shirts that said "The Fitchuation" and "GTL...You Know The Deal."[39]
Stores[edit]

The exterior of the contemporary store design features white molding and formerly black louvers. Starting in mid-2013 and concluding early 2014, the louvers were removed from all locations except flagship stores. The company stated that the louvers were removed in an effort to eliminate the exclusive atmosphere from stores and to experiment with window marketing.[40] The currently featured marketing image directly faces the entrance. The interior is lit with dim ceiling lights and spot lighting. Electronic dance music meant to create an upbeat atmosphere may be played at sound levels as high as 90 decibels, exceeding the corporate policy of 84 decibels and comparable to heavy construction machinery and harmful to the ears.[41]
The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands. The A&F brand has 278[42] locations in the United States, five in Canada (two in Alberta, two in Ontario and one in British Columbia). The company currently operates 25 full-line stores and four outlet stores across sixteen countries.
International expansion[edit]




The Abercrombie & Fitch flagship store in Ginza, Tokyo, Japan – the first one in Asia


The Abercrombie & Fitch brand is believed to have reached its maximum growth potential in the American market. International expansion began in 2005, with the long-term goal of opening flagships for A&F (and eventually all its brands), in high-profile locations worldwide "at a deliberate pace".[43][44] After initially opening at a deliberately slow pace, the company began to accelerate international expansion for its namesake and its Hollister Co. brand in 2012.[45][46]
The first non-U.S. Abercrombie & Fitch stores opened in Toronto and Edmonton in 2005, and then expanded to other major cities in Canada. The company first entered the European market in 2007 with the opening of its flagship London store at 7 Burlington Gardens, Savile Row.[47] Since then, the company has opened stores in Milan, Copenhagen, Paris, Madrid, Brussels Dublin and other major cities in Europe, including six stores in Germany. The company opened its first Asian A&F flagship store in Tokyo in 2009,[48] followed by Fukuoka, Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul.[49] The company would primarily focus on the Chinese and Japanese markets where luxury consumption is high.[50] The company has also entered a franchise agreement with Grupo AXO to open retail stores in Mexico by 2015.[51] The company entered the Middle Eastern market in 2015 with the opening of its flagship store in Kuwait.[52] Since then the company has opened locations in Dubai and plans to expand deeper into the Middle East with stores in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.[53]
Brands[edit]
Abercrombie & Fitch has three concept brands apart from its namesake; they are referred to as subsidiaries, but are operated as divisions under the A&F umbrella.

Abercrombie Kids
Prep-school by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed as "classic cool" for kids 7 through 14,[2] this is the children's version of Abercrombie & Fitch.


Hollister Co.
Southern California by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "SoCal" for teenagers 14 through 18,[2] with significantly lower prices than its parent brand.


Gilly Hicks
The cheeky cousin of Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "Down Under" Sydney, it offered underwear and loungewear for women 18 and up.[55] All stores closed in 2015.[56]


Ruehl No.925
Post-Grad by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after a fictional Greenwich Village heritage, offered clothes for 22 through 35 post-grads. Closed in 2010.[57]

Humanitarian projects[edit]
In recent years, Abercrombie & Fitch has engaged in philanthropic and humanitarian projects. In January 2010, the company launched the "A&F Cares" feature on its website to inform the public about its efforts in the fields of diversity, inclusion, human rights, philanthropy, and sustainability.[58]
The A&F Challenge is an annual fundraising event held on the home office campus in New Albany that features running, walking, biking, entertainment, and food. The funds raised go to the Ohio State University Medical Center's Program for Health, which focuses on "women's cancers and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease."[59]
In 2007, Abercrombie & Fitch partnered with the National Society of High School Scholars at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia to offer US$75,000 scholarships to NSHSS members.[60]
Legal issues[edit]
The company has been involved in legal conflicts over its employment practices, treatment of customers, and clothing styles.
Employment practices[edit]
See also: Employment Practices Liability
In a 2004 lawsuit González v. Abercrombie & Fitch, the company was accused of discriminating against African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women by preferentially offering floor sales positions (called Brand Representatives or Models) and store management positions to Caucasian males.[61] The company agreed to a settlement of the class-action suit, which required the company to (1) pay $40 million to African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women who applied and were not hired or worked in certain store positions, (2) revise its hiring, performance measurement, and promotion policies, (3) revise its internal complaint procedures, (4) appoint a Vice President of Diversity, (5) hire 25 recruiters to seek out minority applicants, (6) discontinue the practice of recruiting employees at primarily white fraternities and sororities, (7) include more minorities in marketing materials, (8) report to a neutral court-appointed monitor twice per year regarding its progress in those areas, and (9) report to the court once per year.[62][63][64]
In June 2009, British law student Riam Dean, who had worked at A&F's flagship store in London's Savile Row, took the company to an employment tribunal. Dean, who was born without a left forearm, claimed that although she was initially given special permission to wear clothing that covered her prosthetic limb, she was soon told that her appearance breached the company's "Look Policy" and sent to work in the stock room, out of sight of customers. Dean sued the company for disability discrimination, and sought up to £20,000 in damages.[65] In August 2009, the tribunal ruled the 22-year-old was wrongfully dismissed and unlawfully harassed. She was awarded £8,013 for loss of earnings and wrongful dismissal.[66][67]
In a lawsuit filed in September 2009, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores,[68] in U.S. District Court by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 17-year-old Samantha Elauf said she applied, in June 2008, for a sales position at the Abercrombie Kids store in the Woodland Hills Mall, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The teen, who wears a hijab in accordance with her religious beliefs, claims the manager told her the headscarf violates the store's "Look Policy".[69] The United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on February 25, 2015,[70] and ruled 8-1 on June 1, 2015 against the company.[71]
In 2010, a Muslim woman working at a Hollister store in San Mateo, California, was fired. Before being dismissed, Hani Khan had refused Abercrombie & Fitch's human-resources representative's demand that she remove her hijab. The representative reportedly stated that the headscarf, which Khan wears for religious reasons, violated the company's "Look Policy". The civil liberties group Council on American-Islamic Relations has stated that the dismissal is a violation of nondiscrimination laws, and filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.[72]
In 2011, the Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism started an investigation into A&F's hiring and remuneration policies. The firm was suspected of only hiring personnel under 25 years old, making heavy demands on the physical appearance of its staff and rewarding a premium to male models that work shirtless.[73]
Customer issues[edit]
In 2009, the company was fined more than $115,000 by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights for refusing to let a teenage girl help her sister, who has autism, try on clothes in a fitting room. The amount of the fine reflected "pushback" by the company according to Michael K. Browne, the legal affairs manager of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.[74]
A 16-year-old is suing the company after discovering that she was being videotaped in an A&F changing room by an employee, Kenneth Applegate II. Applegate denied the claim, but co-workers discovered his camera days later with the video on it.[75]
In 2010, a customer filed a class action relating to a 2009 holiday gift card promotion. The lawsuit alleges that the gift cards said "No Expiration Date" but Abercrombie voided and expired the gift cards in early 2010. In 2012, a judge certified a nationwide class in the case. In May 2013, Class Notice went out to potential class members.[76]
Lawsuits against other parties[edit]
In 2002, the company filed a lawsuit against American Eagle Outfitters, claiming that American Eagle copied A&F garment designs, among other things. The lawsuit was based on a trade-dress claim, stating that American Eagle had very closely mimicked A&F's products' visual appearance and packaging. Specifically, A&F claimed that American Eagle copied particular articles of clothing, in-store displays and advertisements, and even the A&F product catalog. Despite the admission that American Eagle might have utilized very similar materials, designs, in-store displays, symbols, color combinations, and patterns as A&F, the court ruled that there was not an excessive level of similarity to confuse potential customers, and therefore the court ruled in favor of American Eagle.[77]
On October 18, 1999, Abercrombie & Fitch had a lawsuit about making false and misleading statements concerning its growth while knowing the actual growth was less than Wall Street expectations,[78] and paid $6,050,000 for settlement.
Controversy and criticism[edit]
Since its re-establishment in 1988, Abercrombie & Fitch has faced numerous accusations regarding its employment practices, merchandise, and advertising campaigns which have been described as sexually explicit and racist.[21][79]
Advertising[edit]
The company has received criticism over its provocative advertising.[80] The company has been accused of promoting the sexualization of pre-teen girls, for example by marketing thongs to 10-year-olds and padded bikini tops to 7-year-olds.[81]
Employment and labor practices[edit]
Lawsuits have been filed against the company due to alleged discriminatory employment practices. In 2004, in Gonzalez v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores (see "Legal issues" and "Controversy and Criticism" below), the company was sued for giving desirable positions to white applicants, to the exclusion of minorities.[62][82]
In November 2009, Abercrombie & Fitch was added to the "Sweatshop Hall of Shame 2010" by the worker advocacy group International Labor Rights Forum.[83]
A&F Quarterly[edit]
Main article: A&F Quarterly
Conservative and religious groups called for boycotts of the original American publication of A&F Quarterly (published from 1997 to 2003) for its sexually explicit nature.[84] The magazine contained nude photography by Bruce Weber, articles about sex, and recipes for alcoholic beverages. Also acting as a catalog, the Quarterly displayed the brand's merchandise with information and prices. Advertisements for the A&F Quarterly appeared in Interview, Out, Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair.[85]
Despite a company policy restricting sale of the publication to minors, critics charged that the publication was readily sold to minors. In 2003, an array of religious organizations, women's rights activists, and Asian American groups organized boycotts and protests over the publication, and the "Christmas Edition" of the catalog was removed from stores.[86] Although Jeffries said he chose to discontinue the catalog, because "Frankly, [he] was getting sick of the old one; it was getting boring," on June 17, 2010, the company made the announcement, "The Return of the A&F Quarterly" and invited email subscribers to reserve their $10 copy for a July 17, 2010, in-store release date.[87]
Product criticism[edit]
In 2002, A&F sold a shirt that featured the slogan "Wong Brothers Laundry Service – Two Wongs Can Make It White" with smiling figures in conical Asian hats, a depiction of early Chinese immigrants. The company discontinued the designs and apologized after a boycott started by an Asian American student group at Stanford University.[88] That same year, abercrombie kids removed a line of thong underwear sold for girls in pre-teen children's sizes after parents mounted nationwide storefront protests. The underwear included phrases like "Eye Candy" and "Wink Wink" printed on the front.[89]
More T-shirt controversies occurred in 2004. The first incident involved a shirt featuring the phrase, "It's All Relative in West Virginia," a jab at alleged incestuous relationships in rural America. West Virginia Governor Bob Wise spoke out against the company for depicting "an unfounded, negative stereotype of West Virginia", but the shirts were not removed.[90] Later, another T-shirt that said "L is for Loser" next to a picture of a male gymnast on the rings gathered publicity. The company stopped selling the shirt in October 2004 after USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi announced a boycott of A&F for mocking the sport.[91]
In 2005, the Women and Girls Foundation of Southwest Pennsylvania launched a "Girlcott" of the store to protest the sale of T-shirts displaying sexist messages such as "Who needs brains when you have these?", "Available for parties," and "I had a nightmare I was a brunette." The campaign received national coverage on The Today Show, and the company pulled the shirts from stores on November 5, 2005.[92] Five days after this media coverage, A&F pulled two of the shirts from its shelves, released an apology to girls for producing the T-shirts, and agreed to have corporate executives meet with the "Girlcott" girls at the company's headquarters.[93]
Bob Jones University, a non-denominational Protestant university located in Greenville, South Carolina, and its affiliated pre-collegiate schools, along with other Christian schools, have prohibited A&F and Hollister clothing from being "worn, carried, or displayed" on its campuses because of "an unusual degree of antagonism to the name of Christ and an unusual display of wickedness" in the company's promotions.[94]
After A&F raised its price points in 2004, its products have been described as overpriced.[87] After the company opened its flagship store in London, England and Paris, France, the brand was criticized in the United Kingdom and France because the merchandise that was offered to the customers cost double (or a direct $/£ - $/€ swap) compared to prices found in the U.S.[95]
A T-shirt controversy arose again over A&F's Back-to-School 2009 collection of "humor tees".[96] One shirt proclaims "Show the twins" above a picture of a young woman with her blouse open to two men. Two other shirts state "Female streaking encouraged" and "Female Students Wanted for Sexual Research".[96] The American Family Association disapproved of the influence of the "sex-as-recreation" lifestyle shirts, and asked the brand to remove its "sexualized shirts" from display.[96]
Renaming of trauma center[edit]
In 2008, Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio agreed to rename its emergency room to the Abercrombie & Fitch Emergency Department and Trauma Center in exchange for a $10 million donation.[97] A letter written by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, signed by over 100 doctors and children's advocacy groups, argued against the renaming, for the "company's appalling history of targeting children with sexualized marketing and clothing."[98]
Remembrance poppy prohibition in the UK[edit]
In November 2010, the Southampton, England, A&F store prevented 18-year-old Harriet Phipps from wearing a remembrance poppy, which is worn as part of the Remembrance Day commemorations in the United Kingdom and Canada every November. The official A&F reason for the refusal was reported to be that the poppy is not considered part of the corporate approved uniform, and is therefore prohibited.[99] The ban drew criticisms, and on November 8 the company posted on its Facebook page the following statement: "As an American company that has been around since 1892, we appreciate the sacrifices of the British and American servicemen/women in the World Wars and in military conflicts that continue today. Our company policy is to allow associates to wear a poppy as a token of this appreciation on Remembrance Day. Going forward, ...we will revisit this policy to the days/weeks leading up to Remembrance Day."
Abercrombie Kids shop on Savile Row[edit]
In 2012, A&F announced plans that it would open its Abercrombie Kids shop at No. 3 on Savile Row, next door to Gieves & Hawkes.[100] The plans drew criticism and opposition from the tailors of the Row, who were already unhappy about the presence of the main A&F store on Burlington Gardens at the end of the Row to begin with, which eventually led to a protest organized by The Chap magazine on April 23, 2012.[101][102] During the consultation period, objections were lodged to Westminster City Council and in February 2013 the Council rejected many of A&F's proposals for the store, and branded the entire plans "utterly unacceptable."[103][104] A&F appealed, managed to overcome the obstacles and opened the store in September 2014.[105] The following year, A&F was subject to nearly £16,000 in fines and legal costs when it was ruled that changes it had made to the Grade II-listed building were illegal.[106]
Jeffries' 2006 target demographic quote[edit]
In 2013, a 2006 Salon interview with the CEO Mike Jeffries went viral and caused widespread outcry over Abercrombie's marketing practices.[107][108][109] The comments made by Mike Jeffries, stating that his brand is only suitable for "the good-looking, cool kids," and that there are people who do not belong in his clothes – namely overweight people, came under fire.[110][111]

That's why we hire good-looking people in our stores. Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don't market to anyone other than that. ... In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids. Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.[112]

These quotes, which were the basis for the article's "youth, sex and casual superiority" headline, went largely unnoticed when the article was published in 2006, until they resurfaced in May 2013 after former Jenny Craig weight-loss spokesperson Kirstie Alley brought them up in an Entertainment Tonight interview.[113] Prominent talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres also later spoke out against the company.[114][115] As the article gained momentum via social media, the company's official Facebook site was bombarded by comments and posts against this strategy.[116]
Jeffries issued an official statement on May 17, 2013, regarding the news articles, saying, "I want to address some of my comments that have been circulating from a 2006 interview. While I believe this 7-year-old, resurrected quote has been taken out of context, I sincerely regret that my choice of words was interpreted in a manner that has caused offense." He also stated, "We are completely opposed to any discrimination, bullying, derogatory characterizations or other anti-social behavior based on race, gender, body type or other individual characteristics."[117]

Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) is an American retailer that focuses on upscale casual wear for young consumers, its headquarters are in New Albany, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus.[2] The company operates two other offshoot brands: Abercrombie Kids & Hollister Co. [2] The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands.[citation needed]
Once known for its sexy ad campaigns, the company has toned down its imagery and no longer displays nearly nude models in their advertisements. According to Chairman Arthur Martinez, Abercrombie and Fitch is now targeting an older consumer, from ages 18–25. These changes provide the hopes that the audience will see the company is evolving along with its consumers, and boost sales.[3]
Abercrombie & Fitch is notable for using "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] Its main competitors are Aéropostale and American Eagle Outfitters. Its younger subsidiary, Abercrombie Kids, competes with Aéropostale's P.S., and American Eagle Outfitters's 77kids.

History[edit]
Main article: History of Abercrombie & Fitch




Cover of A&F catalog from 1909.


Founded in 1892 in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, by David T. Abercrombie and Ezra Fitch, Abercrombie & Fitch was an elite outfitter of sporting and excursion goods, particularly noted for its expensive shotguns, fishing rods, fishing boats, and tents.[5] In 1976, Abercrombie & Fitch filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, finally closing its flagship store at Madison Avenue and East 45th Street in 1977.[6]
Shortly thereafter the name was revived in 1978; Oshman's Sporting Goods, a Houston-based chain owned by Jake Oshman,[7] bought the defunct firm's name and mailing list for $1.5 million[8] ($5.2 million in 2013 dollars).[9] Oshman's relaunched A&F as a mail-order retailer specializing in hunting wear and novelty items. It also opened shops in Beverly Hills, Dallas, and (by the mid-1980s) New York City. Finally, in 1988, Oshman's sold the company name and operations to The Limited, a clothing-chain operator based in Columbus, Ohio.[10] Abercrombie & Fitch gradually shifted its focus to young adults, first as a subsidiary of Limited Brands and then as a separate, publicly traded company; and grew to become one of the largest apparel firms in the United States.[11]
Since 1997, the company has consistently kept a high-profile in the public eye, due to its advertising, its philanthropy, and its involvement in legal conflicts over branding, clothing style and employment practices. In the first decade of the 21st century, the Great Recession battered the company's business as teenagers looked to lower-priced fast fashion brands like H&M and Forever 21 for fashion. Abercrombie & Fitch's stock price dropped from an all-time high of $84.23 in October 2007 to a low of $14.64 in November 2008.[12] The company worked to overhaul its merchandise mix and cut underperforming stores,[13] but lackluster performance has continued. Longtime CEO Michael Jeffries stepped down in December 2014, after 22 years with the company.[14]




Abercrombie & Fitch store in New York City


To combat heavy competition from fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21 and H&M, Abercrombie & Fitch announced key changes to change its image. It aims to reduce emphasis on sexualized advertising and focus more on customer service & diversity. Among the changes announced are eliminating sexualized advertising, no longer having shirtless models at new store openings, and eliminating sexualized pictures and advertising on bags, gift cards, and in stores. They are changing the name of store employees from "models" to "brand representatives", and will allow a more individualistic dress code. "Brand representatives" will also focus more on customer service by asking customers for help in stores, as opposed to past policies of aloofness. They also aim to promote more diversity among store employees and executives as well. A&F is signaling it will be implementing changes quickly.[4]
As of May 2015, the changes were already very apparent in stores. All "permanent marketing" images at the cash wrap and fitting rooms have been removed. Also, store models are no longer dressed in Abercrombie clothes.[4]

As of December 9, 2014[update], following the retirement of Mike Jeffries the following were key corporate officials:[15]

Arthur Martinez – Executive Chairman
Diane Chang – Executive Vice President of Sourcing
Leslee K. Herro – Executive Vice President of Planning and Allocation
Ronald A. Robins, Jr. – Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel
Jonathan Ramsden – Chief Operating Officer
Amy Zehrer – Senior Vice President of Stores
Christos Angelides – President of Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands
Fran Horowitz – President of Hollister brand

In April 2017, the company was described by Standard & Poor's as having a market value of $650,000,000 and about $420,000,000 cash on hand. In May 2017, the company was in talks to sell itself. Potential buyers included Express, American Eagle Outfitters and Cerberus Capital Management. Negotiations failed by early July. As a result of the news, on 10 July the firm's stock fell 21%.[16]

Headquarters[edit]
The company's headquarters, referred to by the company as "The Home Office", is located outside of Columbus in New Albany, Ohio.[17] The Home Office is designed as a campus of sorts, and is referred to as such. The company's merchandise-distribution centers (1 million square feet) are located exclusively on campus to help ensure brand protection.[17] Also on campus are mock-up stores, one for each of the company's brands, where store layout, merchandise and atmosphere are determined.[17] In January 2017, the company announced they would be cutting 150 jobs at their corporate headquarters.[18]
The company also has a European office in Mendrisio, Switzerland.[19][20]
Marketing, advertising and brand identity[edit]




The trademark slogan, Casual Luxury.


A&F is known for its racy marketing photography by Bruce Weber.[21] It is rendered to grayscale and features outdoor settings, usually with semi-nude males and females for an increased tone of sexuality. A&F casts only store employees for marketing campaigns. Casting directors from the home office travel to key A&F regional stores in the United States and to London to hold "casting calls" for employees aspiring to become the next "A&F New Face".[22][dead link] The company promotes its casting sessions, models, and photo shoots in the "A&F Casting" feature online at abercrombie.com. The website also provides a gallery of current photography. Framed copies at A&F stores will sometimes name the model and store.
The Abercrombie & Fitch brand image is heavily promoted as an international near-luxury lifestyle concept.[23] The company began cultivating an upscale image after the 2005 opening of its Fifth Avenue flagship store alongside Prada and other upscale retailers.[24] Having for years used high-grade materials in the construction of its merchandise, and pricing them at "near-luxury" levels, A&F introduced the trademark Casual Luxury[24] as a fictional dictionary term with multiple definitions such as "[using] the finest cashmere, pima cottons, and highest quality leather to create the ultimate in casual, body conscious clothing,"[25] and "implementing and/or incorporating time honored machinery ...to produce the most exclusive denim..."[25] This upscale image has allowed A&F to open stores in international high-end locations and further promote the image by pricing its merchandise at almost double the American prices.
Overall, CEO Jeffries calls the A&F image a "movie" because of the "fantasy" that plays out instore.[26] Even some of the clothing is given "story": "You buy into the emotional experience of a movie," Jeffries explains, "And that's what we're creating. Here I am walking into a movie, and I say, 'What's going to be [at] the box office today?'"[26]
Following a dismal earnings announcement on August 2014,[27] the company decided to drop its logo-branded apparel line, arguing that this element of its brand does not resonate with its target market. The company is now shifting its marketing strategy to trendier outfits and faster production processes. Some experts argue the retailer's focus on exclusivity has caused it to fall out of fashion with its target market.[28]

The company is noted for its use of "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] The models were required to buy and wear A&F clothing, but following a company settlement with California state labor regulators may now wear any no-logo clothing as long as it corresponds with the season and style of the brand. The California settlement also provided $2.2 million to reimburse former employees for their forced purchases of company-branded clothing.[29] An "Impact Team" was created in 2004 to control merchandise within each store and maintain company standards. Bigger and higher volume stores have a "Full Time Stock" who trains Impact associates, processes shipment, maintains stock room standards, and can act as a manager if the store is short on management staffing. The store manager and assistant managers are responsible for forms, lighting, photo marketing, fragrance presentations and to ensure models comply with the "look policy".[30]
Products[edit]

Women's Wear Daily calls Abercrombie & Fitch clothing classically "neo-preppy", with an "edgy tone and imagery".[31] The company's fashions have a reputation for luxury, with the majority of designs trend-driven. There is heavy promotion of "Premium Jeans". In early 2010, the company introduced a leather handbag collection inspired by designs from Ruehl.
Its prices are recognized as the highest in the youth-clothing industry.[32] Internationally, prices are almost double those in its American stores. Retail analyst Chris Boring warns that the company's brands are a "little more susceptible" should recession hit, because their specialties are premium-priced goods rather than necessities.[33] Indeed, as the late-2000s recession continues, A&F has noticeably suffered financially for its refusal to lower prices or offer discounts. A&F argues that doing so would "cheapen" its near-luxury image. Analyst Bruce Watson warns that A&F risks finding itself transformed into "a cautionary tale of a store that was left by the wayside when it declined to change with the times".[32] A&F's year-to-year revenue, a key indicator of a retailer's health, rose 13% in September 2010, aided by strong international sales.[34]
Abercrombie & Fitch has carried men's fragrances Fierce, Colden, and has re-branded the original cologne Woods (Christmas Floorset 2010). Women's fragrances have included 8, Perfume 41, Wakely, and Perfume #1. Fierce and 8 are the most heavily marketed fragrances, as they are the signature scents of the brand overall.[35]
The company also offers the Abercrombie & Fitch Credit Card, issued by the World Financial Network Bank.[36]
Brand protection[edit]
Because of extensive counterfeiting of Abercrombie & Fitch goods, in 2006 the company launched a brand protection program to combat the problem worldwide (focusing more on China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea) by working with legal forces globally.[37] The program is headed by a former FBI Supervisory Special Agent who was part of the FBI's Intellectual Property Rights program, and covers all A&F brands. A&F says that the program "will improve current practices and strategies by focusing on eliminating the supply of illicit Abercrombie & Fitch products."[37]
In August 2011, A&F offered Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino and other cast members of the MTV reality show Jersey Shore a "substantial payment" if they stopped wearing Abercrombie-branded clothes, stating "We are deeply concerned that Mr. Sorrentino's association with our brand could cause significant damage to our image."[38] In November 2011, Sorrentino filed a lawsuit against A&F after the company allegedly violated his copyrights in making shirts that said "The Fitchuation" and "GTL...You Know The Deal."[39]
Stores[edit]

The Modern Canoe store located at the Mall at Millenia in Orlando, Florida with wooden louvers (featuring the Spring Break 2007 marketing campaign picture).


The exterior of the contemporary store design features white molding and formerly black louvers. Starting in mid-2013 and concluding early 2014, the louvers were removed from all locations except flagship stores. The company stated that the louvers were removed in an effort to eliminate the exclusive atmosphere from stores and to experiment with window marketing.[40] The currently featured marketing image directly faces the entrance. The interior is lit with dim ceiling lights and spot lighting. Electronic dance music meant to create an upbeat atmosphere may be played at sound levels as high as 90 decibels, exceeding the corporate policy of 84 decibels and comparable to heavy construction machinery and harmful to the ears.[41]
The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands. The A&F brand has 278[42] locations in the United States, five in Canada (two in Alberta, two in Ontario and one in British Columbia). The company currently operates 25 full-line stores and four outlet stores across sixteen countries.
International expansion[edit]




The Abercrombie & Fitch flagship store in Ginza, Tokyo, Japan – the first one in Asia


The Abercrombie & Fitch brand is believed to have reached its maximum growth potential in the American market. International expansion began in 2005, with the long-term goal of opening flagships for A&F (and eventually all its brands), in high-profile locations worldwide "at a deliberate pace".[43][44] After initially opening at a deliberately slow pace, the company began to accelerate international expansion for its namesake and its Hollister Co. brand in 2012.[45][46]
The first non-U.S. Abercrombie & Fitch stores opened in Toronto and Edmonton in 2005, and then expanded to other major cities in Canada. The company first entered the European market in 2007 with the opening of its flagship London store at 7 Burlington Gardens, Savile Row.[47] Since then, the company has opened stores in Milan, Copenhagen, Paris, Madrid, Brussels Dublin and other major cities in Europe, including six stores in Germany. The company opened its first Asian A&F flagship store in Tokyo in 2009,[48] followed by Fukuoka, Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul.[49] The company would primarily focus on the Chinese and Japanese markets where luxury consumption is high.[50] The company has also entered a franchise agreement with Grupo AXO to open retail stores in Mexico by 2015.[51] The company entered the Middle Eastern market in 2015 with the opening of its flagship store in Kuwait.[52] Since then the company has opened locations in Dubai and plans to expand deeper into the Middle East with stores in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.[53]
Brands[edit]
Abercrombie & Fitch has three concept brands apart from its namesake; they are referred to as subsidiaries, but are operated as divisions under the A&F umbrella.

Abercrombie Kids
Prep-school by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed as "classic cool" for kids 7 through 14,[2] this is the children's version of Abercrombie & Fitch.


Hollister Co.
Southern California by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "SoCal" for teenagers 14 through 18,[2] with significantly lower prices than its parent brand.


Gilly Hicks
The cheeky cousin of Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "Down Under" Sydney, it offered underwear and loungewear for women 18 and up.[55] All stores closed in 2015.[56]


Ruehl No.925
Post-Grad by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after a fictional Greenwich Village heritage, offered clothes for 22 through 35 post-grads. Closed in 2010.[57]

Humanitarian projects[edit]
In recent years, Abercrombie & Fitch has engaged in philanthropic and humanitarian projects. In January 2010, the company launched the "A&F Cares" feature on its website to inform the public about its efforts in the fields of diversity, inclusion, human rights, philanthropy, and sustainability.[58]
The A&F Challenge is an annual fundraising event held on the home office campus in New Albany that features running, walking, biking, entertainment, and food. The funds raised go to the Ohio State University Medical Center's Program for Health, which focuses on "women's cancers and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease."[59]
In 2007, Abercrombie & Fitch partnered with the National Society of High School Scholars at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia to offer US$75,000 scholarships to NSHSS members.[60]
Legal issues[edit]
The company has been involved in legal conflicts over its employment practices, treatment of customers, and clothing styles.
Employment practices[edit]
See also: Employment Practices Liability
In a 2004 lawsuit González v. Abercrombie & Fitch, the company was accused of discriminating against African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women by preferentially offering floor sales positions (called Brand Representatives or Models) and store management positions to Caucasian males.[61] The company agreed to a settlement of the class-action suit, which required the company to (1) pay $40 million to African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women who applied and were not hired or worked in certain store positions, (2) revise its hiring, performance measurement, and promotion policies, (3) revise its internal complaint procedures, (4) appoint a Vice President of Diversity, (5) hire 25 recruiters to seek out minority applicants, (6) discontinue the practice of recruiting employees at primarily white fraternities and sororities, (7) include more minorities in marketing materials, (8) report to a neutral court-appointed monitor twice per year regarding its progress in those areas, and (9) report to the court once per year.[62][63][64]
In June 2009, British law student Riam Dean, who had worked at A&F's flagship store in London's Savile Row, took the company to an employment tribunal. Dean, who was born without a left forearm, claimed that although she was initially given special permission to wear clothing that covered her prosthetic limb, she was soon told that her appearance breached the company's "Look Policy" and sent to work in the stock room, out of sight of customers. Dean sued the company for disability discrimination, and sought up to £20,000 in damages.[65] In August 2009, the tribunal ruled the 22-year-old was wrongfully dismissed and unlawfully harassed. She was awarded £8,013 for loss of earnings and wrongful dismissal.[66][67]
In a lawsuit filed in September 2009, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores,[68] in U.S. District Court by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 17-year-old Samantha Elauf said she applied, in June 2008, for a sales position at the Abercrombie Kids store in the Woodland Hills Mall, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The teen, who wears a hijab in accordance with her religious beliefs, claims the manager told her the headscarf violates the store's "Look Policy".[69] The United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on February 25, 2015,[70] and ruled 8-1 on June 1, 2015 against the company.[71]
In 2010, a Muslim woman working at a Hollister store in San Mateo, California, was fired. Before being dismissed, Hani Khan had refused Abercrombie & Fitch's human-resources representative's demand that she remove her hijab. The representative reportedly stated that the headscarf, which Khan wears for religious reasons, violated the company's "Look Policy". The civil liberties group Council on American-Islamic Relations has stated that the dismissal is a violation of nondiscrimination laws, and filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.[72]
In 2011, the Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism started an investigation into A&F's hiring and remuneration policies. The firm was suspected of only hiring personnel under 25 years old, making heavy demands on the physical appearance of its staff and rewarding a premium to male models that work shirtless.[73]
Customer issues[edit]
In 2009, the company was fined more than $115,000 by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights for refusing to let a teenage girl help her sister, who has autism, try on clothes in a fitting room. The amount of the fine reflected "pushback" by the company according to Michael K. Browne, the legal affairs manager of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.[74]
A 16-year-old is suing the company after discovering that she was being videotaped in an A&F changing room by an employee, Kenneth Applegate II. Applegate denied the claim, but co-workers discovered his camera days later with the video on it.[75]
In 2010, a customer filed a class action relating to a 2009 holiday gift card promotion. The lawsuit alleges that the gift cards said "No Expiration Date" but Abercrombie voided and expired the gift cards in early 2010. In 2012, a judge certified a nationwide class in the case. In May 2013, Class Notice went out to potential class members.[76]
Lawsuits against other parties[edit]
In 2002, the company filed a lawsuit against American Eagle Outfitters, claiming that American Eagle copied A&F garment designs, among other things. The lawsuit was based on a trade-dress claim, stating that American Eagle had very closely mimicked A&F's products' visual appearance and packaging. Specifically, A&F claimed that American Eagle copied particular articles of clothing, in-store displays and advertisements, and even the A&F product catalog. Despite the admission that American Eagle might have utilized very similar materials, designs, in-store displays, symbols, color combinations, and patterns as A&F, the court ruled that there was not an excessive level of similarity to confuse potential customers, and therefore the court ruled in favor of American Eagle.[77]
On October 18, 1999, Abercrombie & Fitch had a lawsuit about making false and misleading statements concerning its growth while knowing the actual growth was less than Wall Street expectations,[78] and paid $6,050,000 for settlement.
Controversy and criticism[edit]
Since its re-establishment in 1988, Abercrombie & Fitch has faced numerous accusations regarding its employment practices, merchandise, and advertising campaigns which have been described as sexually explicit and racist.[21][79]
Advertising[edit]
The company has received criticism over its provocative advertising.[80] The company has been accused of promoting the sexualization of pre-teen girls, for example by marketing thongs to 10-year-olds and padded bikini tops to 7-year-olds.[81]
Employment and labor practices[edit]
Lawsuits have been filed against the company due to alleged discriminatory employment practices. In 2004, in Gonzalez v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores (see "Legal issues" and "Controversy and Criticism" below), the company was sued for giving desirable positions to white applicants, to the exclusion of minorities.[62][82]
In November 2009, Abercrombie & Fitch was added to the "Sweatshop Hall of Shame 2010" by the worker advocacy group International Labor Rights Forum.[83]
A&F Quarterly[edit]
Main article: A&F Quarterly
Conservative and religious groups called for boycotts of the original American publication of A&F Quarterly (published from 1997 to 2003) for its sexually explicit nature.[84] The magazine contained nude photography by Bruce Weber, articles about sex, and recipes for alcoholic beverages. Also acting as a catalog, the Quarterly displayed the brand's merchandise with information and prices. Advertisements for the A&F Quarterly appeared in Interview, Out, Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair.[85]
Despite a company policy restricting sale of the publication to minors, critics charged that the publication was readily sold to minors. In 2003, an array of religious organizations, women's rights activists, and Asian American groups organized boycotts and protests over the publication, and the "Christmas Edition" of the catalog was removed from stores.[86] Although Jeffries said he chose to discontinue the catalog, because "Frankly, [he] was getting sick of the old one; it was getting boring," on June 17, 2010, the company made the announcement, "The Return of the A&F Quarterly" and invited email subscribers to reserve their $10 copy for a July 17, 2010, in-store release date.[87]
Product criticism[edit]
In 2002, A&F sold a shirt that featured the slogan "Wong Brothers Laundry Service – Two Wongs Can Make It White" with smiling figures in conical Asian hats, a depiction of early Chinese immigrants. The company discontinued the designs and apologized after a boycott started by an Asian American student group at Stanford University.[88] That same year, abercrombie kids removed a line of thong underwear sold for girls in pre-teen children's sizes after parents mounted nationwide storefront protests. The underwear included phrases like "Eye Candy" and "Wink Wink" printed on the front.[89]
More T-shirt controversies occurred in 2004. The first incident involved a shirt featuring the phrase, "It's All Relative in West Virginia," a jab at alleged incestuous relationships in rural America. West Virginia Governor Bob Wise spoke out against the company for depicting "an unfounded, negative stereotype of West Virginia", but the shirts were not removed.[90] Later, another T-shirt that said "L is for Loser" next to a picture of a male gymnast on the rings gathered publicity. The company stopped selling the shirt in October 2004 after USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi announced a boycott of A&F for mocking the sport.[91]
In 2005, the Women and Girls Foundation of Southwest Pennsylvania launched a "Girlcott" of the store to protest the sale of T-shirts displaying sexist messages such as "Who needs brains when you have these?", "Available for parties," and "I had a nightmare I was a brunette." The campaign received national coverage on The Today Show, and the company pulled the shirts from stores on November 5, 2005.[92] Five days after this media coverage, A&F pulled two of the shirts from its shelves, released an apology to girls for producing the T-shirts, and agreed to have corporate executives meet with the "Girlcott" girls at the company's headquarters.[93]
Bob Jones University, a non-denominational Protestant university located in Greenville, South Carolina, and its affiliated pre-collegiate schools, along with other Christian schools, have prohibited A&F and Hollister clothing from being "worn, carried, or displayed" on its campuses because of "an unusual degree of antagonism to the name of Christ and an unusual display of wickedness" in the company's promotions.[94]
After A&F raised its price points in 2004, its products have been described as overpriced.[87] After the company opened its flagship store in London, England and Paris, France, the brand was criticized in the United Kingdom and France because the merchandise that was offered to the customers cost double (or a direct $/£ - $/€ swap) compared to prices found in the U.S.[95]
A T-shirt controversy arose again over A&F's Back-to-School 2009 collection of "humor tees".[96] One shirt proclaims "Show the twins" above a picture of a young woman with her blouse open to two men. Two other shirts state "Female streaking encouraged" and "Female Students Wanted for Sexual Research".[96] The American Family Association disapproved of the influence of the "sex-as-recreation" lifestyle shirts, and asked the brand to remove its "sexualized shirts" from display.[96]
Renaming of trauma center[edit]
In 2008, Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio agreed to rename its emergency room to the Abercrombie & Fitch Emergency Department and Trauma Center in exchange for a $10 million donation.[97] A letter written by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, signed by over 100 doctors and children's advocacy groups, argued against the renaming, for the "company's appalling history of targeting children with sexualized marketing and clothing."[98]
Remembrance poppy prohibition in the UK[edit]
In November 2010, the Southampton, England, A&F store prevented 18-year-old Harriet Phipps from wearing a remembrance poppy, which is worn as part of the Remembrance Day commemorations in the United Kingdom and Canada every November. The official A&F reason for the refusal was reported to be that the poppy is not considered part of the corporate approved uniform, and is therefore prohibited.[99] The ban drew criticisms, and on November 8 the company posted on its Facebook page the following statement: "As an American company that has been around since 1892, we appreciate the sacrifices of the British and American servicemen/women in the World Wars and in military conflicts that continue today. Our company policy is to allow associates to wear a poppy as a token of this appreciation on Remembrance Day. Going forward, ...we will revisit this policy to the days/weeks leading up to Remembrance Day."
Abercrombie Kids shop on Savile Row[edit]
In 2012, A&F announced plans that it would open its Abercrombie Kids shop at No. 3 on Savile Row, next door to Gieves & Hawkes.[100] The plans drew criticism and opposition from the tailors of the Row, who were already unhappy about the presence of the main A&F store on Burlington Gardens at the end of the Row to begin with, which eventually led to a protest organized by The Chap magazine on April 23, 2012.[101][102] During the consultation period, objections were lodged to Westminster City Council and in February 2013 the Council rejected many of A&F's proposals for the store, and branded the entire plans "utterly unacceptable."[103][104] A&F appealed, managed to overcome the obstacles and opened the store in September 2014.[105] The following year, A&F was subject to nearly £16,000 in fines and legal costs when it was ruled that changes it had made to the Grade II-listed building were illegal.[106]
Jeffries' 2006 target demographic quote[edit]
In 2013, a 2006 Salon interview with the CEO Mike Jeffries went viral and caused widespread outcry over Abercrombie's marketing practices.[107][108][109] The comments made by Mike Jeffries, stating that his brand is only suitable for "the good-looking, cool kids," and that there are people who do not belong in his clothes – namely overweight people, came under fire.[110][111]

That's why we hire good-looking people in our stores. Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don't market to anyone other than that. ... In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids. Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.[112]

These quotes, which were the basis for the article's "youth, sex and casual superiority" headline, went largely unnoticed when the article was published in 2006, until they resurfaced in May 2013 after former Jenny Craig weight-loss spokesperson Kirstie Alley brought them up in an Entertainment Tonight interview.[113] Prominent talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres also later spoke out against the company.[114][115] As the article gained momentum via social media, the company's official Facebook site was bombarded by comments and posts against this strategy.[116]
Jeffries issued an official statement on May 17, 2013, regarding the news articles, saying, "I want to address some of my comments that have been circulating from a 2006 interview. While I believe this 7-year-old, resurrected quote has been taken out of context, I sincerely regret that my choice of words was interpreted in a manner that has caused offense." He also stated, "We are completely opposed to any discrimination, bullying, derogatory characterizations or other anti-social behavior based on race, gender, body type or other individual characteristics."[117]

    Abercrombie & Fitch launches products on Alibaba Tmall

23
Jul '17






Courtesy: Abercrombie & Fitch
Abercrombie & Fitch has announced the launch of Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids on Alibaba Group's Tmall, China's largest consumer platform for brands and retailers. Tmall has carried the Hollister brand since 2014 and starting on July 26, it will also include a full offering of Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids products.                                   With 454 million annual active buyers across its China retail marketplaces, including Tmall, Alibaba Group is helping A&F meet the ever-growing and changing needs of Chinese consumers with a strategic omni-channel approach spanning online-to-offline. Additionally, with 75 per cent of Alibaba Group's users under the age of 35, and about 80 per cent of its gross merchandise value taking place on mobile, the demographics on Alibaba Group's China retail marketplaces align well with the updated A&F brand's target consumer in their twenties. Tmall enables brands to tap into its big data capability and innovative marketing tools such as live-streaming to provide consumers with a shopping experience that's both deeply personalised and interactive.                                   A&F is focused on delivering both an engaging and seamless experience for its customers, whenever, wherever, and however they choose to shop. A&F currently has ten physical stores in mainland China and a local site at abercrombie.cn. While stores remain an important gateway for the brand, Alibaba Group's vast reach creates an opportunity to meet the needs of consumers' shopping preferences, including those without access to a physical store. A&F and Tmall plan to explore providing additional omni-channel capabilities to the shoppers.                                   "Alibaba Group places a strong emphasis on consumer engagement, which aligns with our focus on creating a unique online brand experience for our customers, as well as facilitating a seamless and frictionless shopping experience. Building on our Hollister brand's successful partnership with the leader in China's online retail space, we are excited to bring our A&F brand experience to the broader Chinese market, beyond the reach of our physical stores through Tmall," said Fran Horowitz, chief executive officer of Abercrombie & Fitch Co.                                   "We are excited to welcome Abercrombie & Fitch to the Tmall platform," said Jessica Liu, president of Tmall Fashion, Alibaba Group. "Abercrombie is an iconic global brand that consumers, both on our platform and in China, have sought out for some time. We look forward to connecting our consumer base to the brand and working with Abercrombie & Fitch to further its international growth."

    Abercrombie & Fitch launches products on Alibaba Tmall

23
Jul '17






Courtesy: Abercrombie & Fitch
Abercrombie & Fitch has announced the launch of Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids on Alibaba Group's Tmall, China's largest consumer platform for brands and retailers. Tmall has carried the Hollister brand since 2014 and starting on July 26, it will also include a full offering of Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids products.                                   With 454 million annual active buyers across its China retail marketplaces, including Tmall, Alibaba Group is helping A&F meet the ever-growing and changing needs of Chinese consumers with a strategic omni-channel approach spanning online-to-offline. Additionally, with 75 per cent of Alibaba Group's users under the age of 35, and about 80 per cent of its gross merchandise value taking place on mobile, the demographics on Alibaba Group's China retail marketplaces align well with the updated A&F brand's target consumer in their twenties. Tmall enables brands to tap into its big data capability and innovative marketing tools such as live-streaming to provide consumers with a shopping experience that's both deeply personalised and interactive.                                   A&F is focused on delivering both an engaging and seamless experience for its customers, whenever, wherever, and however they choose to shop. A&F currently has ten physical stores in mainland China and a local site at abercrombie.cn. While stores remain an important gateway for the brand, Alibaba Group's vast reach creates an opportunity to meet the needs of consumers' shopping preferences, including those without access to a physical store. A&F and Tmall plan to explore providing additional omni-channel capabilities to the shoppers.                                   "Alibaba Group places a strong emphasis on consumer engagement, which aligns with our focus on creating a unique online brand experience for our customers, as well as facilitating a seamless and frictionless shopping experience. Building on our Hollister brand's successful partnership with the leader in China's online retail space, we are excited to bring our A&F brand experience to the broader Chinese market, beyond the reach of our physical stores through Tmall," said Fran Horowitz, chief executive officer of Abercrombie & Fitch Co.                                   "We are excited to welcome Abercrombie & Fitch to the Tmall platform," said Jessica Liu, president of Tmall Fashion, Alibaba Group. "Abercrombie is an iconic global brand that consumers, both on our platform and in China, have sought out for some time. We look forward to connecting our consumer base to the brand and working with Abercrombie & Fitch to further its international growth."

            A judge has given final approval to a settlement in a class action lawsuit against Abercrombie & Fitch relating to $25 hard copy promotional gift cards that stated "No expiration date" on the cards. Abercrombie & Fitch, which denies any wrongdoing, has restored 70% of the original remaining value on those promotional gift cards, which Abercrombie & Fitch issued as part of a 2009 winter holiday promotion and a 2010 spring promotion and later voided. The restored value on the cards may be redeemed at any store of the brand that issued the card (or, in the case of Gilly Hicks, at Hollister) until October 18, 2017. For more information about the settlement, please visit: www.abercrombieclassaction.com.

Performance Assessment Of Abercrombie And Fitch Co Marketing Essay
Published: 23rd March, 2015 Last Edited: 23rd March, 2015

This essay has been submitted by a student. This is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers.
Abercrombie & Fitch was founded by David T. Abercrombie in 1892 under the name "David T. Abercrombie Co." (A&F Handbook, 2008). The first store was located in downtown New York City at 314 Broadway and was dedicated to selling high quality camping, fishing and hunting gear to a market containing professional hunters, explorers and trappers (A&F Handbook, 2008). A lawyer and camping enthusiast, Ezra Fitch, became one of the store's most devoted customers and eventually bought partnership into the business in 1900 (A&F Handbook, 2008). In 1904, the company became incorporated and officially known as Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F Handbook, 2008). The two men had radically opposing views as to how to run the company: Abercrombie was very conservative while Fitch saw a new direction for the company. Eventually Abercrombie resigned in 1907 (A&F Handbook, 2008).
The store began to expand and reached international recognition after Fitch published a gear and clothing catalogue (A&F Handbook, 2008). Expansion into other areas of the United States continued even after Fitch's retirement in 1928. After being bought and sold numerous times, including once by The Limited Inc. in 1988, the company finally became fully independent and publicly traded in May of 1998 (A&F Handbook, 2008). Today, the Abercrombie & Fitch Co. is segmented into five brands: Abercrombie & Fitch, abercrombie, Hollister Co., Gilly Hicks and RUEHL No.925., which comprise the 1 125 stores in five countries and five online stores, one for each brand (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010). This year, Abercrombie & Fitch and Abercrombie each established a flagship store in Milan, Italy and Tokyo, Japan allowing the company to reach an international level beyond the scope of the online store.
The Customer/Market Perspective
Abercrombie & Fitch Co.'s five subsidiaries each have a coordinated theme, apparel style and logo to satisfy their individual target market. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. considers their customer in-store experience as "the primary vehicle for communicating the spirit of each brand" (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010) and thus, invests great effort into the maintaining common elements across the brands and in all locations.
The company ensures that the five senses: sight, sound, smell, touch and energy (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010) are continually and equally experienced by all potential customers that enter the store, regardless of location. The way in which the senses are felt by customers is controlled by Head Office and enforced by in-store management. Sight includes lighting (e.g. generally dim with strategic spot lighting), cleanliness of the store, presentation of clothing, fixtures and forms, and in-store marketing (e.g. black and white photos of Abercrombie & Fitch models) (A&F Manager M. Deffet, personal communication, October 2010). Sound is completely controlled by the Head Office satellite through a music playlist that is automatically turned on at a predetermined volume during mall hours (A&F Manager M. Deffet, personal communication, October 2010). The playlist is always upbeat and energetic in keeping with the energy of the store and includes songs that will attract their target market. Smell is the fragrance that is sprayed hourly in a specific fashion onto all clothing and forms by models (i.e. salesfloor associates) (A&F Manager M. Deffet, personal communication, October 2010). Touch includes the softest, richest and highest quality fabrics in their clothing (A&F Handbook, 2008). Finally, energy is the result of the aforementioned senses and is exemplified by the attitude and look of the associates. Energy is also created and maintained through the model's use of standardized taglines: greetings and phrases that customers receive to promote customer service/interaction and the store's products (A&F Manager M. Deffet, personal communication, October 2010). The first tagline is given in the front room meant to make the customer feel welcome the minute they walk in the store such that their first impression is positive one (A&F Manager M. Deffet, personal communication, October 2010). The second tagline is given at the cash and invites the customer to try the brand's latest fragrance (A&F Manager M. Deffet, personal communication, October 2010). The aforementioned elements are a general view of how Abercrombie & Fitch Co. creates their store experience. Although there is a high level of coordination among the brands, each differs slightly such that it can reach its target market most effectively.
Abercrombie & Fitch sells "casual luxury" apparel at a premium price point to a target market that includes post-secondary students ranging from 18 to 21 years of age (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010). The company describes the style of their clothing as "timeless and always cool" (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010). Although Abercrombie & Fitch has a timeless style it is responsive to current trends. They incorporate elements of modern fashion into their classic American look to attract both a trendy and a classic consumer base. All clothing has a moose logo consistently placed on the left side of the clothing. Abercrombie & Fitch strives to create a classic, sexy and energetic atmosphere to sell their clothing (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010). The in-store theme is grayscale luxury, the music is dance, the fragrance sprayed is men's "Fierce" and customers are welcomed into the store with the tagline "Hey, how's it going?"
Abercrombie & Fitch Co. created a younger sibling with the establishment of their children's store, abercrombie, in July 1998 (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010). Maintaining the same atmosphere and "classic cool" look as Abercrombie and Fitch, abercrombie targets a consumer base ranging from 8 to 16 years of age. The in-store theme is navy luxury, the music is pop, the fragrance sprayed is boy's "Phelps" and customers are welcomed into the store with the tagline "Hey, what's going on?"
In July 2000, a third sister company was launched by Abercrombie & Fitch Co., Hollister Co. (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010). Hollister Co. sells Southern California ("SoCal") inspired clothing at a premium price point slightly lower than that of Abercrombie & Fitch to a market containing teenagers 14 to 16 years old (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010). The atmosphere is "laidback" and beach-like and all clothing is identified by a red seagull logo outlined in white (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010). Today, Hollister Co. is the second most preferred teenage clothing brand (Jaffray, 2008). The in-store theme is a beachhouse in sepia color scheme, the music is rock, the fragrance sprayed is men's "Jake" and customers are welcomed into the store with the tagline "What's up?"
The fourth subsidiary, RUEHL No.925, was established in September 2004 to reach a older, post-graduate consumer base ranging from 22 to 35 years of age (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010). RUEHL No.925 offers the same clothing and store experience as Abercrombie & Fitch with added sophistication and artistic flair inspired by a "New York City lifestyle" (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010). Their clothing is distinguished by a French bulldog and is more upscale and expensive than all other Abercrombie & Fitch brands (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010). The in-store theme is a Greenwich home in a burgundy, red and blue color scheme, the music is dance, the fragrance sprayed is men's "Signature" and customers are welcomed into the store with the tagline "the tagline "Hey, how's it going? Have you checked out Gilly Hicks yet?"
The latest addition to the Abercrombie & Fitch Co. assemblage of companies is their lingerie store, Gilly Hicks, nicknamed the "cheeky cousin of Abercrombie & Fitch" (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010). Inspired by the "free spirit of Sydney, Australia", Gilly Hiks, sells "cute bras and underwear" and other intimate apparel to female consumer of the parent brand over the age of 18 (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010). All clothing is recognized by a koala logo and is sold at a premium price point (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010). The in-store theme is a British colonial-style manor in grey, burgundy and sepia color scheme, the music is slow pop (usually piano-based), the fragrance sprayed is women's "La Perouse" and customers are welcomed into the store with the tagline "Hey, welcome to Gilly Hicks! We're A&F's cheeky cousin."
Another key factor in creating the Abercrombie & Fitch Co. store experience and image is its models. All models are hired on a basis of being "aspirational", that is, customers should walk into one their stores and want to look and dress like the models. In accordance with that strategy, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. depends on a passive customer that is susceptible to conform. For this reason, little information is collected through customer feedback since in most cases the primary objective of purchasing the clothes is not to obtain clothing but to achieve the lifestyle that comes along with wearing the clothing. In addition, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. does not have any forms of formal advertising or promotions (e.g. "Buy one get one free") and therefore, adds value to the product because it is truly a luxury.
However, customer service is still important to the company as their employee handbook states: "Providing amazing customer service should be a top priority to all associates" (A&F Handbook, 2008). In addition, the return policy is very reasonable: all items may be returned at any time, regardless of date of purchase, as long as the items are not worn and the tags and receipt is present for a full refund; or without a receipt, a merchandise credit may be given.
In addition, an online store was created to give the customers the convenience of shopping from home from anywhere in the world. There is a separate online store for each brand that mirrors the five senses of the in-store experience. Sight is demonstrated through pictures of models wearing the clothing, the font used, the layout of the clothing in its picture, the generally dim-lit appearance and the overall organization of the website. Sound on the website is in the form of a playlist that includes all the songs that are played in the store with the option of switching between songs. Smell and touch cannot be incorporated into the website however, all fragrances are available for purchase and the clothing remains to be of the highest quality fabrics. Energy is created in this way and thus customers can have a similar Abercrombie & Fitch Co. experience in the comfort of their home.
It is clear that the customer perspective of the company performs effectively as seen by its 16% average growth that the company has been experiencing over the past five years (Microsoft, 2010).
The Financial Perspective
In spite of its emphasis on qualitative measurements of a firm's success, the balanced scorecard also recognizes the importance of incorporating financial data into overall performance assessment (BSCI, 2007). Abercrombie & Fitch Co., the American "casual luxury" apparel designer and retailer, has experienced a steady increase in sales for the past five years with the exception of the last year (see Figure 6 in Appendix). On average the company's sales have been growing at a rate of about 16% a year for the past 4 years, however sales suffered a 5.6% drop in the year ending January 31st 2009 (see Table 3 in Appendix). It is safe to assume that the drop is a result of the international financial crisis; when consumers have less disposable income they are less likely to purchase premium priced items (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010). Also, last year's income statement included a non-cash $30.6 million "unusual expense" in the form of an impairment of store related assets (see Table 2 in Appendix). The combination of the drop in sales and the additional expenses taken on by the company last year resulted in a $272 million net income, a 42.8% drop from 2007's $475.7 million (see Table 3 in Appendix). In 2008 the company used cash from operations to finance its growth strategy. They opened up 2 new Abercrombie & Fitch store, 66 new Hollister stores, 12 new abercrombie stores, six new RUEHL stores and 11 new Gilly Hicks stores (Abercrombie & Fitchf, 2010). The balance sheet shows a strong Abercrombie & Fitch with approximately $2.8 billion in assets, of which $1.1 billion are current, and only $1.0 billion in liabilities, of which $450 million are current (see Table 2 in Appendix). This results in strong key ratios demonstrating good financial health. These ratios will be discussed further and analyzed with respect to ratios from competitors and average industry standards. Also in the 2008 fiscal year, there was an increase in inventory on hand (due to the drop in sales) as opposed to the decrease in inventory on hand experienced in the fiscal year 2007 (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010). On January 31st 2009 inventory was valued at approximately $372 million, a $39 million 10.5% jump from last year's $333 million (see Table 2 in Appendix). Some analysts might find this statistic worrying, however, it may not be as dangerous as it seems. Firstly, as mentioned earlier this observation is primarily due to a negative change in spending patterns associated with the global financial situation. This is trend experienced by a majority of retailers worldwide and not just Abercrombie & Fitch. In addition, the image that the brands strive to portray is a "timeless and always coolâ€¦" one (A&F Brands, 2010), meaning that the average lifespan of a piece of their attire is longer than that of a company who's image is more current and trendy. Because of this, the small amount of left over inventory should not be a problem to move, as displayed in fiscal year 2006, prior to the onset of the financial crisis, where the company experienced a 22% reduction in inventory (see Table 2 in Appendix).
Here is a broader look at a range of Abercrombie & Fitch's key financials and their implications as to where the company stands in regards to its competitors and the industry. The primarily relevant ratios reported and analyzed are those pertaining to growth, profitability, financial condition and management efficiency.

Looking at each area individually will lead to more accurate conclusions and help identify problem areas and strengths along with providing explanations for certain phenomena.
Sales Growth Ratio (5 year average) - This ratio demonstrates what percentage sales have been increasing (or decreasing) by from year to year, on average for the past 5 years (Business Dictionary, 2010). Abercrombie & Fitch's 16% growth rate is significantly higher than the industry average, at par with American Eagle Outfitters, higher than competitor GAP whose sales have been decreasing, however, significantly lower than Guess?. These results are positive and indicate progress: Abercrombie & Fitch is not the fastest growing of its competitors but sales are growing at a steady sustainable rate.
Gross Margin Ratio (5 year average) - This ratio express gross profit as a percentage of total revenue (Business Dictionary, 2010). For Abercrombie & Fitch this ratio is 66.7% (see Table 1) indicating that goods are marked up approximately 200%, a mark up that is nearly double that of their closest competitor American Eagle Outfitters and nearly four times the industry average.
Net Profit Margin Ratio (5 year average) - This ratio expresses net income (Business Dictionary, 2010). In spite of the outrageously high initial mark up, the 11% (see Table 1) net profit margin are at par with American Eagle Outfitters, slightly higher than guess and nearly double that of the industry.
The trend of a much higher gross margin and a more tempered net profit margin can be interpreted to suggest that although direct costs associated with goods sold may be relatively low, the indirect costs associated with operations are higher and exhaust a larger sum of the revenue from sales.
Debt/Equity Ratio - A measure of a company's financial leverage calculated by dividing total liabilities by stockholders' equity (Business Dictionary, 2010). It shows what portion of equity and debt a company is using to finance its assets. This demonstrates that Abercrombie & Fitch may not have a hard time paying off any long term debts based on the condition of the company at this time. The company's competitors are all in a similar situation and are stronger than an average company in the industry in this regard. This shows that they are more established larger players in the apparel retail industry. This is a strong asset when applying for a long-term loan.
Current Ratio - This is a liquidity ratio that shows how capable a company is of paying off their short-term liabilities (Business Dictionary, 2010). Calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. Higher Current ratio implies that the company is financially healthy and can easily reach its short-term obligations. Abercrombie & Fitch, its competitors and the industry are all comparable and well off in this area.
Quick Ratio - A measure if how easily a company can meet its short-term obligations using only its most liquid assets (e.g. cash) (Business Dictionary, 2010). It is calculated by subtracting inventory from current assets and dividing the result by current liabilities. Basically, this ratio tells us how easily a company can meet its short-term obligations without selling their inventory. Again, Abercrombie & Fitch scores well in this field along with its competitors and the industry.
The company's ability to pay off short term-debts with ease show strong financial condition and can help them secure short term loans and a unsecured line of credit (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010).
Inventory Turnover - The number of times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period of time (Business Dictionary, 2010). Calculated by dividing sales by inventory. Abercrombie & Fitch's number here is 2.5, while all competitors show an inventory turn over of over 4 and the industry's average is 4.4 (see Table 1), more than one and a half times that of Abercrombie & Fitch's. As mentioned earlier, Abercrombie & Fitch's image is vintage, timeless and effortlessly cool. Because of this, the company does not have to change styles as often as some of its competitors and it does not need to participate in extensive promotional activities (like those practiced by its competitors) that can quickly move inventory but can tarnish the brand's 'premium' image.
Revenue Per Employee - This is a productivity and management efficiency ratio it measures sales in relation to number of employees (Business Dictionary, 2010). It is calculated by dividing Total Sales by Total Number of Employees. Abercrombie & Fitch reported sales of $302,395 per employee, significantly higher than that of Gap, $104,799, and Guess?, $189,585, and slightly higher than the industry's, $278,855 (see Table 1)(keeping in mind that Abercrombie & Fitch's mark up to achieve this statistic).
Income Per Employee - This is also a productivity and management efficiency ratio, however is measures net income after tax in relation to number of employees (Business Dictionary, 2010). After all expenses are paid, Abercrombie & Fitch's Net Income per Employee is only $2,120, only a fraction of American Eagle Outfitters' $21,912 and Guess?'s $19,116 and significantly lower than the market's $9,463 (see Table 1).
When Net Income Per Employee is compared to Revenue Per Employee a very large change is observed in regards to where Abercrombie & Fitch stands in the market. It goes from being one of the leaders in Revenue Per Employee to having an extremely low result for Income Per Employee that is approximately 78% lower than the industry average (see Table 1). This again goes to show that relative to other players in the apparel retail industry Abercrombie & Fitch has relatively high overhead costs. Looking at the statements in the appendix we see that Abercrombie & Fitch have general, selling and administrative expenses close to $1.9 billion (for sales of about $3.5 billion (see Table 3 in Appendix)), more than double that of American Eagle Outfitters' (whose sales were approximately $3.0 billion (see Table 4 in Appendix)) and more than triple Guess?'s (whose sales were approximately $2.1 billion (see Table 6 in Appendix)).
In brief conclusion Abercrombie & Fitch's financial condition is sound. All figures reported reflect a strong sustainable business. Figures that suggest otherwise compared to the industry average, such as inventory turnover and yearend January 31st 2009 sales, are justifiable. The high overhead and indirect expenses can be studied and lowered to net increase pre-tax income, however doing so without bringing down the gross margin may result in a higher taxable income.
The Business Process Perspective
Abercrombie & Fitch's business processes can be exemplified through its management processes, operational processes and its supporting processes.  Management processes can be expressed as corporate governance; a collection of policies and laws affecting the way the corporation is administered (BSCI, 2007). Abercrombie & Fitch employee relations criteria states that the company will care for its employees honestly, fairly and with respect (A&F Handbook, 2008).  Happy associates working together in a team prove to be essential elements in the growth and success of the company as a whole. 
All instructions and tasks are assigned by the Abercrombie & Fitch Head Office.  The visual merchandise policy indicates that retail stores cannot sell merchandise on forms, faceouts or other displays because visual teams own these items (A&F Handbook, 2008).  The merchandise is strategically set up to create a certain look, playing a huge role in the stores experience.  The employees of Abercrombie & Fitch are well informed as to the appropriate answers to customer concerns.  For example, when customers complain about either the fragrance smell or the music volume, the proper response is to inform the client that it partakes in the store's experience (A&F Handbook, 2008).  In addition, employees are to politely explain that Head Office controls the music volume and that they can call the Home Office department for further feedback (A&F Handbook, 2008).  Moreover, another policy that Abercrombie & Fitch has is its No Hold Policy.  This is to give all customers an equal chance to purchase the products (A&F Handbook, 2008). In order to help protect and maintain the company's assets, Abercrombie & Fitch has their Loss Prevention Store policies to bestow alertness within its stores (A&F Handbook, 2008).  This policy assists in preserving a safe working environment, maintaining awareness to the area of company shortage and in-turn increase profitability preventing theft both internal and external.  Lastly, there is a Look Policy implemented that affects the model and impact employees, which requires to represent the brand by being properly groomed and natural-looking while portraying an Abercrombie & Fitch style (A&F Manager M. Deffet, personal communication, October 2010).
The operational processes are the primary aspect of the value stream consisting of purchasing and manufacturing.  In 2008, Abercrombie & Fitch purchased merchandise from 210 different suppliers, which are located in 37 different countries (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010).  The corporation's largest supplier is responsible for only 6% of apparel and personal care products and no other factory produces more than 5% of their merchandise (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010).  Consequently, in a scenario of political or financial incidents, this is advantageous as it poses minor disruption for the company.  All of the manufacturers are required to uphold Abercrombie & Fitch's high quality standards in production.  The distribution and merchandise inventory is monitored by two distribution centers that check quality before distributed to the retail stores by primarily one contract carrier (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010).  Abercrombie & Fitch management's goal is to uphold ample merchandise in stock at retail stores.  In order to balance inventory levels and stock turnover, markdowns are implemented to keep their merchandise stylish with current fashion trends (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010). 
Supporting processes assist in contributing to the value stream.  An important process that Abercrombie & Fitch uses is recruitment.  The company has 73,000 part time employees and 10,000 full time employees and is still focusing on recruiting and hiring more (Abercrombie & Fitch, 2010).  The managers at retail stores have a quota indicating the number of people that must be recruited in a given time period (A&F Manager M. Deffet, personal communication, October 2010).  Managers who believe that a customer represents the Abercrombie & Fitch lifestyle will attempt to recruit them for one of the part-time positions and invite them to a group interview held every Tuesday and Friday at 4:00PM (A&F Manager M. Deffet, personal communication, October 2010).  There are three part-time positions: model, impact and overnight.  Models are basically floor sales associates responsible for taglineing, maintaining the sales floor, customer service, cash out and contributing to store experience (A&F Manager M. Deffet, personal communication, October 2010).  A model may also be selected to participate in their in-store marketing campaigns. An impact employee maintains the stockroom, receives shipments and prepares/places it on the sales floor, places sensor tags and marks down older merchandise.  A look policy is required for both the models and impacts (A&F Handbook, 2008). The last part-time position is an overnight employee who works at premium pay and brings the store up to 'standard' by arranging a perfect size order, size stickers, color blocking, and general organization of the store and its components (A&F Manager M. Deffet, personal communication, October 2010).  In-store full-time positions are management only.  This includes the district manager, general manager, store manager, people's manager, overnight manager, stockroom manager and assistant manager (A&F Manager M. Deffet, personal communication, October 2010).

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  BUSINESS SUMMARY  The Company is a specialty retailer who primarily sells its products through store and direct-to-consumer operations, as well as through various wholesale, franchise and licensing arrangements. The Company offers a broad array of apparel products, including knit tops, woven shirts, graphic t-shirts, fleece, sweaters, jeans, woven pants, shorts, outerwear, dresses, intimates and swimwear; and personal care products and accessories for men, women and kids under the Hollister, Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands. The Company has operations in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.  The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. Fiscal years are designated in the consolidated financial statements and notes by the calendar year in which the fiscal year commences. All references herein to "Fiscal 2017" represent the fifty-three week fiscal year that will end on February 3, 2018, and to "Fiscal 2016" represent the fifty-two week fiscal year that ended January 28, 2017.  Due to the seasonal nature of the retail apparel industry, the results of operations for any current period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year. The seasonality of the Company's operations may also lead to significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts.  SUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The table below summarizes the Company's results of operations for the thirteen week periods ended April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016. (in thousands, except change in comparable sales, gross profit rate and per share amounts) April 29, 2017 April 30, 2016 Net sales $ 661,099 $ 685,483 Change in comparable sales(1) (3 )% (4 )% Gross profit rate 60.3 % 62.1 % Operating loss $ (69,941 ) $ (54,911 ) Net loss attributable to A&F $ (61,700 ) $ (39,587 ) Net loss per diluted share attributable to A&F $ (0.91 ) $ (0.59 )  (1) Changes in comparable sales are calculated on a constant currency basis by converting prior year store and online sales at current year exchange rates. For inclusion in this calculation, a store must have been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage must not have been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year.  As of April 29, 2017, the Company had $421.4 million in cash and equivalents and $268.3 million in gross borrowings outstanding under its term loan facility. Net cash used by operating activities was $84.3 million for the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017. The Company also used cash of $32.1 million for capital expenditures and $13.6 million to pay dividends during the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017.  Table of Contents  CURRENT TRENDS AND OUTLOOK  Our results for the first quarter of Fiscal 2017 reflect comparable sales improvement over the prior quarter in a continued challenging, promotional environment. Hollister, our largest brand, delivered an increase in comparable sales. At Abercrombie, sales results were in line with our expectations as we continue to lay the foundation for its revitalization.  While we anticipate the second quarter retail environment to remain promotional and generally challenging, we expect comparable sales trend improvement in the second half of the year, as we gain traction from our strategic investments in marketing, loyalty programs and omnichannel capabilities. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to our cost structure, with a balanced focus between dealing with short-term realities and driving towards our long-term ambition, and remain confident in our strategic direction and our ability to execute on our plans.  For Fiscal 2017, we expect:   Continued adverse impact from foreign currency on sales and operating income.   A gross profit rate down slightly to last year's adjusted non-GAAP rate of 61.0%, with continued pressure in the second quarter.   Operating expense to be down at least 3% from last year's adjusted non-GAAP operating expense of $2.025 billion, with approximately 65% of the full year reduction to occur in the second half of the year.   Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of approximately $4 million.   A weighted average diluted share count of approximately 68 million shares, excluding the effect of potential share buybacks.  For the full year, we expect the effective tax rate to reflect a core tax rate in the low 30s, which remains highly sensitive at lower levels of pre-tax earnings. Additionally, we expect discrete non-cash income tax charges for the full year of approximately $11 million primarily related to a change in share-based compensation accounting standards.  We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million for the full year.  We plan to open approximately seven full-price stores in Fiscal 2017, including six in the U.S. and one in international markets. We also plan to open two new outlet stores. In addition, we anticipate closing approximately 60 stores in the U.S. during the fiscal year through natural lease expirations.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes discussion of certain financial measures under "RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. The Company believes that each of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" are useful to investors as they provide a measure of the Company's operating performance excluding the effect of certain items which the Company believes do not reflect its future operating outlook, and therefore supplements investors' understanding of comparability across periods. Management used these non-GAAP financial measures during the periods presented to assess the Company's performance and to develop expectations for future operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be used supplemental to, not as an alternative to, the Company's GAAP financial results, and may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.  Changes in comparable sales are calculated on a constant currency basis by converting prior year store and online sales at current year exchange rates. For the purpose of this calculation, a store must have been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage must not have been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year.  Table of Contents  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS STORE ACTIVITY Store count and gross square footage by brand for the thirteen weeks ended April 29, 2017 and April 30, 2016, respectively, were as follows: Hollister (1) Abercrombie (2) Total United States International United States International United States International January 28, 2017 398 145 311 44 709 189 New 1 - 2 - 3 - Closed (2 ) - (5 ) (1 ) (7 ) (1 ) April 29, 2017 397 145 308 43 705 188 Gross square feet (in thousands): April 29, 2017 2,717 1,216 2,396 610 5,113 1,826 Hollister (1) Abercrombie (2) Total United States International United States International United States International January 30, 2016 414 139 340 39 754 178 New - 2 1 - 1 2 Closed (3 ) - (7 ) - (10 ) - April 30, 2016 411 141 334 39 745 180 Gross square feet (in thousands): April 30, 2016 2,834 1,195 2,561 619 5,395 1,814  (1) Excludes five international franchise stores as of April 29, 2017, three international franchise stores as of January 28, 2017 and two international franchise stores as of April 30, 2016 and January 30, 2016.  (2) Includes Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands. Excludes three international franchise stores as of April 29, 2017 and one international franchise store as of January 28, 2017, April 30, 2016 and January 30, 2016.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED APRIL 29, 2017 VERSUS THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED APRIL 30, 2016 Net Sales Thirteen Weeks Ended April 29, 2017 April 30, 2016 Change in Change in Comparable Comparable Net Sales Net Sales (in thousands) Net Sales Sales(1) Net Sales Sales(1) $ Change % Change Hollister $ 374,677 3% $ 362,147 -% $ 12,530 3% Abercrombie(2) 286,422 (10)% 323,336 (8)% (36,914 ) (11)% Total net sales $ 661,099 (3)% $ 685,483 (4)% $ (24,384 ) (4)% United States $ 409,068 (3)% $ 425,429 (2)% $ (16,361 ) (4)% International 252,031 (2)% 260,054 (7)% (8,023 ) (3)% Total net sales $ 661,099 (3)% $ 685,483 (4)% $ (24,384 ) (4)%  (1) Changes in comparable sales are calculated on a constant currency basis by converting prior year store and online sales at current year exchange rates. For inclusion in this calculation, a store must have been open as the same brand at least one year and its square footage must not have been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year.  (2) Includes Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands.  For the first quarter of Fiscal 2017, net sales decreased 4% as compared to the first quarter of Fiscal 2016, primarily attributable to a 3% decrease in comparable sales, driven by the Abercrombie brand.  Table of Contents  Cost of Sales, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization   Thirteen Weeks Ended April 29, 2017 April 30, 2016 (in thousands) % of Net Sales % of Net Sales Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization $ 262,174 39.7% $ 259,762 37.9% Gross profit $ 398,925 60.3% $ 425,721 62.1%  For the first quarter of Fiscal 2017, cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of net sales increased by approximately 180 basis points as compared to the first quarter of Fiscal 2016, primarily due to lower average unit retail, which includes the adverse effects from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately 50 basis points, partially offset by lower average unit cost.  Stores and Distribution Expense Thirteen Weeks Ended April 29, 2017 April 30, 2016 (in thousands) % of Net Sales % of Net Sales Stores and distribution expense $ 359,929 54.4% $ 369,118 53.8%  For the first quarter of Fiscal 2017, stores and distribution expense as a percentage of net sales increased by approximately 60 basis points as compared to the first quarter of Fiscal 2016, primarily due to the deleveraging effect from negative comparable sales and higher direct-to-consumer expense, partially offset by expense reduction efforts.  For the first quarter of Fiscal 2017, shipping and handling costs, including costs incurred to store, move and prepare product for shipment and costs incurred to physically move product to the customer, associated with direct-to-consumer operations were $29.7 million as compared to $22.8 million for the first quarter of Fiscal 2016.  For the first quarter of Fiscal 2017, handling costs, including costs incurred to store, move and prepare product for shipment to stores, were $8.1 million as compared to $10.4 million for the first quarter of Fiscal 2016.  Shipping and handling costs are included in stores and distribution expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.

Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) is an American retailer that focuses on upscale casual wear for young consumers, its headquarters are in New Albany, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus.[2] The company operates two other offshoot brands: Abercrombie Kids & Hollister Co. [2] The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands.[citation needed]
Once known for its sexy ad campaigns, the company has toned down its imagery and no longer displays nearly nude models in their advertisements. According to Chairman Arthur Martinez, Abercrombie and Fitch is now targeting an older consumer, from ages 18–25. These changes provide the hopes that the audience will see the company is evolving along with its consumers, and boost sales.[3]
Abercrombie & Fitch is notable for using "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] Its main competitors are Aéropostale and American Eagle Outfitters. Its younger subsidiary, Abercrombie Kids, competes with Aéropostale's P.S., and American Eagle Outfitters's 77kids.

History[edit]
Main article: History of Abercrombie & Fitch




Cover of A&F catalog from 1909.


Founded in 1892 in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, by David T. Abercrombie and Ezra Fitch, Abercrombie & Fitch was an elite outfitter of sporting and excursion goods, particularly noted for its expensive shotguns, fishing rods, fishing boats, and tents.[5] In 1976, Abercrombie & Fitch filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, finally closing its flagship store at Madison Avenue and East 45th Street in 1977.[6]
Shortly thereafter the name was revived in 1978; Oshman's Sporting Goods, a Houston-based chain owned by Jake Oshman,[7] bought the defunct firm's name and mailing list for $1.5 million[8] ($5.2 million in 2013 dollars).[9] Oshman's relaunched A&F as a mail-order retailer specializing in hunting wear and novelty items. It also opened shops in Beverly Hills, Dallas, and (by the mid-1980s) New York City. Finally, in 1988, Oshman's sold the company name and operations to The Limited, a clothing-chain operator based in Columbus, Ohio.[10] Abercrombie & Fitch gradually shifted its focus to young adults, first as a subsidiary of Limited Brands and then as a separate, publicly traded company; and grew to become one of the largest apparel firms in the United States.[11]
Since 1997, the company has consistently kept a high-profile in the public eye, due to its advertising, its philanthropy, and its involvement in legal conflicts over branding, clothing style and employment practices. In the first decade of the 21st century, the Great Recession battered the company's business as teenagers looked to lower-priced fast fashion brands like H&M and Forever 21 for fashion. Abercrombie & Fitch's stock price dropped from an all-time high of $84.23 in October 2007 to a low of $14.64 in November 2008.[12] The company worked to overhaul its merchandise mix and cut underperforming stores,[13] but lackluster performance has continued. Longtime CEO Michael Jeffries stepped down in December 2014, after 22 years with the company.[14]




Abercrombie & Fitch store in New York City


To combat heavy competition from fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21 and H&M, Abercrombie & Fitch announced key changes to change its image. It aims to reduce emphasis on sexualized advertising and focus more on customer service & diversity. Among the changes announced are eliminating sexualized advertising, no longer having shirtless models at new store openings, and eliminating sexualized pictures and advertising on bags, gift cards, and in stores. They are changing the name of store employees from "models" to "brand representatives", and will allow a more individualistic dress code. "Brand representatives" will also focus more on customer service by asking customers for help in stores, as opposed to past policies of aloofness. They also aim to promote more diversity among store employees and executives as well. A&F is signaling it will be implementing changes quickly.[4]
As of May 2015, the changes were already very apparent in stores. All "permanent marketing" images at the cash wrap and fitting rooms have been removed. Also, store models are no longer dressed in Abercrombie clothes.[4]

As of December 9, 2014[update], following the retirement of Mike Jeffries the following were key corporate officials:[15]

Arthur Martinez – Executive Chairman
Diane Chang – Executive Vice President of Sourcing
Leslee K. Herro – Executive Vice President of Planning and Allocation
Ronald A. Robins, Jr. – Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel
Jonathan Ramsden – Chief Operating Officer
Amy Zehrer – Senior Vice President of Stores
Christos Angelides – President of Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands
Fran Horowitz – President of Hollister brand

In April 2017, the company was described by Standard & Poor's as having a market value of $650,000,000 and about $420,000,000 cash on hand. In May 2017, the company was in talks to sell itself. Potential buyers included Express, American Eagle Outfitters and Cerberus Capital Management. Negotiations failed by early July. As a result of the news, on 10 July the firm's stock fell 21%.[16]

Headquarters[edit]
The company's headquarters, referred to by the company as "The Home Office", is located outside of Columbus in New Albany, Ohio.[17] The Home Office is designed as a campus of sorts, and is referred to as such. The company's merchandise-distribution centers (1 million square feet) are located exclusively on campus to help ensure brand protection.[17] Also on campus are mock-up stores, one for each of the company's brands, where store layout, merchandise and atmosphere are determined.[17] In January 2017, the company announced they would be cutting 150 jobs at their corporate headquarters.[18]
The company also has a European office in Mendrisio, Switzerland.[19][20]
Marketing, advertising and brand identity[edit]




The trademark slogan, Casual Luxury.


A&F is known for its racy marketing photography by Bruce Weber.[21] It is rendered to grayscale and features outdoor settings, usually with semi-nude males and females for an increased tone of sexuality. A&F casts only store employees for marketing campaigns. Casting directors from the home office travel to key A&F regional stores in the United States and to London to hold "casting calls" for employees aspiring to become the next "A&F New Face".[22][dead link] The company promotes its casting sessions, models, and photo shoots in the "A&F Casting" feature online at abercrombie.com. The website also provides a gallery of current photography. Framed copies at A&F stores will sometimes name the model and store.
The Abercrombie & Fitch brand image is heavily promoted as an international near-luxury lifestyle concept.[23] The company began cultivating an upscale image after the 2005 opening of its Fifth Avenue flagship store alongside Prada and other upscale retailers.[24] Having for years used high-grade materials in the construction of its merchandise, and pricing them at "near-luxury" levels, A&F introduced the trademark Casual Luxury[24] as a fictional dictionary term with multiple definitions such as "[using] the finest cashmere, pima cottons, and highest quality leather to create the ultimate in casual, body conscious clothing,"[25] and "implementing and/or incorporating time honored machinery ...to produce the most exclusive denim..."[25] This upscale image has allowed A&F to open stores in international high-end locations and further promote the image by pricing its merchandise at almost double the American prices.
Overall, CEO Jeffries calls the A&F image a "movie" because of the "fantasy" that plays out instore.[26] Even some of the clothing is given "story": "You buy into the emotional experience of a movie," Jeffries explains, "And that's what we're creating. Here I am walking into a movie, and I say, 'What's going to be [at] the box office today?'"[26]
Following a dismal earnings announcement on August 2014,[27] the company decided to drop its logo-branded apparel line, arguing that this element of its brand does not resonate with its target market. The company is now shifting its marketing strategy to trendier outfits and faster production processes. Some experts argue the retailer's focus on exclusivity has caused it to fall out of fashion with its target market.[28]




Abercrombie & Fitch models


Store staff[edit]
The company is noted for its use of "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] The models were required to buy and wear A&F clothing, but following a company settlement with California state labor regulators may now wear any no-logo clothing as long as it corresponds with the season and style of the brand. The California settlement also provided $2.2 million to reimburse former employees for their forced purchases of company-branded clothing.[29] An "Impact Team" was created in 2004 to control merchandise within each store and maintain company standards. Bigger and higher volume stores have a "Full Time Stock" who trains Impact associates, processes shipment, maintains stock room standards, and can act as a manager if the store is short on management staffing. The store manager and assistant managers are responsible for forms, lighting, photo marketing, fragrance presentations and to ensure models comply with the "look policy".[30]
Products[edit]

The signature A&F fragrance, FIERCE.


Women's Wear Daily calls Abercrombie & Fitch clothing classically "neo-preppy", with an "edgy tone and imagery".[31] The company's fashions have a reputation for luxury, with the majority of designs trend-driven. There is heavy promotion of "Premium Jeans". In early 2010, the company introduced a leather handbag collection inspired by designs from Ruehl.
Its prices are recognized as the highest in the youth-clothing industry.[32] Internationally, prices are almost double those in its American stores. Retail analyst Chris Boring warns that the company's brands are a "little more susceptible" should recession hit, because their specialties are premium-priced goods rather than necessities.[33] Indeed, as the late-2000s recession continues, A&F has noticeably suffered financially for its refusal to lower prices or offer discounts. A&F argues that doing so would "cheapen" its near-luxury image. Analyst Bruce Watson warns that A&F risks finding itself transformed into "a cautionary tale of a store that was left by the wayside when it declined to change with the times".[32] A&F's year-to-year revenue, a key indicator of a retailer's health, rose 13% in September 2010, aided by strong international sales.[34]
Abercrombie & Fitch has carried men's fragrances Fierce, Colden, and has re-branded the original cologne Woods (Christmas Floorset 2010). Women's fragrances have included 8, Perfume 41, Wakely, and Perfume #1. Fierce and 8 are the most heavily marketed fragrances, as they are the signature scents of the brand overall.[35]
The company also offers the Abercrombie & Fitch Credit Card, issued by the World Financial Network Bank.[36]
Brand protection[edit]
Because of extensive counterfeiting of Abercrombie & Fitch goods, in 2006 the company launched a brand protection program to combat the problem worldwide (focusing more on China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea) by working with legal forces globally.[37] The program is headed by a former FBI Supervisory Special Agent who was part of the FBI's Intellectual Property Rights program, and covers all A&F brands. A&F says that the program "will improve current practices and strategies by focusing on eliminating the supply of illicit Abercrombie & Fitch products."[37]
In August 2011, A&F offered Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino and other cast members of the MTV reality show Jersey Shore a "substantial payment" if they stopped wearing Abercrombie-branded clothes, stating "We are deeply concerned that Mr. Sorrentino's association with our brand could cause significant damage to our image."[38] In November 2011, Sorrentino filed a lawsuit against A&F after the company allegedly violated his copyrights in making shirts that said "The Fitchuation" and "GTL...You Know The Deal."[39]
Stores[edit]

The Modern Canoe store located at the Mall at Millenia in Orlando, Florida with wooden louvers (featuring the Spring Break 2007 marketing campaign picture).


The exterior of the contemporary store design features white molding and formerly black louvers. Starting in mid-2013 and concluding early 2014, the louvers were removed from all locations except flagship stores. The company stated that the louvers were removed in an effort to eliminate the exclusive atmosphere from stores and to experiment with window marketing.[40] The currently featured marketing image directly faces the entrance. The interior is lit with dim ceiling lights and spot lighting. Electronic dance music meant to create an upbeat atmosphere may be played at sound levels as high as 90 decibels, exceeding the corporate policy of 84 decibels and comparable to heavy construction machinery and harmful to the ears.[41]
The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands. The A&F brand has 278[42] locations in the United States, five in Canada (two in Alberta, two in Ontario and one in British Columbia). The company currently operates 25 full-line stores and four outlet stores across sixteen countries.
International expansion[edit]




The Abercrombie & Fitch flagship store in Ginza, Tokyo, Japan – the first one in Asia


The Abercrombie & Fitch brand is believed to have reached its maximum growth potential in the American market. International expansion began in 2005, with the long-term goal of opening flagships for A&F (and eventually all its brands), in high-profile locations worldwide "at a deliberate pace".[43][44] After initially opening at a deliberately slow pace, the company began to accelerate international expansion for its namesake and its Hollister Co. brand in 2012.[45][46]
The first non-U.S. Abercrombie & Fitch stores opened in Toronto and Edmonton in 2005, and then expanded to other major cities in Canada. The company first entered the European market in 2007 with the opening of its flagship London store at 7 Burlington Gardens, Savile Row.[47] Since then, the company has opened stores in Milan, Copenhagen, Paris, Madrid, Brussels Dublin and other major cities in Europe, including six stores in Germany. The company opened its first Asian A&F flagship store in Tokyo in 2009,[48] followed by Fukuoka, Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul.[49] The company would primarily focus on the Chinese and Japanese markets where luxury consumption is high.[50] The company has also entered a franchise agreement with Grupo AXO to open retail stores in Mexico by 2015.[51] The company entered the Middle Eastern market in 2015 with the opening of its flagship store in Kuwait.[52] Since then the company has opened locations in Dubai and plans to expand deeper into the Middle East with stores in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.[53]
Brands[edit]
Abercrombie & Fitch has three concept brands apart from its namesake; they are referred to as subsidiaries, but are operated as divisions under the A&F umbrella.

Abercrombie Kids
Prep-school by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed as "classic cool" for kids 7 through 14,[2] this is the children's version of Abercrombie & Fitch.


Hollister Co.
Southern California by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "SoCal" for teenagers 14 through 18,[2] with significantly lower prices than its parent brand.


Gilly Hicks
The cheeky cousin of Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "Down Under" Sydney, it offered underwear and loungewear for women 18 and up.[55] All stores closed in 2015.[56]


Ruehl No.925
Post-Grad by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after a fictional Greenwich Village heritage, offered clothes for 22 through 35 post-grads. Closed in 2010.[57]

Humanitarian projects[edit]
In recent years, Abercrombie & Fitch has engaged in philanthropic and humanitarian projects. In January 2010, the company launched the "A&F Cares" feature on its website to inform the public about its efforts in the fields of diversity, inclusion, human rights, philanthropy, and sustainability.[58]
The A&F Challenge is an annual fundraising event held on the home office campus in New Albany that features running, walking, biking, entertainment, and food. The funds raised go to the Ohio State University Medical Center's Program for Health, which focuses on "women's cancers and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease."[59]
In 2007, Abercrombie & Fitch partnered with the National Society of High School Scholars at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia to offer US$75,000 scholarships to NSHSS members.[60]
Legal issues[edit]
The company has been involved in legal conflicts over its employment practices, treatment of customers, and clothing styles.
Employment practices[edit]
See also: Employment Practices Liability
In a 2004 lawsuit González v. Abercrombie & Fitch, the company was accused of discriminating against African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women by preferentially offering floor sales positions (called Brand Representatives or Models) and store management positions to Caucasian males.[61] The company agreed to a settlement of the class-action suit, which required the company to (1) pay $40 million to African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women who applied and were not hired or worked in certain store positions, (2) revise its hiring, performance measurement, and promotion policies, (3) revise its internal complaint procedures, (4) appoint a Vice President of Diversity, (5) hire 25 recruiters to seek out minority applicants, (6) discontinue the practice of recruiting employees at primarily white fraternities and sororities, (7) include more minorities in marketing materials, (8) report to a neutral court-appointed monitor twice per year regarding its progress in those areas, and (9) report to the court once per year.[62][63][64]
In June 2009, British law student Riam Dean, who had worked at A&F's flagship store in London's Savile Row, took the company to an employment tribunal. Dean, who was born without a left forearm, claimed that although she was initially given special permission to wear clothing that covered her prosthetic limb, she was soon told that her appearance breached the company's "Look Policy" and sent to work in the stock room, out of sight of customers. Dean sued the company for disability discrimination, and sought up to £20,000 in damages.[65] In August 2009, the tribunal ruled the 22-year-old was wrongfully dismissed and unlawfully harassed. She was awarded £8,013 for loss of earnings and wrongful dismissal.[66][67]
In a lawsuit filed in September 2009, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores,[68] in U.S. District Court by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 17-year-old Samantha Elauf said she applied, in June 2008, for a sales position at the Abercrombie Kids store in the Woodland Hills Mall, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The teen, who wears a hijab in accordance with her religious beliefs, claims the manager told her the headscarf violates the store's "Look Policy".[69] The United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on February 25, 2015,[70] and ruled 8-1 on June 1, 2015 against the company.[71]
In 2010, a Muslim woman working at a Hollister store in San Mateo, California, was fired. Before being dismissed, Hani Khan had refused Abercrombie & Fitch's human-resources representative's demand that she remove her hijab. The representative reportedly stated that the headscarf, which Khan wears for religious reasons, violated the company's "Look Policy". The civil liberties group Council on American-Islamic Relations has stated that the dismissal is a violation of nondiscrimination laws, and filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.[72]
In 2011, the Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism started an investigation into A&F's hiring and remuneration policies. The firm was suspected of only hiring personnel under 25 years old, making heavy demands on the physical appearance of its staff and rewarding a premium to male models that work shirtless.[73]
Customer issues[edit]
In 2009, the company was fined more than $115,000 by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights for refusing to let a teenage girl help her sister, who has autism, try on clothes in a fitting room. The amount of the fine reflected "pushback" by the company according to Michael K. Browne, the legal affairs manager of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.[74]
A 16-year-old is suing the company after discovering that she was being videotaped in an A&F changing room by an employee, Kenneth Applegate II. Applegate denied the claim, but co-workers discovered his camera days later with the video on it.[75]
In 2010, a customer filed a class action relating to a 2009 holiday gift card promotion. The lawsuit alleges that the gift cards said "No Expiration Date" but Abercrombie voided and expired the gift cards in early 2010. In 2012, a judge certified a nationwide class in the case. In May 2013, Class Notice went out to potential class members.[76]
Lawsuits against other parties[edit]
In 2002, the company filed a lawsuit against American Eagle Outfitters, claiming that American Eagle copied A&F garment designs, among other things. The lawsuit was based on a trade-dress claim, stating that American Eagle had very closely mimicked A&F's products' visual appearance and packaging. Specifically, A&F claimed that American Eagle copied particular articles of clothing, in-store displays and advertisements, and even the A&F product catalog. Despite the admission that American Eagle might have utilized very similar materials, designs, in-store displays, symbols, color combinations, and patterns as A&F, the court ruled that there was not an excessive level of similarity to confuse potential customers, and therefore the court ruled in favor of American Eagle.[77]
On October 18, 1999, Abercrombie & Fitch had a lawsuit about making false and misleading statements concerning its growth while knowing the actual growth was less than Wall Street expectations,[78] and paid $6,050,000 for settlement.
Controversy and criticism[edit]
Since its re-establishment in 1988, Abercrombie & Fitch has faced numerous accusations regarding its employment practices, merchandise, and advertising campaigns which have been described as sexually explicit and racist.[21][79]
Advertising[edit]
The company has received criticism over its provocative advertising.[80] The company has been accused of promoting the sexualization of pre-teen girls, for example by marketing thongs to 10-year-olds and padded bikini tops to 7-year-olds.[81]
Employment and labor practices[edit]
Lawsuits have been filed against the company due to alleged discriminatory employment practices. In 2004, in Gonzalez v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores (see "Legal issues" and "Controversy and Criticism" below), the company was sued for giving desirable positions to white applicants, to the exclusion of minorities.[62][82]
In November 2009, Abercrombie & Fitch was added to the "Sweatshop Hall of Shame 2010" by the worker advocacy group International Labor Rights Forum.[83]
A&F Quarterly[edit]
Main article: A&F Quarterly
Conservative and religious groups called for boycotts of the original American publication of A&F Quarterly (published from 1997 to 2003) for its sexually explicit nature.[84] The magazine contained nude photography by Bruce Weber, articles about sex, and recipes for alcoholic beverages. Also acting as a catalog, the Quarterly displayed the brand's merchandise with information and prices. Advertisements for the A&F Quarterly appeared in Interview, Out, Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair.[85]
Despite a company policy restricting sale of the publication to minors, critics charged that the publication was readily sold to minors. In 2003, an array of religious organizations, women's rights activists, and Asian American groups organized boycotts and protests over the publication, and the "Christmas Edition" of the catalog was removed from stores.[86] Although Jeffries said he chose to discontinue the catalog, because "Frankly, [he] was getting sick of the old one; it was getting boring," on June 17, 2010, the company made the announcement, "The Return of the A&F Quarterly" and invited email subscribers to reserve their $10 copy for a July 17, 2010, in-store release date.[87]
Product criticism[edit]
In 2002, A&F sold a shirt that featured the slogan "Wong Brothers Laundry Service – Two Wongs Can Make It White" with smiling figures in conical Asian hats, a depiction of early Chinese immigrants. The company discontinued the designs and apologized after a boycott started by an Asian American student group at Stanford University.[88] That same year, abercrombie kids removed a line of thong underwear sold for girls in pre-teen children's sizes after parents mounted nationwide storefront protests. The underwear included phrases like "Eye Candy" and "Wink Wink" printed on the front.[89]
More T-shirt controversies occurred in 2004. The first incident involved a shirt featuring the phrase, "It's All Relative in West Virginia," a jab at alleged incestuous relationships in rural America. West Virginia Governor Bob Wise spoke out against the company for depicting "an unfounded, negative stereotype of West Virginia", but the shirts were not removed.[90] Later, another T-shirt that said "L is for Loser" next to a picture of a male gymnast on the rings gathered publicity. The company stopped selling the shirt in October 2004 after USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi announced a boycott of A&F for mocking the sport.[91]
In 2005, the Women and Girls Foundation of Southwest Pennsylvania launched a "Girlcott" of the store to protest the sale of T-shirts displaying sexist messages such as "Who needs brains when you have these?", "Available for parties," and "I had a nightmare I was a brunette." The campaign received national coverage on The Today Show, and the company pulled the shirts from stores on November 5, 2005.[92] Five days after this media coverage, A&F pulled two of the shirts from its shelves, released an apology to girls for producing the T-shirts, and agreed to have corporate executives meet with the "Girlcott" girls at the company's headquarters.[93]
Bob Jones University, a non-denominational Protestant university located in Greenville, South Carolina, and its affiliated pre-collegiate schools, along with other Christian schools, have prohibited A&F and Hollister clothing from being "worn, carried, or displayed" on its campuses because of "an unusual degree of antagonism to the name of Christ and an unusual display of wickedness" in the company's promotions.[94]
After A&F raised its price points in 2004, its products have been described as overpriced.[87] After the company opened its flagship store in London, England and Paris, France, the brand was criticized in the United Kingdom and France because the merchandise that was offered to the customers cost double (or a direct $/£ - $/€ swap) compared to prices found in the U.S.[95]
A T-shirt controversy arose again over A&F's Back-to-School 2009 collection of "humor tees".[96] One shirt proclaims "Show the twins" above a picture of a young woman with her blouse open to two men. Two other shirts state "Female streaking encouraged" and "Female Students Wanted for Sexual Research".[96] The American Family Association disapproved of the influence of the "sex-as-recreation" lifestyle shirts, and asked the brand to remove its "sexualized shirts" from display.[96]
Renaming of trauma center[edit]
In 2008, Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio agreed to rename its emergency room to the Abercrombie & Fitch Emergency Department and Trauma Center in exchange for a $10 million donation.[97] A letter written by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, signed by over 100 doctors and children's advocacy groups, argued against the renaming, for the "company's appalling history of targeting children with sexualized marketing and clothing."[98]
Remembrance poppy prohibition in the UK[edit]
In November 2010, the Southampton, England, A&F store prevented 18-year-old Harriet Phipps from wearing a remembrance poppy, which is worn as part of the Remembrance Day commemorations in the United Kingdom and Canada every November. The official A&F reason for the refusal was reported to be that the poppy is not considered part of the corporate approved uniform, and is therefore prohibited.[99] The ban drew criticisms, and on November 8 the company posted on its Facebook page the following statement: "As an American company that has been around since 1892, we appreciate the sacrifices of the British and American servicemen/women in the World Wars and in military conflicts that continue today. Our company policy is to allow associates to wear a poppy as a token of this appreciation on Remembrance Day. Going forward, ...we will revisit this policy to the days/weeks leading up to Remembrance Day."
Abercrombie Kids shop on Savile Row[edit]
In 2012, A&F announced plans that it would open its Abercrombie Kids shop at No. 3 on Savile Row, next door to Gieves & Hawkes.[100] The plans drew criticism and opposition from the tailors of the Row, who were already unhappy about the presence of the main A&F store on Burlington Gardens at the end of the Row to begin with, which eventually led to a protest organized by The Chap magazine on April 23, 2012.[101][102] During the consultation period, objections were lodged to Westminster City Council and in February 2013 the Council rejected many of A&F's proposals for the store, and branded the entire plans "utterly unacceptable."[103][104] A&F appealed, managed to overcome the obstacles and opened the store in September 2014.[105] The following year, A&F was subject to nearly £16,000 in fines and legal costs when it was ruled that changes it had made to the Grade II-listed building were illegal.[106]
Jeffries' 2006 target demographic quote[edit]
In 2013, a 2006 Salon interview with the CEO Mike Jeffries went viral and caused widespread outcry over Abercrombie's marketing practices.[107][108][109] The comments made by Mike Jeffries, stating that his brand is only suitable for "the good-looking, cool kids," and that there are people who do not belong in his clothes – namely overweight people, came under fire.[110][111]

That's why we hire good-looking people in our stores. Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don't market to anyone other than that. ... In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids. Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.[112]

These quotes, which were the basis for the article's "youth, sex and casual superiority" headline, went largely unnoticed when the article was published in 2006, until they resurfaced in May 2013 after former Jenny Craig weight-loss spokesperson Kirstie Alley brought them up in an Entertainment Tonight interview.[113] Prominent talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres also later spoke out against the company.[114][115] As the article gained momentum via social media, the company's official Facebook site was bombarded by comments and posts against this strategy.[116]
Jeffries issued an official statement on May 17, 2013, regarding the news articles, saying, "I want to address some of my comments that have been circulating from a 2006 interview. While I believe this 7-year-old, resurrected quote has been taken out of context, I sincerely regret that my choice of words was interpreted in a manner that has caused offense." He also stated, "We are completely opposed to any discrimination, bullying, derogatory characterizations or other anti-social behavior based on race, gender, body type or other individual characteristics."[117]

            A judge has given final approval to a settlement in a class action lawsuit against Abercrombie & Fitch relating to $25 hard copy promotional gift cards that stated "No expiration date" on the cards. Abercrombie & Fitch, which denies any wrongdoing, has restored 70% of the original remaining value on those promotional gift cards, which Abercrombie & Fitch issued as part of a 2009 winter holiday promotion and a 2010 spring promotion and later voided. The restored value on the cards may be redeemed at any store of the brand that issued the card (or, in the case of Gilly Hicks, at Hollister) until October 18, 2017.

Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) is an American retailer that focuses on upscale casual wear for young consumers, its headquarters are in New Albany, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus.[2] The company operates two other offshoot brands: Abercrombie Kids & Hollister Co. [2] The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands.[citation needed]
Once known for its sexy ad campaigns, the company has toned down its imagery and no longer displays nearly nude models in their advertisements. According to Chairman Arthur Martinez, Abercrombie and Fitch is now targeting an older consumer, from ages 18–25. These changes provide the hopes that the audience will see the company is evolving along with its consumers, and boost sales.[3]
Abercrombie & Fitch is notable for using "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] Its main competitors are Aéropostale and American Eagle Outfitters. Its younger subsidiary, Abercrombie Kids, competes with Aéropostale's P.S., and American Eagle Outfitters's 77kids.

History[edit]
Main article: History of Abercrombie & Fitch




Cover of A&F catalog from 1909.


Founded in 1892 in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, by David T. Abercrombie and Ezra Fitch, Abercrombie & Fitch was an elite outfitter of sporting and excursion goods, particularly noted for its expensive shotguns, fishing rods, fishing boats, and tents.[5] In 1976, Abercrombie & Fitch filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, finally closing its flagship store at Madison Avenue and East 45th Street in 1977.[6]
Shortly thereafter the name was revived in 1978; Oshman's Sporting Goods, a Houston-based chain owned by Jake Oshman,[7] bought the defunct firm's name and mailing list for $1.5 million[8] ($5.2 million in 2013 dollars).[9] Oshman's relaunched A&F as a mail-order retailer specializing in hunting wear and novelty items. It also opened shops in Beverly Hills, Dallas, and (by the mid-1980s) New York City. Finally, in 1988, Oshman's sold the company name and operations to The Limited, a clothing-chain operator based in Columbus, Ohio.[10] Abercrombie & Fitch gradually shifted its focus to young adults, first as a subsidiary of Limited Brands and then as a separate, publicly traded company; and grew to become one of the largest apparel firms in the United States.[11]
Since 1997, the company has consistently kept a high-profile in the public eye, due to its advertising, its philanthropy, and its involvement in legal conflicts over branding, clothing style and employment practices. In the first decade of the 21st century, the Great Recession battered the company's business as teenagers looked to lower-priced fast fashion brands like H&M and Forever 21 for fashion. Abercrombie & Fitch's stock price dropped from an all-time high of $84.23 in October 2007 to a low of $14.64 in November 2008.[12] The company worked to overhaul its merchandise mix and cut underperforming stores,[13] but lackluster performance has continued. Longtime CEO Michael Jeffries stepped down in December 2014, after 22 years with the company.[14]




Abercrombie & Fitch store in New York City


To combat heavy competition from fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21 and H&M, Abercrombie & Fitch announced key changes to change its image. It aims to reduce emphasis on sexualized advertising and focus more on customer service & diversity. Among the changes announced are eliminating sexualized advertising, no longer having shirtless models at new store openings, and eliminating sexualized pictures and advertising on bags, gift cards, and in stores. They are changing the name of store employees from "models" to "brand representatives", and will allow a more individualistic dress code. "Brand representatives" will also focus more on customer service by asking customers for help in stores, as opposed to past policies of aloofness. They also aim to promote more diversity among store employees and executives as well. A&F is signaling it will be implementing changes quickly.[4]
As of May 2015, the changes were already very apparent in stores. All "permanent marketing" images at the cash wrap and fitting rooms have been removed. Also, store models are no longer dressed in Abercrombie clothes.[4]

As of December 9, 2014[update], following the retirement of Mike Jeffries the following were key corporate officials:[15]

Arthur Martinez – Executive Chairman
Diane Chang – Executive Vice President of Sourcing
Leslee K. Herro – Executive Vice President of Planning and Allocation
Ronald A. Robins, Jr. – Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel
Jonathan Ramsden – Chief Operating Officer
Amy Zehrer – Senior Vice President of Stores
Christos Angelides – President of Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands
Fran Horowitz – President of Hollister brand

In April 2017, the company was described by Standard & Poor's as having a market value of $650,000,000 and about $420,000,000 cash on hand. In May 2017, the company was in talks to sell itself. Potential buyers included Express, American Eagle Outfitters and Cerberus Capital Management. Negotiations failed by early July. As a result of the news, on 10 July the firm's stock fell 21%.[16]

Headquarters[edit]
The company's headquarters, referred to by the company as "The Home Office", is located outside of Columbus in New Albany, Ohio.[17] The Home Office is designed as a campus of sorts, and is referred to as such. The company's merchandise-distribution centers (1 million square feet) are located exclusively on campus to help ensure brand protection.[17] Also on campus are mock-up stores, one for each of the company's brands, where store layout, merchandise and atmosphere are determined.[17] In January 2017, the company announced they would be cutting 150 jobs at their corporate headquarters.[18]
The company also has a European office in Mendrisio, Switzerland.[19][20]
Marketing, advertising and brand identity[edit]




The trademark slogan, Casual Luxury.


A&F is known for its racy marketing photography by Bruce Weber.[21] It is rendered to grayscale and features outdoor settings, usually with semi-nude males and females for an increased tone of sexuality. A&F casts only store employees for marketing campaigns. Casting directors from the home office travel to key A&F regional stores in the United States and to London to hold "casting calls" for employees aspiring to become the next "A&F New Face".[22][dead link] The company promotes its casting sessions, models, and photo shoots in the "A&F Casting" feature online at abercrombie.com. The website also provides a gallery of current photography. Framed copies at A&F stores will sometimes name the model and store.
The Abercrombie & Fitch brand image is heavily promoted as an international near-luxury lifestyle concept.[23] The company began cultivating an upscale image after the 2005 opening of its Fifth Avenue flagship store alongside Prada and other upscale retailers.[24] Having for years used high-grade materials in the construction of its merchandise, and pricing them at "near-luxury" levels, A&F introduced the trademark Casual Luxury[24] as a fictional dictionary term with multiple definitions such as "[using] the finest cashmere, pima cottons, and highest quality leather to create the ultimate in casual, body conscious clothing,"[25] and "implementing and/or incorporating time honored machinery ...to produce the most exclusive denim..."[25] This upscale image has allowed A&F to open stores in international high-end locations and further promote the image by pricing its merchandise at almost double the American prices.
Overall, CEO Jeffries calls the A&F image a "movie" because of the "fantasy" that plays out instore.[26] Even some of the clothing is given "story": "You buy into the emotional experience of a movie," Jeffries explains, "And that's what we're creating. Here I am walking into a movie, and I say, 'What's going to be [at] the box office today?'"[26]
Following a dismal earnings announcement on August 2014,[27] the company decided to drop its logo-branded apparel line, arguing that this element of its brand does not resonate with its target market. The company is now shifting its marketing strategy to trendier outfits and faster production processes. Some experts argue the retailer's focus on exclusivity has caused it to fall out of fashion with its target market.[28]




Abercrombie & Fitch models


Store staff[edit]
The company is noted for its use of "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] The models were required to buy and wear A&F clothing, but following a company settlement with California state labor regulators may now wear any no-logo clothing as long as it corresponds with the season and style of the brand. The California settlement also provided $2.2 million to reimburse former employees for their forced purchases of company-branded clothing.[29] An "Impact Team" was created in 2004 to control merchandise within each store and maintain company standards. Bigger and higher volume stores have a "Full Time Stock" who trains Impact associates, processes shipment, maintains stock room standards, and can act as a manager if the store is short on management staffing. The store manager and assistant managers are responsible for forms, lighting, photo marketing, fragrance presentations and to ensure models comply with the "look policy".[30]
Products[edit]

Women's Wear Daily calls Abercrombie & Fitch clothing classically "neo-preppy", with an "edgy tone and imagery".[31] The company's fashions have a reputation for luxury, with the majority of designs trend-driven. There is heavy promotion of "Premium Jeans". In early 2010, the company introduced a leather handbag collection inspired by designs from Ruehl.
Its prices are recognized as the highest in the youth-clothing industry.[32] Internationally, prices are almost double those in its American stores. Retail analyst Chris Boring warns that the company's brands are a "little more susceptible" should recession hit, because their specialties are premium-priced goods rather than necessities.[33] Indeed, as the late-2000s recession continues, A&F has noticeably suffered financially for its refusal to lower prices or offer discounts. A&F argues that doing so would "cheapen" its near-luxury image. Analyst Bruce Watson warns that A&F risks finding itself transformed into "a cautionary tale of a store that was left by the wayside when it declined to change with the times".[32] A&F's year-to-year revenue, a key indicator of a retailer's health, rose 13% in September 2010, aided by strong international sales.[34]
Abercrombie & Fitch has carried men's fragrances Fierce, Colden, and has re-branded the original cologne Woods (Christmas Floorset 2010). Women's fragrances have included 8, Perfume 41, Wakely, and Perfume #1. Fierce and 8 are the most heavily marketed fragrances, as they are the signature scents of the brand overall.[35]
The company also offers the Abercrombie & Fitch Credit Card, issued by the World Financial Network Bank.[36]
Brand protection[edit]
Because of extensive counterfeiting of Abercrombie & Fitch goods, in 2006 the company launched a brand protection program to combat the problem worldwide (focusing more on China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea) by working with legal forces globally.[37] The program is headed by a former FBI Supervisory Special Agent who was part of the FBI's Intellectual Property Rights program, and covers all A&F brands. A&F says that the program "will improve current practices and strategies by focusing on eliminating the supply of illicit Abercrombie & Fitch products."[37]
In August 2011, A&F offered Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino and other cast members of the MTV reality show Jersey Shore a "substantial payment" if they stopped wearing Abercrombie-branded clothes, stating "We are deeply concerned that Mr. Sorrentino's association with our brand could cause significant damage to our image."[38] In November 2011, Sorrentino filed a lawsuit against A&F after the company allegedly violated his copyrights in making shirts that said "The Fitchuation" and "GTL...You Know The Deal."[39]
Stores[edit]

The exterior of the contemporary store design features white molding and formerly black louvers. Starting in mid-2013 and concluding early 2014, the louvers were removed from all locations except flagship stores. The company stated that the louvers were removed in an effort to eliminate the exclusive atmosphere from stores and to experiment with window marketing.[40] The currently featured marketing image directly faces the entrance. The interior is lit with dim ceiling lights and spot lighting. Electronic dance music meant to create an upbeat atmosphere may be played at sound levels as high as 90 decibels, exceeding the corporate policy of 84 decibels and comparable to heavy construction machinery and harmful to the ears.[41]
The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands. The A&F brand has 278[42] locations in the United States, five in Canada (two in Alberta, two in Ontario and one in British Columbia). The company currently operates 25 full-line stores and four outlet stores across sixteen countries.
International expansion[edit]




The Abercrombie & Fitch flagship store in Ginza, Tokyo, Japan – the first one in Asia


The Abercrombie & Fitch brand is believed to have reached its maximum growth potential in the American market. International expansion began in 2005, with the long-term goal of opening flagships for A&F (and eventually all its brands), in high-profile locations worldwide "at a deliberate pace".[43][44] After initially opening at a deliberately slow pace, the company began to accelerate international expansion for its namesake and its Hollister Co. brand in 2012.[45][46]
The first non-U.S. Abercrombie & Fitch stores opened in Toronto and Edmonton in 2005, and then expanded to other major cities in Canada. The company first entered the European market in 2007 with the opening of its flagship London store at 7 Burlington Gardens, Savile Row.[47] Since then, the company has opened stores in Milan, Copenhagen, Paris, Madrid, Brussels Dublin and other major cities in Europe, including six stores in Germany. The company opened its first Asian A&F flagship store in Tokyo in 2009,[48] followed by Fukuoka, Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul.[49] The company would primarily focus on the Chinese and Japanese markets where luxury consumption is high.[50] The company has also entered a franchise agreement with Grupo AXO to open retail stores in Mexico by 2015.[51] The company entered the Middle Eastern market in 2015 with the opening of its flagship store in Kuwait.[52] Since then the company has opened locations in Dubai and plans to expand deeper into the Middle East with stores in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.[53]
Brands[edit]
Abercrombie & Fitch has three concept brands apart from its namesake; they are referred to as subsidiaries, but are operated as divisions under the A&F umbrella.

Abercrombie Kids
Prep-school by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed as "classic cool" for kids 7 through 14,[2] this is the children's version of Abercrombie & Fitch.


Hollister Co.
Southern California by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "SoCal" for teenagers 14 through 18,[2] with significantly lower prices than its parent brand.


Gilly Hicks
The cheeky cousin of Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "Down Under" Sydney, it offered underwear and loungewear for women 18 and up.[55] All stores closed in 2015.[56]


Ruehl No.925
Post-Grad by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after a fictional Greenwich Village heritage, offered clothes for 22 through 35 post-grads. Closed in 2010.[57]

Humanitarian projects[edit]
In recent years, Abercrombie & Fitch has engaged in philanthropic and humanitarian projects. In January 2010, the company launched the "A&F Cares" feature on its website to inform the public about its efforts in the fields of diversity, inclusion, human rights, philanthropy, and sustainability.[58]
The A&F Challenge is an annual fundraising event held on the home office campus in New Albany that features running, walking, biking, entertainment, and food. The funds raised go to the Ohio State University Medical Center's Program for Health, which focuses on "women's cancers and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease."[59]
In 2007, Abercrombie & Fitch partnered with the National Society of High School Scholars at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia to offer US$75,000 scholarships to NSHSS members.[60]
Legal issues[edit]
The company has been involved in legal conflicts over its employment practices, treatment of customers, and clothing styles.
Employment practices[edit]
See also: Employment Practices Liability
In a 2004 lawsuit González v. Abercrombie & Fitch, the company was accused of discriminating against African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women by preferentially offering floor sales positions (called Brand Representatives or Models) and store management positions to Caucasian males.[61] The company agreed to a settlement of the class-action suit, which required the company to (1) pay $40 million to African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women who applied and were not hired or worked in certain store positions, (2) revise its hiring, performance measurement, and promotion policies, (3) revise its internal complaint procedures, (4) appoint a Vice President of Diversity, (5) hire 25 recruiters to seek out minority applicants, (6) discontinue the practice of recruiting employees at primarily white fraternities and sororities, (7) include more minorities in marketing materials, (8) report to a neutral court-appointed monitor twice per year regarding its progress in those areas, and (9) report to the court once per year.[62][63][64]
In June 2009, British law student Riam Dean, who had worked at A&F's flagship store in London's Savile Row, took the company to an employment tribunal. Dean, who was born without a left forearm, claimed that although she was initially given special permission to wear clothing that covered her prosthetic limb, she was soon told that her appearance breached the company's "Look Policy" and sent to work in the stock room, out of sight of customers. Dean sued the company for disability discrimination, and sought up to £20,000 in damages.[65] In August 2009, the tribunal ruled the 22-year-old was wrongfully dismissed and unlawfully harassed. She was awarded £8,013 for loss of earnings and wrongful dismissal.[66][67]
In a lawsuit filed in September 2009, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores,[68] in U.S. District Court by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 17-year-old Samantha Elauf said she applied, in June 2008, for a sales position at the Abercrombie Kids store in the Woodland Hills Mall, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The teen, who wears a hijab in accordance with her religious beliefs, claims the manager told her the headscarf violates the store's "Look Policy".[69] The United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on February 25, 2015,[70] and ruled 8-1 on June 1, 2015 against the company.[71]
In 2010, a Muslim woman working at a Hollister store in San Mateo, California, was fired. Before being dismissed, Hani Khan had refused Abercrombie & Fitch's human-resources representative's demand that she remove her hijab. The representative reportedly stated that the headscarf, which Khan wears for religious reasons, violated the company's "Look Policy". The civil liberties group Council on American-Islamic Relations has stated that the dismissal is a violation of nondiscrimination laws, and filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.[72]
In 2011, the Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism started an investigation into A&F's hiring and remuneration policies. The firm was suspected of only hiring personnel under 25 years old, making heavy demands on the physical appearance of its staff and rewarding a premium to male models that work shirtless.[73]
Customer issues[edit]
In 2009, the company was fined more than $115,000 by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights for refusing to let a teenage girl help her sister, who has autism, try on clothes in a fitting room. The amount of the fine reflected "pushback" by the company according to Michael K. Browne, the legal affairs manager of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.[74]
A 16-year-old is suing the company after discovering that she was being videotaped in an A&F changing room by an employee, Kenneth Applegate II. Applegate denied the claim, but co-workers discovered his camera days later with the video on it.[75]
In 2010, a customer filed a class action relating to a 2009 holiday gift card promotion. The lawsuit alleges that the gift cards said "No Expiration Date" but Abercrombie voided and expired the gift cards in early 2010. In 2012, a judge certified a nationwide class in the case. In May 2013, Class Notice went out to potential class members.[76]
Lawsuits against other parties[edit]
In 2002, the company filed a lawsuit against American Eagle Outfitters, claiming that American Eagle copied A&F garment designs, among other things. The lawsuit was based on a trade-dress claim, stating that American Eagle had very closely mimicked A&F's products' visual appearance and packaging. Specifically, A&F claimed that American Eagle copied particular articles of clothing, in-store displays and advertisements, and even the A&F product catalog. Despite the admission that American Eagle might have utilized very similar materials, designs, in-store displays, symbols, color combinations, and patterns as A&F, the court ruled that there was not an excessive level of similarity to confuse potential customers, and therefore the court ruled in favor of American Eagle.[77]
On October 18, 1999, Abercrombie & Fitch had a lawsuit about making false and misleading statements concerning its growth while knowing the actual growth was less than Wall Street expectations,[78] and paid $6,050,000 for settlement.
Controversy and criticism[edit]
Since its re-establishment in 1988, Abercrombie & Fitch has faced numerous accusations regarding its employment practices, merchandise, and advertising campaigns which have been described as sexually explicit and racist.[21][79]
Advertising[edit]
The company has received criticism over its provocative advertising.[80] The company has been accused of promoting the sexualization of pre-teen girls, for example by marketing thongs to 10-year-olds and padded bikini tops to 7-year-olds.[81]
Employment and labor practices[edit]
Lawsuits have been filed against the company due to alleged discriminatory employment practices. In 2004, in Gonzalez v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores (see "Legal issues" and "Controversy and Criticism" below), the company was sued for giving desirable positions to white applicants, to the exclusion of minorities.[62][82]
In November 2009, Abercrombie & Fitch was added to the "Sweatshop Hall of Shame 2010" by the worker advocacy group International Labor Rights Forum.[83]
A&F Quarterly[edit]
Main article: A&F Quarterly
Conservative and religious groups called for boycotts of the original American publication of A&F Quarterly (published from 1997 to 2003) for its sexually explicit nature.[84] The magazine contained nude photography by Bruce Weber, articles about sex, and recipes for alcoholic beverages. Also acting as a catalog, the Quarterly displayed the brand's merchandise with information and prices. Advertisements for the A&F Quarterly appeared in Interview, Out, Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair.[85]
Despite a company policy restricting sale of the publication to minors, critics charged that the publication was readily sold to minors. In 2003, an array of religious organizations, women's rights activists, and Asian American groups organized boycotts and protests over the publication, and the "Christmas Edition" of the catalog was removed from stores.[86] Although Jeffries said he chose to discontinue the catalog, because "Frankly, [he] was getting sick of the old one; it was getting boring," on June 17, 2010, the company made the announcement, "The Return of the A&F Quarterly" and invited email subscribers to reserve their $10 copy for a July 17, 2010, in-store release date.[87]
Product criticism[edit]
In 2002, A&F sold a shirt that featured the slogan "Wong Brothers Laundry Service – Two Wongs Can Make It White" with smiling figures in conical Asian hats, a depiction of early Chinese immigrants. The company discontinued the designs and apologized after a boycott started by an Asian American student group at Stanford University.[88] That same year, abercrombie kids removed a line of thong underwear sold for girls in pre-teen children's sizes after parents mounted nationwide storefront protests. The underwear included phrases like "Eye Candy" and "Wink Wink" printed on the front.[89]
More T-shirt controversies occurred in 2004. The first incident involved a shirt featuring the phrase, "It's All Relative in West Virginia," a jab at alleged incestuous relationships in rural America. West Virginia Governor Bob Wise spoke out against the company for depicting "an unfounded, negative stereotype of West Virginia", but the shirts were not removed.[90] Later, another T-shirt that said "L is for Loser" next to a picture of a male gymnast on the rings gathered publicity. The company stopped selling the shirt in October 2004 after USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi announced a boycott of A&F for mocking the sport.[91]
In 2005, the Women and Girls Foundation of Southwest Pennsylvania launched a "Girlcott" of the store to protest the sale of T-shirts displaying sexist messages such as "Who needs brains when you have these?", "Available for parties," and "I had a nightmare I was a brunette." The campaign received national coverage on The Today Show, and the company pulled the shirts from stores on November 5, 2005.[92] Five days after this media coverage, A&F pulled two of the shirts from its shelves, released an apology to girls for producing the T-shirts, and agreed to have corporate executives meet with the "Girlcott" girls at the company's headquarters.[93]
Bob Jones University, a non-denominational Protestant university located in Greenville, South Carolina, and its affiliated pre-collegiate schools, along with other Christian schools, have prohibited A&F and Hollister clothing from being "worn, carried, or displayed" on its campuses because of "an unusual degree of antagonism to the name of Christ and an unusual display of wickedness" in the company's promotions.[94]
After A&F raised its price points in 2004, its products have been described as overpriced.[87] After the company opened its flagship store in London, England and Paris, France, the brand was criticized in the United Kingdom and France because the merchandise that was offered to the customers cost double (or a direct $/£ - $/€ swap) compared to prices found in the U.S.[95]
A T-shirt controversy arose again over A&F's Back-to-School 2009 collection of "humor tees".[96] One shirt proclaims "Show the twins" above a picture of a young woman with her blouse open to two men. Two other shirts state "Female streaking encouraged" and "Female Students Wanted for Sexual Research".[96] The American Family Association disapproved of the influence of the "sex-as-recreation" lifestyle shirts, and asked the brand to remove its "sexualized shirts" from display.[96]
Renaming of trauma center[edit]
In 2008, Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio agreed to rename its emergency room to the Abercrombie & Fitch Emergency Department and Trauma Center in exchange for a $10 million donation.[97] A letter written by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, signed by over 100 doctors and children's advocacy groups, argued against the renaming, for the "company's appalling history of targeting children with sexualized marketing and clothing."[98]
Remembrance poppy prohibition in the UK[edit]
In November 2010, the Southampton, England, A&F store prevented 18-year-old Harriet Phipps from wearing a remembrance poppy, which is worn as part of the Remembrance Day commemorations in the United Kingdom and Canada every November. The official A&F reason for the refusal was reported to be that the poppy is not considered part of the corporate approved uniform, and is therefore prohibited.[99] The ban drew criticisms, and on November 8 the company posted on its Facebook page the following statement: "As an American company that has been around since 1892, we appreciate the sacrifices of the British and American servicemen/women in the World Wars and in military conflicts that continue today. Our company policy is to allow associates to wear a poppy as a token of this appreciation on Remembrance Day. Going forward, ...we will revisit this policy to the days/weeks leading up to Remembrance Day."
Abercrombie Kids shop on Savile Row[edit]
In 2012, A&F announced plans that it would open its Abercrombie Kids shop at No. 3 on Savile Row, next door to Gieves & Hawkes.[100] The plans drew criticism and opposition from the tailors of the Row, who were already unhappy about the presence of the main A&F store on Burlington Gardens at the end of the Row to begin with, which eventually led to a protest organized by The Chap magazine on April 23, 2012.[101][102] During the consultation period, objections were lodged to Westminster City Council and in February 2013 the Council rejected many of A&F's proposals for the store, and branded the entire plans "utterly unacceptable."[103][104] A&F appealed, managed to overcome the obstacles and opened the store in September 2014.[105] The following year, A&F was subject to nearly £16,000 in fines and legal costs when it was ruled that changes it had made to the Grade II-listed building were illegal.[106]
Jeffries' 2006 target demographic quote[edit]
In 2013, a 2006 Salon interview with the CEO Mike Jeffries went viral and caused widespread outcry over Abercrombie's marketing practices.[107][108][109] The comments made by Mike Jeffries, stating that his brand is only suitable for "the good-looking, cool kids," and that there are people who do not belong in his clothes – namely overweight people, came under fire.[110][111]

That's why we hire good-looking people in our stores. Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don't market to anyone other than that. ... In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids. Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.[112]

These quotes, which were the basis for the article's "youth, sex and casual superiority" headline, went largely unnoticed when the article was published in 2006, until they resurfaced in May 2013 after former Jenny Craig weight-loss spokesperson Kirstie Alley brought them up in an Entertainment Tonight interview.[113] Prominent talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres also later spoke out against the company.[114][115] As the article gained momentum via social media, the company's official Facebook site was bombarded by comments and posts against this strategy.[116]
Jeffries issued an official statement on May 17, 2013, regarding the news articles, saying, "I want to address some of my comments that have been circulating from a 2006 interview. While I believe this 7-year-old, resurrected quote has been taken out of context, I sincerely regret that my choice of words was interpreted in a manner that has caused offense." He also stated, "We are completely opposed to any discrimination, bullying, derogatory characterizations or other anti-social behavior based on race, gender, body type or other individual characteristics."[117]

About Abercrombie & FitchEach Abercrombie & Fitch coupon opens the door to a world of trendy, all-American style at a discounted price.

Find your Abercrombie & Fitch promo code for special deals on these products and more.Since it was founded in 1892, Abercrombie & Fitch has continuously evolved. In the early days, the company took its inspiration from the great outdoors, crafting durable expedition equipment and apparel for the rugged outdoorsman. Almost a hundred years later, in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, A&F stores began making camp in several major U.S. cities. In 1988, purchased by fashion monolith The Limited, Abercrombie and Fitch took a bold new direction. New designers reshaped and rebranded the company’s image, shifting focus toward creating garments with an all-American, on-trend aesthetic. Today, Abercrombie & Fitch operates at hundreds of locations throughout the country and internationally.Abercrombie & Fitch has certainly branched out over the last century, transforming from a sporting-goods company into a fashion powerhouse catering to the tastes of the young and stylish. The company’s trendy, youthful image is cemented by its advertising, which consists largely of provocative black-and-white imagery featuring slim, muscular models posing on sandy beaches or grassy fields. Don’t be surprised if you come face-to-face with one of these models someday—when they’re not posing for the camera, each of the models actually works at an Abercrombie & Fitch shop.Already planning your next stylish outfit?

Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) is an American retailer that focuses on upscale casual wear for young consumers, its headquarters are in New Albany, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus.[2] The company operates two other offshoot brands: Abercrombie Kids & Hollister Co. [2] The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands.[citation needed]
Once known for its sexy ad campaigns, the company has toned down its imagery and no longer displays nearly nude models in their advertisements. According to Chairman Arthur Martinez, Abercrombie and Fitch is now targeting an older consumer, from ages 18–25. These changes provide the hopes that the audience will see the company is evolving along with its consumers, and boost sales.[3]
Abercrombie & Fitch is notable for using "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] Its main competitors are Aéropostale and American Eagle Outfitters. Its younger subsidiary, Abercrombie Kids, competes with Aéropostale's P.S., and American Eagle Outfitters's 77kids.

History[edit]
Main article: History of Abercrombie & Fitch




Cover of A&F catalog from 1909.


Founded in 1892 in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, by David T. Abercrombie and Ezra Fitch, Abercrombie & Fitch was an elite outfitter of sporting and excursion goods, particularly noted for its expensive shotguns, fishing rods, fishing boats, and tents.[5] In 1976, Abercrombie & Fitch filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, finally closing its flagship store at Madison Avenue and East 45th Street in 1977.[6]
Shortly thereafter the name was revived in 1978; Oshman's Sporting Goods, a Houston-based chain owned by Jake Oshman,[7] bought the defunct firm's name and mailing list for $1.5 million[8] ($5.2 million in 2013 dollars).[9] Oshman's relaunched A&F as a mail-order retailer specializing in hunting wear and novelty items. It also opened shops in Beverly Hills, Dallas, and (by the mid-1980s) New York City. Finally, in 1988, Oshman's sold the company name and operations to The Limited, a clothing-chain operator based in Columbus, Ohio.[10] Abercrombie & Fitch gradually shifted its focus to young adults, first as a subsidiary of Limited Brands and then as a separate, publicly traded company; and grew to become one of the largest apparel firms in the United States.[11]
Since 1997, the company has consistently kept a high-profile in the public eye, due to its advertising, its philanthropy, and its involvement in legal conflicts over branding, clothing style and employment practices. In the first decade of the 21st century, the Great Recession battered the company's business as teenagers looked to lower-priced fast fashion brands like H&M and Forever 21 for fashion. Abercrombie & Fitch's stock price dropped from an all-time high of $84.23 in October 2007 to a low of $14.64 in November 2008.[12] The company worked to overhaul its merchandise mix and cut underperforming stores,[13] but lackluster performance has continued. Longtime CEO Michael Jeffries stepped down in December 2014, after 22 years with the company.[14]




Abercrombie & Fitch store in New York City


To combat heavy competition from fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21 and H&M, Abercrombie & Fitch announced key changes to change its image. It aims to reduce emphasis on sexualized advertising and focus more on customer service & diversity. Among the changes announced are eliminating sexualized advertising, no longer having shirtless models at new store openings, and eliminating sexualized pictures and advertising on bags, gift cards, and in stores. They are changing the name of store employees from "models" to "brand representatives", and will allow a more individualistic dress code. "Brand representatives" will also focus more on customer service by asking customers for help in stores, as opposed to past policies of aloofness. They also aim to promote more diversity among store employees and executives as well. A&F is signaling it will be implementing changes quickly.[4]
As of May 2015, the changes were already very apparent in stores. All "permanent marketing" images at the cash wrap and fitting rooms have been removed. Also, store models are no longer dressed in Abercrombie clothes.[4]

As of December 9, 2014[update], following the retirement of Mike Jeffries the following were key corporate officials:[15]

Arthur Martinez – Executive Chairman
Diane Chang – Executive Vice President of Sourcing
Leslee K. Herro – Executive Vice President of Planning and Allocation
Ronald A. Robins, Jr. – Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel
Jonathan Ramsden – Chief Operating Officer
Amy Zehrer – Senior Vice President of Stores
Christos Angelides – President of Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands
Fran Horowitz – President of Hollister brand

In April 2017, the company was described by Standard & Poor's as having a market value of $650,000,000 and about $420,000,000 cash on hand. In May 2017, the company was in talks to sell itself. Potential buyers included Express, American Eagle Outfitters and Cerberus Capital Management. Negotiations failed by early July. As a result of the news, on 10 July the firm's stock fell 21%.[16]

Headquarters[edit]
The company's headquarters, referred to by the company as "The Home Office", is located outside of Columbus in New Albany, Ohio.[17] The Home Office is designed as a campus of sorts, and is referred to as such. The company's merchandise-distribution centers (1 million square feet) are located exclusively on campus to help ensure brand protection.[17] Also on campus are mock-up stores, one for each of the company's brands, where store layout, merchandise and atmosphere are determined.[17] In January 2017, the company announced they would be cutting 150 jobs at their corporate headquarters.[18]
The company also has a European office in Mendrisio, Switzerland.[19][20]
Marketing, advertising and brand identity[edit]




The trademark slogan, Casual Luxury.


A&F is known for its racy marketing photography by Bruce Weber.[21] It is rendered to grayscale and features outdoor settings, usually with semi-nude males and females for an increased tone of sexuality. A&F casts only store employees for marketing campaigns. Casting directors from the home office travel to key A&F regional stores in the United States and to London to hold "casting calls" for employees aspiring to become the next "A&F New Face".[22][dead link] The company promotes its casting sessions, models, and photo shoots in the "A&F Casting" feature online at abercrombie.com. The website also provides a gallery of current photography. Framed copies at A&F stores will sometimes name the model and store.
The Abercrombie & Fitch brand image is heavily promoted as an international near-luxury lifestyle concept.[23] The company began cultivating an upscale image after the 2005 opening of its Fifth Avenue flagship store alongside Prada and other upscale retailers.[24] Having for years used high-grade materials in the construction of its merchandise, and pricing them at "near-luxury" levels, A&F introduced the trademark Casual Luxury[24] as a fictional dictionary term with multiple definitions such as "[using] the finest cashmere, pima cottons, and highest quality leather to create the ultimate in casual, body conscious clothing,"[25] and "implementing and/or incorporating time honored machinery ...to produce the most exclusive denim..."[25] This upscale image has allowed A&F to open stores in international high-end locations and further promote the image by pricing its merchandise at almost double the American prices.
Overall, CEO Jeffries calls the A&F image a "movie" because of the "fantasy" that plays out instore.[26] Even some of the clothing is given "story": "You buy into the emotional experience of a movie," Jeffries explains, "And that's what we're creating. Here I am walking into a movie, and I say, 'What's going to be [at] the box office today?'"[26]
Following a dismal earnings announcement on August 2014,[27] the company decided to drop its logo-branded apparel line, arguing that this element of its brand does not resonate with its target market. The company is now shifting its marketing strategy to trendier outfits and faster production processes. Some experts argue the retailer's focus on exclusivity has caused it to fall out of fashion with its target market.[28]




Abercrombie & Fitch models


Store staff[edit]
The company is noted for its use of "brand representatives" (previously called "models") for store customer service.[4] The models were required to buy and wear A&F clothing, but following a company settlement with California state labor regulators may now wear any no-logo clothing as long as it corresponds with the season and style of the brand. The California settlement also provided $2.2 million to reimburse former employees for their forced purchases of company-branded clothing.[29] An "Impact Team" was created in 2004 to control merchandise within each store and maintain company standards. Bigger and higher volume stores have a "Full Time Stock" who trains Impact associates, processes shipment, maintains stock room standards, and can act as a manager if the store is short on management staffing. The store manager and assistant managers are responsible for forms, lighting, photo marketing, fragrance presentations and to ensure models comply with the "look policy".[30]
Products[edit]

The signature A&F fragrance, FIERCE.


Women's Wear Daily calls Abercrombie & Fitch clothing classically "neo-preppy", with an "edgy tone and imagery".[31] The company's fashions have a reputation for luxury, with the majority of designs trend-driven. There is heavy promotion of "Premium Jeans". In early 2010, the company introduced a leather handbag collection inspired by designs from Ruehl.
Its prices are recognized as the highest in the youth-clothing industry.[32] Internationally, prices are almost double those in its American stores. Retail analyst Chris Boring warns that the company's brands are a "little more susceptible" should recession hit, because their specialties are premium-priced goods rather than necessities.[33] Indeed, as the late-2000s recession continues, A&F has noticeably suffered financially for its refusal to lower prices or offer discounts. A&F argues that doing so would "cheapen" its near-luxury image. Analyst Bruce Watson warns that A&F risks finding itself transformed into "a cautionary tale of a store that was left by the wayside when it declined to change with the times".[32] A&F's year-to-year revenue, a key indicator of a retailer's health, rose 13% in September 2010, aided by strong international sales.[34]
Abercrombie & Fitch has carried men's fragrances Fierce, Colden, and has re-branded the original cologne Woods (Christmas Floorset 2010). Women's fragrances have included 8, Perfume 41, Wakely, and Perfume #1. Fierce and 8 are the most heavily marketed fragrances, as they are the signature scents of the brand overall.[35]
The company also offers the Abercrombie & Fitch Credit Card, issued by the World Financial Network Bank.[36]
Brand protection[edit]
Because of extensive counterfeiting of Abercrombie & Fitch goods, in 2006 the company launched a brand protection program to combat the problem worldwide (focusing more on China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea) by working with legal forces globally.[37] The program is headed by a former FBI Supervisory Special Agent who was part of the FBI's Intellectual Property Rights program, and covers all A&F brands. A&F says that the program "will improve current practices and strategies by focusing on eliminating the supply of illicit Abercrombie & Fitch products."[37]
In August 2011, A&F offered Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino and other cast members of the MTV reality show Jersey Shore a "substantial payment" if they stopped wearing Abercrombie-branded clothes, stating "We are deeply concerned that Mr. Sorrentino's association with our brand could cause significant damage to our image."[38] In November 2011, Sorrentino filed a lawsuit against A&F after the company allegedly violated his copyrights in making shirts that said "The Fitchuation" and "GTL...You Know The Deal."[39]
Stores[edit]

The Modern Canoe store located at the Mall at Millenia in Orlando, Florida with wooden louvers (featuring the Spring Break 2007 marketing campaign picture).


The exterior of the contemporary store design features white molding and formerly black louvers. Starting in mid-2013 and concluding early 2014, the louvers were removed from all locations except flagship stores. The company stated that the louvers were removed in an effort to eliminate the exclusive atmosphere from stores and to experiment with window marketing.[40] The currently featured marketing image directly faces the entrance. The interior is lit with dim ceiling lights and spot lighting. Electronic dance music meant to create an upbeat atmosphere may be played at sound levels as high as 90 decibels, exceeding the corporate policy of 84 decibels and comparable to heavy construction machinery and harmful to the ears.[41]
The company operates 1,049 stores across all four brands. The A&F brand has 278[42] locations in the United States, five in Canada (two in Alberta, two in Ontario and one in British Columbia). The company currently operates 25 full-line stores and four outlet stores across sixteen countries.
International expansion[edit]




The Abercrombie & Fitch flagship store in Ginza, Tokyo, Japan – the first one in Asia


The Abercrombie & Fitch brand is believed to have reached its maximum growth potential in the American market. International expansion began in 2005, with the long-term goal of opening flagships for A&F (and eventually all its brands), in high-profile locations worldwide "at a deliberate pace".[43][44] After initially opening at a deliberately slow pace, the company began to accelerate international expansion for its namesake and its Hollister Co. brand in 2012.[45][46]
The first non-U.S. Abercrombie & Fitch stores opened in Toronto and Edmonton in 2005, and then expanded to other major cities in Canada. The company first entered the European market in 2007 with the opening of its flagship London store at 7 Burlington Gardens, Savile Row.[47] Since then, the company has opened stores in Milan, Copenhagen, Paris, Madrid, Brussels Dublin and other major cities in Europe, including six stores in Germany. The company opened its first Asian A&F flagship store in Tokyo in 2009,[48] followed by Fukuoka, Singapore, Hong Kong and Seoul.[49] The company would primarily focus on the Chinese and Japanese markets where luxury consumption is high.[50] The company has also entered a franchise agreement with Grupo AXO to open retail stores in Mexico by 2015.[51] The company entered the Middle Eastern market in 2015 with the opening of its flagship store in Kuwait.[52] Since then the company has opened locations in Dubai and plans to expand deeper into the Middle East with stores in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman.[53]
Brands[edit]
Abercrombie & Fitch has three concept brands apart from its namesake; they are referred to as subsidiaries, but are operated as divisions under the A&F umbrella.

Abercrombie Kids
Prep-school by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed as "classic cool" for kids 7 through 14,[2] this is the children's version of Abercrombie & Fitch.


Hollister Co.
Southern California by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "SoCal" for teenagers 14 through 18,[2] with significantly lower prices than its parent brand.


Gilly Hicks
The cheeky cousin of Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after "Down Under" Sydney, it offered underwear and loungewear for women 18 and up.[55] All stores closed in 2015.[56]


Ruehl No.925
Post-Grad by Abercrombie & Fitch[54] Themed after a fictional Greenwich Village heritage, offered clothes for 22 through 35 post-grads. Closed in 2010.[57]

Humanitarian projects[edit]
In recent years, Abercrombie & Fitch has engaged in philanthropic and humanitarian projects. In January 2010, the company launched the "A&F Cares" feature on its website to inform the public about its efforts in the fields of diversity, inclusion, human rights, philanthropy, and sustainability.[58]
The A&F Challenge is an annual fundraising event held on the home office campus in New Albany that features running, walking, biking, entertainment, and food. The funds raised go to the Ohio State University Medical Center's Program for Health, which focuses on "women's cancers and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease."[59]
In 2007, Abercrombie & Fitch partnered with the National Society of High School Scholars at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia to offer US$75,000 scholarships to NSHSS members.[60]
Legal issues[edit]
The company has been involved in legal conflicts over its employment practices, treatment of customers, and clothing styles.

Abercrombie & Fitch, the company was accused of discriminating against African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women by preferentially offering floor sales positions (called Brand Representatives or Models) and store management positions to Caucasian males.[61] The company agreed to a settlement of the class-action suit, which required the company to (1) pay $40 million to African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and women who applied and were not hired or worked in certain store positions, (2) revise its hiring, performance measurement, and promotion policies, (3) revise its internal complaint procedures, (4) appoint a Vice President of Diversity, (5) hire 25 recruiters to seek out minority applicants, (6) discontinue the practice of recruiting employees at primarily white fraternities and sororities, (7) include more minorities in marketing materials, (8) report to a neutral court-appointed monitor twice per year regarding its progress in those areas, and (9) report to the court once per year.[62][63][64]
In June 2009, British law student Riam Dean, who had worked at A&F's flagship store in London's Savile Row, took the company to an employment tribunal. Dean, who was born without a left forearm, claimed that although she was initially given special permission to wear clothing that covered her prosthetic limb, she was soon told that her appearance breached the company's "Look Policy" and sent to work in the stock room, out of sight of customers. Dean sued the company for disability discrimination, and sought up to £20,000 in damages.[65] In August 2009, the tribunal ruled the 22-year-old was wrongfully dismissed and unlawfully harassed. She was awarded £8,013 for loss of earnings and wrongful dismissal.[66][67]
In a lawsuit filed in September 2009, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores,[68] in U.S. District Court by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 17-year-old Samantha Elauf said she applied, in June 2008, for a sales position at the Abercrombie Kids store in the Woodland Hills Mall, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The teen, who wears a hijab in accordance with her religious beliefs, claims the manager told her the headscarf violates the store's "Look Policy".[69] The United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on February 25, 2015,[70] and ruled 8-1 on June 1, 2015 against the company.[71]
In 2010, a Muslim woman working at a Hollister store in San Mateo, California, was fired. Before being dismissed, Hani Khan had refused Abercrombie & Fitch's human-resources representative's demand that she remove her hijab. The representative reportedly stated that the headscarf, which Khan wears for religious reasons, violated the company's "Look Policy". The civil liberties group Council on American-Islamic Relations has stated that the dismissal is a violation of nondiscrimination laws, and filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.[72]
In 2011, the Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism started an investigation into A&F's hiring and remuneration policies. The firm was suspected of only hiring personnel under 25 years old, making heavy demands on the physical appearance of its staff and rewarding a premium to male models that work shirtless.[73]
Customer issues[edit]
In 2009, the company was fined more than $115,000 by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights for refusing to let a teenage girl help her sister, who has autism, try on clothes in a fitting room. The amount of the fine reflected "pushback" by the company according to Michael K. Browne, the legal affairs manager of the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.[74]
A 16-year-old is suing the company after discovering that she was being videotaped in an A&F changing room by an employee, Kenneth Applegate II. Applegate denied the claim, but co-workers discovered his camera days later with the video on it.[75]
In 2010, a customer filed a class action relating to a 2009 holiday gift card promotion. The lawsuit alleges that the gift cards said "No Expiration Date" but Abercrombie voided and expired the gift cards in early 2010. In 2012, a judge certified a nationwide class in the case. In May 2013, Class Notice went out to potential class members.[76]
Lawsuits against other parties[edit]
In 2002, the company filed a lawsuit against American Eagle Outfitters, claiming that American Eagle copied A&F garment designs, among other things. The lawsuit was based on a trade-dress claim, stating that American Eagle had very closely mimicked A&F's products' visual appearance and packaging. Specifically, A&F claimed that American Eagle copied particular articles of clothing, in-store displays and advertisements, and even the A&F product catalog. Despite the admission that American Eagle might have utilized very similar materials, designs, in-store displays, symbols, color combinations, and patterns as A&F, the court ruled that there was not an excessive level of similarity to confuse potential customers, and therefore the court ruled in favor of American Eagle.[77]
On October 18, 1999, Abercrombie & Fitch had a lawsuit about making false and misleading statements concerning its growth while knowing the actual growth was less than Wall Street expectations,[78] and paid $6,050,000 for settlement.
Controversy and criticism[edit]
Since its re-establishment in 1988, Abercrombie & Fitch has faced numerous accusations regarding its employment practices, merchandise, and advertising campaigns which have been described as sexually explicit and racist.[21][79]
Advertising[edit]
The company has received criticism over its provocative advertising.[80] The company has been accused of promoting the sexualization of pre-teen girls, for example by marketing thongs to 10-year-olds and padded bikini tops to 7-year-olds.[81]
Employment and labor practices[edit]
Lawsuits have been filed against the company due to alleged discriminatory employment practices. In 2004, in Gonzalez v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores (see "Legal issues" and "Controversy and Criticism" below), the company was sued for giving desirable positions to white applicants, to the exclusion of minorities.[62][82]
In November 2009, Abercrombie & Fitch was added to the "Sweatshop Hall of Shame 2010" by the worker advocacy group International Labor Rights Forum.[83]
A&F Quarterly[edit]
Main article: A&F Quarterly
Conservative and religious groups called for boycotts of the original American publication of A&F Quarterly (published from 1997 to 2003) for its sexually explicit nature.[84] The magazine contained nude photography by Bruce Weber, articles about sex, and recipes for alcoholic beverages. Also acting as a catalog, the Quarterly displayed the brand's merchandise with information and prices. Advertisements for the A&F Quarterly appeared in Interview, Out, Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair.[85]
Despite a company policy restricting sale of the publication to minors, critics charged that the publication was readily sold to minors. In 2003, an array of religious organizations, women's rights activists, and Asian American groups organized boycotts and protests over the publication, and the "Christmas Edition" of the catalog was removed from stores.[86] Although Jeffries said he chose to discontinue the catalog, because "Frankly, [he] was getting sick of the old one; it was getting boring," on June 17, 2010, the company made the announcement, "The Return of the A&F Quarterly" and invited email subscribers to reserve their $10 copy for a July 17, 2010, in-store release date.[87]
Product criticism[edit]
In 2002, A&F sold a shirt that featured the slogan "Wong Brothers Laundry Service – Two Wongs Can Make It White" with smiling figures in conical Asian hats, a depiction of early Chinese immigrants. The company discontinued the designs and apologized after a boycott started by an Asian American student group at Stanford University.[88] That same year, abercrombie kids removed a line of thong underwear sold for girls in pre-teen children's sizes after parents mounted nationwide storefront protests. The underwear included phrases like "Eye Candy" and "Wink Wink" printed on the front.[89]
More T-shirt controversies occurred in 2004. The first incident involved a shirt featuring the phrase, "It's All Relative in West Virginia," a jab at alleged incestuous relationships in rural America. West Virginia Governor Bob Wise spoke out against the company for depicting "an unfounded, negative stereotype of West Virginia", but the shirts were not removed.[90] Later, another T-shirt that said "L is for Loser" next to a picture of a male gymnast on the rings gathered publicity. The company stopped selling the shirt in October 2004 after USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi announced a boycott of A&F for mocking the sport.[91]
In 2005, the Women and Girls Foundation of Southwest Pennsylvania launched a "Girlcott" of the store to protest the sale of T-shirts displaying sexist messages such as "Who needs brains when you have these?", "Available for parties," and "I had a nightmare I was a brunette." The campaign received national coverage on The Today Show, and the company pulled the shirts from stores on November 5, 2005.[92] Five days after this media coverage, A&F pulled two of the shirts from its shelves, released an apology to girls for producing the T-shirts, and agreed to have corporate executives meet with the "Girlcott" girls at the company's headquarters.[93]
Bob Jones University, a non-denominational Protestant university located in Greenville, South Carolina, and its affiliated pre-collegiate schools, along with other Christian schools, have prohibited A&F and Hollister clothing from being "worn, carried, or displayed" on its campuses because of "an unusual degree of antagonism to the name of Christ and an unusual display of wickedness" in the company's promotions.[94]
After A&F raised its price points in 2004, its products have been described as overpriced.[87] After the company opened its flagship store in London, England and Paris, France, the brand was criticized in the United Kingdom and France because the merchandise that was offered to the customers cost double (or a direct $/£ - $/€ swap) compared to prices found in the U.S.[95]
A T-shirt controversy arose again over A&F's Back-to-School 2009 collection of "humor tees".[96] One shirt proclaims "Show the twins" above a picture of a young woman with her blouse open to two men. Two other shirts state "Female streaking encouraged" and "Female Students Wanted for Sexual Research".[96] The American Family Association disapproved of the influence of the "sex-as-recreation" lifestyle shirts, and asked the brand to remove its "sexualized shirts" from display.[96]
Renaming of trauma center[edit]
In 2008, Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio agreed to rename its emergency room to the Abercrombie & Fitch Emergency Department and Trauma Center in exchange for a $10 million donation.[97] A letter written by the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, signed by over 100 doctors and children's advocacy groups, argued against the renaming, for the "company's appalling history of targeting children with sexualized marketing and clothing."[98]
Remembrance poppy prohibition in the UK[edit]
In November 2010, the Southampton, England, A&F store prevented 18-year-old Harriet Phipps from wearing a remembrance poppy, which is worn as part of the Remembrance Day commemorations in the United Kingdom and Canada every November. The official A&F reason for the refusal was reported to be that the poppy is not considered part of the corporate approved uniform, and is therefore prohibited.[99] The ban drew criticisms, and on November 8 the company posted on its Facebook page the following statement: "As an American company that has been around since 1892, we appreciate the sacrifices of the British and American servicemen/women in the World Wars and in military conflicts that continue today. Our company policy is to allow associates to wear a poppy as a token of this appreciation on Remembrance Day. Going forward, ...we will revisit this policy to the days/weeks leading up to Remembrance Day."
Abercrombie Kids shop on Savile Row[edit]
In 2012, A&F announced plans that it would open its Abercrombie Kids shop at No. 3 on Savile Row, next door to Gieves & Hawkes.[100] The plans drew criticism and opposition from the tailors of the Row, who were already unhappy about the presence of the main A&F store on Burlington Gardens at the end of the Row to begin with, which eventually led to a protest organized by The Chap magazine on April 23, 2012.[101][102] During the consultation period, objections were lodged to Westminster City Council and in February 2013 the Council rejected many of A&F's proposals for the store, and branded the entire plans "utterly unacceptable."[103][104] A&F appealed, managed to overcome the obstacles and opened the store in September 2014.[105] The following year, A&F was subject to nearly £16,000 in fines and legal costs when it was ruled that changes it had made to the Grade II-listed building were illegal.[106]
Jeffries' 2006 target demographic quote[edit]
In 2013, a 2006 Salon interview with the CEO Mike Jeffries went viral and caused widespread outcry over Abercrombie's marketing practices.[107][108][109] The comments made by Mike Jeffries, stating that his brand is only suitable for "the good-looking, cool kids," and that there are people who do not belong in his clothes – namely overweight people, came under fire.[110][111]

That's why we hire good-looking people in our stores. Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don't market to anyone other than that. ... In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids. Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.[112]

These quotes, which were the basis for the article's "youth, sex and casual superiority" headline, went largely unnoticed when the article was published in 2006, until they resurfaced in May 2013 after former Jenny Craig weight-loss spokesperson Kirstie Alley brought them up in an Entertainment Tonight interview.[113] Prominent talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres also later spoke out against the company.[114][115] As the article gained momentum via social media, the company's official Facebook site was bombarded by comments and posts against this strategy.[116]
Jeffries issued an official statement on May 17, 2013, regarding the news articles, saying, "I want to address some of my comments that have been circulating from a 2006 interview. While I believe this 7-year-old, resurrected quote has been taken out of context, I sincerely regret that my choice of words was interpreted in a manner that has caused offense." He also stated, "We are completely opposed to any discrimination, bullying, derogatory characterizations or other anti-social behavior based on race, gender, body type or other individual characteristics."[117]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
