                            Providing you with a Value investment approach that utilizes 
                            in-house research, rather than market emotions or a herd mentality, 
                            to help you avoid the pitfalls that can be detrimental to long-term success.

                            We are devoted to our core values, thinking independently 
                            of the Wall Street crowd and executing investment decisions 
                            that seek to enhance the odds of outstanding risk-adjusted returns.
                        





                            Integrity
                        

                            We strive to earn your loyalty and trust through 
                            personalized service, transparent communication, 
                            and execution of our value-oriented investment process.
                        











What we do 


                        We believe that a value approach to investing will prevail over other styles in the long run. We use a disciplined methodology to evaluate businesses, which enables us to think independently of the Wall Street crowd.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Company Description


Eubel Brady & Suttman Asset Management (EBS) is a value manager that focuses on searching for value in the companies they invest in, evaluating businesses and people based on the long term and thinking independently of others on Wall Street. EBS purchases the securities of companies that are statistically cheap and are trading below their intrinsic value.EBS's research approach employs a variety of resources and tools. Ideas are generated from many sources, including database screens, Value Line reports, periodicals and a vast knowledge base of companies. They may use street research to help them up the learning curve more quickly, but they rely on their internal analysis for final decisions. EBS's research process also involves studying company filings and reports and interviewing management and competitors.The firm monitors 6,000 stocks and closely follows more than 250 others. EBS uses screening databases to apply traditional measures of valuation to identify companies with low price-to: cash flow, sales, earnings, book value and dividends. The firm uses a bottom-up security selection process that focuses on companies' intrinsic values. EBS looks for companies with durable economic characteristics such as low-cost production, industry leadership or a franchise quality to its brand. They seek companies that generate strong free cash flow, require low capital reinvestment and produce high returns on capital. From a qualitative standpoint, EBS considers companies' competitive positions, risk of obsolescence, management quality, insider ownership, compensation structures and other factors. The firm has a preference for companies with significant ownership by management and appropriately structured compensation plans. The analysis is completed through company visits, discussions with competitors and other qualitative business evaluations. Companies that meet the firm's quantitative and qualitative standards are considered for purchase. Sell decisions are driven by changes in valuations, market conditions or company fundamentals.Equity portfolios are typically diversified across several economic sectors and hold 25 to 35 securities that EBS believes are attractively priced. They may be void or overweight certain sectors. Individual equity positions are generally limited to 5% of the portfolio at initial purchase, and held for 3 to 5 years on average.

                            Providing you with a Value investment approach that utilizes 
                            in-house research, rather than market emotions or a herd mentality, 
                            to help you avoid the pitfalls that can be detrimental to long-term success.

                            We are devoted to our core values, thinking independently 
                            of the Wall Street crowd and executing investment decisions 
                            that seek to enhance the odds of outstanding risk-adjusted returns.
                        





                            Integrity
                        

                            We strive to earn your loyalty and trust through 
                            personalized service, transparent communication, 
                            and execution of our value-oriented investment process.
                        











What we do 


                        We believe that a value approach to investing will prevail over other styles in the long run. We use a disciplined methodology to evaluate businesses, which enables us to think independently of the Wall Street crowd.
