History[edit]
Merger[edit]
Chile's LAN Airlines and Brazil's TAM Airlines signed a non-binding agreement on 13 August 2010, a binding agreement on 19 January 2011,[8][9] and papers to close the merger on 22 June 2012, with TAM Airlines shareholders agreeing to the takeover by LAN Airlines.[10] Enrique Cueto, former CEO of LAN, is CEO of LATAM;[11] Mauricio Rolim Amaro, formerly vice-chairman of TAM, became LATAM chairman.[12]
Government approvals[edit]
The agreement to establish LATAM was approved by Chilean authorities on 21 September 2011, with 11 restrictions. These include transferring four landing slots at São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport to competitors interested in operating flights to Santiago de Chile's Comodoro Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport; renouncing membership to either the Oneworld or Star Alliance airline alliance; restricting the increase in capacity on flights between Brazil and Chile; and opening code-share possibilities and fidelity program membership to interested competitors.[13] On 14 December 2011, Brazilian authorities approved the agreement, imposing similar restrictions as Chilean authorities: LATAM would have to choose an alliance by August 2012; and frequencies between São Paulo and Santiago de Chile would have to be reduced. At the time TAM had two pairs of slots while LAN had four, LAN had to relinquish two pairs to competitors interested in using them.[14] On 7 March 2013, LATAM announced its final decision to choose Oneworld as its global airline alliance; as a result TAM left Star Alliance during the second quarter of FY2014 to join Oneworld.[15]
Rebranding[edit]
In August 2015 it was announced that all LATAM Airline Group airlines would fully rebrand as LATAM, with one unified livery to be applied on all aircraft by 2018.[16][17] The first of these aircraft were repainted (or delivered new) in a new LATAM livery in April 2016.
LATAM Airlines Group is currently working on the rebranding process, which is expected to be completed by 2019. Changes are becoming gradually more evident in physical spaces, on aircraft, at business offices, airport service counters, web sites, uniforms among others. Some changes are already in place, mainly in passenger travel experiences, such as the new cabin interiors which have been incorporated into the fleet, new VIP lounges in São Paulo and Santiago currently open to the public and forming part of the largest network of frequent flyer lounges in the region, and digital platforms such as the onboard entertainment system for mobile devices.[18]

History[edit]
Merger[edit]
Chile's LAN Airlines and Brazil's TAM Airlines signed a non-binding agreement on 13 August 2010, a binding agreement on 19 January 2011,[8][9] and papers to close the merger on 22 June 2012, with TAM Airlines shareholders agreeing to the takeover by LAN Airlines.[10] Enrique Cueto, former CEO of LAN, is CEO of LATAM;[11] Mauricio Rolim Amaro, formerly vice-chairman of TAM, became LATAM chairman.[12]
Government approvals[edit]
The agreement to establish LATAM was approved by Chilean authorities on 21 September 2011, with 11 restrictions. These include transferring four landing slots at São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport to competitors interested in operating flights to Santiago de Chile's Comodoro Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport; renouncing membership to either the Oneworld or Star Alliance airline alliance; restricting the increase in capacity on flights between Brazil and Chile; and opening code-share possibilities and fidelity program membership to interested competitors.[13] On 14 December 2011, Brazilian authorities approved the agreement, imposing similar restrictions as Chilean authorities: LATAM would have to choose an alliance by August 2012; and frequencies between São Paulo and Santiago de Chile would have to be reduced. At the time TAM had two pairs of slots while LAN had four, LAN had to relinquish two pairs to competitors interested in using them.[14] On 7 March 2013, LATAM announced its final decision to choose Oneworld as its global airline alliance; as a result TAM left Star Alliance during the second quarter of FY2014 to join Oneworld.[15]
Rebranding[edit]
In August 2015 it was announced that all LATAM Airline Group airlines would fully rebrand as LATAM, with one unified livery to be applied on all aircraft by 2018.[16][17] The first of these aircraft were repainted (or delivered new) in a new LATAM livery in April 2016.
LATAM Airlines Group is currently working on the rebranding process, which is expected to be completed by 2019. Changes are becoming gradually more evident in physical spaces, on aircraft, at business offices, airport service counters, web sites, uniforms among others. Some changes are already in place, mainly in passenger travel experiences, such as the new cabin interiors which have been incorporated into the fleet, new VIP lounges in São Paulo and Santiago currently open to the public and forming part of the largest network of frequent flyer lounges in the region, and digital platforms such as the onboard entertainment system for mobile devices.[18]

TIBCO was selected basically because of its resiliency, robustness, and of course the good references that we received during the selection process.











Juan Carlos Ferrer

Director of Enterprise Architecture LATAM Airlines Group
























How LATAM Airlines Used TIBCO to Make Its Connection











Merging Airline Companies with TIBCO Integration




























Challenge











Real-time computing is part of almost everything an airline does, from coordinating departures and boarding passengers to managing inventory. With technology so deeply ingrained in business operations, mergers can create a serious migration problem. When LAN and TAM airlines merged, they faced the challenge of how to unify their processes and integrate their systems.
To appreciate what an undertaking it was to merge LAN and TAM’s computing, you must understand the depth of the duplication. “We have several processes, back-office processes, as well as operational and customer-facing processes, and for each of those we have systems that LAN and TAM needed to integrate,” explains Juan Carlos Ferrer, director of enterprise architecture for LATAM Airlines Group.
Combining these systems would be a challenge in and of itself, but the new company needed to do it without any major interruption to customer service. “We are very pressed on the one hand to accomplish the objective of merging both companies’ processes, and on the other hand, to keep up with what the customer is expecting in terms of the service,” says Ferrer.




















Solution











LATAM decided the best course of action would be to introduce a service-oriented architecture (SOA) that would allow deeply embedded legacy systems to interact
with newer systems that could be more easily changed. It also meant a simpler and shorter unification process, because they wouldn’t have to start from scratch. “Not only did we need good governance, but an infrastructure that guarantees us very high levels of resiliency and robustness, and one that would make sure this change would not impact the continuity of the business,” says Ferrer.
Starting with TIBCO ActiveMatrix® Service Bus as a mediation layer, LATAM uses TIBCO Enterprise Message Service™ to communicate between infrastructures and
systems new and old. In addition, TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks™ is used as a platform for implementing new processes and propagating scheduled changes to legacy systems.




















Benefits











Fast Integration and Faster Service Delivery
With TIBCO technologies, LATAM integrated and merged systems quickly while establishing a foundation for the future. Its SOA approach helped them connect several systems from all corners of the organization, and it even helped them deliver services faster. “With good SOA governance, with good definition of canonical entities, service interfaces, and business services, and by using TIBCO BusinessWorks, we were able to provide services with a very good time to market,” says Ferrer.




















Future











Now that LATAM has established a source of events, it is weighing the value of big data and analytics. “That’s something we’re really looking forward to using in
the future. We believe that we might connect with the big data notion, the event processing concept as well. We’re waiting for the correct time to merge them into a solution,” said Ferrer.

History[edit]
Merger[edit]
Chile's LAN Airlines and Brazil's TAM Airlines signed a non-binding agreement on 13 August 2010, a binding agreement on 19 January 2011,[8][9] and papers to close the merger on 22 June 2012, with TAM Airlines shareholders agreeing to the takeover by LAN Airlines.[10] Enrique Cueto, former CEO of LAN, is CEO of LATAM;[11] Mauricio Rolim Amaro, formerly vice-chairman of TAM, became LATAM chairman.[12]
Government approvals[edit]
The agreement to establish LATAM was approved by Chilean authorities on 21 September 2011, with 11 restrictions. These include transferring four landing slots at São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport to competitors interested in operating flights to Santiago de Chile's Comodoro Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport; renouncing membership to either the Oneworld or Star Alliance airline alliance; restricting the increase in capacity on flights between Brazil and Chile; and opening code-share possibilities and fidelity program membership to interested competitors.[13] On 14 December 2011, Brazilian authorities approved the agreement, imposing similar restrictions as Chilean authorities: LATAM would have to choose an alliance by August 2012; and frequencies between São Paulo and Santiago de Chile would have to be reduced. At the time TAM had two pairs of slots while LAN had four, LAN had to relinquish two pairs to competitors interested in using them.[14] On 7 March 2013, LATAM announced its final decision to choose Oneworld as its global airline alliance; as a result TAM left Star Alliance during the second quarter of FY2014 to join Oneworld.[15]
Rebranding[edit]
In August 2015 it was announced that all LATAM Airline Group airlines would fully rebrand as LATAM, with one unified livery to be applied on all aircraft by 2018.[16][17] The first of these aircraft were repainted (or delivered new) in a new LATAM livery in April 2016.
LATAM Airlines Group is currently working on the rebranding process, which is expected to be completed by 2019. Changes are becoming gradually more evident in physical spaces, on aircraft, at business offices, airport service counters, web sites, uniforms among others. Some changes are already in place, mainly in passenger travel experiences, such as the new cabin interiors which have been incorporated into the fleet, new VIP lounges in São Paulo and Santiago currently open to the public and forming part of the largest network of frequent flyer lounges in the region, and digital platforms such as the onboard entertainment system for mobile devices.[18]

History[edit]
Merger[edit]
Chile's LAN Airlines and Brazil's TAM Airlines signed a non-binding agreement on 13 August 2010, a binding agreement on 19 January 2011,[8][9] and papers to close the merger on 22 June 2012, with TAM Airlines shareholders agreeing to the takeover by LAN Airlines.[10] Enrique Cueto, former CEO of LAN, is CEO of LATAM;[11] Mauricio Rolim Amaro, formerly vice-chairman of TAM, became LATAM chairman.[12]
Government approvals[edit]
The agreement to establish LATAM was approved by Chilean authorities on 21 September 2011, with 11 restrictions. These include transferring four landing slots at São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport to competitors interested in operating flights to Santiago de Chile's Comodoro Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport; renouncing membership to either the Oneworld or Star Alliance airline alliance; restricting the increase in capacity on flights between Brazil and Chile; and opening code-share possibilities and fidelity program membership to interested competitors.[13] On 14 December 2011, Brazilian authorities approved the agreement, imposing similar restrictions as Chilean authorities: LATAM would have to choose an alliance by August 2012; and frequencies between São Paulo and Santiago de Chile would have to be reduced. At the time TAM had two pairs of slots while LAN had four, LAN had to relinquish two pairs to competitors interested in using them.[14] On 7 March 2013, LATAM announced its final decision to choose Oneworld as its global airline alliance; as a result TAM left Star Alliance during the second quarter of FY2014 to join Oneworld.[15]
Rebranding[edit]
In August 2015 it was announced that all LATAM Airline Group airlines would fully rebrand as LATAM, with one unified livery to be applied on all aircraft by 2018.[16][17] The first of these aircraft were repainted (or delivered new) in a new LATAM livery in April 2016.
LATAM Airlines Group is currently working on the rebranding process, which is expected to be completed by 2019. Changes are becoming gradually more evident in physical spaces, on aircraft, at business offices, airport service counters, web sites, uniforms among others. Some changes are already in place, mainly in passenger travel experiences, such as the new cabin interiors which have been incorporated into the fleet, new VIP lounges in São Paulo and Santiago currently open to the public and forming part of the largest network of frequent flyer lounges in the region, and digital platforms such as the onboard entertainment system for mobile devices.[18]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
