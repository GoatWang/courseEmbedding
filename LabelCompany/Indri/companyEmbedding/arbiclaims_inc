Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        ArbiClaims, Inc has received 3.46 out of 5 stars based on 2 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Would a Trump Self-Pardon Precipitate a Constitutional Crisis?



Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf argues that if President Trump were to pardon himself, that action itself would not cause a constitutional crisis, but other actions Trump has already taken have already placed us far along a road to a constitutional crisis.

Would a Trump Self-Pardon Precipitate a Constitutional Crisis?



Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf argues that if President Trump were to pardon himself, that action itself would not cause a constitutional crisis, but other actions Trump has already taken have already placed us far along a road to a constitutional crisis.

USLegal and ArbiClaims Join Forces to Offer Online Dispute Resolution Service



Share Article


















Leading legal destination site provides customers arbitration powered by ArbiClaims.







ArbiClaims logo



(PRWEB)
January 25, 2017
 USLegal, Inc. today announced a partnership with ArbiClaims, a premier web-based dispute resolution service. The alliance now enables individuals to settle legal disagreements more quickly, efficiently, and affordably though online arbitration. Arbitration is a process to resolve conflicts without going to court. An arbitrator decides a case and the decision is enforceable similar to a court judgment. The new service can be accessed at resolveit.uslegal.com.
“USLegal welcomes the opportunity to partner with ArbiClaims to bring online dispute resolution to our website users. We seek to provide USLegal customers with access to the widest range of legal products and services available today, especially those that can help them settle legal matters cost effectively,” said USLegal CEO Frank D. Edens.
ArbiClaims handles personal and business disputes under $15,000. Once parties agree to use the service, evidence is presented to a neutral third party arbitrator and 15 to 30 minute online “trials” are held. The decision and awards made by the arbitrator then becomes binding on the parties. Most conflicts are resolved in 21 days through the web-based service versus going through the traditional court process which can often take months and involve the hiring of attorneys and payment of court costs to resolve. Examples of matters that can be handled by ArbiClaims include disagreements over loan repayments, past due invoices, car repair, security deposits, and services contracts. 
"US Legal is a proven leader in DIY law, having provided millions of users with cost effective solutions they otherwise wouldn't have access to,” said Stephen Kane, ArbiClaims CEO. “We're excited to partner with them and work together to do the same thing when it comes to disputes. Frank and his team understand the pain points we solve with ArbiClaims, making them a natural fit."
