Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Academy Bank


                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

PenFed Credit Union


                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Overview
Prominent Bible scholar, member of the Sulpician Fathers, and respected professor of biblical studies, Raymond Edward Brown was one of the first Roman Catholic scholars to analyze the Bible using historical-critical methodology. Controversial in some Catholic circles and celebrated in others, Brown remains an important figure in the Catholic Church and in the landscape of twentieth-century biblical scholarship.

Biblical Exegesis and Church Doctrine

Author: Raymond E. Brown
Publisher: Wipf & Stock
Publication Date: 1985
Pages: 171

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




In this book, Raymond Brown reflects on the interplay between biblical criticism employed by a majority of Roman Catholic scholars and the doctrinal proclamations of the Catholic Church. He also presents his argument for how liberals and ultraconservatives both misinterpret the effects of biblical criticism on doctrine. He gives special attention to the positive results of contemporary biblical studies for the understanding of Mary, the Holy Spirit, and the Church.







Priest and Bishop: Biblical Reflections

Author: Raymond E. Brown
Publisher: Wipf & Stock
Publication Date: 1999
Pages: 86





This booklet presents Brown’s thoughts on the biblical basis of priesthood, as well as some reflections on the role of bishop. Not setting out to give a “complete, scientific treatment of the biblical background of priesthood,” he presents his intentions for compiling these reflections this way: “I have culled the Scriptures to offer material for thought at a crucial moment in the history of the Roman Catholic priesthood. With the whole Christian world looking on, we Catholics have entered a sometimes acrimonious debate with ourselves as to what should be expected of those who are in the special ministry of the Church . . . What manner of life should our priests live and work should they do?”







Recent Discoveries and the Biblical World

Author: Raymond E. Brown
Publisher: Wipf & Stock
Publication Date: 2003
Pages: 101

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




One of the most fascinating aspects of biblical research today involves Near East discoveries and how they cast light on the Bible. This text by Brown is a handy guide which discusses twenty-five of the most significant archaeological and documentary finds of our times, and explains how they broaden our knowledge of the biblical world. This book provides helpful photographs and illustrations to enhance your study, as well as an insightful introduction by the author in which Brown recounts how for himself, reading of such discoveries sparked him to commit his life to formal Bible study and helped him develop his cardinal principle of biblical interpretation: viewing the Bible as the “word of God” involves a combination of divine inspiration and human time-conditioned perception.







The Sensus Plenior of Sacred Scripture

Author: Raymond E. Brown
Publisher: St. Mary’s University
Publication Date: 1955
Pages: 161

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




This work, published in 1955, is a dissertation Brown wrote at St. Mary’s University in Baltimore. It deals with the notion of sensus plenior or “fuller sense,” a term in biblical exegesis first used by Andres Fernandez, S.J. in the late 1920s. This new hermeneutic classification sparked a complicated dispute in Catholic circles in the years following, to which Brown adds his voice in this text. Brown defines sensus plenior as “that additional, deeper meaning, intended by God but not clearly intended by the human author, which is seen to exist in the words of a biblical text (or group of texts, or even a whole book) when they are studied in the light of further revelation or development in the understanding of revelation.” Brown explores the use of Scripture in its various senses through the ages, explains the divisions of sensus plenior and its relations to other senses of Scripture, examines the objections raised against it, and much more.
