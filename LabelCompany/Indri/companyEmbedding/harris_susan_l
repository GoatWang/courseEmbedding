You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.

This company, business, contacted me under false pretense advertising a product that I purchased August 2013 for $112. And never heard from again. This alumni directory was a Christmas gift for my husband. I was told at the time of purchase it would be shipped Jan. 2014. I have contacted this company by phone three times since that date to no avail. Each time I have been told there is a delay,in shipping. I have received no notifications from this company alerting me of the delays. I feel I have been scammed, ripped off, and taken for the $112. Plus the mental and emotional stress this has caused. What has happened to integrity and honesty in our country?

AUTHOR: Ken -  () SUBMITTED: Wednesday, February 05, 2014 POSTED: Wednesday, February 05, 2014   As I recall. it too, was a little delayed due to compiling late information they received.  The book and DVD were well worth the wait an beautifully done.  I don't have any reason to believe you are being ripped off.  No, I don't work for them, but would expect they will deliver a quality product.  The BBB seems to think so to as they are rated A+. Good luck to you and hope you enjoy your purchase soon.  Please come back on Ripoff Report and advise if/when you receive your book. BTW, most shippers are experiencing significant delays due to severe weather in the northeast.    Respond to this report!  What's this?

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. Behen, Susan L, MD10710 Charter Dr Ste 230Columbia, MD 21044(443) 546-1600Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteServicesSponsored LinksShowing1-1
