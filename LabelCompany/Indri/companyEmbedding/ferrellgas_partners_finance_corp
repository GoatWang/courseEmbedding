The following is a discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The discussions set forth in the "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" sections generally refer to Ferrellgas Partners and its consolidated subsidiaries. However, in these discussions there exist two material differences between Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership. Those material differences are:   because Ferrellgas Partners has outstanding $182.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.625% senior notes due fiscal 2020, the two partnerships incur different amounts of interest expense on their outstanding indebtedness; see the statements of earnings in their respective consolidated financial statements and Note H - Debt in the respective notes to their consolidated financial statements; and   Ferrellgas Partners issued common units during fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013.  Overview  Table of Contents  Strategic Diversification Acquisitions  During May 2014, we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding membership interests in each of Sable Environmental, LLC and Sable SWD 2, LLC (collectively, "Sable"), a fluid logistics provider in the Eagle Ford shale region of south Texas for consideration of $124.7 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments and contingent consideration. Consideration was paid in cash upon closing and a two year contingent consideration agreement was entered into entitling the sellers to additional cash consideration if the acquired business exceeds certain earnings targets. The acquisition was funded through borrowings from our secured credit facility, and subsequently Sable's ownership group purchased $50.0 million of our common units in a registered direct offering, which units are subject to certain transfer restrictions. With this acquisition we established a new operating and reportable segment referred to as our "Midstream Operations". With the acquisition of Sable, we have two reportable operating segments: propane and related equipment sales and midstream operations.  During May 2014, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire one salt water disposal well, Dietert SWD, based in LaSalle County, Texas.  During September 2014, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire two salt water disposal wells in the Eagle Ford shale region of south Texas from C&E Production, LLC and its affiliates ("C&E sellers"), based in Bryan, Texas. Consideration was paid in cash upon closing with funds borrowed from our secured credit facility. During September 2014, in a non-brokered registered direct offering, which units are subject to certain transfer restrictions, we issued to Ferrell Companies Inc. and the former equity holders of C&E sellers, an aggregate of 1.5 million common units for an aggregate purchase price of $42.0 million. We used these proceeds to pay down a portion of the borrowings under our secured credit facility used to fund the acquisition discussed above, as well as other propane and related equipment sales acquisitions completed during fiscal 2014.  Propane and related equipment sales  We believe we are a leading distributor of propane and related equipment and supplies to customers in the United States. We believe that we are the second largest retail marketer of propane in the United States as measured by the volume of our retail sales in fiscal 2014 and a leading national provider of propane by portable tank exchange.  We employ risk management activities that attempt to mitigate price risks related to the purchase, storage, transport and sale of propane. We enter into propane sales commitments with a portion of our customers that provide for a contracted price agreement for a specified period of time. These commitments can expose us to product price risk if not immediately economically hedged with an offsetting propane purchase commitment. Moreover, customers may not fulfill their purchase agreement due to the effects of warmer than normal weather, customer conservation or other economic conditions.  Our open financial derivative purchase commitments are designated as hedges primarily for fiscal 2015 and 2016 sales commitments and, as of July 31, 2014, have experienced net mark to market gains of approximately $6.9 million. Because these financial derivative purchase commitments qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the resulting asset, liability and related mark to market gains or losses are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as "Prepaid expenses and other current assets," "Other assets, net," "Other current liabilities," "Other liabilities" and "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)," respectively, until settled. Upon settlement, realized gains or losses on these contracts will be reclassified to "Cost of product sold-propane and other gas liquid sales" in the consolidated statements of earnings as the underlying inventory is sold. These financial derivative purchase commitment net gains are expected to be offset by decreased margins on propane sales commitments that qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exception. At July 31, 2014, we estimate 67% of currently open financial derivative purchase commitments, the related propane sales commitments and the resulting gross margin will be realized into earnings during the next twelve months.  We also enter into interest rate derivative contracts, including swaps, to manage our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our fixed rate senior notes and our floating rate borrowings from both the secured credit facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility. Fluctuations in interest rates subject us to interest rate risk. Decreases in interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt, while increases in interest rates subject us to the risk of increased interest expense related to our variable rate borrowings. Midstream operations  Table of Contents  volumes of salt water known as "flowback" and "production" water. Flowback is a water based solution that flows back to the surface during and after the completion of the hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") process whereby large volumes of water, sand and chemicals are injected under high pressures into rock formations to stimulate production. Flowback contains clays, chemicals, dissolved metal ions, total dissolved solids and oil/condensate. Production water is salt water from underground formations that are brought to the surface during the normal course of oil or gas production. Because this water has been in contact with hydrocarbon-bearing formations, it contains some of the chemical characteristics of the formations and the hydrocarbons. In the oil and gas fields we service, these volumes of water are transported by truck away from the fields to salt water disposal wells where it is injected into underground geologic formations using high-pressure pumps. Our revenue is derived from fees we charge our customers to dispose of salt water at our facilities and crude oil sales from our skimming oil process.  "Net earnings (loss) attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P." in fiscal 2014 was a net earnings of $33.2 million as compared to $56.4 million in fiscal 2013. This decrease was primarily due to:   a $21.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the early extinguishment of all of our $300.0 million 9.125% fixed rate senior notes due October 1, 2017 and related interest rate swap termination;   a $39.1 million increase in "operating expenses" due primarily to the increase in propane sales volume;   a $12.0 million increase in "general and administrative expenses" primarily due to increased non-cash stock based compensation charges;   a $6.0 million increase in "Non-cash employee stock ownership plan compensation charge" primarily due to the increase in per share value of Ferrell Companies shares allocated to employees; and  partially offset by the following:   a $43.9 million increase in "Gross margin - Propane and other gas liquid sales" due primarily to the increase in propane sales volume;   a $8.6 million increase in "Gross margin - Other"; and   a $3.9 million decrease in "Loss on disposal of assets".  We have completed our impairment test for the Retail operations and Products reporting units and believe that estimated fair values exceed the carrying values of our reporting units as of January 31, 2014. Goodwill associated with the Midstream operations reporting unit is a result of our acquisition of Sable.  Forward-looking Statements  Statements included in this report include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are identified as any statement that does not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements often use words such as "anticipate," "believe," "intend," "plan," "projection," "forecast," "strategy," "position," "continue," "estimate," "expect," "may," "will," or the negative of those terms or other variations of them or comparable terminology. These statements often discuss plans, strategies, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future and are based upon the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on the information currently available to them. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning our future operating results or our ability to generate sales, income or cash flow are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Many of the factors that will affect our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict.  Table of Contents  Some of our forward-looking statements include the following:   that we will continue to have sufficient access to capital markets at yields acceptable to us to support our expected growth expenditures and refinancing of debt maturities;   that Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership will continue to meet all of the quarterly financial tests required by the agreements governing their indebtedness; and   that our future capital expenditures and working capital needs will be provided by a combination of cash generated from future operations, existing cash balances, the secured credit facility or the accounts receivable securitization facility.  When considering any forward-looking statement, you should also keep in mind the risk factors set forth in "Item 1A. Risk Factors." Any of these risks could impair our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any such impairment may affect our ability to make distributions to our unitholders or pay interest on the principal of any of our debt securities. In addition, the trading price, if any, of our securities could decline as a result of any such impairment.  Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information as required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or risk factors after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  In addition, the classification of Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership as partnerships for federal income tax purposes means that we do not generally pay federal income taxes. We do, however, pay taxes on the income of our subsidiaries that are corporations. We rely on a legal opinion from our counsel, and not a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, as to our proper classification for federal income tax purposes. See the section entitled, "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Tax Risks." The IRS could treat us as a corporation for tax purposes or changes in federal or state laws could subject us to entity-level taxation, which would substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders or to pay interest on the principal of any of our debt securities.

Management believes the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful because it allows investors to view the partnership's performance in a manner similar to  Table of Contents  the method management uses, adjusted for items management believes makes it easier to compare its results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures. This method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA may not be consistent with that of other companies and should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP.  The following table summarizes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively:  (amounts in thousands) 2014 2013 Net earnings attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. $ 33,211 $ 56,426 Income tax expense 2,516 1,855 Interest expense 86,502 89,145 Depreciation and amortization expense 84,202 83,344 EBITDA 206,431 230,770 Loss on extinguishment of debt 21,202 - Non-cash employee stock ownership plan compensation 21,789 15,769 charge Non-cash stock and unit-based compensation charge 24,508 13,545 Loss on disposal of assets 6,486 10,421 Other expense (income), net 479 (565 ) Change in fair value of contingent consideration 5,000 - Litigation accrual and related legal fees associated with a class action lawsuit 1,749 1,568 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest 504 741 Adjusted EBITDA 288,148 272,249 Net cash interest expense (a) (83,686 ) (83,495 ) Maintenance capital expenditures (b) (17,673 ) (15,070 ) Cash paid for taxes (816 ) (550 ) Proceeds from asset sales 4,524 9,980 Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors 190,497 183,114 (c) Distributable cash flow attributable to general partner 3,810 3,662 and non-controlling interest Distributable cash flow attributable to common 186,687 179,452 unitholders (d) Less: Distributions paid 159,316 158,087 Distributable cash flow excess $ 27,371 $ 21,365  (a) Net cash interest expense is the sum of interest expense less non-cash interest expense and other income, net. This amount includes interest expense related to the accounts receivable securitization facility.  (b) Maintenance capital expenditures include capitalized expenditures for betterment and replacement of property, plant and equipment.  (c) Management considers distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors a meaningful non-GAAP measure of the partnership's ability to declare and pay quarterly distributions to equity investors. Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors, as management defines it, may not be comparable to distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors or similarly titled measurements used by other corporations and partnerships. Items added into our calculation of distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. Distributable cash flow attributable to equity investors may not be consistent with that of other companies and should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP.  (d) Management considers distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders a meaningful non-GAAP measure of the partnership's ability to declare and pay quarterly distributions to common unitholders. Distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders, as management defines it, may not be comparable to distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders or similarly titled measurements used by other corporations and partnerships. Items  Table of Contents  added into our calculation of distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders that will not occur on a continuing basis may have associated cash payments. Distributable cash flow attributable to common unitholders may not be consistent with that of other companies and should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with GAAP.  Propane and related equipment sales  Propane sales volumes during fiscal 2014 increased 5%, or 45.2 million gallons, from that of the prior year period due to 31.8 million of increased gallon sales to wholesale customers and 13.4 million of increased gallons to retail customers.  Weather in the more highly concentrated geographic areas we serve for the twelve months ended July 31, 2014 was approximately 9% colder than that of the prior year period and 4% colder than normal. We believe retail and wholesale customer sales volume increased due to colder weather and heavier than normal propane use for crop drying during an unusually wet harvest season.  Our sales price per gallon correlates to the wholesale market price of propane. The wholesale market price at one of the major supply points, Mt. Belvieu, Texas and Conway, Kansas, during fiscal 2014 averaged 29% and 49% more than the prior year period, respectively. The wholesale market price at Mt. Belvieu, Texas averaged $1.15 and $0.89 per gallon during fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, while the wholesale market price at Conway, Kansas averaged $1.22 and $0.82 per gallon during fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.  The propane industry experienced significant logistical and infrastructure challenges caused by industry-wide storage and transportation issues during the winter heating season. As a result, wholesale propane prices rose to historic levels in certain geographic areas. Once these issues were resolved, the wholesale cost of propane decreased significantly and dramatically in these geographic locations. During February 2014, the wholesale cost of propane in Conway, Kansas decreased from $2.49 per gallon to $1.16 per gallon. During this period of rapidly decreasing wholesale propane prices our gross margin per gallon sold increased on certain contracted sales volumes to commercial customers.  Revenues  Retail sales increased $264.8 million compared to the prior year period. This increase resulted primarily from a $241.0 million increase in sales price per gallon and $23.8 million of increased sales volumes, both as discussed above.  Wholesale sales increased $140.2 million compared to the prior year period. This increase resulted primarily from $89.8 million of increased sales price per gallon and $50.4 million of increased sales volumes, both as discussed above.  Other gas sales increased $3.1 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to $34.4 million of increased sales price per gallon, offset by $31.3 million of decreased sales volumes.  Gross margin - Propane and other gas liquids sales  Gross margin increased $43.9 million primarily due to a $30.2 million increase in gallon sales and an $13.7 million increase in gross margin per gallon sold nationally, both as discussed above.  Gross margin - Other  Gross margin increased $3.2 million primarily due to $8.2 million of grilling tool and accessory sales gained through acquisitions, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in miscellaneous fees billed to customers and a $1.9 million decrease in materials and appliance sales.  Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA increased $15.9 million primarily due to the $43.9 million of increased "Gross margin - Propane and other gas liquid sales" and a $3.2 million increase in Gross margin - Other, both as discussed above, partially offset by a $29.8 million increase in "Operating expense". "Operating expense" increased $17.9 million due to variable delivery costs related to the increase in propane sales volume, as discussed above, and increased operating expenses of $8.1 million related to acquisitions of both grilling tool and accessory operations and propane operations.  Table of Contents  Midstream operations - Disposal wells  Our midstream operations began with our May 2014 acquisition of Sable.  Revenues  Our midstream operations segment generated $7.4 million of skimming oil and salt water disposal revenues.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Overview  Our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership.  Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. have nominal assets, do not conduct any operations and have no employees other than officers. Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. serves as co-issuer and co-obligor for debt securities of Ferrellgas Partners while Ferrellgas Finance Corp. serves as co-issuer and co-obligor for debt securities of the operating partnership. Accordingly, and due to the reduced disclosure format, a discussion of the results of operations, liquidity and capital resources of Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and Ferrellgas Finance Corp. is not presented.  In this Item 2 of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context indicates otherwise:   "us," "we," "our," "ours," "consolidated," or "Ferrellgas" are references exclusively to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp., Ferrellgas, L.P. and Ferrellgas Finance Corp., except when used in connection with "common units," in which case these terms refer to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. without its consolidated subsidiaries;   "Ferrellgas Partners" refers to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. itself, without its consolidated subsidiaries;   the "operating partnership" refers to Ferrellgas, L.P., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Ferrellgas Finance Corp.;   our "general partner" refers to Ferrellgas, Inc.;   "Ferrell Companies" refers to Ferrell Companies, Inc., the sole shareholder of our general partner;   "unitholders" refers to holders of common units of Ferrellgas Partners;   "retail sales" refers to Propane and other gas liquid sales: Retail - Sales to End Users or the volume of propane sold primarily to our residential, industrial/commercial and agricultural customers;   "wholesale sales" refers to Propane and other gas liquid sales: Wholesale - Sales to Resellers or the volume of propane sold primarily to our portable tank exchange customers and bulk propane sold to wholesale customers;   "other gas sales" refers to Propane and other gas liquid sales: Other Gas Sales or the volume of bulk propane sold to other third party propane distributors or marketers and the volume of refined fuel sold;   "propane sales volume" refers to the volume of propane sold to our retail sales and wholesale sales customers;   "water solutions revenues" refers to fees charged for the processing and disposal of salt water as well as the sale of skimming oil;   "crude oil logistics revenues" refers to fees charged for crude oil transportation and logistics services on behalf of producers and end-users of crude oil;   "crude oil sales" refers to crude oil purchased and sold in connection with crude oil transportation and logistics services on behalf of producers and end-users of crude oil;   "crude oil hauled" refers to the crude oil volume in barrels transported through our operation of a fleet of trucks, tank trailers, rail cars and a barge;   "Jamex" refers to Jamex Marketing, LLC;   "salt water volume" refers to the number of barrels of salt water processed at our disposal sites;  Table of Contents   "skimming oil" refers to the oil collected from the process used at our salt water disposal wells through a combination of gravity and chemicals to separate crude oil that is dissolved in the salt water;   "Notes" refers to the notes of the condensed consolidated financial statements of Ferrellgas Partners or the operating partnership, as applicable;   "MBbls/d" refers to one thousand barrels per day; and  Ferrellgas Partners is a holding entity that conducts no operations and has two direct subsidiaries, Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. and the operating partnership. Ferrellgas Partners' only significant assets are its approximate 99% limited partnership interest in the operating partnership and its 100% equity interest in Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp. The common units of Ferrellgas Partners are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and our activities are primarily conducted through the operating partnership.  The operating partnership was formed on April 22, 1994, and accounts for substantially all of our consolidated assets, sales and operating earnings, except for interest expense related to the senior notes co-issued by Ferrellgas Partners and Ferrellgas Partners Finance Corp.  Our general partner performs all management functions for us and our subsidiaries and holds a 1% general partner interest in Ferrellgas Partners and an approximate 1% general partner interest in the operating partnership. The parent company of our general partner, Ferrell Companies, beneficially owns approximately 23% of our outstanding common units. Ferrell Companies is owned 100% by an employee stock ownership trust.  We file annual, quarterly, and other reports and information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). You may read and download our SEC filings over the Internet from several commercial document retrieval services as well as at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. You may also read and copy our SEC filings at the SEC's Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information concerning the Public Reference Room and any applicable copy charges. Because our common units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "FGP," we also provide our SEC filings and particular other information to the New York Stock Exchange. You may obtain copies of these filings and such other information at the offices of the New York Stock Exchange located at 11 Wall Street, New York, New York 10005. In addition, our SEC filings are available on our website at www.ferrellgas.com at no cost as soon as reasonably practicable after our electronic filing or furnishing thereof with the SEC. Please note that any Internet addresses provided in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are for informational purposes only and are not intended to be hyperlinks. Accordingly, no information found and/or provided at such Internet addresses is intended or deemed to be incorporated by reference herein.  The following is a discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our historical condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  The discussions set forth in the "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" sections generally refer to Ferrellgas Partners and its consolidated subsidiaries. However, in these discussions there exist two material differences between Ferrellgas Partners and the operating partnership. Those material differences are:   because Ferrellgas Partners has outstanding $357.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.625% senior notes due fiscal 2020, the two partnerships incur different amounts of interest expense on their outstanding indebtedness; see the statements of operations in their respective condensed consolidated financial statements; and   Ferrellgas Partners issued common units during fiscal 2016 and repurchased common units in fiscal 2016 and 2017.  Table of Contents  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements  Statements included in this report include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are identified as any statement that does not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements often use words such as "anticipate," "believe," "intend," "plan," "projection," "forecast," "strategy," "position," "continue," "estimate," "expect," "may," "will," or the negative of those terms or other variations of them or comparable terminology. These statements often discuss plans, strategies, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future and are based upon the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on the information currently available to them. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning our future operating results or our ability to generate sales, income or cash flow are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Many of the factors that will affect our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict. Some of the risk factors that may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations include:   we are highly leveraged;   we may be in violation of certain financial covenants within our Note Indentures, secured credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility;   the effect of weather conditions on the demand for propane;   the prices of wholesale propane, motor fuel and crude oil;   disruptions to the supply of propane;   competition from other industry participants and other energy sources;   energy efficiency and technology advances;   the termination or non-renewal of certain arrangements or agreements;   adverse changes in our relationships with our national propane customers;   significant delays in the collection of, or uncollectibility of, accounts or notes receivable;   changes in demand for, and production of, hydrocarbon products;   capacity overbuild of midstream energy infrastructure in our midstream operational areas;   disruptions to railroad operations on the railroads we use;   increased trucking and rail regulations;   cost increases that exceed contractual rate increases for our logistics services;   inherent operating and litigation risks in gathering, transporting, handling and storing propane and crude oil;   our inability to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate acquired operations;   costs of complying with, or liabilities imposed under, environmental, health and safety laws;   economic and political instability, particularly in areas of the world tied to the energy industry; and   disruptions in the capital and credit markets.  When considering any forward-looking statement, keep in mind the risk factors set forth in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2016 and under Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of these risks could impair our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any such impairment may affect our ability to make distributions to our unitholders or to pay interest on the principal of our debt securities. In addition, the trading price of our securities could decline as a result of any such impairment.  Except for our ongoing obligations to disclose material information as required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or risk factors after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Table of Contents  Recent developments  In connection with the closing of our acquisition of Bridger in June 2015, Bridger entered into a ten-year transportation and logistics agreement (the "Jamex TLA") with Jamex pursuant to which Jamex would be responsible for certain payments to Bridger and also for sourcing crude oil volumes for Bridger's largest customer.  As a result of concerns regarding the collectability of amounts owed to Bridger from Jamex under the Jamex TLA and certain other matters between Bridger and Jamex, on September 1, 2016, Bridger, Jamex, Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. and certain other affiliated parties entered into a group of agreements that terminated the Jamex TLA, facilitated Ferrellgas purchasing certain Ferrellgas common units from Jamex, and established payment terms for certain amounts owed by Jamex to Bridger under the Jamex TLA. Consequently, Ferrellgas does not anticipate any material contribution to revenue or EBITDA from Jamex or Bridger's former largest customer in the future.  On September 1, 2016, Bridger and Ferrellgas entered into a Termination, Settlement and Release Agreement (the "Jamex Termination Agreement") with Jamex, certain of Jamex's affiliates, and James Ballengee (the owner of Jamex) pursuant to which:  (1) Jamex agreed to execute and deliver a secured promissory note in favor of Bridger in original principal amount of $49.5 million (the "Jamex Secured Promissory Note") in satisfaction of all obligations owed to Bridger under the Jamex TLA;  (2) Mr. Ballengee and Bacchus Capital Trading, LLC, an entity controlled by Mr. Ballengee, executed and delivered a joint guarantee of the Jamex Secured Promissory Note obligations up to a maximum aggregate amount of $20.0 million;  (3) The operating partnership agreed to provide Jamex with a $5.0 million revolving secured working capital facility evidenced by a revolving promissory note (the "Jamex Revolving Promissory Note" and, together with the Jamex Secured Promissory Note, the "Jamex Notes");  (4) The other Jamex entities agreed to execute and deliver a security agreement and a full guarantee of the obligations under the Jamex Notes;  (5) Ferrellgas paid approximately $16.9 million to Jamex and in return received 0.9 million of Ferrellgas Partners' common units, which were cancelled upon receipt, and approximately 23 thousand barrels of crude oil;  (6) The parties agreed to terminate the Jamex TLA and certain other commercial agreements and arrangements between them, and release any claims between or among them that may exist (other than those arising under the Jamex Termination Agreement or the other agreements entered into in connection with the Jamex Termination Agreement); and  (7) Ferrellgas waived the remaining lockup provision applicable to Jamex under the Registration Rights Agreement dated June 24, 2015 to which Jamex is party.  The Jamex Secured Promissory Note originally had an annual interest rate of 7%, which decreased to 2.8% as a result of Ferrellgas reducing its quarterly distribution rate to $0.10, and contemplates quarterly amortizing principal payments, together with payments of accrued interest. The first quarterly interest payment of approximately $0.9 million was received in December 2016 and the first quarterly principal payment of approximately $2.5 million was received in March 2017. The maturity date of the Jamex Secured Promissory Note is December 17, 2021, and Jamex may prepay the Secured Promissory Note in whole or in part at any time.  The Jamex Revolving Promissory Note, which provides Jamex with access to working capital liquidity to meet their unrelated and ongoing crude oil marketing and other business needs, has an annual interest rate of 0% (which rate would be increased in case of a default), and contains certain conditions precedent to the operating partnership's obligation to make any advances thereunder. Each borrowing under the Jamex Revolving Promissory Note must be repaid within 10 days, and the ultimate maturity date of the Jamex Revolving Promissory Note is the earlier of September 1, 2021 and the date on which all obligations under the Jamex Secured Promissory Note are repaid.  The Jamex Secured Promissory Note is guaranteed, pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement, jointly by James Ballengee and Bacchus Capital Trading, LLC, an entity controlled by Mr. Ballengee (up to a maximum aggregate amount of $20.0 million), and each Note is fully guaranteed, pursuant to respective Guaranty Agreements, by the other Jamex entities. The obligations of Jamex and the other Jamex entities under the Notes are secured, pursuant to a Security Agreement, by a lien on certain of those entities' assets, actively traded marketable securities and cash, which are held in a controlled account that can be seized by us in the event of default. The sum of the amounts available under the controlled account and the $20.0 million guarantee approximate the $45.0 million note receivable as of April 30, 2017.  Table of Contents  During the year ended July 31, 2016, approximately 60% and 80% of Bridger's gross margin and EBITDA, respectively, was generated from its largest customer and Jamex, that customer's supplier, under take-or-pay arrangements. Bridger's largest customer during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 owned a refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania. Bridger was party to an agreement with this customer under which Bridger provided logistics services to transport crude oil from the Bakken region in North Dakota to the Trainer refinery. That agreement had a minimum volume commitment and payment obligation from the refinery for logistics services associated with the delivery of 65 MBbls/d. However, if the quantity of crude oil delivered to the refinery dropped below 35 MBbls/d, the minimum volume commitment and payment obligation from the refinery would be suspended and Jamex would become responsible for payments to Bridger under the pay provisions of the Jamex TLA. During February 2016, Jamex ceased sourcing barrels for delivery to the refinery and since that time Bridger had been billing Jamex directly in accordance with the pay provisions of the Jamex TLA. During July 2016, we determined Jamex would not resume sourcing barrels for delivery to the refinery or be likely to continue to make payments under the pay provisions of the Jamex TLA. As a result, we negotiated a settlement with Jamex, and the Jamex TLA was terminated on September 1, 2016. While the agreement with the refinery owner was not terminated as a result of the execution and delivery of the Jamex Termination Agreement, Bridger has been unable to negotiate a revised transportation and logistics agreement with that customer; accordingly it is unlikely that Bridger will continue to make any deliveries under the existing agreement. Consequently, Ferrellgas does not anticipate any material contribution to revenue or EBITDA from Jamex or Bridger's former largest customer in the future. Additionally, the continued, sustained decline in crude oil prices and resulting decrease in crude oil production in the regions in which we operate continued to significantly impact our trucking and rail operations during the nine months ended April 30, 2017, a trend we anticipate will continue in fiscal 2017 and beyond.  Financial covenants  The indenture governing the outstanding notes of Ferrellgas Partners and the agreements governing the operating partnership's indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of specified subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness and make distribution payments to our common unitholders. Our general partner believes that the most restrictive of these covenants are the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the indenture governing the outstanding notes of Ferrellgas Partners, and the consolidated leverage ratio and the consolidated interest coverage ratio, as defined in our secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility.  Before a restricted payment (as defined in the secured credit facility and the operating partnership indentures) can be made by the operating partnership, the operating partnership must be in compliance with the covenants under the secured credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility and in compliance with the covenants under the operating partnership's indentures. If the operating partnership is unable to make restricted payments, Ferrellgas Partners will not have the ability to make semi-annual interest payments on its $357.0 million 8.625% unsecured senior notes due 2020 or distributions to Ferrellgas Partners common unitholders. If Ferrellgas Partners does not make interest payments on its unsecured notes, that would constitute an event of default which would permit the acceleration of the indenture. The accelerated indenture would become immediately due and payable, which would in turn trigger cross acceleration of other debt. If the payment of Ferrellgas' debt is accelerated, Ferrellgas may be unable to borrow sufficient funds to refinance debt in which case unitholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investment.  Before a restricted payment (as defined in the Ferrellgas Partners indenture) can be made by Ferrellgas Partners, Ferrellgas Partners must be in compliance with the covenant under the Ferrellgas Partners indenture. If Ferrellgas Partners is unable to make restricted payments, Ferrellgas Partners will not have the ability to make distributions to Ferrellgas Partners common unitholders.  A breach of the financial covenants under the secured credit facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility will also result in an event of default under those facilities resulting in the operating partnership's inability to obtain funds under those facilities and give the lenders and receivables purchasers the right to accelerate the operating partnership's obligations under those facilities and to exercise remedies to collect the outstanding amounts under those facilities.  Consolidated leverage ratio  Our consolidated leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt of the operating partnership to trailing four quarters EBITDA (both as adjusted for certain, specified items) of the operating partnership, as detailed in our secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility. During fiscal 2016 our secured credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility required the operating partnership to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than 5.5x as of each fiscal quarter end. Our consolidated leverage ratio was 5.48x as of July 31, 2016, which would have permitted approximately $8.1 million of additional borrowing capacity or approximately $1.5 million less EBITDA as of the fiscal year end. The narrow margin in this covenant was due primarily to several factors including higher debt caused by: (1) a $44.8 million unpaid accounts receivable balance due from Jamex at July 31, 2016; (2) the $45.9 million purchase of 2.4 million common units from Jamex in November 2015; (3) a $16.9 million purchase of 0.9 million of Ferrellgas Partners' common units  Table of Contents  from Jamex on September 1, 2016; (4) Bridger's growth capital expenditures of approximately $52.4 million; and lower EBITDA caused by: (1) the warm weather in fiscal 2016 which was 19% warmer than normal and 16% warmer than fiscal 2015, which led to reduced demand for propane; and (2) the decline in our water solutions business. As a result of these factors, and the Jamex settlement discussed above, on September 27, 2016, we entered into a fifth amendment to our secured credit facility and a fourth amendment to our accounts receivable securitization facility to modify our maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant.  During the quarter ended January 31, 2017, our results of operations were negatively impacted by sustained temperatures that were 14% warmer than normal throughout our operating areas. In order to avoid a violation of both the fifth amendment to our secured credit facility and the fourth amendment to our accounts receivable credit facility, Ferrellgas Partners sold in a private placement offering $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of additional 8.625% unsecured senior notes due 2020, at 96% of par. Net proceeds from the offering of approximately $165.9 million were contributed to the operating partnership, which used the net proceeds to repay borrowings under our secured credit facility.  As a result of the factors discussed above and the continued significantly warmer than normal temperatures during the quarter ended April 30, 2017, which were 19.5% warmer than normal throughout our operating area, on April 28, 2017, we entered into a sixth amendment to our secured credit facility and a fifth amendment to our accounts receivable facility to modify our maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant and our consolidated interest ratio covenant. The amendment to our secured credit facility also (1) reduces the amounts available to be borrowed from $700 million to $575 million, (2) increases the pricing of loans when our leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 6.00x from LIBOR plus 3.50% to LIBOR plus 3.75% and when our leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 7.00x from LIBOR plus 3.50% to LIBOR plus 4.00%, (3) limits the amount of distributions (other than distributions to Ferrellgas Partners for payments of interest payable on its unsecured notes) that the operating partnership may make to Ferrellgas Partners to $10 million per quarter (Ferrellgas Partners' current distribution rate is $9.8 million per quarter) until the leverage ratio is less than 5.50x, (4) reduces the amount of investments we can make when our leverage ratio is greater than 5.50x from $200 million to $50 million, and (5) requires us to reduce our secured credit facility with 50% of the net cash proceeds received from any equity sale.  On April 28, 2017, the maximum consolidated leverage covenant was modified as follows:   Maximum leverage ratio Maximum leverage ratio Date (prior to amendments) (after amendments) April 30, 2017 5.95 7.75 July 31, 2017 6.05 7.75 October 31, 2017 5.95 7.75 January 31, 2018 5.95 7.75 April 30, 2018 5.50 7.75 July 31, 2018 & thereafter 5.50 5.50  Our consolidated leverage ratio was 6.45x as of April 30, 2017; the margin allows for approximately $340.2 million of additional borrowing capacity or approximately $43.9 million less EBITDA. This covenant also restricts the operating partnership's ability to make payments to Ferrellgas Partners for purposes of funding quarterly common unit distributions as discussed above.  Consolidated interest coverage ratio  On April 28, 2017, the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio was modified as follows:   Minimum consolidated Minimum consolidated interest coverage interest coverage ratio ratio Date (prior to amendments) (after amendments) April 30, 2017 2.50 1.75 July 31, 2017 2.50 1.75 . . .

We take pride in this position, and the peace of mind it provides our stakeholders.

As of March 31, 2017, we have 97,152,665 units, with our employees indirectly owning 22.8 million units of the partnership through an Employee Stock Ownership Plan.

Ferrellgas At A Glance

Distribution Policy
Our current cash distribution is $0.10 per common unit quarterly, or $0.40 per common unit annually. We have paid a quarterly cash distribution in each quarter since our initial public offering in 1994. Ferrellgas anticipates making a cash distribution on or around the 15th day of March, June, September, and December to investors of record on the applicable record dates.
Tax Information
Unitholders are partners in Ferrellgas and receive cash distributions. A partnership generally is not subject to federal or state income tax. The annual income, gains, losses, deductions, or credits of Ferrellgas flow through to its investors, who are required to report their allocated share of these amounts on their tax returns as though the investor had incurred these items directly.
Each March, investors receive Schedule K-1 tax packages that summarize their allocated share of Ferrellgas’ reportable tax items. In general, cash distributions received during the year should not be reported as taxable income even though those distributions may be shown on a statement issued by a broker. Only the amounts shown on the Schedule K-1 should be entered on investors’ tax returns.
It is the responsibility of each holder of Ferrellgas Partners, L.P units to investigate the legal and tax consequences of his or her investment under federal tax law and the laws of pertinent states and localities. You should consult your tax advisor regarding to these matters.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.
