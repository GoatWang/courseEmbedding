All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account. If a Household Annual Fee is due, the highest-value account in the client's household that is eligible to be charged a fee will be debited in September of each year.
Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others. Certain accounts cannot be included in a household. Please call us at 1-800-TRADERS for more information and to determine whether all eligible accounts have been included in your household. It is your responsibility to ensure that all eligible accounts are included in your household
*Other fees and commissions apply to a WellsTrade® account. For complete information on fees and commissions refer to the WellsTrade® Account Commissions and Fee Schedule on wellsfargo.com

	EXPLANATORY
	NOTE






	 





	On
	September 30, 2016, the Company filed its registration information on Form 10. The Company filed its First Amendment on October
	4 to add two exhibits related to cooperative agreements with the Yongan Government and Chizou Jiangnan provinces in China. This
	Second Amendment is being filed to disclose the terms and conditions of the Company’s Employment Agreement with Alton Perkins
	in serving as the Company’s Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer
	and Secretary. The Employment Agreement is dated July 1, 2016, but the effective date and compensation payout was October 12,
	2016. As a result of the stock issuance under the Employment Agreement, Mr. Perkins beneficially owns 110,117,593 shares of the
	Company’s common stock, or 87% of the issuance and outstanding shares of common stock in the Company.




	 




	This
	Second Amendment also amends Item 5 to disclose Mr. Perkins’ position with EXA, Inc., a former blank check company (“EXA”).
	The Company’s largest shareholder, AmericaTowne, Inc., a Delaware corporation, closed on the purchase of the majority and
	controlling interest of EXA on October 13, 2016. EXA is listed on the OTC:Pinks as “EXAI.”




	 




	 

	FORWARD
	LOOKING STATEMENTS





	 




	There
	are statements in this registration statement that are not historical facts. These “forward-looking statements” can
	be identified by use of terminology suggesting a belief in future performance and similar expressions. You should be aware that
	these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control. For a discussion of these
	risks, you should read this entire Registration Statement carefully. Although management believes that the assumptions underlying
	the forward looking statements included in this Registration Statement are reasonable, they do not guarantee our future performance,
	and actual results could differ from those contemplated by these forward looking statements. The assumptions used for purposes
	of the forward-looking statements specified in the following information represent estimates of future events and are subject
	to uncertainty as to possible changes in economic, legislative, industry, and other circumstances. As a result, the identification
	and interpretation of data and other information and their use in developing and selecting assumptions from and among reasonable
	alternatives require the exercise of judgment. To the extent that the assumed events do not occur, the outcome may vary substantially
	from anticipated or projected results, and, accordingly, no opinion is expressed on the achievability of those forward-looking
	statements. In the light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the results and events contemplated
	by the forward-looking statements contained in this Registration Statement will in fact transpire. You are cautioned not to place
	undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their dates. We do not undertake any obligation to
	update or revise any forward-looking statements.




	 





	Item 1. Description of
	Business.





	 





	(a) General Development
	of Business





	 




	We
	are an operating company engaged in the development and the exporting of modular energy efficient technology and processes that
	allow government and private enterprises in China to use US-based methods for creating modular spaces, facilities, and properties.
	We are in the business of all aspects of modular construction, including but not limited to, (a) the furtherance of modular construction
	technology, education and development in developed and undeveloped countries, (b) acquisition and/or installation of construction
	equipment, materials, furnishings, adware, insulation, flooring, roofing, wiring, plumbing, heating and air conditioning, and
	landscaping, and (c) other businesses directly or tangentially related to these lines of services, including assisting businesses
	and entrepreneurs in securing naming, licensing or promotional rights, driving internet and media traffic, increasing visibility
	of product and name recognition, and other services. As with any business plan that is aspirational in nature, there is no assurance
	we will be able to accomplish all of our objectives or that we will be able to meet our financing needs to accomplish our objectives;
	however, we believe that we are not a “shell company,” as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. Our CIK number
	is 0001697426, and we have selected June 30 as our fiscal year.

	We
	are currently evaluating a physical location for our operations in China along with a manufacturing facility. Our principal executive
	offices are located at 4700 Homewood Court, Suite 100 in Raleigh, North Carolina. We are registered as a foreign business entity
	in the State of North Carolina. We lease the office space from Yilaime Corporation, a Nevada corporation doing business in North
	Carolina, and a related party to the Company, as set forth below.




	 




	The
	Company was incorporated on January 2, 1969 as United Gold & Silver Co. (“UGS”). On February 17, 1971, UGS merged
	with Lucky Irish Silver, Inc., a Montana corporation, and Deep Creek Mines, Inc., a Washington corporation, in which the surviving
	entity’s name remained USG. On November 29, 1999, USG merged with Auto America, Inc., (“Auto America”), a Delaware
	corporation, through the filing of Articles of Merger resulting in the surviving entity changing its name from USG to Auto America.
	From 2002 to 2007, the State of Washington automatically filed numerous Certificates of Administrative Dissolutions for Auto America
	for failure to file annual reports. On May 14, 2007, Auto America filed its final Application of Reinstatement resulting in restoring
	the Company to good standing. Also, on May 14, 2007, Auto America filed Amended Articles of Incorporation changing its name to
	Charter Equities, Inc. (“Charter Equities”). Charter Equities converted to an Arizona corporation on January 23, 2008.
	Shortly thereafter, the Company converted to Nevada corporation and changed its name to Global Recycle Energy, Inc. We amended
	our articles of incorporation on June 27, 2016, changing our name to ATI Modular Technology Corp.




	  





	(b)
	Description of Registrant’s Plan of Operation






	 





	As
	of the filing of this Registration Statement, we are in the first quarter of our fiscal year. Our focus at this time is on performing
	our duties and obligations under a series of pending operational agreements, discussed below.




	 




	As
	set forth below, the Company intends on relying on other businesses controlled by our sole director and officer, and beneficial
	owner of the majority shares of common stock in the Company – Alton Perkins, in implementing its business plan.




	 




	Mr.
	Perkins is the control person of Yilaime Corporation, AmericaTowne and AXP Holding Corporation. At this time, the purpose of the
	Company is to service the construction and related technology needs of AmericaTowne under AmericaTowne’s agreements with
	the Shexian County Investment Promotion Bureau in developing an AmericaTowne community in the Hanwang mountains in Shexian, China.
	The Company also intends on supporting these services in other AmericaTowne ventures at the invitation of the Xiamen Longyan City
	Chamber of Commerce, Xiamen/Longyan China and the Xiamen City Growth Planning Agency in developing an AmericaTowne Community and
	an International School in Longyan County China.




	 




	The
	related export services rendered to the Company in the implementation of its business plan cannot be provided by AmericaTowne
	or through the AmericaTowne relationship. In order to avoid conflicts of interest, Mr. Perkins is of the opinion that there must
	be a separate and distinct agreement between, in this case, the Company and AXP Holding Corporation. Furthermore, although other
	similar IC-DISC entities exist, the Company is able to obtain better terms and conditions from AXP Holding Corporation in light
	of Mr. Perkins’ control of AXP Holding Corporation.




	 




	AmericaTowne’s
	Board of Directors determined that operating and controlling a separate but related entity focused on the development and the
	exporting of modular energy efficient technology and processes for government and private enterprises in China would be more prudent
	from a risk mitigation and operational standpoint than providing these services under the AmericaTowne business plan. Furthermore,
	the intent of the Company is to expand its services and relationships to other similar endeavors in projects not related to AmericaTowne,
	thus the need to maintain and operate a separate entity.

	Cooperative
	Agreement (Shexian County Government, China)





	 




	The
	Company’s majority and controlling shareholder – AmericaTowne, is a party under the Cooperative Agreement with the
	Shexian County Investment Promotion Bureau (the “Shexian Agreement”). Under the Shexian Agreement, AmericaTowne and
	the Shexian County Bureau have agreed to a partnership in furthering the development of an AmericaTowne community in the Hanwang
	mountains. Although not definitive at this time, the parties have agreed that, in consideration for AmericaTowne’s investment
	of approximately $30,000,000 into the development, plus any additional tax paid to the local government, where applicable, the
	Shexian County Bureau will dedicate local resources, including land (which AmericaTowne would be required to obtain rights through
	local bid invitation), and participation with AmericaTowne in an agreed upon equity split through a future definitive agreement.




	 




	The
	Company will be providing construction and technology services to AmericaTowne in facilitating AmericaTowne’s obligations
	under the Shexian Agreement. The Company’s ability to generate revenue under its agreement with AmericaTowne could be impaired
	in the event AmericaTowne is not able to meet its obligations under the Shexian Agreement. Furthermore, Mr. Perkins, as a control
	person of each entity, might elect to forego certain obligations of AmericaTowne under the Shexian Agreement or not enter into
	a more definitive agreement with the Shexian County Bureau, which in turn, could impact the Company’s ability to meet its
	business plan set forth herein.








	Investment
	and Cooperation Agreement for ATI Modular Green Building Manufacturing Project (Jiangnan)






	 




	On
	September 8, 2016, the Company entered into the Investment and Cooperation Agreement for ATI Modular Green Building Manufacturing
	Project with the Jiangnan Industry Zone in Anhui Province (the “Jiangnan Agreement”). Under the Jiangnan Agreement,
	the Company has agreed to manufacture and install modular buildings, and provide research into the development of green building
	module manufacturing. The Company has agreed to provide appropriate technology and intelligent systems in providing modular building
	lifecycle services. The location of the planned project is the New Material Industry Park in the Jiangnan Industry Zone in Anhui
	Province. The parties have projected a cost of $30,000,000.




	 




	The
	Company has agreed to grant the Jiangnan Industry Zone audit, access, supervision, inspection and other rights. The Jiangnan Industry
	Zone has agreed to coordinate any and all necessary services in securing benefits associated with the Company being a foreign
	investment enterprise, including but not limited to, providing the site for the manufacturing facility, tax relief, access to
	financing and a “Project Headquarter” for the Company, which is defined in the Jiangnan Agreement.




	 




	The
	Jiangnan Agreement is not a definitive agreement; rather, it is a memorialization of the parties’ future intent as to the
	subject matter therein. The Company’s business plans and objectives could be impaired in the event the parties do not reach
	a definitive agreement.

	Investment
	and Cooperation Agreement for ATI Modular Green Building Manufacturing Project (Yongan)





	 




	On
	September 9, 2016, the Company entered into the Investment and Cooperation Agreement for ATI Modular Green Building Manufacturing
	Project with the Yongan government in the Fujian province (the “Yongan Agreement”). Under the Yongan Agreement, similar
	to the Jiangnan Agreement, the Company has agreed to manufacture and install modular buildings, and provide research into the
	development of green building module manufacturing. The Company has agreed to provide appropriate technology and intelligent systems
	in providing modular building lifecycle services. The location of the planned project is Yongan city in the Fujian province, China.
	The parties have projected a cost of $30,000,000.




	 




	The
	Company has agreed to grant the Yongan government audit, access, supervision, inspection and other rights. The Yongan government
	has agreed to coordinate any and all necessary services in securing benefits associated with the Company being a foreign investment
	enterprise, including but not limited to, providing the site for the manufacturing facility, tax relief, access to financing and
	a “Project Headquarter” for the Company, which is defined in the Yongan Agreement.




	 




	The
	Yongan Agreement is not a definitive agreement; rather, it is a memorialization of the parties’ future intent as to the
	subject matter therein. The Company’s business plans and objectives could be impaired in the event the parties do not reach
	a definitive agreement.




	 











	Sales
	and Support Services Agreement (Yilaime Corporation)





	 




	On
	June 27, 2016, we entered into a Sales and Support Services Agreement with Yilaime Corporation, a Nevada corporation (“Yilaime”).
	Yilaime is controlled by Alton Perkins, who is our sole director and officer. Yilaime, and another related-party – Yilaime
	Corporation of NC, Inc. (“Yilaime NC”), are the holders of the majority of issued and outstanding shares of common
	stock in AmericaTowne, Inc. (“ATI”), a Delaware corporation and fully-reporting company with the United States Securities
	and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Mr. Perkins is also the Trustee of the Alton & Xiang Mei Lin Perkins Family
	Trust (“Perkins Trust”) and the AXP Nevada Asset Protection Trust 1 (“AXP”), which holds 5,100,367 and
	120,000 shares, respectively, of the issued and outstanding common stock in ATI. Mr. Perkins is the beneficial owner of 20,674,484
	shares of ATI, which equals 90.11% of issued and outstanding shares. Mr. Perkins is the beneficial owner of the majority and controlling
	interest in the Company through his direct holdings, and beneficial holdings through Yilaime, AXP and the Perkins Trust. ATI,
	Perkins Trust and Mr. Perkins beneficially own 110,117,593 shares, or 86%, of the Company’s common stock.




	 




	Under
	the Services Agreement, Yilaime will provide the Company with marketing, sales and support services in the Company’s pursuit
	of ATI Modular business in China in consideration of a commission equal to 10% of the gross amount of monies procured for the
	Company through Yilaime’s services. In consideration of the right to receive this commission, Yilaime has agreed to pay
	the Company a quarterly fee of $250,000 starting on July 1, 2016. The Services Agreement is set to expire on June 10, 2020, absent
	early termination for breach thereof by either party. Yilaime retains an option to extend the term under its sole discretion until
	June 10, 2025 by providing written notice to the Company by March 10, 2019. Yilaime has agreed to be the Company’s exclusive
	independent contractor in providing the services in the Services Agreement, and has agreed to a non-compete and non-circumvent
	agreement.




	 




	Yilaime
	is obligated to provide support services only in a manner that is deemed commercially acceptable by Yilaime and Yilaime has the
	sole right to determine the means, manner and method by which services will be provided and at the time and location of its choosing.
	Furthermore, as the control person of Yilaime, Mr. Perkins might make decisions he deems are in the best interests of Yilaime,
	which might be to the detriment of the goals and objectives of the Company.

	Modular
	Construction & Technology Services Agreement (AmericaTowne)





	 




	On
	June 28, 2016, we entered into a Modular Construction & Technology Services Agreement (the “Modular Services Agreement”)
	with AmericaTowne Inc. (“ATI”), a Delaware corporation and fully-reporting company with the United States Securities
	and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The impetus behind the Modular Services Agreement was the Company’s Cooperative
	Agreement with the Shexian County Government, China. Under the Cooperative Agreement, ATI and the Shexian County Bureau have agreed
	to a partnership in furthering the development of an AmericaTowne community in the Hanwang mountains, Shexian, China. In addition,
	ATI, at the invitation of the Xiamen Longyan City Chamber of Commerce, Xiamen/Longyan China and the Xiamen City Growth Planning
	Agency plan to pursue the development of an AmericaTowne Community and an International School in Longyan County China.




	 




	Under
	the Modular Services Agreement, ATI Modular shall provide the

	research, development, training
	and modular technology in a manner deemed commercially acceptable by ATI based on its commercially reasonable requirements, plans
	and specifications, which shall be agreed upon in advance of any substantial and material construction.

	ATI will pay the
	Company a quarterly fee of $125,000 per quarter. The initial fee was paid upon signing the Modular Services Agreement. The Services
	Agreement is set to expire on June 10, 2020, absent early termination for breach thereof by either party. ATI retains an option
	to extend the term under its sole discretion until June 10, 2025 by providing written notice to the Company by March 10, 2019.
	Yilaime has agreed to be the Company’s exclusive independent contractor in providing the services in the Services Agreement,
	and has agreed to a non-compete and non-circumvent agreement.




	  





	Interest
	Charge – Domestic International Sales Agreement (AXP Holding Corporation)





	 




	On
	June 29, 2016, we entered into an IC-DISC Service Provider Agreement with AXP Holding Corporation, a Nevada corporation (“AXP
	Holding”) and related party to the Company through Mr. Perkins control of AXP Holding. AXP Holding is an Interest Charge
	- Domestic International Sales Corporation, or “IC-DISC”. AXP IC-DISC tax-exempt status was authorized and approved
	by the United States Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service. As an IC-DISC, AXP Holding may, under certain conditions,
	act as a sister corporation to entities and provide services to assist a company in obtaining lower tax rates on export income.
	In addition to the export tax savings provided by AXP, AXP can provide an additional array of services including promoting the
	Company’s export activities, purchasing receivables from the Company at a discount through a factoring relationship, and
	providing the Company with working capital loans.




	 




	The
	term under the IC-DISC Service Provider Agreement is set to expire on December 6, 2019, absent early termination for breach thereof
	by either party. AXP retains the right to extend the term, exercising its sole discretion, to December 6, 2024 by providing written
	notice to the Company by November 6, 2019. AXP has agreed to a non-compete and non-circumvent in providing the services under
	the IC-DISC Service Provider Agreement.




	 




	The
	Company has agreed to pay AXP a commission fee up to the greater of 50% of the Company’s export net income or 4% of the
	Company’s export gross receipts. The Company will determine the exact amount and the method of payment of the commission
	fee. The commission fee shall be paid at the option of the Company periodically throughout the year, but no later than December
	31 on annual basis. If there is no commission fee due to no export sales, the Company will pay AXP an export service fee of $50,000.
	The export service fee, if any, is due on or before December 31 on an annual basis.

	-









	 









	In
	addition, for referring businesses from the Company’s “Export Platform” or “Community,” AXP agrees
	to pay the Company 25% of each “Sales Export Service Fee” charged and received as an “IC-DISC Commission”
	from each Exporter or Licensee resulting from participating in the Export Platform or Community. This fee is called a “Group
	Export Consulting Fee” in the IC-DISC Service Provider Agreement, and is due no later than fifteen business days after receipt
	from the Exporter or Licensee, but no later than December 31 on an annual basis. For illustrative purposes, if AXP receives and
	or charges an Exporter 50% of its net export sales as a commission, and that value is $100,000, AXP would owe the Company 25%,
	or $25,000. Furthermore, during the term, the Company shall pay AXP a flat fee of $5,000 per transaction for purchasing receivables
	from the Company, plus an interest rate for such factoring at the prime rate plus one-percent.




	 




	The
	Company is in the early stages of its operations, and many of its plans and objectives are aspirational in nature, and thus might
	never come to fruition. At this time, the Company plans to retain engineering and architectural firms based in the United States
	who have extensive experience in developing modular structures in the United States, China and other foreign locations based on
	market demand, which has not been thoroughly researched to date. The Company has been focused on obtaining quotes, negotiating
	formal engagements and researching all aspects of the modular construction industry. While the infrastructure is still in the
	developmental stage, the Company is confident that it has the experience, or access to those with experience, in the modular construction
	field.




	 




	The
	Company plans on engaging in onsite placement and delivery of modular structures. Mr. Perkins has extensive experience in operating
	business in China. One of the reasons that Mr. Perkins was sought out and invited to participate in developing the modular industry
	in China is that he was the co-chairman of a construction company in China - Yilaime Foreign Partnership in Henghsui China. His
	experience with Yilaime Foreign Partnership allows ATI Modular to call on local companies in China as well as modular companies
	and experts in the United States to help provide on-site services. Yilaime Foreign Partnership is not a related party to the Company,
	ATI, Yilaime or AXP.




	 




	In
	addition, the Company recently joined the Modular Building Institute in Charlottesville, Virginia. In September of 2016, Mr. Perkins
	attended the Institute’s annual exposition in order to line up available suppliers, and experts in the modular construction
	field.




	 




	We
	intend on offering support services in all phases of modular construction. Our approach will be to focus on exporting United States
	based technology, services and equipment, and general “know-how.” Exporters in our related company, AmericaTowne,
	are experienced in the modular field and we plan on allowing those experienced exporters to participate in various levels of our
	program.




	 




	The
	Company currently does not have a principal supplier of raw materials. The Company has identified potential sources of raw materials
	in the United States through its membership in the Modular Building Institute. One of our primary challenges will be pricing the
	source of raw materials and delivery to China. We are also looking to potential raw material sources in China.




	 




	To
	operate within China, the Company requires approval of government officials in China. In both cases where the Company has signed
	Cooperative Agreements (and in the case of the Shexian Agreement), and at the invitation of the local government, we have the
	approval to register and conduct business.

	Emerging
	Growth Company






	 





	We
	are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. We shall continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest
	of:




	 




	(a)
	the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as such amount
	is indexed for inflation every 5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers
	published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more;




	 




	(b)
	the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities
	of the issuer pursuant to an effective IPO registration statement;




	 




	(c)
	the date on which such issuer has, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt;

	As
	an emerging growth company we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes Oxley. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish information
	in their annual reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.
	This statement shall also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires that the
	registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal
	control structure and procedures for financial reporting.




	 




	As
	an emerging growth company we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require
	the shareholder approval of executive compensation and golden parachutes. We have elected to use the extended transition period
	for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption
	of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards
	apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply
	with public company effective dates.

	Our

	Management’s Discussion
	and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.





	 










	In
	fiscal year 2016, the Company achieved $125,000 in revenue. The Company's revenue recognition policies comply with FASB ASC Topic 605.
	The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition.
	The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable
	and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,(ii) the product
	has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv)
	collectability is reasonably assured. In fiscal year 2016, the Company achieved $125,000 in revenue under the Modular Services
	Agreement with ATI.




	 




	We
	can make no assurances that we will find commercial success in any of our products. We also rely upon the Sales and Support Services
	Service Agreement with Yilaime for revenues. We are implementing a new business plan and have very limited experience in sales
	expectations and forecasting in this area. We also have not fully discovered any seasonality to our business as we end operations
	for the fourth quarter of 2016. Entering the first Quarter of the next fiscal year, we intend on relying on both Yilaime and AmericaTowne,
	Inc. for operational support. If we cannot achieve independent commercial success, we may need to continue to rely on Yilaime
	and AmericaTowne for support. If either company at any time decides to alter or change materially our arrangement, we could experience
	a material adverse effect on the Company. Additionally, the results of operations are based upon a limited view since the controlling
	interest was acquired and a new business plan implemented.

	During
	fiscal year 2016, the Company had sales of $125,000, compared to 2015 sales of $0. Our sales of $125,000 was derived from the
	Modular Services Agreement with ATI.




	 




	We
	can make no assurances that we will find commercial success in any of our revenue producing contracts. We are implementing a new
	business plan and thus have very limited experience in sales expectations and forecasting. We also have not fully discovered any
	seasonality to our business as we began operations in the first quarter of 2017.

	Our

	our business plan. Compared to 2015, our operating expenses increased $128,693. The increase is due to implementing our new business
	model.




	 




	Net Income




	 




	As
	a result of our operations, for 2016, the Company reported net loss after provision for income tax of $3,693. In 2015 our net
	loss was $3,859. The slight decrease in net loss is due to starting to implement our business plan.

	Cash
	Provided by Operating Activities




	 




	Compared
	to 2015, increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2016 is mainly due to increase in deposit from customers.




	 




	Cash
	Used in Financing Activities




	 




	We
	spent $4,156 on fixed assets for 2016.




	 




	As
	of June 30,2016, the Company had sufficient amount of cash to operate its business at the current level for the next twelve months,
	but insufficient cash to achieve our business goals and initiatives set forth above. To address the cash situation, the Company
	continues to manage its cash accounts and receivables closely.




	 




	To
	date, we have been able to meet all of our account payable obligations within a five to ten day window. If required, we can extend
	this window to improve our cash flow position. Additionally, we have a plan to increase sales. There is no assurance that we will
	be able to maintain this level of operations.




	  




	The
	success of our business plan beyond the next twelve months is contingent upon us growing our business, keeping costs down, increasing
	revenue and obtaining additional equity and/or debt financing. We intend to fund operations through our pro-active efforts to
	monitor receivables, and debt and/or equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund our capital expenditures,
	working capital, or other cash requirements. We do not have any formal commitments or arrangements for the sales of stock or the
	advancement or loan of funds at this time. There is no assurance that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable
	terms, or at all or that our receivable plan will be effective in the future.




	 




	Plan
	of Operation and Cash Requirements




	 




	The
	Company anticipates that its expenses over the next twelve months will be approximately $1,500,000 as described in the table below.
	These estimates may change significantly depending on the nature of our business activities and our ability to raise capital from
	our shareholders or other sources.

	Our
	other administrative expenses for the year will consist primarily of transfer agent fees, bank and interest charges and general
	office expenses. The professional fees are related to our regulatory filings throughout the year and include legal, accounting
	and auditing fees.




	 




	Based
	on our planned expenditures, we will require approximately $1,500,000 to proceed with our business plan over the next twelve months.
	If we secure less than the full amount of financing that we require, we will not be able to carry out our complete business plan
	and we will be forced to proceed with a scaled back business plan based on our available financial resources.




	 




	We
	intend to raise the balance of our cash requirements for the next twelve months from private placements, shareholder loans or
	possibly a registered public offering (either self-underwritten or through a broker-dealer). If we are unsuccessful in raising
	enough money through such efforts, we may review other financing possibilities such as bank loans. At this time we do not have
	a commitment from any third-party to provide us with financing. There is no assurance that any financing will be available to
	us or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.




	  




	Even
	though we plan to raise capital through equity or debt financing, we believe that the latter may not be a viable alternative for
	funding our operations, as we do not have sufficient tangible assets to secure any such financing. We anticipate that any additional
	funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. At the close of 2016, we are considering financing
	arrangements for our common stock. However, the arrangements are not final and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be
	able to raise sufficient funds from the sale of our common stock to finance our operations. In the absence of such financing,
	we may be forced to abandon our business plan.




	 




	 

	Quantitative and
	Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.





	 




	We
	have not utilized any derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts, options and swaps, forward foreign exchange
	contracts or interest rate swaps and futures. We believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities.
	We do not have any borrowings and, consequently, we are not affected by changes in market interest rates. We do not currently
	have any sales or own assets and operate facilities in countries outside the United States and, consequently, we are not effected
	by foreign currency fluctuations or exchange rate changes.  Overall, at this time, we believe that our exposure to interest
	rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate changes is not material to our financial condition or results of operations.




	 





	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements





	 




	We
	have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
	on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
	or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.

	Item
	3. Properties.





	 




	We
	currently do not own any properties. We rent office space and equipment from Yilaime for $2,500 per month. The Company currently
	has no policy with respect to investments or interests in real estate, real estate mortgages or securities of, or interests in,
	persons primarily engaged in real estate activities.




	 





	Item
	4. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management






	 





	The
	following table sets forth the ownership of our common stock by each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than
	5% of our outstanding common stock as a group as of September 25, 2014. There are not any pending arrangements that may cause
	a change in control. The information presented below has been presented in accordance with the rules of the SEC and is not necessarily
	indicative of ownership for any other purpose.




	 




	A
	person is deemed to be a “beneficial owner” of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct
	the voting of the security or the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security. A person is deemed to own beneficially
	any security as to which such person has the right to acquire sole or shared voting or investment power within 60 days through
	the conversion or exercise of any convertible security, warrant, option or other right. More than one person may be deemed to
	be a beneficial owner of the same securities. The percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is
	calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially owned by such person, which includes the number of shares as to which
	such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days, by the sum of the number of shares outstanding
	as of such date plus the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60
	days. Consequently, the denominator used for calculating such percentage may be different for each beneficial owner.

	Alton Perkins

	Chief Executive, Secretary, Treasurer and Director





	 




	Alton
	Perkins – Sole Director and Officer

	. Mr. Perkins has been the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief
	Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary of the Company since the change in control event on June 27, 2016. Mr. Perkins serves
	in these same capacities for ATI, Yilaime, Yilaime NC and AXP Holding. Mr. Perkins is a former decorated Air Force Officer and
	Missile Launch Officer with 22 years of military service, who graduated from the University of Southern Illinois with a B.S. in
	Business Administration and a M.B.A. from the University of North Dakota. Between 1988 and 1997, he held CEO positions with start-up
	companies in the jet fuels, defense contracting, construction, business consulting and development, and real estate industries.
	Between 1997 and 2009, Mr. Perkins served as the CEO and Chief Technology Officer for internet, childcare operations, media, and
	realty development companies. From 2009 to the present, Mr. Perkins has served as Chairman of Yilaime and its related entities
	– ATI, Yilaime NC and AXP Holding. Mr. Perkins has expertise in conducting business in China. Living and working in China
	studying Chinese consumer habits, working with Chinese entrepreneurs and government agencies, he developed the AmericaTowne®
	and AmericaStreet™ concepts.




	In
	addition to serving as Co-Chair of Yilaime Foreign Invested Partnership in China, an entity focused on real estate development,
	he served as a chief consultant to a major Chinese chemical company responsible for funding and technology transfer, and coordinated
	business with USA based auditors, DOW Chemical and USA Exim Bank. In addition, Mr. Perkins is the recently appointed sole director
	and officer with EXA, Inc., a Florida corporation (“EXA”). The Company’s largest shareholder – ATI, closed
	on the purchase of the majority and controlling interest of EXA on October 13, 2016. EXA is listed on the OTC:Pinks as “EXAI.”
	No Company funds were used to purchase ATI’s interest in EXA.






	 




	Mr.
	Perkins is subject to a Desist and Refrain Order dated March 21, 2008 (the “Order”) issued by the State of California’s
	Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, Department of Corporations (the “Department”). In 2003, Mr. Perkins had
	been the Chief Executive Officer of Sunburst Holding Corporation (“Sunburst”). The Department alleged that in May
	of 2003, Sunburst and Mr. Perkins offered and sold securities through general solicitation to finance art-related activities.
	Neither Sunburst nor Mr. Perkins had been issued a permit or other form of qualification authorizing the sales in California.
	The Department alleged that Sunburst and Mr. Perkins omitted material facts, and more specifically, that Mr. Perkins had pled
	no contest to felony counts related to an indictment for fraudulent misappropriation of funds in a fiduciary capacity in Maryland,
	and had received a five-year suspended sentence.




	 




	The
	Department was of the opinion that investments offered and sold by Sunburst and Mr. Perkins constituted securities, which were
	subject to qualification under the California law, and that the securities were offered without being qualified, and were not
	exempt, in violation of California law. The Department ordered Sunburst and Mr. Perkins to desist and refrain from the further
	offer or sale of securities in California unless and until qualification has been made under the law or unless exempt. The Department
	also ordered that Sunburst and Mr. Perkins to desist and refrain from offering or selling or buying or offering to buy securities
	in California, including but not limited to stock, by means of any written or oral communication which includes an untrue statement
	of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
	under which they are made, not misleading.




	 











	-

	15

	-









	 











	Mr.
	Perkins has been in compliance with the Order since issuance. The Order is not related in any manner with respect to the Company
	or its related parties. To the extent the Order was entered (i.e. only copy available for inspection by management is an unsigned
	version), there is no restriction on Mr. Perkins from engaging in an offering in California provided he complies with the appropriate
	disclosures and laws. The Company is not aware of any similar orders in any other jurisdiction.




	 




	The
	Company further discloses that the aforementioned Order references the failure of Mr. Perkins to disclose a conviction in the
	Circuit Court for Prince George’s County, Maryland, for fraudulent misappropriation by a fiduciary and other convictions.
	The Company is not aware of any such conviction; furthermore, Mr. Perkins has disclosed to the Company that he obtained a judgment
	out of the Superior Court of Mecklenburg County in North Carolina in the amount of $125,000 against the individual who defamed
	him and published comments related to the false conviction.




	 




	(b)
	Significant Employees. None




	 




	(c)
	Family Relationships. Mr. Perkins’ wife, Xiang Mei Lin Perkins, is a beneficiary under the Perkins Trust.




	 




	(d)
	Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings.




	  




	Except
	as otherwise disclosed, no officer, director, or persons nominated for such positions, promoter or significant employee has been
	involved in the last ten years in any of the following:




	 






	 




	•




	Any
	bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either
	at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	•




	Any
	conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other
	minor offenses);






	 




	 




	 






	 




	•




	Being
	subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction,
	permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities
	or banking activities; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	•




	Being
	found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
	to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated.






	 




	(e)
	The Board of Directors acts as the Audit Committee and the Board has no separate committees. The Company has no qualified financial
	expert at this time because it has not been able to hire a qualified candidate. Further, the Company believes that it has inadequate
	financial resources at this time to hire such an expert. The Company intends to continue to search for a qualified individual
	for hire.

	Code of Ethics. We do not currently have a code of ethics.

	Mr.
	Perkins beneficial ownership in ATI is set forth in this Registration Statement. ATI, formerly known as Alpine 5, Inc., filed
	its Form 10-12G/A on June 13, 2014. ATI ceased to be a blank check company on March 3, 2015 upon the Commission having no further
	comment on ATI’s disclosures on Form 8-K, Item 5.06 (Change in Shell Status). ATI is publicly reporting with the Commission.
	ATI is engaged in exporting and consulting in the exporting of American made goods, products and services to China and Africa
	through strategic relationships in China and in the United States, which is referred to internally by the Company as the ‘AmericaTowne
	Platform.’ The Company's forward-looking vision is to create a physical location called AmericaTowne in China that incorporates
	business selling the ‘American experience’ in housing, retail, education, senior care and entertainment.




	 




	ATI
	is the majority and controlling shareholder of ATI Nationwide Holding Corp., a Florida corporation (“ATI Nationwide”).
	ATI Nationwide is formerly known as EXA, Inc. ATI Nationwide is listed on the OTC Market Place Pink Sheets as “EXAI.”
	ATI Nationwide has a Notice of Corporate Action currently pending with FINRA changing its name and requesting a change in symbol.
	ATI acquired the controlling interest in ATI Nationwide through a private stock acquisition with Carson Holdings, LLC, a Utah
	limited liability company, and Joseph C. Passalaqua, an individual, which closed on October, 7 2016. ATI Nationwide is a blank
	check company; however, through ATI’s performance under the Master Joint Venture and Operational Agreement with Nationwide
	Microfinance Limited, a Ghanaian corporation, which has been disclosed by ATI on Form 8-K dated July 14, 2016, ATI Nationwide
	is in the process of taking necessary steps to cease being a blank check company; however, there is no guarantee that it will
	be able to cease being a blank check company.




	  





	Item
	6. Executive Compensation.





	 




	On
	July 1, 2016, the Company entered into an Employment Agreement with Mr. Perkins to serve as the Company’s Chairman of the
	Board, President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary (the “Employment Agreement”).
	The term of the Employment Agreement is five years with successive one-year option terms. In consideration his services under
	the Employment Agreement, the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Perkin’s designee –
	the Perkins Trust, which is allowed for under Section 3.2 of the Employment Agreement.

	stock issuance is subject to certain lock-up provisions in the Employment Agreement, which are more thoroughly set forth in the
	enclosed exhibit. Until the Company acquires additional capital, it is not anticipated that Mr. Perkins, or any future officer
	or director will receive compensation from the Company other than reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf
	of the Company. In addition to this issuance, the Company agreed to issue Mr. Perkins, or his authorized designee, an option to
	purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company per year at any time prior to the conclusion of the first year
	of the Employment Agreement, i.e. prior to 365 days after execution of the Employment Agreement, at a price of 1.5% per share
	of the closing price of the Company’s stock quoted on a major exchange or OTC Market one business day before purchase, and
	annually thereafter for a total of 5 consecutive years. The shares purchased under this option are subject to all rights and lock-up
	restrictions set forth in the Employment Agreement.




	 




	Mr.
	Perkins, who is also a director, officer and control person of ATI, intends to devote very limited time to our affairs. Other
	than as set forth above, the Company has no stock option, retirement, pension, or profit sharing programs for the benefit of directors,
	officers or other employees, but our sole officer and director may recommend adoption of one or more such programs in the future.
	The Company does not have a standing compensation committee or a committee performing similar functions, since the Board of Directors
	has determined not to compensate the officer and director.



	 








	Item
	7. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.





	 




	The
	Company has not entered into, nor does it have plans to enter into, any related party transaction in excess of $120,000 since
	the beginning of its last year, i.e. since July 1, 2016. For those related party transactions entered into the preceding fiscal
	year, i.e. prior to July 1, 2016, we incorporate those disclosures set forth in Item 1(b). For these transactions, as disclosed
	above, Mr. Perkins has a direct and indirect material interest in our performance of those related-party transactions by virtue
	of his beneficial, and controlling, ownership in ATI, Yilaime and AXP Holding. The approximate dollar amount on an annual basis
	is: (a) Sales and Support Services Agreement with Yilaime is $1,000,000, (b) Modular Construction & Technology Services Agreement
	with ATI is $500,000, and (c) IC-DISC Service Provider Agreement with AXP Holding is a minimum of $50,000, and could exceed approximately
	$200,000 based on performance. Mr. Perkins approximate dollar value of the amount of the related party transactions is $1,550,000,
	not accounting for profit or loss.





	 





	We
	do not have a policy or procedures in place for the review, approval or ratification of any related-party transaction, other than,
	written consent in lieu of the meeting of the Board of Directors or shareholders, as the case may be, for the given transaction.
	The related party transactions set forth in Item 1(b) were approved by the Board of Directors, but not approved pursuant to any
	written policy or procedure. Our internal controls in the review, approval or ratification of related party transactions are not
	sufficient. The Company has no disclosures regarding promoters since none have been used over the past five years. The Company’s
	parent entity – ATI, owns 86% of the common shares of the Company, and thus has control over the affairs of the Company.




	 




	Mr.
	Perkins is involved in other business activities and may, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities. These
	other businesses might be vendors or service providers to the Company, e.g. ATI, Yilaime and AXP Holding, or might take more of
	Mr. Perkins’ time in providing director and officer services to the Company. Furthermore, a conflict of interest might arise
	if Mr. Perkins’ other business activities coincide with an event of the Company. As a result, Mr. Perkins would have to
	evaluate and act on a conflict in selecting between the Company and his other business interests. The Company has not formulated
	a policy for resolution of any conflict of interest.

	We do not have
	director independence under Item 407(a) of Regulation S-K. Pursuant to Article XI of the Company’s Bylaws, no contract or

	(d)      the
	fact of the common directorship, office or financial interest is not disclosed or known to the Director or Officer at the time
	the transaction is

	brought

	before the Board of Directors of the Corporation for such
	action.


	 


	Such interested Directors may be

	counted

	when

	determining

	the presence of a quorum at the Board of Directors' or

	meeting

	authorizing

	the

	or

	Item
	10. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities.





	 




	Within
	the past three years, the Company issued a total of 100,500,000 shares of unregistered securities. In 2016, the Company had issued
	100,000,000 shares to Joseph Arcaro (“Arcaro”) for services rendered in the amount of $100,000. ATI subsequently purchased
	these shares on June 2, 2016 in a private transaction without solicitation or through the use of a broker or intermediary. As
	a condition of closing the Stock Purchase Agreement with Arcaro, Arcaro facilitated the cancellation of 500,000 shares of the
	Company’s common stock previously issued in 2016 for rights under an oil lease. The Company has no further rights, title
	or interest in the oil lease. In both issuances, the Company relied on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
	We believe that Section 4(2) was available because neither of the issuances involved underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions;
	restrictive legends had been placed on the certificates; no sales were made by general solicitation; and the issuances were made
	to an accredited investor in consideration of a release of a debt obligation.




	  





	Item
	11. Description of Registrant’s Securities to be Registered

	.




	 





	Common
	Stock





	 




	The
	Company has 250,000,000 shares of authorized common stock (CUSIP# 00215H 103), of which, as of the end of its fiscal year had
	126,075,716 issued and outstanding. Of the amount of issued and outstanding, ATI owned a total of 100,000,000 shares as a result
	of the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement on June 6, 2016 with Arcaro, above.




	 




	Between
	June 13, 2016 and September 13, 2016, Mr. Perkins purchased on the open market, as trustee of the Alton & Xiang Mei Lin Perkins
	Family Trust (the “Perkins Trust”), with a tax identification number of 46-7513804, and individually, 15,964 shares
	and 101,629 shares, respectively, of the Company’s common stock at the average per share price of $1.91 and $.89, respectively.
	Perkins and Perkins Trust used personal funds for the purchase. The total number of shares issued and outstanding as of the date
	of this Registration Statement equals 126,615,309. ATI, Perkins Trust and Perkins beneficially own 110,117,593 shares, or 87%,
	of the Company’s common stock.




	 




	The
	holders of our common stock have equal ratable rights to dividends from funds legally available if and when declared by our board
	of directors; are entitled to share ratably in all of our assets available for distribution to holders of common stock upon liquidation,
	dissolution or winding up of our affairs; do not have preemptive, subscription or conversion rights and there are no redemption
	or sinking fund provisions or rights; and are entitled to one non-cumulative vote per share on all matters on which stockholders
	may vote. All shares of common stock now outstanding are fully paid and non-assessable and are fully paid for and non-assessable.
	 As of the date of this prospectus, we have not paid any cash dividends to stockholders.  The declaration of any future
	cash dividend will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements
	and financial position and our general economic condition.  It is our intention not to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable
	future, but rather to reinvest earnings, if any, in our business operations. We refer you to our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws
	and the applicable statutes of the State of Nevada for a more complete description of the rights and liabilities of holders of
	our securities.

	Item
	12. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.





	 




	Section
	78.7502 of the Nevada Revised Statutes empowers Nevada corporations to indemnify their officers and directors and further states
	that the indemnification provided by Section 78.7502 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking
	indemnification may be entitled under the articles of incorporation or any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
	directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office;
	thus, Section 78.7502 does not by itself limit the extent to which the Company may indemnify persons serving as its officers and
	directors. The Company’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws authorize the indemnification of the officers and directors
	of the Company as permitted by Section 78.7502.




	 




	The
	Board of Directors of the Company has concluded that, to retain and attract talented and experienced individuals to serve as officers
	and directors of the Company and to encourage such individuals to take the business risks necessary for the success of the Company,
	it is necessary for the Company to contractually indemnify its officers and directors, and to assume for itself liability for
	expenses and damages in connection with claims against such officers and directors in connection with their service to the Company,
	and has further concluded that the failure to provide such contractual indemnification could result in great harm to the Company
	and its stockholders.




	 




	Our
	Bylaws provide to the fullest extent permitted by law that our directors or officers, former directors and officers, and persons
	who act at our request as a director or officer of a body corporate of which we are a shareholder or creditor shall be indemnified
	by us. We believe that the indemnification provisions in our Bylaws are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors
	and officers. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors,
	officers or persons controlling ATI Modular pursuant to provisions of the State of Nevada, we have been informed that, in the
	opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM






	 




	To
	the Board of Directors and Stockholders of ATI Modular Technology Corp




	We
	have audited the accompanying balance sheets of ATI Modular Technology Corp as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related statement
	of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2016.
	ATI MODULAR TECHNOLOGY CORP's management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
	on these financial statements based on our audits.




	 




	We


	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
	Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
	the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
	an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial
	reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
	an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements;
	assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
	statement presentation.

	We

	believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
	our opinion.




	 




	In
	our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present

	fairly,

	in all material
	respects, the financial position of

	ATI

	Modular Technology Corp as of June 30, 2016
	and 2015, and the results of operations and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2016, in conformity
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
	in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company is still in development stage and has not created sufficient revenue to cover
	any operating losses it may

	incur.

	The Company has incurred accumulated deficit of
	$56,581 as of June 30, 2016 that includes loss of $3,693 for the year ended June 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt
	about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans concerning this matter are also described in Note 3. The
	accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	NOTE
	1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS




	 




	ATI


	Modular Technology Corp., defined above and herein as the “Company” or the “Issuer,”
	formerly Global Recycle

	Energy,

	Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the State
	of Nevada on March 7, 2008. The Company is engaged in the development and the exporting of modular energy efficient technology
	and processes that allow government and private enterprises in China to use US-based methods for creating modular spaces, facilities,
	and properties. The Company is currently evaluating a physical location for its operations in China along with a manufacturing
	facility. As with any business plan that is aspirational in nature, there is no assurance we will be able to accomplish all of
	our objective or that we will be able to meet our financing needs to accomplish our objectives.






	 




	The Company
	entered into the Modular Services Agreement with AmericaTowne, a related party and the majority and controlling shareholder of
	the Company, to support AmericaTowne’s obligations under the Shexian Agreement in designing, installing and manufacturing
	American modular technology for use in all government and private buildings throughout Shexian County, and elsewhere in China.
	The terms and conditions of the Modular Services Agreement with AmericaTowne and the Shexian Agreement are set forth above.




	 




	Also, the
	Company has entered into the Jiangnan Agreement and the Yongan Agreement in order to pursue the development of business opportunities
	involving modular technology and investments, and business development. While we plan to have robust operations in the United
	States and international locations to support the AmericaTowne concept and trade center, we expect the bulk of our operations
	and revenue will come from China.




	 




	China's
	economy and its government impact our revenues and operations. While AmericaTowne has an agreement in place with the government
	in Shexian, which we believe will lead to the development of a major manufacturing facility in Shexian, and in turn revenue to
	the Company through the Modular Services Agreement with AmericaTowne, there is no assurance that we will operate the facility
	successfully. Additionally, the Company will need government approval in China to operate other aspects of our business plan.
	There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining approvals from government entities to operate other aspects of our
	business plan. Finally, Mr. Perkins, as a control person of each entity – AmericaTowne and the Company, might elect to forego
	certain obligations of AmericaTowne under the Shexian Agreement or not enter into a more definitive agreement with the Shexian
	County Bureau, which in turn, could impact the Company’s ability to meet its business plan set forth herein.

	NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF
	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	Basis of Presentation





	 





	These
	financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
	("U.S. GAAP”).




	 




	Accounting Method





	 





	The
	Company's financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The Company has elected a fiscal year ending
	on June 30.




	 




	Use of Estimates





	 





	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
	at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. In the
	opinion of management, all adjustments necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading have been included.
	Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	 




	Financial Instruments





	 





	The
	carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, interest payable
	and short-term notes payable approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.




	 




	Cash Equivalents





	 





	The Company
	considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.




	  




	Accounts Receivable





	 





	Accounts'
	receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management provides for probable
	uncollected amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to an allowance for bad debts based on its assessment of the current
	status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are
	written off through a charge to the allowance for bad debts and a credit to accounts receivable.




	 




	Our
	bad debt policy is determined by the Company's periodic review of each account receivable for reasonable assurance of collection.




	 




	Factors
	considered are the exporter's financial condition, past payment history if any, any conversations with the exporter about the
	exporter's financial conditions and any other extenuating circumstances. Based upon the above factors the Company makes a determination
	whether the receivable are reasonable 2016 and 2015, based upon our limited history, our allowance for bad debt is just above
	bad debt we anticipate will be written off for the year.




	 









	F-

	7










	 









	Concentration of
	Credit Risk





	 





	Financial
	instruments that potentially subject the Company to a significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
	equivalents. The Company maintains deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits.
	However, management believes the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository
	institutions in which those deposits are held.




	 




	Property, Plant,
	and Equipment





	 





	Property,
	plant and equipment are initially recognized recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposals are reflected as gain or loss in the
	period of disposal. The cost of improvements that extend the life of plant and equipment are capitalized. These capitalized costs
	may include structural improvements, equipment and fixtures. All ordinary repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.




	 




	 Depreciation
	for financial reporting purposes is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets:




	 





	Office equipment


	5 years




	 



	For
	the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, depreciation expense is $0.




	 




	Income Taxes





	 





	Income
	taxes are provided in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ASC 740 Accounting for Income Taxes. A deferred
	tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry
	forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred
	tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion
	of all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes
	in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.




	 




	The
	Company was established under the laws of the State of Delaware and is subject to U.S. federal income tax and Delaware state income
	tax. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
	assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts and are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable
	to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary
	to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.




	 




	Earnings per Share





	 





	In
	February 1997, the FASB issued ASC 260, "Earnings per Share", which specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure
	requirements for earnings (loss) per share for entities with publicly held common stock. ASC 260 supersedes the provisions of
	APB No. 15, and requires the presentation of basic earnings (loss) per share and diluted earnings (loss) per share. The Company
	has adopted the provisions of ASC 260 effective (inception).




	 




	Basic
	earnings or net loss per share amounts are computed by dividing the net income or loss by the weighted average number of common
	shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are the same as basic earnings per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the
	Company.




	 











	F-

	Impact of New Accounting
	Standards





	 





	The
	Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company's
	results of operations, financial position, or cash flow.




	 




	Pushdown Accounting
	and Goodwill





	 





	Pursuant
	to applicable rules (FASB ASC 805-50-S99) the Company used push down accounting to reflect AmericaTowne Inc.’s purchase
	of 86% of the shares of the Company's common stock. Joseph Arcaro, the Company's prior controlling shareholder entered into an
	agreement to sell an aggregate of 100,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock to AmericaTowne Inc. effective upon the closing
	date of the Share Purchase Agreement dated June 2, 2016. Joseph Arcaro executed the agreement and owned no shares of the Company's
	common stock. This transaction resulted in AmericaTowne Inc. retaining rights, title and interest to 86% of issued and outstanding
	shares of common stock in the Company. Joseph Arcaro was not, nor has ever been, a related party to AmericaTowne.




	 




	The
	purchase cost for the agreement was $175,000. The implied fair value of the Company’s net assets is $203,133 which is used
	as a new accounting basis for its net assets. Since there was no assets on the company's book on June 6, 2016, to make the company's
	net assets $203,133, the Company recorded $206,992 in goodwill ($206,992-$3,859=$203,133; $3,859 was a liability of accounts payable).
	Therefore, in recognizing push down accounting, the Company's net asset increased by the amount reflected by Goodwill.




	  




	Revenue Recognition





	 





	The
	Company's revenue recognition policies comply with

	FASB

	ASC

	Topic

	605. The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the

	FASB

	Accounting Standards
	Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company
	considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an
	arrangement exists,




	(ii)
	the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable,
	and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.




	 




	The
	Company does not provide unconditional right of return, price protection or any other concessions to its customers.




	 




	There
	were no sales returns and allowances from inception to June 30, 2016.

	Valuation of Goodwill





	 





	We


	assess goodwill for potential impairments at the end of each fiscal year, or during the year
	if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. In evaluating
	goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood
	of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is not
	more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then no further testing of the goodwill
	assigned to the reporting unit is required. However, if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
	unit is less than its carrying value, then we perform a two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment
	and measure the amount of goodwill impairment to be recognized, if

	any.





	 




	In
	the first step of the review process, we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the
	estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further analysis is needed. If the estimated fair value
	of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we proceed to the second step of the review process to calculate the implied
	fair value of the reporting unit goodwill in order to determine whether any impairment is required.

	We

	calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting
	unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.
	If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, we recognize an impairment
	loss for that excess amount. In allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities
	of the reporting unit, we use industry and market data, as well as knowledge of the industry and our past experiences.




	 




	We


	base our calculation of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit on the income approach.
	For the income approach, we use internally developed discounted cash flow models that include, among others, the following assumptions:
	projections of revenues and expenses and related cash flows based on assumed long-term growth rates and demand trends; expected
	future investments to grow new units; and estimated discount rates.

	We

	base these
	assumptions on our historical data and experience, third-party appraisals, industry projections, micro and macro general economic
	condition projections, and our expectations.




	 




	We


	have had no goodwill impairment charges for the year ended June 30, 2016, and as of June
	30, 2016, the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its' respective carrying amount by more than 100 percent
	based on our models and assumptions.

	NOTE 3. GOING CONCERN






	 






	The
	Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable
	to a going concern that contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.




	 




	The
	Company is still in development stage and has not created sufficient revenue to cover any operating losses it may incur. The Company
	has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $56,581 as of June 30, 2016 that includes loss of $3,693
	for the year ended June 30, 2016. Management's plans include the raising of capital through the equity markets to fund future
	operations, seeking additional acquisitions, and generating of revenue through our business. However, there can be no assurances
	the Company will be successful in its efforts to secure additional equity financing and obtaining sufficient revenue producing
	contracts. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
	do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification
	of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty.




	 




	NOTE 4. ACCOUNT RECEIVABLES

	The
	nature of the accounts receivable for June 30, 2016 in the amount of $125,000 are for modular construction and technology services

	 NOTE 6. INCOME TAXES






	 






	Deferred
	income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
	reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

All investing involves some degree of risk, whether it is associated with market volatility, purchasing power or a specific security. There is no assurance any investment strategy will be successful or that a fund will meet its investment objectives. An investment in a mutual fund or exchange–traded fund (ETF) will fluctuate and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
*The $30 Household Annual Fee or the IRA Custodial Fee (for IRA only households) can be waived with one of the following for all WellsTrade accounts in your household as of June 30 each year: 1) electronic delivery only enrollment for statements, trade confirmations, other documents and shareholder communications (excluding tax documents/1099s), 2) linkage to the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program 3) household balances of $250,000 or more, 4) households with solely SEP IRA, or 5) Wells Fargo Private Bank account. If a Household Annual Fee is due, the highest-value account in the client's household that is eligible to be charged a fee will be debited in September of each year.
Households comprised only of IRA accounts will be subject to a $30 IRA Custodial Fee. Households with an IRA and any other account type that is not exempt from annual fee will be subject to the $30 Household Annual Fee. IRA Custodial Fee will be waived for households paying a household annual fee. If an IRA Custodial Fee is due, clients will receive a remittance notice in August 2017 with several payment options. If a payment option is not selected, the fee will be automatically deducted from the IRA in September 2017. If there is more than one non-exempt IRA in the household, the fee will be equally divided amongst the non-exempt IRAs.
The grouping of accounts into a household is based on account eligibility and family relationship such as children, parents, domestic partners, and others.
