Kensey Nash Corporation (KNSY) Announces Resignation of CFO  











Tweet








10/23/2008 6:36:04 AM


EXTON, Pa., Oct. 23 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kensey Nash Corporation (Nasdaq: KNSY - News) today announced that its Chief Financial Officer, Wendy F. DiCicco, C.P.A. has resigned to pursue other opportunities. Ms. DiCicco joined the company as Controller in April 1996 and became Chief Financial Officer in August 1998.

Ms. DiCicco's departure does not involve any issues with the company's accounting practices, financial statements or internal controls. She will remain with the company until her resignation becomes effective on November 15, 2008, following the Company's filing of its 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Ryan Lake, C.P.A., the company's Director of Finance, will assume her responsibilities in the interim until a replacement can be found.

"The Board and I wish to express our gratitude to Wendy for her many contributions and service over the past twelve years and wish her well in her future endeavors," said Joe Kaufmann, President and Chief Executive Officer.

"My years at Kensey Nash have been personally and professionally rewarding," stated Wendy DiCicco. "The company has experienced tremendous growth and achieved significant accomplishments. While I look forward to new opportunities ahead, I am optimistic about the continued future success of Kensey Nash," added DiCicco.

About Kensey Nash Corporation. Kensey Nash Corporation is a leading medical technology company providing innovative solutions and technologies for a wide range of medical procedures. The Company provides an extensive range of products into multiple medical markets, primarily sports medicine, spine, and endovascular markets. Many of the products are based on the Company's significant expertise in the design, development, manufacturing and processing of absorbable biomaterials, which has led to partnerships to commercialize technologies. Kensey Nash has also developed and commercialized a series of innovative endovascular products and recently completed the sale of this product line to Spectranetics Corporation. In conjunction with the sale transaction, the Company will continue to manufacture and develop these products for Spectranetics for a period of time. The Company is known as a pioneer in the field of arterial puncture closure, as the inventor and developer of the Angio-Seal(TM) Vascular Closure Device, which is licensed to St. Jude Medical, Inc.
