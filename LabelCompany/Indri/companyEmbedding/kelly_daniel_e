Item Description: Random House USA Inc, United States, 2002. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Reissue. Language: English . This book usually ship within 10-15 business days and we will endeavor to dispatch orders quicker than this where possible. Brand New Book. There were no dry runs for Seawolves in Vietnam. They put their lives on the line--every time. In the Viet Cong-infested Mekong Delta, where small SEAL teams were always outgunned and outnumbered, discovery brought swift, deadly consequences-- and a radio call for backup from the United States Navy s very best: the Seawolves. The whir of approaching rotor blades signaled their arrival as they tore through the jungle at treetop level, gunners hanging off the skids, shooting M-60s, raining down their lethal mix of high explosives and incendiary death. Seawolf Dan Kelly describes the origins of this extraordinary outfit. Put through a training program unlike any other, these men emerged to perform unparalleled feats of courage. The stories of these elite warriors capture America s real heroes in all their guts and glory, and demonstrate why the Seawolves are known as the most successful and most decorated unit in the Vietnam War.

					Cover: �Created in 1967, the HAL-3 helicopter squadron � aka Seawolves � provided quick-reaction close air support to SEALs, PBR River Rats, and Special Forces advisers and their troops. During the five years of the unit�s existence, the seven detachments of Seawolves amassed stunning statistics: 78,000 missions, 8,200 enemy kills, 8,700 sampans sunk, and 9,500 structures destroyed. These 200 men collected a total of 17,339 medals. Taking enemy fire while braced against the rocket pod of a Huey gunship and shooting an M-60 freehand in 110 mph winds was just part of Dan Kelly�s job in Vietnam. As a gunner in the all-volunteer Seawolves, he served with distinction until three bullets brought him a trip home. Here is his amazing story of the Seawolves � a harrowing tale of unsung heroism and undaunted courage in combat.�  Condition: Reading copy. Pages are clean. Slight spine slant. Cover has rubbing wear, creases, and wear to the edges and corners. Spine is cracked in the middle.

 They called themselves Seawolves . . .The men of SEALs, PBRs, and SF called them saviors . . . Created in 1967, the HAL-3 helicopter squadron--aka Seawolves--provided quick-reaction close air support to SEALs, PBR River Rats, and Special Forces advisers and their troops. During the five years of the unit's existence, the seven detachments of Seawolves amassed stunning statistics: 78,000 missions, 8,200 enemy kills, 8,700 sampans sunk, and 9,500 structures destroyed. These 200 men collected a total of 17,339 medals.This is the story of one of those men. . . .Taking enemy fire while braced against the rocket pod of a Huey gunship and shooting an M-60 freehand in 110 mph winds was just part of Dan Kelly's job in Vietnam. As a gunner in the all-volunteer Seawolves, he served with distinction until three bullets bought him a trip home. Here is his amazing story of the Seawolves--a harrowing tale of unsung heroism and undaunted courage in combat.

My brother was a Seawolf pilot in late '70-'71.  He spoke very little about his experience in Vietnam and what he told me was, I am positive, a very small account of what he went through.  After reading this book,  I now understand his reluctance.  My only regret was not knowing very much at all about the Seawolves until after my brother's recent passing.  Daniel Kelly did a great job and I thank him for educating me.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsGreat Read, if you want to read the truth!ByNotoldon June 21, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseGreat read! Especially for those who want to know the truth about this elite combat unit.  I am a Navy veteran who flew with this squadron on a few occasions and I can say the author  Daniel Kelly told an honest version and I am confident that the editors watered down or edited out some of his true life missions.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsA breed apart...ByJim W. Baizeon February 14, 2012Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThis is a great book about a rare breed of men. They were helicopter pilots during the Vietnam War. Not just anyone can or will fly into the middle of an incredible firefight to evacuate SEALs who have either completed a mission or have been compromised. I know one such man personally. ( A couple of years ago I purchased a hand-carved model of the very ship he flew. I bought it from a sidewalk shop on the streets of Saigon, now called Ho Chi Minh City. I then gave the model to my friend, the Seawolf pilot.)  I also know a number of retired SEALs. What a complement the Seawolf pilots were to the Teams! A great read. A rare breed.Jim BaizePastor, Ocean View ChurchSan Diego, CARead more0Comment|

Mr. Kelly's writing stile  makes it hard to set the book down.  He gets an "atta boy" for not only his service but taking the time to express it in his book.
