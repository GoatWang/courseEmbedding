History[edit]
See also: Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget and Brown, Boveri & Cie
ABB's history goes back to the late 19th century. ASEA was founded in 1883 by Ludvig Fredholm[5] in Västerås as manufacturer of electrical light and generators. Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC) was formed in 1891 in Baden, Switzerland, by Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown and Walter Boveri[6] as a Swiss group of electrical companies producing AC and DC motors, generators, steam turbines and transformers.




ABB around the world.[vague]


ABB resulted from the 1988 merger of the Swedish corporation Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA) and the Swiss company Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC); the latter had absorbed the Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon in 1967. CEO at the time of the merger was the former CEO of ASEA, Percy Barnevik, who ran the company until 1996.

In 1990, ABB purchased Westinghouse's metering and control division (the load control division was spun off to Cannon Technologies in the late 1990s and the meter division was spun off to Elster Electricity in the early 2000s). Also, in the early 1990s, ABB purchased Combustion Engineering (C-E), headquartered in Stamford and Norwalk, Connecticut, a leading U.S. firm in the development of conventional fossil fuel power and nuclear power supply systems to break into the North American market. Klaus Agthe was CEO of the US operation at the time. Continuing with its expansion plans, ABB purchased Elsag Bailey,[7] a process automation group, in 1997 which included Bailey Controls, Hartmann & Braun, and Fischer & Porter. This was the largest acquisition to date in ABB's history.
ABB bought International Combustion Ltd[8] from Rolls-Royce[9] in 1997.
ABB's boiler and fossil fuel businesses were purchased by Alstom in 2000, and its nuclear business was purchased by Westinghouse Electric Company in 2000. In 2000, ABB also signed a contract for the delivery of equipment and services for two North Korean nuclear powerplants to be supplied under an agreement with the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO),[10] a consortium formed in 1995 by the governments of the United States, Japan, South Korea and the European Union.[11] ABB formally divested from a joint venture named ABB-Alstom Power in 2000, and sold its interest in conventional power generation systems to Alstom Power. ABB's nuclear business was sold[12] to BNFL and merged into Westinghouse Electric Company.
In 2001, ABB was ranked as number one on the Dow Jones corporate sustainability index[13] for the third year in a row.
In 2002, ABB asked Lindahl, the company's former chief executive, to return some of his $50 million retirement pay, which its board called excessive. ABB also asked its former chairman Percy Barnevik to pay back part of his $87 million pension package. The size of the pensions was disclosed at the same time as ABB's $691 million net loss for 2001 made headlines and drew sharp criticism in Switzerland and Sweden.[14]
ABB's Building Systems business unit was sold off in 2004 to Capvis,[15] a Swiss private equity company, as part of ABB's strategy to focus on power and automation technologies. ABB's building systems businesses in Australia and Hong Kong were sold off the year before, in May 2003, to Downer EDI Limited. Building Systems provided services for building facilities encompassing indoor air quality, building automation as well as power distribution and management.
Financial debt and lingering asbestos liability brought ABB to the brink of bankruptcy in the early 2000s. In 2006, ABB returned to financial health by settling its asbestos liability regarding claims that were filed against ABB's U.S. subsidiaries, Combustion Engineering and Lummus Global.[16] In August 2007 Lummus Global was sold to CB&I.[17]
In December 2008, ABB acquired Ber-Mac Electrical and Instrumentation to expand its presence in western Canada's oil and gas industries. Ber-Mac Electrical and Instrumentation has been in the business of supplying electrical power and instrumentation equipment and services, both domestically and to international markets since 1980. Ber-Mac provides its clients with expertise in industrial automation, electrical and instrumentation design, process optimization, panel fabrication and field services. It is particularly strong in the Oil & Gas industry. Ber-Mac’s value proposition in engineering expertise and service capabilities is highly respected throughout Western Canada, this was a key factor in ABB’s decision to acquire the firm. This acquisition significantly expanded ABB’s presence in Western Canada to more than 760 employees in over 20 locations.
In 2009, ABB realigned its automation divisions to enhance growth opportunities. As of January 1, 2010, the business units in the Automation Products and Robotics divisions were regrouped into two new divisions – Discrete Automation and Motion, and Low Voltage Products. The Process Automation division remained unchanged except for the addition of the instrumentation business from the Automation Products division.
In May 2010, ABB acquired software company Ventyx for more than $1 billion from Vista Equity Partners.[18]
In 2011, on May 9 ABB announced acquisition of Australian-based Mincom Limited from private equity firm Francisco Partners - to expand their enterprise software business for undisclosed sum.[19] On July 29, 2011, acquisition has been finalised.[20] Mincom and Ventyx were subsequently integrated under the Ventyx name, and have now been integrated into ABB as the Enterprise Software Product Group.
In 2011 ABB acquired Baldor Electric USA for $4.2 billion in an all-cash transaction
On January 30, 2012, ABB Group acquired Thomas & Betts in a $3.9 billion cash transaction.[21]
On June 15, 2012, ABB completed acquisition of commercial and industrial wireless technology specialists Tropos.
In July 2013, ABB acquired Power-One in a $1 billion all-cash transaction, to become the leading global manufacturer of solar inverters [1].

History[edit]
See also: Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget and Brown, Boveri & Cie
ABB's history goes back to the late 19th century. ASEA was founded in 1883 by Ludvig Fredholm[5] in Västerås as manufacturer of electrical light and generators. Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC) was formed in 1891 in Baden, Switzerland, by Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown and Walter Boveri[6] as a Swiss group of electrical companies producing AC and DC motors, generators, steam turbines and transformers.




ABB around the world.[vague]


ABB resulted from the 1988 merger of the Swedish corporation Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA) and the Swiss company Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC); the latter had absorbed the Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon in 1967. CEO at the time of the merger was the former CEO of ASEA, Percy Barnevik, who ran the company until 1996.

In 1990, ABB purchased Westinghouse's metering and control division (the load control division was spun off to Cannon Technologies in the late 1990s and the meter division was spun off to Elster Electricity in the early 2000s). Also, in the early 1990s, ABB purchased Combustion Engineering (C-E), headquartered in Stamford and Norwalk, Connecticut, a leading U.S. firm in the development of conventional fossil fuel power and nuclear power supply systems to break into the North American market. Klaus Agthe was CEO of the US operation at the time. Continuing with its expansion plans, ABB purchased Elsag Bailey,[7] a process automation group, in 1997 which included Bailey Controls, Hartmann & Braun, and Fischer & Porter. This was the largest acquisition to date in ABB's history.
ABB bought International Combustion Ltd[8] from Rolls-Royce[9] in 1997.
ABB's boiler and fossil fuel businesses were purchased by Alstom in 2000, and its nuclear business was purchased by Westinghouse Electric Company in 2000. In 2000, ABB also signed a contract for the delivery of equipment and services for two North Korean nuclear powerplants to be supplied under an agreement with the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO),[10] a consortium formed in 1995 by the governments of the United States, Japan, South Korea and the European Union.[11] ABB formally divested from a joint venture named ABB-Alstom Power in 2000, and sold its interest in conventional power generation systems to Alstom Power. ABB's nuclear business was sold[12] to BNFL and merged into Westinghouse Electric Company.
In 2001, ABB was ranked as number one on the Dow Jones corporate sustainability index[13] for the third year in a row.
In 2002, ABB asked Lindahl, the company's former chief executive, to return some of his $50 million retirement pay, which its board called excessive. ABB also asked its former chairman Percy Barnevik to pay back part of his $87 million pension package. The size of the pensions was disclosed at the same time as ABB's $691 million net loss for 2001 made headlines and drew sharp criticism in Switzerland and Sweden.[14]
ABB's Building Systems business unit was sold off in 2004 to Capvis,[15] a Swiss private equity company, as part of ABB's strategy to focus on power and automation technologies. ABB's building systems businesses in Australia and Hong Kong were sold off the year before, in May 2003, to Downer EDI Limited. Building Systems provided services for building facilities encompassing indoor air quality, building automation as well as power distribution and management.
Financial debt and lingering asbestos liability brought ABB to the brink of bankruptcy in the early 2000s. In 2006, ABB returned to financial health by settling its asbestos liability regarding claims that were filed against ABB's U.S. subsidiaries, Combustion Engineering and Lummus Global.[16] In August 2007 Lummus Global was sold to CB&I.[17]
In December 2008, ABB acquired Ber-Mac Electrical and Instrumentation to expand its presence in western Canada's oil and gas industries. Ber-Mac Electrical and Instrumentation has been in the business of supplying electrical power and instrumentation equipment and services, both domestically and to international markets since 1980.

History[edit]
See also: Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget and Brown, Boveri & Cie
ABB's history goes back to the late 19th century. ASEA was founded in 1883 by Ludvig Fredholm[5] in Västerås as manufacturer of electrical light and generators. Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC) was formed in 1891 in Baden, Switzerland, by Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown and Walter Boveri[6] as a Swiss group of electrical companies producing AC and DC motors, generators, steam turbines and transformers.




ABB around the world.[vague]


ABB resulted from the 1988 merger of the Swedish corporation Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA) and the Swiss company Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC); the latter had absorbed the Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon in 1967. CEO at the time of the merger was the former CEO of ASEA, Percy Barnevik, who ran the company until 1996.

In 1990, ABB purchased Westinghouse's metering and control division (the load control division was spun off to Cannon Technologies in the late 1990s and the meter division was spun off to Elster Electricity in the early 2000s). Also, in the early 1990s, ABB purchased Combustion Engineering (C-E), headquartered in Stamford and Norwalk, Connecticut, a leading U.S. firm in the development of conventional fossil fuel power and nuclear power supply systems to break into the North American market. Klaus Agthe was CEO of the US operation at the time. Continuing with its expansion plans, ABB purchased Elsag Bailey,[7] a process automation group, in 1997 which included Bailey Controls, Hartmann & Braun, and Fischer & Porter. This was the largest acquisition to date in ABB's history.
ABB bought International Combustion Ltd[8] from Rolls-Royce[9] in 1997.
ABB's boiler and fossil fuel businesses were purchased by Alstom in 2000, and its nuclear business was purchased by Westinghouse Electric Company in 2000. In 2000, ABB also signed a contract for the delivery of equipment and services for two North Korean nuclear powerplants to be supplied under an agreement with the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO),[10] a consortium formed in 1995 by the governments of the United States, Japan, South Korea and the European Union.[11] ABB formally divested from a joint venture named ABB-Alstom Power in 2000, and sold its interest in conventional power generation systems to Alstom Power. ABB's nuclear business was sold[12] to BNFL and merged into Westinghouse Electric Company.
In 2001, ABB was ranked as number one on the Dow Jones corporate sustainability index[13] for the third year in a row.
In 2002, ABB asked Lindahl, the company's former chief executive, to return some of his $50 million retirement pay, which its board called excessive. ABB also asked its former chairman Percy Barnevik to pay back part of his $87 million pension package. The size of the pensions was disclosed at the same time as ABB's $691 million net loss for 2001 made headlines and drew sharp criticism in Switzerland and Sweden.[14]
ABB's Building Systems business unit was sold off in 2004 to Capvis,[15] a Swiss private equity company, as part of ABB's strategy to focus on power and automation technologies. ABB's building systems businesses in Australia and Hong Kong were sold off the year before, in May 2003, to Downer EDI Limited. Building Systems provided services for building facilities encompassing indoor air quality, building automation as well as power distribution and management.
Financial debt and lingering asbestos liability brought ABB to the brink of bankruptcy in the early 2000s. In 2006, ABB returned to financial health by settling its asbestos liability regarding claims that were filed against ABB's U.S. subsidiaries, Combustion Engineering and Lummus Global.[16] In August 2007 Lummus Global was sold to CB&I.[17]
In December 2008, ABB acquired Ber-Mac Electrical and Instrumentation to expand its presence in western Canada's oil and gas industries. Ber-Mac Electrical and Instrumentation has been in the business of supplying electrical power and instrumentation equipment and services, both domestically and to international markets since 1980. Ber-Mac provides its clients with expertise in industrial automation, electrical and instrumentation design, process optimization, panel fabrication and field services. It is particularly strong in the Oil & Gas industry. Ber-Mac’s value proposition in engineering expertise and service capabilities is highly respected throughout Western Canada, this was a key factor in ABB’s decision to acquire the firm. This acquisition significantly expanded ABB’s presence in Western Canada to more than 760 employees in over 20 locations.
In 2009, ABB realigned its automation divisions to enhance growth opportunities. As of January 1, 2010, the business units in the Automation Products and Robotics divisions were regrouped into two new divisions – Discrete Automation and Motion, and Low Voltage Products. The Process Automation division remained unchanged except for the addition of the instrumentation business from the Automation Products division.
In May 2010, ABB acquired software company Ventyx for more than $1 billion from Vista Equity Partners.[18]
In 2011, on May 9 ABB announced acquisition of Australian-based Mincom Limited from private equity firm Francisco Partners - to expand their enterprise software business for undisclosed sum.[19] On July 29, 2011, acquisition has been finalised.[20] Mincom and Ventyx were subsequently integrated under the Ventyx name, and have now been integrated into ABB as the Enterprise Software Product Group.
In 2011 ABB acquired Baldor Electric USA for $4.2 billion in an all-cash transaction
On January 30, 2012, ABB Group acquired Thomas & Betts in a $3.9 billion cash transaction.[21]
On June 15, 2012, ABB completed acquisition of commercial and industrial wireless technology specialists Tropos.
In July 2013, ABB acquired Power-One in a $1 billion all-cash transaction, to become the leading global manufacturer of solar inverters [1].
Organizational structure[edit]
ABB is the world's largest builder of electricity grids[22] and is active in many sectors, its core businesses being in power and automation technologies. With a long history of growth through mergers and acquisitions, it entered a phase of structure unification since 2014. The company has one corporate division and four production divisions since reorganization in January 2017. ABB is one of the few large companies that have successfully implemented the matrix structure in their organization.
Electrification Products[edit]
The Electrification Products division manufactures low- and medium-voltage electrical products, including electric vehicle infrastructure, solar inverters, modular substations, distribution automation; products to protect people, installations and electronic equipment from electrical overload such as enclosures, cable systems and low-voltage circuit breakers; measuring and sensing devices, control products, switches and wiring accessories. The division further makes KNX systems that integrate and automate a building's electrical installations, ventilation systems, and security and data communication networks. Electrification Products also incorporates an Electrification Solutions unit manufacturing low voltage switchgear and motor control centres. Customers include a wide range of industry and utility operations, plus commercial and residential buildings.
Robotics and Motion[edit]
The Robotics and Motion division provides products and services for industrial production. It includes electric motors, generators, drives, power electronics and industrial robots. ABB has installed over 300,000 robots.[23] In 2006, ABB opened a manufacturing centre in Shanghai, China. Also, wind generators, solar power inverters and UPS products belong to this division.
Industrial Automation[edit]
The main focus of the Industrial Automation division is to provide customers with systems for control, plant optimization, and industry-specific automation applications. The industries served include oil and gas, power, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, pulp and paper, metals and minerals, marine and turbocharging. The division consists of seven business units: Control Technologies (the world's No 1 DCS supplier); Marine & Ports; Measurement & Analytics; Oil, Gas & Chemicals; Power Generation & Water; Process Industries and Turbocharging.
Power Grids[edit]
The Power Grids division offers key components for the transmission and distribution of electricity. The division incorporates ABB's manufacturing network for transformers, switchgear, circuit breakers, and associated high voltage equipment such as digital protective relays. It also offers maintenance services. The division also offers turnkey systems and service for power transmission and distribution grids, and for power plants. Electrical substations and substation automation systems are key areas. Additional highlights include flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS), high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems and network management systems. The division is subdivided into the four business units High Voltage Products, Transformers, Grid Automation and Grid Integration.
Other[edit]
In May 2013, ABB Sécheron SA joined with several groups in Geneva (TOSA Trolleybus Optimisation Système Alimentation, or in English, Trolleybus Power System Optimization) in a one-year demonstration of a trolleybus route using a novel charging system. Rather than overhead wires, charging is accomplished by fixed overhead devices located at stops along the route and at the terminus.[24][25][26] Jean-Luc Favre, head of Rail ISI, discussed the promising role of improved electric transport technology in ABB.[27]

History[edit]
See also: Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget and Brown, Boveri & Cie
ABB's history goes back to the late 19th century. ASEA was founded in 1883 by Ludvig Fredholm[5] in Västerås as manufacturer of electrical light and generators. Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC) was formed in 1891 in Baden, Switzerland, by Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown and Walter Boveri[6] as a Swiss group of electrical companies producing AC and DC motors, generators, steam turbines and transformers.




ABB around the world.[vague]


ABB resulted from the 1988 merger of the Swedish corporation Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA) and the Swiss company Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC); the latter had absorbed the Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon in 1967. CEO at the time of the merger was the former CEO of ASEA, Percy Barnevik, who ran the company until 1996.

In 1990, ABB purchased Westinghouse's metering and control division (the load control division was spun off to Cannon Technologies in the late 1990s and the meter division was spun off to Elster Electricity in the early 2000s). Also, in the early 1990s, ABB purchased Combustion Engineering (C-E), headquartered in Stamford and Norwalk, Connecticut, a leading U.S. firm in the development of conventional fossil fuel power and nuclear power supply systems to break into the North American market. Klaus Agthe was CEO of the US operation at the time. Continuing with its expansion plans, ABB purchased Elsag Bailey,[7] a process automation group, in 1997 which included Bailey Controls, Hartmann & Braun, and Fischer & Porter. This was the largest acquisition to date in ABB's history.
ABB bought International Combustion Ltd[8] from Rolls-Royce[9] in 1997.
ABB's boiler and fossil fuel businesses were purchased by Alstom in 2000, and its nuclear business was purchased by Westinghouse Electric Company in 2000. In 2000, ABB also signed a contract for the delivery of equipment and services for two North Korean nuclear powerplants to be supplied under an agreement with the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO),[10] a consortium formed in 1995 by the governments of the United States, Japan, South Korea and the European Union.[11] ABB formally divested from a joint venture named ABB-Alstom Power in 2000, and sold its interest in conventional power generation systems to Alstom Power. ABB's nuclear business was sold[12] to BNFL and merged into Westinghouse Electric Company.
In 2001, ABB was ranked as number one on the Dow Jones corporate sustainability index[13] for the third year in a row.
In 2002, ABB asked Lindahl, the company's former chief executive, to return some of his $50 million retirement pay, which its board called excessive. ABB also asked its former chairman Percy Barnevik to pay back part of his $87 million pension package. The size of the pensions was disclosed at the same time as ABB's $691 million net loss for 2001 made headlines and drew sharp criticism in Switzerland and Sweden.[14]
ABB's Building Systems business unit was sold off in 2004 to Capvis,[15] a Swiss private equity company, as part of ABB's strategy to focus on power and automation technologies. ABB's building systems businesses in Australia and Hong Kong were sold off the year before, in May 2003, to Downer EDI Limited. Building Systems provided services for building facilities encompassing indoor air quality, building automation as well as power distribution and management.
Financial debt and lingering asbestos liability brought ABB to the brink of bankruptcy in the early 2000s. In 2006, ABB returned to financial health by settling its asbestos liability regarding claims that were filed against ABB's U.S. subsidiaries, Combustion Engineering and Lummus Global.[16] In August 2007 Lummus Global was sold to CB&I.[17]
In December 2008, ABB acquired Ber-Mac Electrical and Instrumentation to expand its presence in western Canada's oil and gas industries. Ber-Mac Electrical and Instrumentation has been in the business of supplying electrical power and instrumentation equipment and services, both domestically and to international markets since 1980. Ber-Mac provides its clients with expertise in industrial automation, electrical and instrumentation design, process optimization, panel fabrication and field services. It is particularly strong in the Oil & Gas industry. Ber-Mac’s value proposition in engineering expertise and service capabilities is highly respected throughout Western Canada, this was a key factor in ABB’s decision to acquire the firm. This acquisition significantly expanded ABB’s presence in Western Canada to more than 760 employees in over 20 locations.
In 2009, ABB realigned its automation divisions to enhance growth opportunities. As of January 1, 2010, the business units in the Automation Products and Robotics divisions were regrouped into two new divisions – Discrete Automation and Motion, and Low Voltage Products. The Process Automation division remained unchanged except for the addition of the instrumentation business from the Automation Products division.
In May 2010, ABB acquired software company Ventyx for more than $1 billion from Vista Equity Partners.[18]
In 2011, on May 9 ABB announced acquisition of Australian-based Mincom Limited from private equity firm Francisco Partners - to expand their enterprise software business for undisclosed sum.[19] On July 29, 2011, acquisition has been finalised.[20] Mincom and Ventyx were subsequently integrated under the Ventyx name, and have now been integrated into ABB as the Enterprise Software Product Group.
In 2011 ABB acquired Baldor Electric USA for $4.2 billion in an all-cash transaction
On January 30, 2012, ABB Group acquired Thomas & Betts in a $3.9 billion cash transaction.[21]
On June 15, 2012, ABB completed acquisition of commercial and industrial wireless technology specialists Tropos.
In July 2013, ABB acquired Power-One in a $1 billion all-cash transaction, to become the leading global manufacturer of solar inverters [1].

History[edit]
See also: Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget and Brown, Boveri & Cie
ABB's history goes back to the late 19th century. ASEA was founded in 1883 by Ludvig Fredholm[5] in Västerås as manufacturer of electrical light and generators. Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC) was formed in 1891 in Baden, Switzerland, by Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown and Walter Boveri[6] as a Swiss group of electrical companies producing AC and DC motors, generators, steam turbines and transformers.




ABB around the world.[vague]


ABB resulted from the 1988 merger of the Swedish corporation Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA) and the Swiss company Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC); the latter had absorbed the Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon in 1967. CEO at the time of the merger was the former CEO of ASEA, Percy Barnevik, who ran the company until 1996.

In 1990, ABB purchased Westinghouse's metering and control division (the load control division was spun off to Cannon Technologies in the late 1990s and the meter division was spun off to Elster Electricity in the early 2000s). Also, in the early 1990s, ABB purchased Combustion Engineering (C-E), headquartered in Stamford and Norwalk, Connecticut, a leading U.S. firm in the development of conventional fossil fuel power and nuclear power supply systems to break into the North American market. Klaus Agthe was CEO of the US operation at the time. Continuing with its expansion plans, ABB purchased Elsag Bailey,[7] a process automation group, in 1997 which included Bailey Controls, Hartmann & Braun, and Fischer & Porter. This was the largest acquisition to date in ABB's history.
ABB bought International Combustion Ltd[8] from Rolls-Royce[9] in 1997.
ABB's boiler and fossil fuel businesses were purchased by Alstom in 2000, and its nuclear business was purchased by Westinghouse Electric Company in 2000. In 2000, ABB also signed a contract for the delivery of equipment and services for two North Korean nuclear powerplants to be supplied under an agreement with the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO),[10] a consortium formed in 1995 by the governments of the United States, Japan, South Korea and the European Union.[11] ABB formally divested from a joint venture named ABB-Alstom Power in 2000, and sold its interest in conventional power generation systems to Alstom Power. ABB's nuclear business was sold[12] to BNFL and merged into Westinghouse Electric Company.
In 2001, ABB was ranked as number one on the Dow Jones corporate sustainability index[13] for the third year in a row.
In 2002, ABB asked Lindahl, the company's former chief executive, to return some of his $50 million retirement pay, which its board called excessive. ABB also asked its former chairman Percy Barnevik to pay back part of his $87 million pension package. The size of the pensions was disclosed at the same time as ABB's $691 million net loss for 2001 made headlines and drew sharp criticism in Switzerland and Sweden.[14]
ABB's Building Systems business unit was sold off in 2004 to Capvis,[15] a Swiss private equity company, as part of ABB's strategy to focus on power and automation technologies. ABB's building systems businesses in Australia and Hong Kong were sold off the year before, in May 2003, to Downer EDI Limited. Building Systems provided services for building facilities encompassing indoor air quality, building automation as well as power distribution and management.
Financial debt and lingering asbestos liability brought ABB to the brink of bankruptcy in the early 2000s. In 2006, ABB returned to financial health by settling its asbestos liability regarding claims that were filed against ABB's U.S. subsidiaries, Combustion Engineering and Lummus Global.[16] In August 2007 Lummus Global was sold to CB&I.[17]
In December 2008, ABB acquired Ber-Mac Electrical and Instrumentation to expand its presence in western Canada's oil and gas industries. Ber-Mac Electrical and Instrumentation has been in the business of supplying electrical power and instrumentation equipment and services, both domestically and to international markets since 1980. Ber-Mac provides its clients with expertise in industrial automation, electrical and instrumentation design, process optimization, panel fabrication and field services. It is particularly strong in the Oil & Gas industry. Ber-Mac’s value proposition in engineering expertise and service capabilities is highly respected throughout Western Canada, this was a key factor in ABB’s decision to acquire the firm. This acquisition significantly expanded ABB’s presence in Western Canada to more than 760 employees in over 20 locations.
In 2009, ABB realigned its automation divisions to enhance growth opportunities. As of January 1, 2010, the business units in the Automation Products and Robotics divisions were regrouped into two new divisions – Discrete Automation and Motion, and Low Voltage Products. The Process Automation division remained unchanged except for the addition of the instrumentation business from the Automation Products division.
In May 2010, ABB acquired software company Ventyx for more than $1 billion from Vista Equity Partners.[18]
In 2011, on May 9 ABB announced acquisition of Australian-based Mincom Limited from private equity firm Francisco Partners - to expand their enterprise software business for undisclosed sum.[19] On July 29, 2011, acquisition has been finalised.[20] Mincom and Ventyx were subsequently integrated under the Ventyx name, and have now been integrated into ABB as the Enterprise Software Product Group.
In 2011 ABB acquired Baldor Electric USA for $4.2 billion in an all-cash transaction
On January 30, 2012, ABB Group acquired Thomas & Betts in a $3.9 billion cash transaction.[21]
On June 15, 2012, ABB completed acquisition of commercial and industrial wireless technology specialists Tropos.
In July 2013, ABB acquired Power-One in a $1 billion all-cash transaction, to become the leading global manufacturer of solar inverters [1].
Organizational structure[edit]
ABB is the world's largest builder of electricity grids[22] and is active in many sectors, its core businesses being in power and automation technologies. With a long history of growth through mergers and acquisitions, it entered a phase of structure unification since 2014. The company has one corporate division and four production divisions since reorganization in January 2017. ABB is one of the few large companies that have successfully implemented the matrix structure in their organization.
Electrification Products[edit]
The Electrification Products division manufactures low- and medium-voltage electrical products, including electric vehicle infrastructure, solar inverters, modular substations, distribution automation; products to protect people, installations and electronic equipment from electrical overload such as enclosures, cable systems and low-voltage circuit breakers; measuring and sensing devices, control products, switches and wiring accessories. The division further makes KNX systems that integrate and automate a building's electrical installations, ventilation systems, and security and data communication networks. Electrification Products also incorporates an Electrification Solutions unit manufacturing low voltage switchgear and motor control centres. Customers include a wide range of industry and utility operations, plus commercial and residential buildings.

The Robotics and Motion division provides products and services for industrial production. It includes electric motors, generators, drives, power electronics and industrial robots. ABB has installed over 300,000 robots.[23] In 2006, ABB opened a manufacturing centre in Shanghai, China. Also, wind generators, solar power inverters and UPS products belong to this division.
Industrial Automation[edit]
The main focus of the Industrial Automation division is to provide customers with systems for control, plant optimization, and industry-specific automation applications. The industries served include oil and gas, power, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, pulp and paper, metals and minerals, marine and turbocharging. The division consists of seven business units: Control Technologies (the world's No 1 DCS supplier); Marine & Ports; Measurement & Analytics; Oil, Gas & Chemicals; Power Generation & Water; Process Industries and Turbocharging.
Power Grids[edit]
The Power Grids division offers key components for the transmission and distribution of electricity. The division incorporates ABB's manufacturing network for transformers, switchgear, circuit breakers, and associated high voltage equipment such as digital protective relays. It also offers maintenance services. The division also offers turnkey systems and service for power transmission and distribution grids, and for power plants. Electrical substations and substation automation systems are key areas. Additional highlights include flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS), high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems and network management systems. The division is subdivided into the four business units High Voltage Products, Transformers, Grid Automation and Grid Integration.
Other[edit]
In May 2013, ABB Sécheron SA joined with several groups in Geneva (TOSA Trolleybus Optimisation Système Alimentation, or in English, Trolleybus Power System Optimization) in a one-year demonstration of a trolleybus route using a novel charging system. Rather than overhead wires, charging is accomplished by fixed overhead devices located at stops along the route and at the terminus.[24][25][26] Jean-Luc Favre, head of Rail ISI, discussed the promising role of improved electric transport technology in ABB.[27]

ABB Ltd Key Developments

ABB Ltd. Reports Earnings Results for the Second Quarter and First Half of 2017; Provides Cash Flow Guidance for the Full Year of 2017
Jul 20 17
ABB Ltd. reported earnings results for the second quarter and first half of 2017. For the quarter, the company reported revenues of $8,454 million against $8,677 for the same period prior year. Operational EBITA was $1,042 million against $1,120 million for the same period prior year. Net income was $525 million against $406 million for the same period prior year. Basic EPS was $0.25 against $0.19 for the same period prior year. Operational EPS was $0.30 against $0.35 for the same period prior year. Operational EBITA was impacted by commodity price increases and overcapacity in some businesses which could not offset the positive net savings effect. Cash flow from operating activities was $467 million compared with $1,082 million in 2016 due to the change in timing of short-term incentive payments to the second quarter from the first quarter in 2017. It was also impacted by timing of tax payments, delays in payment from Middle Eastern customers and the positive cash contribution in the previous year from the recently divested cables business.


For the half year, the company reported revenues of $16,752 million against $17,569 for the same period prior year. Operational EBITA was $1,985 million against $2,071 million for the same period prior year. Net income was $1,249 million against $906 million for the same period prior year. Basic EPS was $0.58 against $0.42 for the same period prior year. Operational EPS was $0.58 against $0.64 for the same period prior year. Cash flow from operating activities was $976 million against $1,334 million for the same period prior year.

For full year 2017, the company expects cash flow from operating activities to be somewhat above last year's levels.

ABB Wins $30 Million Order to Upgrade Nordic HVDC Link
Jul 12 17
ABB has won an order worth around $30 million from Svenska Kraftnät in Sweden and Energinet in Denmark. ABB will upgrade the control and protection system for the Konti-Skan high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission link with its latest ABB Ability MACH technology. The order was booked in the second quarter of 2017. The Konti-Skan transmission link was built 52 years ago as the first interconnection between Sweden and Denmark enabling electricity exchange. This provided the benefits of a shared grid with additional features from the HVDC system, which has enabled the exchange of renewable hydropower and wind energy for decades. The installation of ABB's latest MACH control and protection system will extend the life span of the HVDC link and further enhance power availability as well as grid reliability and efficiency through advanced digitalization. The advanced ABB Ability MACH system acts like the brain of the HVDC link - monitoring, controlling and protecting the sophisticated technology in the stations to ensure reliability and efficiency. It incorporates advanced fault registration and remote control functions.

ABB: Dominating Industrial Automation And Robotics - ABB LTD. (NYSE:ABB) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»ABB: Dominating Industrial Automation And RoboticsApr.19.17 | About: ABB LTD. (ABB) Prasanna Rajagopal Long only, growth at reasonable price, tech, valueLinkedInSummaryConvergence of robotics and industrial automation is real.B&R Acquisition completes the product portfolio for industrial automation at ABB.ABB strengthens its position in automation.Robotics industry may be ripe for more consolidation.ABB (NYSE:ABB) has slowly built itself into a leader in automation technologies via both in-house product development and shrewd acquisitions. With its latest acquisition of B&R, ABB has transformed itself into an end-to-end provider of automation and robotic technologies. The global trend towards increased automation across all industries is very clear. The largest economy in the world, the U.S., may already be in the midst of a manufacturing renaissance powered by automation and robotics. In a recent article about Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK), I had stated that convergence of robotics, industrial automation and enterprise software is very likely. After studying ABB, I am convinced that the convergence is essential to drive productivity gains and to reduce costs in the long run. Until January 2016, ABB was comprised of five divisions:  Discrete Automation & Motion Low Voltage Products Process Automation Power Products Power Systems  As of January 1, 2016, ABB streamlined its operations and organized under four divisions: Power Grids o The power grids division, which was formed from the combination of its Power Products and Power Systems divisions, offers electrical and automation products, system, software and service solutions across the electric utility business. Electrification Products o This division offers solutions across the full electrical value chain from substation to the point of electricity consumption. o The products in this category include modular substation packages, distribution automation products, switchgear, circuit breakers, measuring and sensing devices, control products, etc. Discrete Automation and Motion o This division provides products and solutions that increase industrial productivity and energy efficiency. o Products in this division are motors, generators, drives, power electronics and robotics.
 Process Automation o This division offers integrated control products, systems and service offerings to customers in oil and gas, minerals and mining, metals, pulp and paper, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, power generation and marine industries. Discrete and Process Automation divisions accounted for 45% or about $15.3 billion of the revenue in 2016. In fact, automation has consistently accounted for over 40% of the revenue since 2008. 

 Exhibit: ABB Total Revenue and Revenue from Discrete and Process Automation (Source: Company Filings) 

 Exhibit: Discrete and Process Automation As a % of Total Revenue (Source: Company Filings, Author Calculations) ABB reports its revenue from the robotics business under Discrete Automation and Motion. Since 2010, the robotics business has seen a turnaround and it grew at a "double-digit" pace in 2011. ABB's robotics business continued to show growth in 2012 through 2016. Cage-Free Robots or Cobots Traditionally, for robots to safely work alongside humans, they needed to be in cages. Keeping robots in cages did help with safety of human workers, but it also made the manufacturing line inflexible and increased cost. But, a new range of cage-free robots or collaborative robots are bringing multiple benefits to the manufacturing line. These include:  Increased flexibility to deploy the robots for different tasks along a manufacturing line Lower cost to deploy robots in manufacturing Safe work environments for human workers to work alongside cobots 
 Also, as robots get smarter, faster and cheaper, they're being deployed to more tasks. ABB introduced its collaborative robot called YuMi in 2015. This product is an acknowledgement by ABB that collaborative robots are here to stay and could potentially be used in more tasks across different industries. 

 Exhibit: Number of Robots Sold in the U.S. is Increasing (Source: PWC) 

 Exhibit: Robots Taking on New Jobs in Different Industries. (Source: PWC) YuMi - Creating an Automated Future Together. You and Me. (Source: ABB Website) 

 Exhibit: ABB YuMi Collaboration Robot (Source: Company Website) According to the International Federation of Robotics, between 2010 and 2015, the average robot sales increase was at 16% per year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). Between 2005 and 2008, the average annual number of robots sold was about 115,000 units. Between 2010 and 2015, the average annual supply rose to about 183,000 units. 


 Exhibit: Number of Industrial Robots Sold Worldwide (Source: International Federation of Robotics) The size of the industrial robotics market in the U.S. and the world as measured by number of units sold might seem less, but as robots become cheaper and more adoptable to tasks in different industries, its use will continue to grow. Even before ABB introduced the YuMi collaborative robot, it was seeing good growth in its robotics business. YuMi might increase the total addressable market for ABB. Acquisition of B&R ABB acquired B&R Automation in April of 2017. B&R had $600 million in revenue at the time of the acquisition. 

 Exhibit: Snapshot of B&R Automation (Source: Company Filings) This acquisition propels ABB into a leadership role in industrial automation and completes the product portfolio in this key segment that is a driver of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). 

 Exhibit: ABB Now Has a Complete Portfolio of Products for Industrial Automation (Source: Company Filings) The current low oil prices coupled with the low prices for metals and minerals has put a lot of pressure on these heavy industries to improve productivity and lower cost. It seems fairly certain at this time that barring a rise in geopolitical tensions, oil prices will remain low for the foreseeable future. As shown in the charts above, ABB generates substantial revenues from process automation and the use of robots and industrial automation is one way to achieve increased productivity.
 ABB is well positioned to take advantage of convergence of robotics and industrial automation. The B&R acquisition further strengthens ABB in the factory automation space. There might be more consolidation in the robotics space due to the convergence and also due to competitive forces.

History[edit]
See also: Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget and Brown, Boveri & Cie
ABB's history goes back to the late 19th century. ASEA was founded in 1883 by Ludvig Fredholm[5] in Västerås as manufacturer of electrical light and generators. Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC) was formed in 1891 in Baden, Switzerland, by Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown and Walter Boveri[6] as a Swiss group of electrical companies producing AC and DC motors, generators, steam turbines and transformers.




ABB around the world.[vague]


ABB resulted from the 1988 merger of the Swedish corporation Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA) and the Swiss company Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC); the latter had absorbed the Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon in 1967. CEO at the time of the merger was the former CEO of ASEA, Percy Barnevik, who ran the company until 1996.

In 1990, ABB purchased Westinghouse's metering and control division (the load control division was spun off to Cannon Technologies in the late 1990s and the meter division was spun off to Elster Electricity in the early 2000s). Also, in the early 1990s, ABB purchased Combustion Engineering (C-E), headquartered in Stamford and Norwalk, Connecticut, a leading U.S. firm in the development of conventional fossil fuel power and nuclear power supply systems to break into the North American market. Klaus Agthe was CEO of the US operation at the time. Continuing with its expansion plans, ABB purchased Elsag Bailey,[7] a process automation group, in 1997 which included Bailey Controls, Hartmann & Braun, and Fischer & Porter. This was the largest acquisition to date in ABB's history.
ABB bought International Combustion Ltd[8] from Rolls-Royce[9] in 1997.
ABB's boiler and fossil fuel businesses were purchased by Alstom in 2000, and its nuclear business was purchased by Westinghouse Electric Company in 2000. In 2000, ABB also signed a contract for the delivery of equipment and services for two North Korean nuclear powerplants to be supplied under an agreement with the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO),[10] a consortium formed in 1995 by the governments of the United States, Japan, South Korea and the European Union.[11] ABB formally divested from a joint venture named ABB-Alstom Power in 2000, and sold its interest in conventional power generation systems to Alstom Power. ABB's nuclear business was sold[12] to BNFL and merged into Westinghouse Electric Company.
In 2001, ABB was ranked as number one on the Dow Jones corporate sustainability index[13] for the third year in a row.
In 2002, ABB asked Lindahl, the company's former chief executive, to return some of his $50 million retirement pay, which its board called excessive. ABB also asked its former chairman Percy Barnevik to pay back part of his $87 million pension package. The size of the pensions was disclosed at the same time as ABB's $691 million net loss for 2001 made headlines and drew sharp criticism in Switzerland and Sweden.[14]
ABB's Building Systems business unit was sold off in 2004 to Capvis,[15] a Swiss private equity company, as part of ABB's strategy to focus on power and automation technologies. ABB's building systems businesses in Australia and Hong Kong were sold off the year before, in May 2003, to Downer EDI Limited. Building Systems provided services for building facilities encompassing indoor air quality, building automation as well as power distribution and management.
Financial debt and lingering asbestos liability brought ABB to the brink of bankruptcy in the early 2000s. In 2006, ABB returned to financial health by settling its asbestos liability regarding claims that were filed against ABB's U.S. subsidiaries, Combustion Engineering and Lummus Global.[16] In August 2007 Lummus Global was sold to CB&I.[17]
In December 2008, ABB acquired Ber-Mac Electrical and Instrumentation to expand its presence in western Canada's oil and gas industries. Ber-Mac Electrical and Instrumentation has been in the business of supplying electrical power and instrumentation equipment and services, both domestically and to international markets since 1980. Ber-Mac provides its clients with expertise in industrial automation, electrical and instrumentation design, process optimization, panel fabrication and field services. It is particularly strong in the Oil & Gas industry. Ber-Mac’s value proposition in engineering expertise and service capabilities is highly respected throughout Western Canada, this was a key factor in ABB’s decision to acquire the firm. This acquisition significantly expanded ABB’s presence in Western Canada to more than 760 employees in over 20 locations.
In 2009, ABB realigned its automation divisions to enhance growth opportunities. As of January 1, 2010, the business units in the Automation Products and Robotics divisions were regrouped into two new divisions – Discrete Automation and Motion, and Low Voltage Products. The Process Automation division remained unchanged except for the addition of the instrumentation business from the Automation Products division.
In May 2010, ABB acquired software company Ventyx for more than $1 billion from Vista Equity Partners.[18]
In 2011, on May 9 ABB announced acquisition of Australian-based Mincom Limited from private equity firm Francisco Partners - to expand their enterprise software business for undisclosed sum.[19] On July 29, 2011, acquisition has been finalised.[20] Mincom and Ventyx were subsequently integrated under the Ventyx name, and have now been integrated into ABB as the Enterprise Software Product Group.
In 2011 ABB acquired Baldor Electric USA for $4.2 billion in an all-cash transaction
On January 30, 2012, ABB Group acquired Thomas & Betts in a $3.9 billion cash transaction.[21]
On June 15, 2012, ABB completed acquisition of commercial and industrial wireless technology specialists Tropos.
In July 2013, ABB acquired Power-One in a $1 billion all-cash transaction, to become the leading global manufacturer of solar inverters [1].
Organizational structure[edit]
ABB is the world's largest builder of electricity grids[22] and is active in many sectors, its core businesses being in power and automation technologies. With a long history of growth through mergers and acquisitions, it entered a phase of structure unification since 2014. The company has one corporate division and four production divisions since reorganization in January 2017. ABB is one of the few large companies that have successfully implemented the matrix structure in their organization.
Electrification Products[edit]
The Electrification Products division manufactures low- and medium-voltage electrical products, including electric vehicle infrastructure, solar inverters, modular substations, distribution automation; products to protect people, installations and electronic equipment from electrical overload such as enclosures, cable systems and low-voltage circuit breakers; measuring and sensing devices, control products, switches and wiring accessories. The division further makes KNX systems that integrate and automate a building's electrical installations, ventilation systems, and security and data communication networks. Electrification Products also incorporates an Electrification Solutions unit manufacturing low voltage switchgear and motor control centres. Customers include a wide range of industry and utility operations, plus commercial and residential buildings.
Robotics and Motion[edit]
The Robotics and Motion division provides products and services for industrial production. It includes electric motors, generators, drives, power electronics and industrial robots. ABB has installed over 300,000 robots.[23] In 2006, ABB opened a manufacturing centre in Shanghai, China. Also, wind generators, solar power inverters and UPS products belong to this division.

History[edit]
See also: Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget and Brown, Boveri & Cie
ABB's history goes back to the late 19th century. ASEA was founded in 1883 by Ludvig Fredholm[5] in Västerås as manufacturer of electrical light and generators. Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC) was formed in 1891 in Baden, Switzerland, by Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown and Walter Boveri[6] as a Swiss group of electrical companies producing AC and DC motors, generators, steam turbines and transformers.




ABB around the world.[vague]


ABB resulted from the 1988 merger of the Swedish corporation Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA) and the Swiss company Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC); the latter had absorbed the Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon in 1967. CEO at the time of the merger was the former CEO of ASEA, Percy Barnevik, who ran the company until 1996.

The industries served include oil and gas, power, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, pulp and paper, metals and minerals, marine and turbocharging. The division consists of seven business units: Control Technologies (the world's No 1 DCS supplier); Marine & Ports; Measurement & Analytics; Oil, Gas & Chemicals; Power Generation & Water; Process Industries and Turbocharging.
Power Grids[edit]
The Power Grids division offers key components for the transmission and distribution of electricity. The division incorporates ABB's manufacturing network for transformers, switchgear, circuit breakers, and associated high voltage equipment such as digital protective relays. It also offers maintenance services. The division also offers turnkey systems and service for power transmission and distribution grids, and for power plants. Electrical substations and substation automation systems are key areas. Additional highlights include flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS), high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems and network management systems. The division is subdivided into the four business units High Voltage Products, Transformers, Grid Automation and Grid Integration.
Other[edit]
In May 2013, ABB Sécheron SA joined with several groups in Geneva (TOSA Trolleybus Optimisation Système Alimentation, or in English, Trolleybus Power System Optimization) in a one-year demonstration of a trolleybus route using a novel charging system. Rather than overhead wires, charging is accomplished by fixed overhead devices located at stops along the route and at the terminus.[24][25][26] Jean-Luc Favre, head of Rail ISI, discussed the promising role of improved electric transport technology in ABB.[27]

History[edit]
See also: Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget and Brown, Boveri & Cie
ABB's history goes back to the late 19th century. ASEA was founded in 1883 by Ludvig Fredholm[5] in Västerås as manufacturer of electrical light and generators. Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC) was formed in 1891 in Baden, Switzerland, by Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown and Walter Boveri[6] as a Swiss group of electrical companies producing AC and DC motors, generators, steam turbines and transformers.




ABB around the world.[vague]


ABB resulted from the 1988 merger of the Swedish corporation Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA) and the Swiss company Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC); the latter had absorbed the Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon in 1967. CEO at the time of the merger was the former CEO of ASEA, Percy Barnevik, who ran the company until 1996.

In 1990, ABB purchased Westinghouse's metering and control division (the load control division was spun off to Cannon Technologies in the late 1990s and the meter division was spun off to Elster Electricity in the early 2000s). Also, in the early 1990s, ABB purchased Combustion Engineering (C-E), headquartered in Stamford and Norwalk, Connecticut, a leading U.S. firm in the development of conventional fossil fuel power and nuclear power supply systems to break into the North American market. Klaus Agthe was CEO of the US operation at the time. Continuing with its expansion plans, ABB purchased Elsag Bailey,[7] a process automation group, in 1997 which included Bailey Controls, Hartmann & Braun, and Fischer & Porter. This was the largest acquisition to date in ABB's history.
ABB bought International Combustion Ltd[8] from Rolls-Royce[9] in 1997.
ABB's boiler and fossil fuel businesses were purchased by Alstom in 2000, and its nuclear business was purchased by Westinghouse Electric Company in 2000. In 2000, ABB also signed a contract for the delivery of equipment and services for two North Korean nuclear powerplants to be supplied under an agreement with the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO),[10] a consortium formed in 1995 by the governments of the United States, Japan, South Korea and the European Union.[11] ABB formally divested from a joint venture named ABB-Alstom Power in 2000, and sold its interest in conventional power generation systems to Alstom Power. ABB's nuclear business was sold[12] to BNFL and merged into Westinghouse Electric Company.
In 2001, ABB was ranked as number one on the Dow Jones corporate sustainability index[13] for the third year in a row.
In 2002, ABB asked Lindahl, the company's former chief executive, to return some of his $50 million retirement pay, which its board called excessive. ABB also asked its former chairman Percy Barnevik to pay back part of his $87 million pension package. The size of the pensions was disclosed at the same time as ABB's $691 million net loss for 2001 made headlines and drew sharp criticism in Switzerland and Sweden.[14]
ABB's Building Systems business unit was sold off in 2004 to Capvis,[15] a Swiss private equity company, as part of ABB's strategy to focus on power and automation technologies. ABB's building systems businesses in Australia and Hong Kong were sold off the year before, in May 2003, to Downer EDI Limited. Building Systems provided services for building facilities encompassing indoor air quality, building automation as well as power distribution and management.
Financial debt and lingering asbestos liability brought ABB to the brink of bankruptcy in the early 2000s. In 2006, ABB returned to financial health by settling its asbestos liability regarding claims that were filed against ABB's U.S. subsidiaries, Combustion Engineering and Lummus Global.[16] In August 2007 Lummus Global was sold to CB&I.[17]
In December 2008, ABB acquired Ber-Mac Electrical and Instrumentation to expand its presence in western Canada's oil and gas industries. Ber-Mac Electrical and Instrumentation has been in the business of supplying electrical power and instrumentation equipment and services, both domestically and to international markets since 1980. Ber-Mac provides its clients with expertise in industrial automation, electrical and instrumentation design, process optimization, panel fabrication and field services. It is particularly strong in the Oil & Gas industry. Ber-Mac’s value proposition in engineering expertise and service capabilities is highly respected throughout Western Canada, this was a key factor in ABB’s decision to acquire the firm. This acquisition significantly expanded ABB’s presence in Western Canada to more than 760 employees in over 20 locations.
In 2009, ABB realigned its automation divisions to enhance growth opportunities. As of January 1, 2010, the business units in the Automation Products and Robotics divisions were regrouped into two new divisions – Discrete Automation and Motion, and Low Voltage Products. The Process Automation division remained unchanged except for the addition of the instrumentation business from the Automation Products division.
In May 2010, ABB acquired software company Ventyx for more than $1 billion from Vista Equity Partners.[18]
In 2011, on May 9 ABB announced acquisition of Australian-based Mincom Limited from private equity firm Francisco Partners - to expand their enterprise software business for undisclosed sum.[19] On July 29, 2011, acquisition has been finalised.[20] Mincom and Ventyx were subsequently integrated under the Ventyx name, and have now been integrated into ABB as the Enterprise Software Product Group.
In 2011 ABB acquired Baldor Electric USA for $4.2 billion in an all-cash transaction
On January 30, 2012, ABB Group acquired Thomas & Betts in a $3.9 billion cash transaction.[21]
On June 15, 2012, ABB completed acquisition of commercial and industrial wireless technology specialists Tropos.
In July 2013, ABB acquired Power-One in a $1 billion all-cash transaction, to become the leading global manufacturer of solar inverters [1].
Organizational structure[edit]
ABB is the world's largest builder of electricity grids[22] and is active in many sectors, its core businesses being in power and automation technologies. With a long history of growth through mergers and acquisitions, it entered a phase of structure unification since 2014. The company has one corporate division and four production divisions since reorganization in January 2017. ABB is one of the few large companies that have successfully implemented the matrix structure in their organization.
Electrification Products[edit]
The Electrification Products division manufactures low- and medium-voltage electrical products, including electric vehicle infrastructure, solar inverters, modular substations, distribution automation; products to protect people, installations and electronic equipment from electrical overload such as enclosures, cable systems and low-voltage circuit breakers; measuring and sensing devices, control products, switches and wiring accessories. The division further makes KNX systems that integrate and automate a building's electrical installations, ventilation systems, and security and data communication networks. Electrification Products also incorporates an Electrification Solutions unit manufacturing low voltage switchgear and motor control centres. Customers include a wide range of industry and utility operations, plus commercial and residential buildings.
Robotics and Motion[edit]
The Robotics and Motion division provides products and services for industrial production. It includes electric motors, generators, drives, power electronics and industrial robots. ABB has installed over 300,000 robots.[23] In 2006, ABB opened a manufacturing centre in Shanghai, China. Also, wind generators, solar power inverters and UPS products belong to this division.
Industrial Automation[edit]
The main focus of the Industrial Automation division is to provide customers with systems for control, plant optimization, and industry-specific automation applications. The industries served include oil and gas, power, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, pulp and paper, metals and minerals, marine and turbocharging. The division consists of seven business units: Control Technologies (the world's No 1 DCS supplier); Marine & Ports; Measurement & Analytics; Oil, Gas & Chemicals; Power Generation & Water; Process Industries and Turbocharging.
Power Grids[edit]
The Power Grids division offers key components for the transmission and distribution of electricity. The division incorporates ABB's manufacturing network for transformers, switchgear, circuit breakers, and associated high voltage equipment such as digital protective relays. It also offers maintenance services. The division also offers turnkey systems and service for power transmission and distribution grids, and for power plants. Electrical substations and substation automation systems are key areas. Additional highlights include flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS), high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems and network management systems. The division is subdivided into the four business units High Voltage Products, Transformers, Grid Automation and Grid Integration.
Other[edit]
In May 2013, ABB Sécheron SA joined with several groups in Geneva (TOSA Trolleybus Optimisation Système Alimentation, or in English, Trolleybus Power System Optimization) in a one-year demonstration of a trolleybus route using a novel charging system. Rather than overhead wires, charging is accomplished by fixed overhead devices located at stops along the route and at the terminus.[24][25][26] Jean-Luc Favre, head of Rail ISI, discussed the promising role of improved electric transport technology in ABB.[27]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
