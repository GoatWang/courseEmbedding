Richard James Kerr (born October 4, 1935) was Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 1991-1992.
He was born on Fort Smith, Arkansas. Kerr had a 32-year career with the CIA which included involvement in the retaliatory bombing raids against Libya in 1986[1] and culminated with key roles in managing U.S. intelligence related to the near nuclear stand-off between India and Pakistan in 1990[2] and the attempted coup against Boris Yeltsin in August, 1991.[3]
In 1991, Kerr was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President George H. W. Bush.[4]
From 1996 to 2002, "Dick" Kerr also served on the Board of Directors for the Aegis Research Corporation of Rosslyn and later Falls Church, Virginia.[5] He continues to serve on corporate boards and is a compliance observer of the 1998 Belfast Agreement.

Mornings in Pacific Palisades
Ronald Reagan and the President's Daily Brief
Richard J. Kerr and Peter Dixon Davis
The presidential election of 1980 was over, and it was the morning after. In CIA's Office of Current Operations, we knew that a new boss and a new set of customers had us in their sights. Ronald Reagan would be in the White House by the end of January, and a Republican team of national security officials would be calling the shots. CIA would have a new Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). He would bring in a new deputy. There probably would be other new faces at the top of CIA, and a new set of staff weenies would appear as well.
Déjà vu all over again? So it seemed to us: here we were, the Director and Deputy Director of the Office of Current Intelligence, and we faced another new administration, another foreign policy team, another group to which we had to prove ourselves all over again. But, while we were veterans of such transitions, neither of us had grown so jaded or so weary of trying to convince our customers of the value of intelligence that we did not warm to the possibility of new experiences. We were at once stimulated by the prospect of change and challenged by the problems we clearly had to overcome. It would not be easy, but it would be exciting. The task sounded straightforward if you had no experience trying to do it: providing a daily report of current intelligence to the President and his national security team that was comprehensive, offered information and analysis not available from other sources, and helped rather than frustrated the policymaking process.
We knew that in the confusion of changing administrations, establishing daily intelligence support at top levels of a wary new leadership might just as likely be resisted as welcomed. At the same time, this new group valued intelligence; the question was whether they thought CIA was up to the task. How would we be received by a palace guard that at times had appeared downright hostile?
It was not as though we had not been warned. The campaign just ended had been a rough one, with CIA taking its knocks, and intelligence performance generally getting poor marks from a range of Republican critics of the Carter administration's handling of our business. Our track record with presidents, moreover, was not encouraging. We had spent the past few years trying to divine exactly what President Carter wanted in the way of current support--the feedback was as mixed as it was sparse--and we were never sure our efforts were on the mark. He eventually took time to visit Headquarters and thank us specifically for the President's Daily Brief (PDB), but we were not convinced that he really valued it.
Our experience with a number of administrations was that they started with the expectation that intelligence could solve every problem, or that it could not do anything right, and then moved to the opposite view. Then they settled down and vacillated from one extreme to the other.
Ronald Reagan gave us pause. The nature of his views and his lack of experience in dealing with foreign policy issues left us even less certain what kind of support would interest him (or what he would accept). We could not have imagined then that soon we would be having daily one-on-one access to "the highest level."
First we would have to contend with Reagan's foreign policy advisers, whose words and actions during the campaign likewise inspired little confidence in the CIA's future. William Casey, Richard Allen, Fred Ikle, Frank Gaffney, Michael Pillsbury, and Angelo Codevilla all were strong critics of intelligence performance.
Establishing Contact With the Transition Team
President Carter made the first move. He directed that the PDB be made available immediately to the President-elect and Vice President-elect so that they would be getting the same information as those responsible for national security until the inauguration.
The first contact with the new team was made in a telephone call from Richard Lehman, who had been the Director of the Office of Current Intelligence during previous transitions, to Richard Allen. The following day, Kerr accompanied Lehman to the transition headquarters in Washington. The meeting was brief and businesslike and clearly placed Allen as our point of contact. It also was clear that he wanted no regular contact with DCI Turner or anyone else in the current leadership: he preferred, as the President-elect's designee, that we serve him directly and that he be the channel for any required intelligence support. To our knowledge, he did not have any regular contact with others in CIA during the transition period.
From that first day, we were pretty much on our own in setting up all subsequent briefing sessions with the three incoming occupants of the White House and in arranging for their intelligence support.
The Briefings Begin
The process began almost immediately with a series of briefings of Allen held in his Washington business office, in cars, and at the Madison Hotel over breakfast. He was shown the PDB and other current reports on the full range of intelligence issues. We also provided special memorandums in response to his various requests. Allen was an avid customer almost from the first day. There was never any question about his view of our loyalty; we worked for him and the new administration. It was an interesting situation: we were still producing the PDB for President Carter, although we had no contact with him or with senior officials in the administration. The incoming group had captured all our attention, and there were still nearly three months to go before the inauguration.
The briefings entered a new phase when the President-elect and the Vice President-elect made their first visit to Washington in mid-November. During their week in town, Allen set up a couple of meetings with President-elect Reagan at his Blair House quarters. At the same time, we began daily briefings of Vice President-elect Bush, who was staying around the corner at the Jackson Place townhouse reserved for former presidents. The sessions with Reagan had to compete with the extraordinary press of business awaiting the new chief executive; they were tightly structured, and intelligence issues were not central. Allen used the meetings to conduct a good deal of general business. The sessions with Bush were quite different: as a former DCI with whom we had had some previous contact, he was a customer of a different sort. His briefings were informal, animated, and extended well beyond the substance of the PDB. Arrangements were handled directly, facilitated by the fact that Bush's executive assistant was also a former colleague.
At the end of that week, as Reagan and Bush prepared to return to Los Angeles and Houston, respectively, things took an interesting turn. Influenced by his experience as DCI and UN Ambassador and his familiarity with intelligence processes and people, Bush had ruminated on several occasions about the need to bring Reagan into the current analytic stream as quickly as possible. He felt it was imperative that the newly elected president receive daily briefings based on the PDB, and--even more important--that a professional intelligence officer be present to answer any questions, provide background information, and follow up on whatever intelligence needs Reagan might have. Bush knew from firsthand experience that filtering went on as an intelligence product moved through the White House staff and on to the President. He also knew that to make intelligence relevant the Agency needed regular feedback from its key customers.
It seemed a good opportunity, given Bush's candor and friendly disposition toward the Agency, to make a bold recommendation: because he was scheduled in a few hours to ride along with Reagan to Andrews Air Force Base, perhaps he might want to urge his new boss to request that such daily briefings be provided him personally during the period he remained in California pending the inauguration. Bush told Davis he would give it a try.
Shortly after Reagan's takeoff that afternoon, a message from the plane arrived at CIA Headquarters. Ed Meese asked that a CIA briefer be prepared to present the PDB to the President-elect at his home in Pacific Palisades the following morning. A few hours later, after hurriedly arranging for daily transmission of the PDB to an Agency facility in Los Angeles, Kerr was on a plane to the West Coast.
Opening a Second Front
Now we were operating on both coasts. We used an Agency facility that had secure communications, and Kerr set up business in a vault. The time difference helped because there was an opportunity for Kerr to read the PDB and then call on a secure line to ask questions and get additional information. Davis directed the production process in Washington--selecting items for the book, sharpening the judgments, and getting the supporting information that was needed to understand complicated issues that might end up being treated in a paragraph in the PDB.
Although we were the front men in this drama, it was an Agency-wide effort. Obviously, the country and technical analysts in the Directorate of Intelligence provided the daily product and responded to the wide range of questions. Photo interpreters, technical experts in the Directorate of Science and Technology, Foreign Broadcast Information Service specialists, and the clandestine collectors in the Directorate of Operations provided the grist for this effort. Without a high-quality product and an organization that could respond quickly to questions and crises, this briefing process would not have gotten off the ground.
The team that put together the PDB every afternoon and evening was extraordinary. Jim McCullough, Chuck Peters, Gail Solin, and Ray McGovern comprised a group of sophisticated analysts with a keen sense of the issues that the customers would or should be interested in. All were to become briefers when the number of our customers expanded after inauguration.
Into the Lion's Den
Kerr had no idea of what to expect at Reagan's house in Pacific Palisades. A cast of thousands, Secret Service a mile deep, and a palace of a residence? No, nothing of the kind. The CIA security officer supporting Kerr had located the house the previous day. Driving up the narrow road to the residence, the only sign of something unusual was that the driveway was closed off. A modest house, looking a bit rundown, was the first impression. A Secret Service agent approached, and Kerr showed him a CIA identification card, saying he was there to brief the President-elect. No passes, no search, no questions, and no horseholders. He went into the recreation room on the lower floor and told a young woman in the makeshift office space that he was there for the intelligence briefing. A man introduced himself as responsible for security and escorted him to the main floor. He suggested that he probably should sit in on the briefing; when told it was for Reagan only, he just nodded and went to find him. A minute later, the future President came out in his bathrobe. We went into the breakfast area, and he introduced Mrs. Reagan. A dog sat next to the table. It was very casual and domestic. Reagan offered coffee, and we went into the den. He read the PDB carefully, asking an occasional question, and then read the other material. We talked briefly about the briefing process and what type of material he would like to see. He agreed that, unless there was some pressing engagement, an early morning briefing would work best.
With no further ado, the pattern was set. During the remainder of the transition, each week we rotated the briefing and editorial duties on the west and east coasts. The briefing sessions in California continued every morning much as they had that first day, Davis being received with equally little fuss by an attentive and gracious Mr. Reagan and a watchful but friendly Mrs. Reagan.
Reagan as Customer
During the holiday period, the President-elect was as diligent as ever in keeping up his briefing schedule, breaking off only for Christmas and for a quick trip to Palm Springs for the traditional New Year's Eve party at the Walter Annenbergs. Returning the next day, he even agreed to meet Davis in the late afternoon for a catchup session. One lesson learned that day: Reagan was a "morning person," not an "afternoon person."
As a rule, Reagan was a studious reader, going over each item deliberately and with considerable concentration. It was common knowledge that he had pretty fixed views on such subjects as the Soviet Union, European diplomacy, and Israel, but--somewhat to our surprise--he showed no impatience or disdain with analysis that presented a different view. In contrast to Allen, for example, there was little tendency to challenge or dispute our line of thinking. If he was skeptical, he rarely showed it. Rather, the door seemed to be open to new ideas, even if they were not welcome or necessarily accepted. And, despite the serious approach to the material, there were more than a few flashes of the Reagan humor. He was, in short, an interested, cordial, and somewhat baffling customer.
Because of Reagan's willingness and patience in reading items we called to his attention, we were frank about the product. We were careful to point out articles that were light on facts as well as those where the analysis was superficial or a bit naïve. It was not uncommon for us to comment on a particular piece that "we really do not know much about this particular development."
The daily routine was interrupted only for a second visit to Washington in mid-January, when we returned to the earlier pattern of briefing Allen, Reagan, and Bush at their Pennsylvania Avenue quarters. On Reagan's return to California, Davis accompanied the presidential party on what was deemed an inappropriately humble military aircraft--a DC-9. Midway in the flight, he was invited to join Reagan in the forward cabin to review the day's PDB and to go over a special memorandum on factional splits in the Palestinian leadership. This turned into a more extended session than usual, giving the President-elect an opportunity to raise a number of questions on issues of priority interest to him.
Iran and the hostage situation were uppermost in our minds throughout the transition. Reagan's concern for the Embassy hostages was acute, and he absorbed whatever raw and finished intelligence we were able to offer on the subject.
Briefers on the Inside
 
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the briefing process was the relationship that developed between both of us, on the one hand, and those we briefed. Often during briefings, or while we waited during telephone calls or other visitations, we overheard conversations between Reagan or Bush and potential cabinet members or advisers. We listened to discussions of their strengths and weaknesses, complaints and personal exchanges that clearly were not meant for outsiders' ears. We also watched the courting process and the beginning of what would become the pecking order for those around the President. We were accepted as part of the scenery--trusted without any apparent reservations. They seemed in fact to trust us with sensitive personal information in the same way we trusted them with the most sensitive intelligence.
Equally striking was the degree to which we were given a free hand during this two-month period of direct contact with a top leadership that would eventually include Secretary of Defense-designate Caspar Weinberger and Secretary of State-designate Alexander Haig as well as Reagan, Bush, and Allen. We had little supervision from officials within the CIA or the Carter administration.
Another interesting feature of this period was that, to our knowledge, Reagan, Bush, and Allen did not receive formal, regular briefings from any other part of the government. There were contacts with State and Defense, but nothing like the type of regular contact we had established. The lack of contact between us and William Casey, who was to become DCI, was also noteworthy. At most, Kerr would exchange "good morning" greetings with Bill Casey, to whom he had been introduced by Reagan. Casey usually was with a group of senior advisers waiting for the intelligence briefing to end outside Reagan's den. He clearly was not worried about what we were saying. Similarly, DCI Turner never asked us what was going on.
Direction From CIA Leadership
After the initial contact with Richard Lehman, we were largely on our own. We reported back to Bruce C. Clarke, Jr., the Deputy Director of Intelligence (DDI)--our immediate boss--and kept him informed about what we were doing and what questions were being asked. We directed most of the tasking for papers or information that we got from the principals or from Allen to the appropriate offices in CIA, and we kept CIA leaders informed of our activity by a daily memorandum. One thing we decided early on was that we were not going to report on the conversations we participated in or overheard, or the personal reactions or comments of those we were briefing, unless it directly related to intelligence support. Consequently, we kept our daily reports clear of any gossip or personal information. That turned out to be a wise decision.
Neither of us received any clear instructions about these briefings of the prospective President, Vice President, National Security Adviser, and others we would be involved with, other than "not to screw it up." Bruce Clarke's most explicit instruction to Kerr before the first briefing was "get a black belt to go with that blue suit--the brown one is not appropriate." He bought a black belt. Davis did not need such basic instruction. He still had the proper black attache case he had used at the Vietnam peace talks in Paris doing daily duty with Ambassadors Harriman, Vance, and Lodge. The confidence that Bruce Clarke had in us was not unexpected. He had been Kerr's mentor for nearly 20 years and was an extraordinary intelligence officer; some of his instruction had stuck.
Putting It All Together
 
We are convinced that this two- month period of private briefings gave the new administration a degree of confidence in the ability and loyalty of CIA that would not have been possible if the initial contact had been limited to those few more formal briefings mentioned by former DDI John Helgerson in his 1996 book, CIA Briefings of Presidential Candidates. Our worst fears about the more extreme critics tearing CIA apart when the new administration came in proved groundless. Some of the credit goes to this briefing effort. Bush's success in convincing Reagan that regular briefings were important and Reagan's instructions that the Secretaries of State and Defense receive the PDB were key. Finally, it was clear that Bill Casey was going to shape CIA along his own lines, not on the basis of transition team recommendations.
Looking back on the transition experience, it seems hard to believe that things fell into place so simply and with so little bureaucratic folderol and that the process had such lasting results. The system that evolved was as unprecedented as it was unpredictable. A review of the more striking short- and long-term features may be useful:
 
 There was no previous model, or rules of procedures, to guide us in meeting needs and exploiting opportunities as they arose.
 

 The system was planned only in the sense that we knew how we could help incoming officials, if only they would let us, and we had some sense of how they could help us.
 

 The support was geared to respond quickly to whatever we felt the situation called for.
 

 The day-to-day personal contact enabled us, in ad hoc fashion, to tailor the support.
 

 Requirements were not filtered; they were received directly, continually, and from the top level.
 

 There was virtually no intervention by intelligence overseers representing either the incoming or outgoing administrations.
 

 The transition team of incoming intelligence advisers installed at the Agency was out of the loop, having no contact with us and possibly not being aware of the support we were providing and to whom. (This unusual circumstance did not seem to bother their bosses.)
 

 Agency supervisors monitored the activity but refrained from directing it. The senior leadership deserved a good deal of credit for giving people the responsibility and then supporting them without a lot of handwringing.
 

 The President-elect, the Vice President-elect, and the National Security Adviser-designate did not, to our knowledge, receive regular, formal briefings from any other part of the government. We appeared to be the only professional US Government officials in continuing contact with these VIPs.
 

 By Inauguration Day, the daily briefing system was so well established that it seemed natural to all involved that it would simply continue. The question hardly arose; it seemed a fait accompli. At President Reagan's direction, the service was to be provided also to Secretary of State Haig and Secretary of Defense Weinberger. (George Shultz and William Clark became recipients when they replaced Haig and Allen, respectively.) The Agency had finally obtained the continuing, high-level access it had been seeking since 1961.
 

 It seems reasonable to assume that the daily cabinet-level briefings that were provided (and welcomed) throughout the Reagan and Bush administrations would not have become such a regular fixture without the precedent of personal briefings during those extraordinary transition months of 1980-81. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As career current intelligence practitioners, we were in the right place at the right time. And we had the best professional products in the business. If we deserve any plaudits for playing our roles well, we are quick to bow to an able supporting cast and to our indulgent customers.
 
Editor's Note: Co-author Peter Dixon Davis provided former President Bush with a copy of this article, whose response is quoted below in part: 
Your article brought back a lot of happy memories and made me realize once again how lucky I was to have the PDB as V.P. and then as President, and how grateful I am and will always be for the work that went into preparing the PDB.
I read it religiously, without fail, and I hope the record will show that we protected the PDB from wide distribution and from careless handling.

RICHARD J. KERR - NOVEMBER 16, 1995









1995 Congressional HearingsIntelligence and Security

RICHARD J. KERR
FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
NOVEMBER 16, 1995 
Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee and staff, I welcome the opportunity to appear at this
hearing to discuss the intelligence community. I spent 32 years in a wide variety of assignments
in CIA and Intelligence Community and retain my strong interest in those organizations and in
the profession of intelligence.

This is a difficult period for CIA and a tough time for someone to argue its merits. But I am proud
to have worked at CIA for thirty plus years. The Agency did some extraordinary things for this
country. I was part of those successes. I do regret some of the things I did not do, some of the
questions I did not ask, some of the actions I did not take. As to personal responsibility, I am a
product of CIA's culture and I influenced that culture. I share its credit for what it did well and
share the blame for its shortcomings.

Given the chance to offer personal views on the Intelligence Community, it is tempting to range
widely and address all aspects of the business of intelligence-the implications of the end of the
Cold War, the national security problems now facing the US, and the full range of intelligence
activities--from R&D through the various collection disciplines and into finished intelligence. I
believe, however, it is worthwhile to focus on a few key issues and some ideas for how to
improve performance in the future. I also plan to center my comments on CIA. It is in real trouble
and is the core of most debate. That does not mean that I believe the NSA Security Agency and
the National Reconnaissance Office and other elements of the intelligence community are
unimportant but I will leave them for another discussion. Finally, I am not going to spend a lot of
time on past shortcomings--there are already too many experts and amateurs wallowing about in
that area.

I would like to address five issues:

1. The need for a strong, independent central intelligence agency and some concerns about the
increasing dominance of the Department of Defense.

2. Concerns about the clandestine service of CIA.

3. Oversight and management of the Intelligence Community.

4. Analysis and the customer.

5. Economic security and intelligence.

A Central Intelligence Organization 
General: An organization that reports to the President and supports the national security agencies
and departments as well as Congress, but has no direct ties to policy making organizations is
crucial. It can provide information and judgments that are not colored by commitment to a
particular outcome. Such an organization also can be an advocate for intelligence programs that
are national in nature and do not just serve a particular military service or agency.

Some
observations:

--I believe that the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (who is also the Director of
Central Intelligence) should not serve a specific term. The position should be filled by someone
chosen by the President and who is a peer of other key policy makers in the national security
arena. Line officers in the CIA should be intelligence professionals. The Deputy Director of CIA
should be an intelligence professional, possibly from the clandestine service. I am not arguing
that no one from the outside can be brought in, but key line jobs-- like the heads of the military
services--should be held by professional officers. Intelligence is a profession.

--Being independent is not enough. To be effective CIA must have clout--clout with other
organizations that compete for influence and money, especially the defense and State
Departments. Authority overseas as the focal point for activities and liaison, leadership in R&D
and the procurement of intelligence collection systems, and a real claim as the premier analytic
organization are key attributes.

--Over the past few years CIA appears to be treated as just
another unit in the intelligence community. The Intelligence Community Staff, DCI centers for
narcotics, terrorism, and nonproliferation were set up at the expense of CIA central role. Defense,
in particular, has been given control of more and more activities where CIA once played an
important if not dominant role. The imagery business is the most striking example, but there are
many CIA currently appears to be just another agency in the Defense budget process. CIA is just
one of several organizations that compete for influence overseas ( a situation that must delight and
confuse our foreign partners and targets). Much of the current debate about intelligence
addresses the issue of DCI authorities. A strong and independent central intelligence
organization is at the core of DCI authority.

--The emphasis on support to military operations has been healthy. The "bloody end of the stick",
"the point of the spear", "getting the intelligence to the warfighter" are good slogans and sound
principles. Most of expensive technical collection systems are justified because they support the
military in war. Consequently the military should have a strong voice in what must support military
operations. But it has other objectives that are equally important--providing intelligence and
supporting activities aimed at avoiding the use of military forces and addressing the complex set of
issues outside the military sphere.

--Covert and political action (under the control of a civilian intelligence organization) probably is
more important now than at any time since the end of WWII. It appears that the capability and
will to conduct such activity is woefully lacking. When it comes to imposing US will, we are more
comfortable sending fighter aircraft to strike targets than using covert military or political action to
influence the outcome. Covert action is a useful tool only when it is part of a much broader and
integrated policy initiative. Political actions is not a panacea and requires a clearly developed
objectives. Accepting these conditions, covert action is an instrument of the US. In my judgement,
paramilitary "covert" actions should be run by a civilian organization.

--Heavy involvement by the Defense Intelligence Agency in clandestine operations is a
mistake--not just for the nation but for DoD. The clandestine operations business is filled with
pitfalls, requires a major infrastructure, and oversight. Protection of overseas facilities and
preparation of the battle field are legitimate areas, but it is not hard to imagine CIA, DIA, and the
FBI running into each other on a regular basis only to acquire marginal information. It also is easy
to imagines the Secretary of Defense spending a lot of time on the Hill explaining what went
wrong.

--One additional point on Defense and intelligence. Without CIA and support from civilians
outside CIA, imagery satellites, the U-2 and the SR-71 would not have been so aggressively
pursued. The military services necessarily focus on their own interests and enhancements that help
their forces. They have not been major supporters of national programs until they found they could
not do without them. Defense also will eat up all the collection resources to support current crises.
It is important to have a strong civilian organization that competes for these resource operating
from a different set of priorities.

CIA needs to revitalize itself as a technological leader. While it may not drive technology today, it
can take the lead in applying commercial technology to intelligence with streamline procedures
and a minimum of bureaucracy.
THE CLANDESTINE SERVICE 
General: The most distinctive feature of CIA other than its independence form policy elements, is
the clandestine service. Technical collection and analysis are conducted by a variety of
organizations. The recruitment of agents, the conduct of paramilitary and political action to support
US policy are activities that each require special set of rules, a special group of people to conduct
them, and a special type of oversight. The present capabilities and practices in each of these
categories are seriously flawed. The current leadership is making important changes but progress
is slow.

Some observations:

--The clandestine service of the Cold War does not serve present needs. It probably got too big,
too walled off, and too isolated. Much of its "culture"--independence and flexibility,--must be
maintained. But like the US military after Vietnam, it needs an overhaul. Introducing rules,
directives and structure may make the senior managers fell more comfortable, but a clear
statement of mission, training and new creative ideas that originate inside the organization probably
are most critical. Most important is strong leadership from within.

--Cutting back on the number of clandestine stations overseas (and cutting back the State
Department presence) makes little sense. Regular contact with foreign governments, the elite in a
country, the opposition and future leaders is a primary task of CIA overseas. These activities are
not substitutes for diplomatic presence but additive and involve people and relationships that are
different than those of State. It also is useful to have lines of contact open when diplomatic
channels are clogged or strained. The clandestine service needs to be world wide. Our ability to
predict where the next crisis will occur is not particularly good.

--Targets of the clandestine service have changed. Recruitment of agents of real or potential
adversaries is still of prime importance. But in most countries access to those with influence,
whether they are controlled agents or not, is equally valuable. Being in the right place and having
entree to the right circles is extremely valuable. --we need to reassess what is valued about
officers in the clandestine service. There will be increasing need to work in teams and in task
forces. More and more of our business is going to be done by multi- disciplinary teams targeted
on specific problems and missions. That does not mean that we should make generalists our of all
case officers -- tradecraft and experience in operations remain key.

--The clandestine service has not valued assignments outside its core activities. over the past ten
years or so, senior executive positions in the Agency were usually filled by officers from the
Directorate of Intelligence. Officers from that organization usually had served in a variety of
positions inside and outside CIA. The career promotion boards in the clandestine service did not
credit work outside the service. Having DDI fill most senior officers in CIA meant there were real
gaps in knowledge about how the clandestine service functioned. They were not in a strong
position to question how things were done. I have specific examples in officers from the
clandestine service that worked as special assistants when I was DDCI. They were not credited
for that assignment by their promotion panels.
OVERNIGHT AND MANAGEMENT OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY 
General: This is a subject on which it is easy to pontificate. All of the old chestnuts appear. The
simple fact is that managing a large, secret organization that does illegal things overseas is difficult
and risky. CIA has had some exceptional managers and even they have gotten into problems. The
Agency officers reprimanded because of their involvement in Iran-Contra, Guatemala and the
Ames case had impressive careers and were among the most impressive people I have met inside
or outside government. I believe that says something about the difficulty of the job.

Management: The DCI's primary management team is composed of the Director of NSA, the
Director of DIA, the Director of the NRO, the head of INR and often someone from the CIA
other than the DCI or DDCI. This group cannot provide strong advice on issues that affect the
intelligence community as a whole because their interest necessarily must be driven by the
interests of their own organizations. CIA tends to be the loser in this process because it is not
represented by its head--the DCI must be seen as ecumenical. The President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board is not an important source of support for the intelligence
community or a valued critic. It does not seem to carry weight with the National Security Advisor
or the President and it has little visibility in technical circles or in Congress.

--It might be useful to create a real board of directors to advise the DCI. While it is not customary
for advisory boards in government to have much clout, there is no reason why a board drawn
from industry, academia, retired military and intelligence officers, information gurus and scientists
could not be given some authority for directing the intelligence community and CIA in particular.
It could have direct impact on new programs and personnel appointments. It could give on
programs and activities. It could be both an internal critic and an external supporter.

Oversight: There is no question that an organization that has special authorities and operates in
secret needs strong oversight--by its own Inspector General, by the Executive, and by Congress.
But oversight is more than a search for any violation of the rules or the law. It should also be
advocacy. Good oversight should identify what went right as well as what went wrong. I
understand why the oversight committees are angry about not being kept well informed--they
have assumed that responsibility for their fellow members and feel hung out when some flap
occurs on a situation about which they are not up to speed. But sometimes what happens to them
becomes more important that how well CIA does in accomplishing its fundamental mission.

--Oversight should involve assessing the impact of intelligence on policy. The question of
whether the Mexican financial crisis was well covered by intelligence probably is as important as
transgressions in Guatemala. The quality of policy and the impact of intelligence on that policy
are important questions that need to be addressed. Has CIA had an impact on US policy in
Bosnia? If so, why doesn't someone say so? If not, why isn't that the subject of review?

--Oversight itself needs to be reexamined now after 20 years of proliferating organs and activities.
The way we do oversight today is not consistent with a serious, effective intelligence effort over
the long haul. It had gotten too political, too publicity prone and lines of responsibility are too
confused. It is time to examine the executive orders, laws and directives that bear on clandestine
operations and on other aspects of intelligence. Although I am not a fan of "blue ribbon" panels,
a group of former legislators, some legal experts, some retired clandestine service officers and
others could develop a comprehensive package for consideration by the Executive and Congress.
Strong oversight but enabling. Clear and concise direction that gives guidance but provides the
maximum flexibility.
ANALYSIS AND THE CUSTOMER 
In my judgment the Directorate of Intelligence continues to provide outstanding support to its
customers. But the requirement to cover more and more subjects while cutting manpower
jeopardize its ability to do serious, in depth analysis. One of the basic questions posed about
analysis is whether CIA should become a reference service for the US government or focus just
on those areas where secret information is key. The answer is neither. CIA must address those
subjects that engaged or should engage policymakers. That means intelligence will need to be
positioned to respond to a wide range of questions--economic, political, social and military.
Obviously there are priorities--nuclear proliferation gets more attention than economic trends in
Africa. But the role for South Africa in the economy of sub-Saharan Africa deserves attention.
Both problems require a broad flow of information, experienced analysts and interested
customers.

Some observations:

--Although some critics argue that the importance of technical intelligence went South with the
end of the Cold War, nothing could be farther from the truth. Today a number of countries sell
advanced weapons systems and the support to go with them in the open market. Some very
sophisticated threats can be put in place rapidly. This poses a real challenge to intelligence. The
answers are not available just by reading the sales brochures.

--In this age of one liner, many believe that information equates to understanding. Continuity and
experience still count for something. Experienced analysts with a deep sense of history and access
to the full range of classified and open source information are key to serving the policy maker. The
capital stock of expertise needed for deep analysis is being depleted.

--The current written product of CIA--current intelligence, research products and
estimates--need updating. The customers should get a product tailored to their needs. They
should be offered some choices in how they received information. They should be able to talk to
key analysts. Consideration should be given to resurrecting the National Intelligence Survey
program that provided detailed country by country information on subjects ranging from
geography to financial systems. Such a program, run by CIA with participation of the DoD and
other agencies, would provide an important base of information for the entire government.

--Teaming with the outside world is imperative. national Estimates should be drafted by floating
teams of experts drawn from the press, academia, the business and scientific worlds, and"even"
foreign experts.

--Perhaps the major challenge is to tap all the sources of information and integrate them into the
final product. Information systems and analytic techniques to help the analyst move through this
maze are slow coming and will cost a bundle, but they are worth the time and money. While
"surfing the net" is the current fad, intelligence must focus on national security policy that deals
with sensitive and often dangerous issues. There must be security and control--not strong points of
the Internet world.

--CIA should continue to be in the military analysis business. It is important that alternative views
about the military threat and effectiveness of US military operations be available. CIA should
maintain an independent imagery analysis organization. It should be in a position to assess the
impact of the air strikes in Bosnia. It should be deeply involved in assessing the implications of
introducing NATO ground forces into the region. This type of analysis makes military planners
and policy makers uncomfortable. Certainly if done in public or used for political purposes by the
Congress, it can be destructive. But issues like this are too important not to use the full resources
of the government.
ECONOMIC SECURITY 
CIA, State, Treasury and Commerce do a good job in supporting the US during economic
negotiations and on issues that are primarily driven by government policy and actions. It is less
clear that these organizations help US industry to compete abroad. Economic intelligence is
controversial because the debate often focuses on economic espionage. Economic security is too
important to be left solely to the "interested" departments like Treasury, Commerce, and the
USTR.

--More can be done to support the interests of the US in the area of economic analysis. Some
consideration should be given to establishing a partnership between CIA,m a university, and some
private or federally funded group. The objective would be systematic, all source analysis of
current or prospective economic issues. That analysis could be based on classified and
unclassified information and be made available to government and (in some sanitized form) to the
private sector., An example of the work that could be done: Vietnam. A broad body of
information should be available to the US government and potential investors. For example,
information on the current infrastructure or lack thereof -- telecommunications, electric power,
transportation, banking an finance, and labor. In addition, information on the basic strategies of
other countries. How are they investing? Where and how do they arrange credit, buy land, hire
labor, contract for services? Who are the principal players?

Is this the job of the CIA? I believe
so.

I made it a point to educate my clients and provide the insurance products that best addressed their needs.  I was an Allstate “Premier Agency”; a designation given to a small number of agents based on production, great customer retention and low loss ratios.I started my insurance career in claims in 1992.  As a claims adjuster, I took great pride in knowing that I delivered on the promise to be there when my clients were dealing with the disruption caused by a fortuitous event.I worked in the pharmaceutical industry for a number of years promoting medication that helped patients with debilitating illnesses such as allergies, osteoporosis, diabetes and cancer.  It was satisfying to know that the medications I promoted made a difference in the lives of the patients who received it.  My unique experience in insurance claims, the pharmaceutical industry, and as a business owner helps me as I work with business clients in the Life Science, Healthcare, Technology, and Construction industries.ExperienceCommercial Insurance BrokerInsurance Office of AmericaJanuary 2011  –  Present (6 years 7 months)Consult with clients in the Technology, Life Science and Healthcare industries to identify potential “blind spots” in their insurance program and to develop strategies to minimize potential gaps in coverage, increase profits and protect assets.
