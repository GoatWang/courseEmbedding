At Walmart, it's easy to find your favorite artists and albums, while discovering new ones, too. Shop some of the most popular categories like pop, rock, country, rap/hip-hop, R&B/soul and Christian/gospel. There s also dance and deejay music, Latin, classical, jazz, blues, movie soundtracks, even music DVDs and more. It s a seemingly endless collection of the best hits   from yesterday and today. Choosing your music Browse through the latest releases and preorder albums that are coming soon. You can also check out the list of current best sellers in any category or sort them by customer rating to see what s most popular with other music fans. There are even can t-miss deals that let you get more music for less money by finding older releases from your favorite artists at discount prices. Music for kids And don t forget the youngsters in your life. If you re searching for music for the kids to listen to   whether you re at home or on a road trip   choose from a wide variety of children's tunes. Singalong songs will keep your child occupied for hours while toddlers will be entertained with timeless classics that never fade. You ll enjoy sharing songs like  The Wheels on the Bus,   Mary Had a Little Lamb  and  I m a Little Teapot.  Wanna get moving? Look through the selection of dance recordings and rock to the beat. Celebrate with karaoke If you have a fun event coming up, check out the karaoke music selections, a perfect complement to parties and family gatherings if there ever was one. Try some country music, pop music, relive the music from the 80s and much more. Whatever the musical preference, there s a karaoke party waiting for you. Records and turntables Still got a thing for vinyl? It s OK. We get that. Satisfy that old-school itch and shop for records in a variety of categories or choose a bundled collection from select popular artists, both old and new. Then spin those RPMs just like you used to because some things should never go out of style. If you should need a record player to go with that vinyl, you can combine old and new technologies with a turntable that includes: an AM/FM radioa cassette playera CD player USB and Bluetooth technology An added USB connection let s you convert vinyl to digital media or Bluetooth technology will let you stream music from other, more modern devices   all with precisely the style you're going for. Throw it back with a vintage record player look or grab a unit that mimics the turntables in a trendy club. Mobile music Of course, you can also take the more modern-day approach and listen to your music on any mobile device, including iPads and tablets. Save the storage space around your house or in your car and go digital. A 16-gigabyte device can hold roughly 3,500 songs. That s a lot of music to listen to   conveniently. And if you want to bump it up to 64 gigs, you re looking at 15,000 songs. Now that s an impressive music collection. Give the gift of music Music makes a fantastic gift any time of the year, so consider making a wish list of albums you'd love and encouraging your family and friends to do the same. Or, simply give them an electronic gift card. iTunes e-gifts are incredibly thoughtful and handy and come in a variety of denominations, from $10 to $100. These unique codes are provided via email and are perfect for anyone who likes apps, games, music, movies, television shows, books and more. They can be used in the App Store, or with iTunes, iBooks   even toward an Apple Music membership, if desired. Google Play gift codes also provide access to the latest entertainment   whether it s music, movies, TV, books, magazines, apps or games. Let that special someone enjoy their favorite songs, flicks and more on any sized screen across Android, iOS and the web. There s also a Microsoft Groove Music pass, which provides instant access to millions of songs. Your music, your way With so many options, it has never been easier to listen to your favorite music. And with Walmart's Every Day low prices, there's no reason not to expand your music library and add to your loved one s collection, too. Save Money.

Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35.
