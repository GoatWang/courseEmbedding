Kirkland Andrews
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
As head of NRG's finance organization, Kirk plays an instrumental role in formulating and executing NRG's capital allocation strategies and in financing the company's renewables and repowering initiatives. He leads all of NRG's corporate financial functions, including treasury, financial planning, accounting, internal audit, tax, risk, credit management, insurance and supply chain.
Kirk joined NRG in 2011 as Chief Financial Officer after a successful 15-year career in investment banking. In 2004, he was introduced to what would become the cornerstone of NRG's generation business when he advised CenterPoint Energy on its sale of Texas Genco to a consortium of financial sponsors, which sold the business to NRG the following year. Kirk served as Managing Director and Head of Power Mergers and Acquisitions and subsequently headed the North American Power Investment Banking group at Citigroup Global Markets. Later, he served as Managing Director and co-head of Power and Utilities–Americas at Deutsche Bank. In his banking career, Kirk has led numerous large and innovative strategic, debt, equity and commodities transactions, including multiple advisory roles for NRG.
Kirk holds a Bachelor's degree in philosophy from Wake Forest University and an MBA from the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business.
