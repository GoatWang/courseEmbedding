They are very sturdy and I love the cards that come with it that describes which glass is good for what. They are not full size glasses though and I wish I would have known that. A full bottle of beer won't fit into a single glass which is the only reason for the three stars. I would only recommend these if somebody is OK with the smaller sizes.Reviewed by 34 customersSort byNewestOldestHighest ratingLowest ratingMost helpfulLeast helpfulClear all filtersDisplaying reviews 1-10Back to topPrevious | Next »4/15/2017(1 of 1 customers found this review helpful) 4.0Happy recipient By Bubbafrom East TennesseeAbout Me PracticalProsUniqueConsBest UsesHomeComments about UncommonGoods 13 Piece Beer Tasting Set:My friend, a self proclaimed "beer snob" was thrilled.

The Mounting Threat of Domestic Terrorism: al Qaeda and the Salvadoran Gang MS-13
Cynthia L. Starita
					July 2009

					ISBN-13:  978-1-59332-341-7 / Hardcover
					Dimensions:  5.5 x 8.5 / viii, 256 pages






						Price   $70.00









Description
Starita considers the terrorist threat of the transnational criminal syndicate Mara Salvatrucha, commonly known as MS-13, its affiliation with Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional (FMLN) in El Salvador, and its possible link to al Qaeda. Starita's findings suggest that the goals, tactical capabilities, and organizational fecklessness of MS-13 make the Salvadoran gang capable of providing the assistance necessary for the realization of al Qaeda's goals and that this assistance could be provided by the cliques of MS-13 operating in the southwestern United States. Further, she finds indirect evidence of collaboration between MS-13 and al Qaeda andthat other transnational criminal syndicates could also offer al Qaeda the same tactical assistance MS-13 might provide.


About the Author

She has fourteen years of experience in the banking industry as well as a background in chemistry and biology, which she taught for six years. Dr. Starita formerly headed a forensic science program and was a police Sergeant for nine years serving as a police academy training coordinator and instructor.

BakerHostetler's Cincinnati Office Grows with Addition of 13 Attorneys

Press Releases / June 28, 2017









CINCINNATI, June 28, 2017 — BakerHostetler announces the addition of 13 attorneys to the firm’s Cincinnati office. Richard Barnett, of counsel, and Associate Katlin Rust join the Business Group; Associates Brian Bartish and Julie Hein join as members of the Intellectual Property Group’s Privacy and Data Protection team; and Staff Attorney Megan Fields joins the Employment Group. Eight staff attorneys also recently joined the firm. The addition of the attorneys is part of continued growth of the Cincinnati office and follows a recent expansion of its Intellectual Property and Business practice groups in 2016.
“We are pleased to add this talented group of trusted counselors as we continue to meet the growing demand for our services,” said Dave Holcombe, Partner-in-Charge of the Cincinnati office. “Expanding our attorney complement allows us to deliver on the firm’s long-standing tradition of strongly supporting our clients’ business and legal needs.”
Barnett, of counsel, is a member of the Business Group. His practice focuses on general legal and business counseling in the commercial, transactional and employment arenas. Most recently, he served as vice president, associate general counsel and assistant secretary of Hillenbrand Inc., a publicly-traded global diversified industrial corporation. At Hillenbrand, he also served as general counsel for its operating companies, including Batesville Casket Company where he was vice president, general counsel, secretary and a member of the executive management team. Previously, he was senior counsel for International Paper Company, a Fortune 100 company, where he helped guide the legal activities of the company’s $7 billion distribution and retail division. He has also served in private practice, having represented Fortune 500 companies, major universities, small businesses and individuals. Barnett received a J.D., with honors, from The Ohio State University College of Law in 1992, where he was a member of Order of the Coif. He earned a bachelor of arts in history, cum laude, from the University of Pennsylvania in 1989.
Four additional attorneys are dedicated to supporting individual practice groups. Rust is a member of the Business Group. She assists corporate clients in growth strategies and managing business risks, focusing on corporate and transactional matters. Rust earned an MBA from the University of Cincinnati in 2015 and received her J.D., magna cum laude, from the University of Cincinnati College of Law in 2014. She received a bachelor of science in business economics, summa cum laude, from the University of Louisville in 2011. Bartish is a member of the Intellectual Property Group and part of the firm’s Chambers USA-ranked Privacy and Data Protection team. He focuses his practice on privacy and data protection. He earned a master of science in information systems from the University of Cincinnati’s Carl H. Lindner College of Business in 2017. He received a J.D. from Indiana University School of Law in 2015 and a bachelor of arts in anthropology from the University of Notre Dame in 2012. Hein also is a member of the Intellectual Property Group, and her practice focuses on cybersecurity and data protection, with a concentration on contracts. She earned a J.D. from Case Western Reserve University School of Law in 2009 and a bachelor of arts in communications from the College of Mount Saint Joseph in 2004. Fields is a member of the Employment Group and part of the firm’s Chambers USA-ranked Labor and Employment team in Ohio. She is an experienced litigator who defends employers and managers in wide-ranging employment and labor issues. She earned a J.D., cum laude, from Northern Kentucky University Salmon P. Chase College of Law in 2009. She received a bachelor of science in political science, magna cum laude, from Clemson University in 2005.
Additionally, eight staff attorneys recently joined the Cincinnati office. New to the Litigation Group are Joshua Berry, Maxim Brumbach, Ken Foisy, Ross Gillingham, Noah Goertemiller, Marianne Hoover, Lauren Martin and Matthew Molony. These litigators are members of the BakerHostetler team serving as court-appointed counsel to the Securities Investor Protection Act (SIPA) Trustee for the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BLMIS), in the unprecedented recovery effort involving hundreds of actions.
The Cincinnati office has been serving clients since 1997. The office has grown to 32 attorneys who practice in all five of the firm’s practice areas, which include Business, Employment, Intellectual Property, Litigation and Tax.
