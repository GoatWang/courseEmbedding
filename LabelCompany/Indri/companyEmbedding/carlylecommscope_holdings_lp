	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT



	This document has two parts, a prospectus supplement and an accompanying prospectus dated March 4, 2015. This prospectus supplement and the accompanying
	prospectus are part of a registration statement on Form S-3 that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), utilizing a shelf registration process. Under this shelf registration process, the selling stockholder named
	in a prospectus supplement may, from time to time, offer and sell our common stock in one or more offerings or resales.


	The accompanying prospectus
	provides you with a general description of our common stock, which the selling stockholder may offer pursuant to this prospectus supplement. This prospectus supplement, which describes certain matters relating to us and the specific terms of this
	offering of shares of our common stock, adds to and updates information contained in the accompanying prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference herein. Any statement that we make in the accompanying prospectus will be modified or
	superseded by any inconsistent statement made by us in this prospectus supplement.


	The rules of the SEC allow us to incorporate by reference information
	into this prospectus supplement. This information incorporated by reference is considered to be a part of this prospectus supplement, and information that we file later with the SEC, to the extent incorporated by reference, will automatically update
	and supersede this information. See Incorporation by Reference. You should read both this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus together with additional information described under the heading Where You Can Find
	More Information before investing in our common stock.


	We are responsible for the information contained or incorporated by reference in this
	prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and in any related free-writing prospectus we prepare or authorize. Neither we, the underwriter nor the selling stockholder has authorized anyone to give you any other information, and we take no
	responsibility for any other information that others may give you. You must not rely upon any information or representation not contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus. This prospectus
	supplement and the accompanying prospectus do not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities in any jurisdiction to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation in such jurisdiction.


	You should not assume that the information contained in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus or any free writing prospectus
	prepared by us is accurate on any date subsequent to the date set forth on the front of the document or that any information we have incorporated by reference is correct on any date subsequent to the date of the document incorporated by reference,
	even though this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus is delivered or securities are sold on a later date. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may have changed materially since those dates.



	Unless otherwise noted in this prospectus supplement, the term CommScope Holdings means CommScope Holding Company, Inc. When we refer to
	CommScope, we, our, us and the Company in this prospectus supplement, we mean CommScope Holdings and its direct and indirect subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless otherwise
	specified.

	PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT SUMMARY




	This summary highlights important features of this offering and the information included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the
	accompanying prospectus. This summary does not contain all of the information that you should consider before investing in our common stock. You should read carefully the entire prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the documents
	incorporated by reference, especially the risks of investing in our common stock discussed under Risk Factors. References to BNS or the BNS business refer to the Broadband Network Solutions business of TE
	Connectivity LTD. (TE Connectivity), which we acquired (the Acquisition) on August 28, 2015 in an all-cash transaction.




	Company Overview

	MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERS



	The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to non-U.S. holders (as defined below) of the purchase,
	ownership and disposition of our common stock sold pursuant to this offering, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. The effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any
	applicable state, local or foreign tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings
	and administrative pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in effect as of the date of this offering. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change may be applied retroactively
	in a manner that could adversely affect a non-U.S. holder of our common stock. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary
	position regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common stock.


	This discussion is limited to non-U.S. holders
	that hold our common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally property held for investment). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a non-U.S.
	holders particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to non-U.S. holders subject to particular rules, including, without limitation:


	 




	 


	


	 


	U.S. expatriates and certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;




	 




	 


	


	 


	persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;




	 




	 


	


	 


	persons holding our common stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment;




	 




	 


	


	 


	banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;




	 




	 


	


	 


	brokers, dealers or traders in securities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;




	 




	 


	


	 


	partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein);




	 




	 


	


	 


	tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations;




	 




	 


	


	 


	persons deemed to sell our common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code;




	 




	 


	


	 


	persons who hold or receive our common stock pursuant to the exercise of any employee stock option or otherwise as compensation; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	tax-qualified retirement plans and foreign pension funds.




	If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S.
	federal income tax purposes holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner (or other owner) in such entity will depend on the status of the partner (or other owner), the activities of such entity and certain determinations made at the
	partner (or owner) level. Accordingly, entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes that hold our common stock and the partners (or owners) in such entities should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income
	tax consequences to them of purchasing, owning and disposing of our common stock.



	THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT INTENDED
	AS TAX ADVICE. INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND

	DISPOSITION OF OUR COMMON STOCK ARISING UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL ESTATE OR GIFT TAX LAWS OR UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX
	TREATY.





	Definition of a Non-U.S. Holder




	For purposes of this discussion, a non-U.S. holder is any beneficial owner of our common stock that is neither a U.S. person nor an
	entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. person is any of the following:


	 




	 


	


	 


	an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;




	 




	 


	


	 


	an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more United States persons (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (2) has made a valid
	election under applicable Treasury Regulations to continue to be treated as a United States person.






	Distributions




	Cash or other property distributions on our common stock generally will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our
	current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Amounts not treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes will constitute a return of capital and first be applied against and reduce a
	non-U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in its common stock, but not below zero. Any excess will be treated as capital gain and will be treated as described below in the section relating to the sale or disposition of our common stock.


	Subject to the discussion below on effectively connected income, dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder of our common stock will be subject to U.S. federal
	withholding tax at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the dividends (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty).


	Non-U.S. holders
	will be entitled to a reduction in or an exemption from withholding on dividends as a result of either (a) an applicable income tax treaty or (b) the dividends being received by the non-U.S. Holder in connection with the non-U.S.
	holders conduct of a trade or business within the United States. To claim such a reduction in or exemption from withholding, the non-U.S. holder must provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed (a) IRS Form W-8BEN or
	W-8BEN-E claiming an exemption from or reduction of the withholding tax under the benefit of an income tax treaty between the United States and the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established, or (b) IRS Form W-8ECI stating
	that the dividends are not subject to withholding tax because they are effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business within the United States, as may be applicable. These certifications must be provided to the
	applicable withholding agent prior to the payment of dividends and may be required to be updated periodically. Non-U.S. holders that do not timely provide the applicable withholding agent with the required certification, but that qualify for a
	reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS.


	If dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder are effectively connected with the non-U.S. holders conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and,
	if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment in the United States to which such dividends are attributable), then, although exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax (provided the non-U.S.
	holder provides appropriate certification, as described above), the non-U.S. holder will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such dividends on a net income basis at regular graduated rates. In addition, a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation


	 


	S-10






	Table of Contents



	may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year
	that are attributable to such dividends, as adjusted for certain items. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under any applicable income tax treaty.




	Sale or Other Taxable Disposition




	A non-U.S.
	holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of our common stock unless:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holders conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent
	establishment in the United States to which such gain is attributable);




	 




	 


	


	 


	the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the disposition and certain other requirements are met; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	our common stock constitutes a U.S. real property interest (USRPI) by reason of our status as a U.S. real property holding corporation (a USRPHC) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.




	Gain described in the first bullet point above will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at regular
	graduated rates. A non-U.S. holder that is a foreign corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on its effectively connected earnings and profits for the
	taxable year that are attributable to such gain, as adjusted for certain items.


	A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point above will be
	subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on any gain derived from the disposition, which may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even
	though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States). Such a non-U.S. holder generally will be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return with respect to such gains and losses.


	With respect to the third bullet point above, we believe we are not currently and do not anticipate becoming a USRPHC. Because the determination of whether we
	are a USRPHC depends on the fair market value of our USRPIs relative to the fair market value of our other business assets and our non-U.S. real property interests, however, there can be no assurance we are not a USRPHC or will not become one in the
	future. Even if we are or were to become a USRPHC, gain arising from the sale or other taxable disposition by a non-U.S. holder of our common stock will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if such class of stock is regularly
	traded, as defined by applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market, and such non-U.S. holder owned, actually or constructively, 5% or less of such class of our stock throughout the shorter of the five-year period ending
	on the date of the sale or other disposition or the non-U.S. holders holding period for such stock.


	Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax
	advisors regarding potentially applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.




	Information Reporting and Backup Withholding




	A non-U.S. holder will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments of dividends on our common stock, provided the applicable
	withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know such holder is a United States person and the holder certifies its non-U.S. status, such as by providing a valid IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI, or other applicable
	certification.


	However, information returns will be filed with the IRS in connection with any dividends on our common stock paid to the non-U.S. holder,
	regardless of whether any tax was actually withheld. Copies of these information


	 


	S-11






	Table of Contents



	returns may also be made available under the provisions of a specific treaty or agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established.


	Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to the proceeds of a sale of our common stock within the United States, and information reporting may
	(although backup withholding generally will not) apply to the proceeds of a sale of our common stock outside the United States conducted through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries, in each case, unless the non-U.S. holder certifies under
	penalty of perjury that it is a non-U.S. holder on IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or other applicable form (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a United States person) or such holder otherwise establishes an
	exemption.


	Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit
	against a non-U.S. holders U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.




	Additional
	Withholding Tax on Payments Made to Foreign Accounts




	Withholding taxes may be imposed under the Code provisions commonly known as the Foreign
	Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) on certain types of payments made to non-U.S. financial institutions and certain other non-U.S. entities. Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on dividends on, or gross proceeds from the
	sale or other disposition of, our common stock paid to a foreign financial institution or a non-financial foreign entity (each as defined in the Code), unless (1) the foreign financial institution undertakes certain
	diligence and reporting obligations, (2) the non-financial foreign entity either certifies it does not have any substantial United States owners (as defined in the Code) or furnishes identifying information regarding each
	substantial United States owner, or (3) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules. If the payee is a foreign financial institution and is subject to the diligence and
	reporting requirements in (1) above, it must enter into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury requiring, among other things, that it undertake to identify accounts held by certain specified United States persons or
	United States owned foreign entities (each as defined in the Code), annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on certain payments to non-compliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account
	holders. Non-U.S. governments have entered into intergovernmental agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described
	herein.


	Withholding under FATCA generally will apply to payments of dividends on our common stock regardless of when they are made. However, under the
	applicable Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally will only apply to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such stock on or after January 1, 2019. If a dividend payment is
	both subject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding tax discussed above under Distributions, the withholding under FATCA may be credited against such other withholding tax.


	Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of withholding under FATCA to their investment in our common
	stock.

	UNDERWRITING



	Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC is acting as the underwriter of the offering. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in an underwriting agreement
	among us, the selling stockholder and the underwriter, the selling stockholder has agreed to sell to the underwriter, and the underwriter has agreed to purchase from the selling stockholder, 10,000,000 shares of common stock.


	Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the underwriting agreement, the underwriter has agreed to purchase all of the shares sold under the
	underwriting agreement if any of these shares are purchased.


	We and the selling stockholder have agreed to indemnify the underwriter against certain
	liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the underwriter may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.


	The underwriter is offering the shares, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and accepted by them, subject to approval of legal matters by their
	counsel, including the validity of the shares, and other conditions contained in the underwriting agreement, such as the receipt by the underwriter of officers certificates and legal opinions. The underwriter reserves the right to withdraw,
	cancel or modify offers to the public and to reject orders in whole or in part.


	The shares may be offered by the underwriter from time to time to
	purchasers directly or through agents, or through brokers in brokerage transaction on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, or to dealers in negotiated transactions or in a combination of such methods of sale, at a fixed price or prices, which may be
	changed, or at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.


	The expenses of
	the offering, including expenses incurred by the selling stockholder but not including the underwriting discount, are estimated at $750,000 and are payable by us. We have also agreed to reimburse the underwriter for certain of its expenses in
	connection with this offering including their expenses, if any, relating to any required reviews by FINRA in an amount up to $20,000.


	The selling
	stockholder has granted an option to the underwriter to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional shares at the public offering price, less the underwriting discount. The underwriter may exercise this option for 30 days from the date of this prospectus
	supplement.


	We, our directors, certain of our executive officers and the selling stockholder have agreed, subject to certain exceptions (including with
	respect to securities issued in connection with an acquisition, joint venture, commercial relationship or strategic transaction up to 10% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding upon closing of this offering and provided the recipient
	enters into a lock-up agreement), not to sell or transfer any common stock or securities convertible into, exchangeable for, exercisable for or repayable with common stock, for 30 days after the date of this prospectus supplement without first
	obtaining the written consent of the underwriter. Specifically, we and these other persons have agreed, with certain limited exceptions, not to directly or indirectly:


	 




	 


	


	 


	offer, pledge, sell or contract to sell any common stock;




	 




	 


	


	 


	sell any option or contract to purchase any common stock;




	 




	 


	


	 


	purchase any option or contract to sell any common stock;




	 




	 


	


	 


	grant any option, right or warrant for the sale of any common stock;




	 




	 


	


	 


	lend or otherwise dispose of or transfer any common stock;




	 




	 


	


	 


	request or demand that we file a registration statement related to the common stock; or




	 


	S-13






	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	enter into any swap or other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, the economic consequence of ownership of any common stock whether any such swap or transaction is to be settled by delivery of shares or other
	securities, in cash or otherwise.




	This lock-up provision applies to common stock and to securities convertible into or exchangeable or
	exercisable for or repayable with common stock. It also applies to common stock owned now or acquired later by the person executing the agreement or for which the person executing the agreement later acquires the power of disposition.


	The shares of common stock are listed on Nasdaq under the symbol COMM.


	In connection with this offering, the underwriter may engage in passive market making transactions in the common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market in
	accordance with Rule 103 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act during a period before the commencement of offers or sales of common stock and extending through the completion of distribution. A passive market maker must display its bid at a price
	not in excess of the highest independent bid of that security. However, if all independent bids are lowered below the passive market makers bid, that bid must then be lowered when specified purchase limits are exceeded. Passive market making
	may cause the price of our common stock to be higher than the price that otherwise would exist in the open market in the absence of those transactions. The underwriter and dealers are not required to engage in passive market making and may end
	passive market making activities at any time.


	Until the distribution of the shares is completed, SEC rules may limit the underwriter from bidding for and
	purchasing our common stock. However, the underwriter may engage in transactions that stabilize the price of the common stock, such as bids or purchases to peg, fix or maintain that price.


	In connection with the offering, the underwriter may purchase and sell our common stock in the open market. These transactions may include short sales,
	purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales and stabilizing transactions. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriter of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in the offering.
	Covered short sales are sales made in an amount not greater than the underwriters option described above. The underwriter may close out any covered short position by either exercising its option or purchasing shares in the open
	market. In determining the source of shares to close out the covered short position, the underwriter will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which it may purchase
	shares through the option. Naked short sales are sales in excess of the option. The underwriter must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the
	underwriter is concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of our common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for
	or purchases of shares of common stock made by the underwriter in the open market prior to the completion of the offering.


	Similar to other purchase
	transactions, the underwriters purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our common stock or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our common stock. As a
	result, the price of our common stock may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. The underwriter may conduct these transactions on the exchange on Nasdaq, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.


	None of us, the selling stockholder or the underwriter makes any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the
	transactions described above may have on the price of our common stock. In addition, none of us, the selling stockholder or the underwriter makes any representation that the underwriter will engage in these transactions or that these transactions,
	once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.


	In connection with the offering, the underwriter or securities dealers may distribute
	prospectuses by electronic means, such as e-mail. In addition, the underwriter may facilitate Internet distribution for this offering to certain


	 


	S-14






	Table of Contents



	of its Internet subscription customers. The underwriter may allocate a limited number of shares for sale to its online brokerage customers. An electronic prospectus is available on the Internet
	web site maintained by the underwriter. Other than the prospectus in electronic format, the information on the web site of the underwriter is not part of this prospectus.


	The underwriter and its affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and
	investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The underwriter and its affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future
	perform, various financial advisory, investment banking, commercial banking and other services for us and our affiliates for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. In particular, the underwriter or its affiliates have acted
	as an underwriter or initial purchaser in our prior initial public offering and secondary offerings and/or prior notes offerings and act as lenders and/or agents under our senior secured credit facilities. Furthermore, the underwriter and its
	affiliates may, from time to time, enter into arms-length transactions with us in the ordinary course of their business.


	In the ordinary course of its
	various business activities, the underwriter and its affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their
	own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours. The underwriter and its affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or
	express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS



	This prospectus is part of a registration statement that we filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), as a
	well-known seasoned issuer as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act, using a shelf registration process. By using a shelf registration statement, the selling stockholders to be named in a supplement to this prospectus
	may, from time to time, sell common stock in one or more offerings. Each time that the selling stockholders sell securities, we will provide a prospectus supplement to this prospectus that will contain specific information about the terms of that
	offering. The prospectus supplement may also add, update or change information contained in this prospectus with respect to that offering. If there is any inconsistency between the information in this prospectus and the applicable prospectus
	supplement, you should rely on the prospectus supplement. Before purchasing any securities, you should carefully read both this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement, together with the additional information described under the
	headings Where You Can Find More Information and Incorporation by Reference.


	We are responsible for the
	information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus, any accompanying prospectus supplement and in any related free-writing prospectus we prepare or authorize. Neither we nor the selling stockholders have authorized anyone to give
	you any other information, and we take no responsibility for any other information that others may give you. We and the selling stockholders will not make an offer to sell these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not
	permitted. You should assume that the information appearing in this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement to this prospectus is accurate as of the date on its respective cover, and that any information incorporated by reference is
	accurate only as of the date of the document incorporated by reference, unless we indicate otherwise. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may have changed since those dates.


	THIS PROSPECTUS MAY NOT BE USED TO SELL ANY SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNLESS ACCOMPANIED BY A PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT.


	Unless otherwise noted in this prospectus, the term CommScope Holdings means CommScope Holding Company, Inc. When we refer to
	CommScope, we, our, us and the Company in this prospectus, we mean CommScope Holdings and its direct and indirect subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless otherwise specified.





	CERTAIN TRADEMARKS



	We own or otherwise have rights to the trademarks, copyrights and service marks, including those mentioned in this prospectus, used in
	conjunction with the marketing and sale of our products and services. This prospectus includes trademarks, such as CommScope, which are protected under applicable intellectual property laws and are our property and/or the property of our
	subsidiaries. This prospectus also contains trademarks, service marks, copyrights and trade names of other companies, which are the property of their respective owners. We do not intend our use or display of other companies trademarks, service
	marks, copyrights or trade names to imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, any other companies. Solely for convenience, our trademarks and tradenames referred to in this prospectus may appear without the

	RISK FACTORS



	Investment in our securities involves risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors incorporated by reference to our most recent
	Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on

	Form 10-Q

	or Current Reports on Form 8-K we file after the date of this prospectus, and all other information contained or incorporated
	by reference into this prospectus, as updated by our subsequent filings under the Exchange Act, as well as the risk factors and other information contained in the applicable prospectus supplement before acquiring any of such securities. The
	occurrence of any of these risks might cause you to lose all or part of your investment in the offered securities.



	Risks Relating to the Offering and
	Our Common Stock





	Upon the sale of a sufficient number of shares by an affiliate of Carlyle in an offering, we would no longer be a controlled
	company, and we may have difficulties complying with Nasdaq rules relating to the composition of our board of directors.




	Our common stock is
	listed on Nasdaq. As a controlled company under Nasdaq rules, we have not been subject to a number of corporate governance rules relating to composition of our board of directors and certain committees. Upon the sale of a sufficient number of shares
	by an affiliate of Carlyle in an offering, we would no longer be a controlled company and, in accordance with Nasdaq rules, would have to phase into compliance with certain requirements from which we are now exempt, including:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the requirement that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities.




	We intend to comply with these Nasdaq rules if we cease to be a controlled company. We may not be able to attract and retain the number of independent
	directors needed to comply with Nasdaq rules during the phase-in period for compliance.




	An offering may result in a substantial amount of
	previously unregistered shares of our common stock being registered, which may depress the market price of our common stock.




	Of the 187,831,389
	shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2014, approximately 53.9% were held by Carlyle. The remainder of our shares of issued and outstanding common stock are freely tradable on Nasdaq without restriction or further
	registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), unless purchased by our affiliates as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The shares of common stock being sold in an
	offering were not freely tradable on Nasdaq prior to the completion of such offering, and the sale by a selling stockholder of the shares of common stock in an offering will increase the number of shares of our common stock eligible to be traded on
	Nasdaq, which could depress the market price of our common stock.




	Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the possibility of such
	sales, may adversely affect the price of our common stock.




	Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after an
	offering, or the perception that such sales will occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for us to raise funds through securities offerings in the future. As of December 31, 2014, there were
	187,831,389 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, of which all of the 81,933,213 shares sold in registered offerings prior to the date hereof and all shares to be sold in an offering pursuant to this prospectus will be freely
	transferable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, unless acquired by our affiliates as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.


	 


	5






	Table of Contents



	In addition, all shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of stock options and other equity-based awards
	granted under our stock incentive plans will also be freely tradable under the Securities Act unless acquired by our affiliates. A maximum of 28.2 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under our stock incentive plans, some of
	which have been issued as of the date of this prospectus supplement. The remaining shares of common stock outstanding will be restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, but will be eligible for resale
	subject to applicable volume, manner of sale, holding period and other limitations of Rule 144 or pursuant to an exemption from registration under Rule 701 under the Securities Act.


	We, our directors, certain of our executive officers and Carlyle may agree to a lock-up in connection with an offering, meaning that, subject to
	certain exceptions, neither we nor they will sell any shares without the prior consent of the underwriter before a certain period of time after an offering. Following the expiration of this lock-up period, all of these shares of our common stock
	will be eligible for future sale, subject to the applicable volume, manner of sale, holding period and other limitations of Rule 144. In addition, Carlyle has the right under certain circumstances to require that we register their remaining shares
	for resale. As of the date of this prospectus, these registration rights apply to the 101,216,970 shares of our outstanding common stock owned by Carlyle. See the section entitled Description of Capital StockAmended and Restated
	Stockholders Agreement for a description of the shares of common stock that may be sold into the public market in the future.

	DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK




	The following description of our capital stock is not complete and may not contain all the information you should consider before investing
	in our capital stock. This description is summarized from, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, our certificate of incorporation, which has been publicly filed with the SEC. See Where You Can Find More Information and
	Incorporation by Reference.



	Our authorized capital stock consists of 1,300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value
	$0.01 per share, and 200,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. The rights and privileges of holders of our common stock are subject to any series of preferred stock that we may issue in the future.



	Common Stock



	Holders of common stock are
	entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including the election of directors, and do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that holders of a majority of the outstanding
	shares of common stock will be able to elect all of the directors, and holders of less than a majority of such shares will be unable to elect any director. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding shares of preferred stock,
	holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available for dividend payments. As a holding company, our ability to pay dividends
	is subject to our subsidiaries ability to make distributions to us. Further, the credit agreement governing CommScope, Inc.s senior secured credit facilities, the indenture governing CommScope Holdings 6.625% / 7.375% Senior PIK
	Toggle Notes due 2020, the indenture governing CommScope, Inc.s 5.000% Senior Notes due 2021 and the indenture governing CommScope, Inc.s 5.500% Senior Notes due 2024 impose restrictions on our ability to declare dividends on our common
	stock. The holders of common stock have no preferences or rights of conversion, exchange, pre-emption or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. In the event of any liquidation,
	dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, holders of common stock will be entitled to share ratably in our assets that are remaining after payment or provision for payment of all of our debts and obligations and after liquidation payments to holders
	of outstanding shares of preferred stock, if any.



	Preferred Stock



	The preferred stock, if issued, would have priority over the common stock with respect to dividends and other distributions, including the
	distribution of our assets upon liquidation. Unless required by law or by Nasdaq, our Board of Directors will have the authority without further stockholder authorization to issue from time to time shares of preferred stock in one or more series and
	to fix the terms, limitations, relative rights and preferences and variations of each series. Although we have no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock, the issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase
	such shares, could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock, could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the common stock, and could have the effect of
	delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of us or an unsolicited acquisition proposal.



	Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement



	Pursuant to the amended and restated stockholders agreement, our Board of Directors consists of up to eleven members, with Carlyle
	having the right to designate nine of the board members. Mr. Drendel also has the right to serve as a board member, and shall serve as the non-executive chairman of the Board, for so long as he is employed by us pursuant to his employment
	agreement. In addition, our senior ranking executive officer has the right to serve as a board member, who, for so long as he serves as our chief executive officer, will be Mr. Edwards. All parties to the amended and restated stockholders
	agreement have agreed to vote their shares in favor of such designees. Carlyle is not obligated to designate the entire number of directors to which it is entitled


	 


	10






	Table of Contents



	and any such undesignated positions shall remain vacant until such time as Carlyle exercises its right to designate such additional directors. Currently, Carlyle has designated only eight of the
	nine director positions to which it is entitled under the amended and restated stockholders agreement. The position for the additional Carlyle designee shall remain vacant until such time as Carlyle desires to exercise its right to designate a
	director to fill this vacancy, or, if it loses its right to designate any directors pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated stockholders agreement, these positions will be filled by our stockholders in accordance with our certificate of
	incorporation and bylaws. See Description of Capital Stock for more information regarding our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws.


	The amended and restated stockholders agreement will terminate upon the written agreement of CommScope Holdings and Carlyle.



	Registration Rights Agreement



	Pursuant
	to a registration rights agreement that we entered into on January 14, 2011 in connection with Carlyles acquisition of our business, Carlyle has the right to cause CommScope Holdings, in certain instances, at its own expense, to file
	registration statements under the Securities Act covering resales of our common stock held by Carlyle. The registration rights agreement also provides Carlyle and certain other stockholders party to that agreement the right to piggyback on
	registration statements filed by CommScope Holdings in certain circumstances. The registration rights agreement also requires CommScope Holdings to indemnify certain of its stockholders and their affiliates in connection with any registrations of
	our securities.



	Corporate Opportunities



	Delaware law permits corporations to adopt provisions renouncing any interests or expectancy in certain opportunities that are presented to the
	corporation or its officers, directors or stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we, on our behalf and on behalf of our subsidiaries, renounce and waive any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an
	opportunity to participate in, and Carlyle will have no obligation to offer us an opportunity to participate in, business opportunities presented to Carlyle or its affiliates, including its respective officers, representatives, directors, agents,
	stockholders, members, partners, affiliates or subsidiaries even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably have pursued, and that neither Carlyle nor its respective officers, representatives, directors, agents, stockholders, members,
	partners, affiliates or subsidiaries will be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any duty by reason of the fact that such person pursues, acquires or participates in such corporate opportunity, directs such corporate opportunity to
	another person or fails to present such corporate opportunity, or information regarding such corporate opportunity, to us or our subsidiaries unless, in the case of any person who is a director or officer of our company, such business opportunity is
	expressly offered to such director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company. Stockholders will be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision of our amended and restated certificate of
	incorporation.



	Limitations on Directors Liability



	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions indemnifying our directors and
	officers to the fullest extent permitted by law because of the directors or officers positions with us or another entity that the director or officer serves at our request and to advance funds to our directors and officers to enable them
	to defend against such proceedings. We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and certain of our officers which provide them with contractual rights to indemnification and expense advancement which are, in some
	cases, broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained under Delaware law.


	In addition, as permitted by Delaware law, our
	amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that no director will be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a


	 


	11






	Table of Contents



	director. The inclusion of this provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for
	a breach of their fiduciary duties, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited us and our stockholders. The effect of this provision is to restrict our rights and the rights of our stockholders in derivative suits to
	recover monetary damages against a director for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except that a director will be personally liable for:


	 




	 


	


	 


	any breach of his or her duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;




	 




	 


	


	 


	acts or omissions not in good faith which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the payment of dividends or the redemption or purchase of stock in violation of Delaware law; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.




	This provision does not affect
	a directors liability under the federal securities laws.



	Provisions of Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and
	Restated Bylaws and Delaware Law that May Have an Anti-Takeover Effect





	Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and
	Restated Bylaws




	Certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws
	summarized below may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, deter or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider to be in its best interests, including attempts that might result in a premium being
	paid over the market price for the shares held by stockholders.


	Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
	and amended and restated bylaws:


	 




	 


	


	 


	authorize 1,300,000,000 shares of common stock, which, to the extent unissued, will be available for future issuance without additional stockholder approval and, under some circumstances, we could use the additional
	shares to create voting impediments or to frustrate persons seeking to effect a takeover or otherwise gain control by, for example, issuing those shares in private placements to purchasers who might side with our Board of Directors in opposing a
	hostile takeover bid;




	 




	 


	


	 


	authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our Board of Directors could, without further stockholder authorization, issue to increase the number of outstanding shares, issue with super voting, special
	approval, dividend or other rights or preferences and otherwise issue to discourage a takeover attempt;




	 




	 


	


	 


	limit the ability of stockholders to remove directors only for cause if Carlyle and its affiliates collectively cease to own more than 50% of our common stock and require any such removal to be approved by
	holders of at least three-quarters of the outstanding shares of common stock;




	 




	 


	


	 


	prohibit our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders if Carlyle and its affiliates collectively cease to own more than 50% of our common stock;




	 




	 


	


	 


	prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders, if Carlyle and its affiliates collectively cease to own more than 50% of our common
	stock;




	 




	 


	


	 


	provide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, alter or repeal our bylaws;




	 




	 


	


	 


	established advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;




	 




	 


	


	 


	require a stockholders notice proposing to nominate a person for election as director to include specific information about the nominating stockholder and the proposed nominee




	 


	12






	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	require a stockholders notice proposing to nominate a person for election as director to include specific information about the nominating stockholder and the proposed nominee




	 




	 


	


	 


	require a stockholders notice relating to the conduct of business (other than the nomination of directors) to contain specific information about the business and the proposing stockholder




	 




	 


	


	 


	established a classified Board of Directors, with three classes of directors




	 




	 


	


	 


	grant to the Board of Directors the sole power to set the number of directors and to fill any vacancy on the Board; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	require the approval of holders of at least three-quarters of the outstanding shares of common stock to amend the bylaws and certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation if Carlyle and its affiliates
	collectively cease to own more than 50% of our common stock.




	The foregoing provisions of our amended and restated
	certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.
	These provisions are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of the Board of Directors and in the policies formulated by the Board of Directors and to discourage certain types of transactions that may
	involve an actual or threatened change of control. These provisions are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited acquisition proposal and encourage persons seeking to acquire control of our company to first consult with our Board of
	Directors to negotiate the terms of any proposed business combination or offer. The provisions also are intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy fights. However, such provisions could have the effect of discouraging others
	from making tender offers for our shares and, as a consequence, they also may inhibit fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that could result from actual or rumored takeover attempts. Such provisions also may have the effect of
	preventing changes in our management.




	Delaware Takeover Statute




	Subject to certain exceptions, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) prohibits a Delaware corporation
	from engaging in any business combination (as defined below) with any interested stockholder (as defined below) for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:
	(1) prior to such date, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; (2) on consummation of the transaction that
	resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the number
	of shares outstanding those shares owned (x) by persons who are directors and also officers and (y) by employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the
	plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or (3) on or subsequent to such date, the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written
	consent, by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.


	In
	our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, as permitted under and pursuant to subsection (b)(3) of Section 203. Section 203 of the DGCL defines business
	combination to include: (1) any merger or consolidation involving the corporation and the interested stockholder; (2) any sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition of 10% or more of the assets of the corporation involving the
	interested stockholder; (3) subject to certain exceptions, any transaction that results in the issuance or transfer by the corporation of any stock of the corporation to the interested stockholder; (4) any transaction involving the
	corporation that has the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the stock of any class or series of the corporation beneficially owned by the interested stockholder; or (5) the receipt by the interested stockholder of the benefit of
	any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial benefits


	 


	13






	Table of Contents



	provided by or through the corporation. In general, Section 203 defines an interested stockholder as any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of the outstanding
	voting stock of the corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person.



	Choice of Forum



	Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no
	state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action
	asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the DGCL, the amended and restated certificate of
	incorporation and the amended and restated by laws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers or other employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. It is possible that a court could rule
	that this provision is not applicable or is unenforceable. We may consent in writing to alternative forums. Stockholders will be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.



	Listing



	Our common stock is listed on
	Nasdaq under the symbol COMM.

	this prospectus to third parties in privately negotiated transactions. In connection with such a transaction, the third parties may sell securities covered by and pursuant to this prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement or pricing
	supplement, as the case may be. If so, the third party may use securities borrowed from the selling stockholders or others to settle such sales and may use securities received from the selling stockholders to close out any related short positions.

	General



	Any public offering price and any discounts, commissions, concessions or other items constituting compensation allowed or reallowed or paid to
	underwriters, dealers, agents or remarketing firms may be changed from time to time. Any selling stockholders, underwriters, dealers, agents and remarketing firms that participate in the distribution of the offered securities may be
	underwriters as defined in the Securities Act. Any discounts or commissions they receive from the selling stockholders and any profits they receive on the resale of the offered securities may be treated as underwriting discounts and
	commissions under the Securities Act. The selling stockholders will identify any underwriters, agents or dealers and describe their commissions, fees or discounts in the applicable prospectus supplement or pricing supplement, as the case may be.


	The selling stockholders and other persons participating in the sale or distribution of the securities will be subject to applicable
	provisions of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Regulation M. This regulation may limit the timing of purchases and sales of any of the securities by the selling stockholders or any other person. The
	anti-manipulation rules under the Exchange Act may apply to sales of securities in the market and to the activities of the selling stockholders and any affiliates of the selling stockholders. Furthermore, Regulation M may restrict the ability of any
	person engaged in the distribution for a


	 


	16






	Table of Contents



	period of up to five business days before the distribution. These restrictions may affect the marketability of the securities and the ability of any person or entity to engage in market-making
	activities with respect to the securities.


	The selling stockholders are not restricted as to the price or prices at which they may sell
	the securities. Sales of such securities may have an adverse effect on the market price of the securities.


	Moreover, it is possible that
	a significant number of shares of common stock could be sold at the same time, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of the securities.


	We cannot assure you that the selling stockholders will sell all or any portion of the securities offered hereby.



	Underwriters and Agents



	If underwriters
	are used in a sale, they will acquire the offered securities for their own account. The underwriters may resell the offered securities in one or more transactions, including negotiated transactions. These sales may be made at a fixed public offering
	price or prices, which may be changed, at market prices prevailing at the time of the sale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. The selling stockholders may offer the securities to the public through an
	underwriting syndicate or through a single underwriter. The underwriters in any particular offering will be mentioned in the applicable prospectus supplement or pricing supplement, as the case may be.


	Unless otherwise specified in connection with any particular offering of securities, the obligations of the underwriters to purchase the
	offered securities will be subject to certain conditions contained in an underwriting agreement that we and the applicable selling stockholders will enter into with the underwriters at the time of the sale to them. The underwriters will be obligated
	to purchase all of the securities of the series offered if any of the securities are purchased, unless otherwise specified in connection with any particular offering of securities. Any initial offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed,
	reallowed or paid to dealers may be changed from time to time.


	The selling stockholders may designate agents to sell the offered
	securities. Unless otherwise specified in connection with any particular offering of securities, the agents will agree to use their best efforts to solicit purchases for the period of their appointment. The selling stockholders may also sell the
	offered securities to one or more remarketing firms, acting as principals for their own accounts or as agents for us or any selling stockholders. These firms will remarket the offered securities upon purchasing them in accordance with a redemption
	or repayment pursuant to the terms of the offered securities. A prospectus supplement or pricing supplement, as the case may be will identify any remarketing firm and will describe the terms of its agreement, if any, with the selling stockholders
	and its compensation.


	In connection with offerings made through underwriters or agents, the selling stockholders may enter into
	agreements with such underwriters or agents pursuant to which the selling stockholders receive outstanding securities in consideration for the securities being offered to the public for cash. In connection with these arrangements, the underwriters
	or agents may also sell securities covered by this prospectus to hedge their positions in these outstanding securities, including in short sale transactions. If so, the underwriters or agents may use the securities received from the selling
	stockholders under these arrangements to close out any related open borrowings of securities.



	Dealers



	The selling stockholders may sell the offered securities to dealers as principals. The selling stockholders may negotiate and pay dealers
	commissions, discounts or concessions for their services. The dealer may then

	Table of Contents



	resell such securities to the public either at varying prices to be determined by the dealer or at a fixed offering price agreed to with the selling stockholders at the time of resale. Dealers
	engaged by the selling stockholders may allow other dealers to participate in resales.



	Direct Sales



	The selling stockholders may choose to sell the offered securities directly. In this case, no underwriters or agents would be involved.



	Institutional Purchasers



	The selling
	stockholders may authorize agents, dealers or underwriters to solicit certain institutional investors to purchase offered securities on a delayed delivery basis pursuant to delayed delivery contracts providing for payment and delivery on a specified
	future date. The applicable prospectus supplement or pricing supplement, as the case may be will provide the details of any such arrangement, including the offering price and commissions payable on the solicitations.


	The selling stockholders will enter into such delayed contracts only with institutional purchasers that the selling stockholders approve.
	These institutions may include commercial and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies and educational and charitable institutions.



	Indemnification; Other Relationships



	We
	and the selling stockholders may have agreements with agents, underwriters, dealers and remarketing firms to indemnify them against certain civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Agents, underwriters, dealers and
	remarketing firms, and their affiliates, may engage in transactions with, or perform services for, the selling stockholders in the ordinary course of business. This includes commercial banking and investment banking transactions.


	We may agree to indemnify in certain circumstances the selling stockholders against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
	Securities Act. The selling stockholders may agree to indemnify us in certain circumstances against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.



	Market-Making, Stabilization and Other Transactions



	In connection with any offering of common stock, the underwriters may purchase and sell shares of common stock in the open market. These
	transactions may include short sales, syndicate covering transactions and stabilizing transactions. Short sales involve syndicate sales of common stock in excess of the number of shares to be purchased by the underwriters in the offering, which
	creates a syndicate short position. Covered short sales are sales of shares made in an amount up to the number of shares represented by the underwriters over-allotment option. In determining the source of shares to close out the
	covered syndicate short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the over-allotment option.
	Transactions to close out the covered syndicate short involve either purchases of the common stock in the open market after the distribution has been completed or the exercise of the over-allotment option. The underwriters may also make
	naked short sales of shares in excess of the overallotment option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares of common stock in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if
	the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of bids for or
	purchases of shares in the open market while the offering is in progress for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the securities.


	 


	18






	Table of Contents



	In connection with any offering, the underwriters may also engage in penalty bids. Penalty bids
	permit the underwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the securities originally sold by the syndicate member are purchased in a syndicate covering transaction to cover syndicate short positions. Stabilizing
	transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the securities to be higher than it would be in the absence of the transactions. The underwriters may, if they commence these transactions, discontinue them at any
	time.



	Fees and Commissions



	We will
	pay the expenses, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, associated with the registration and sale of shares to be sold by the selling stockholders. The selling stockholders will pay any underwriting discounts, selling commissions or
	other minor expenses.

History[3][edit]
In 1975, CommScope was a product line of Superior Continental Cable. At 29-years-old, Frank Drendel headed a team charged with selling the failing product line. Frank Drendel and Jearld Leonhardt founded CommScope in August 1976 after raising $5.1 million to purchase the CommScope product line. Two years later, CommScope and Valtech merged under the Valtech name. In 1979, Valtech donated fiber optics line and equipment to link the U.S. House of Representatives to the C-SPAN studios, enabling live broadcasting of U.S. Congressional proceedings for the first time.
Continuing in the 1980s, Valtech sold to M/A-COM, Inc. and CommScope becomes part of the Cable Home Group for M/A-COM. In 1983, CommScope formed the Network Cable division for the local area network, data communications, television-receive only and specialized wire markets. In 1986, M/A-COM, Inc. sells, the Cable Home Group to General Instrument Corporation. CommScope becomes a division of General Instrument. Frank Drendel received an Emmy award in 1986 for his work on anti-pirating VideoCipher technology.
In 1990, CommScope opened a new manufacturing facility in Claremont, North Carolina to answer the increased demand for unshielded twisted pair (copper telephone wiring), television receive-only cables (used for consumer satellite reception) and personal computer cables. 
In 1997, General Instrument split into three independent, publicly traded companies, one of which was CommScope. In July 1997, Frank Drendel rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange to announce CommScope going public.
In 2000, CommScope opens its new global headquarters in Hickory, North Carolina. In 2004, CommScope acquires Avaya's Connectivity Solutions business and inherits the SYSTIMAX brand, a globally recognized world leader in enterprise cabling systems. Avaya’s Carrier Solutions – which offered products designed for switching and transmission applications in telephone central offices and secure environmental enclosures—also becomes a part of CommScope. This acquisition doubled the size of CommScope. In 2007, CommScope made another major transaction, acquiring global wireless infrastructure provider Andrew Corporation. Through its new Andrew brand, CommScope becomes a global leader in radio frequency subsystem solutions for wireless networks and again doubled CommScope’s. In 2011, the Carlyle Group, a global alternative asset manager, acquired CommScope. This acquisition makes CommScope privately owned by the Carlyle Group and removed from the New York Stock Exchange. This acquisition also changed the executive structure at CommScope. Eddie Edwards was appointed president and chief executive officer, succeeding Frank Drendel, who served as CommScope’s CEO since the company’s founding in 1976. Drendel continued as the chairman of the board. 
In October 25, 2015, CommScope celebrated its initial public offering as the NASDAQ. In 2015, CommScope acquires TE Connectivity’s Broadband Network Solutions (BNS) division. It positioned CommScope as a leading communications infrastructure provider with deeper resources to meet the world’s growing demand for network bandwidth. The acquisition strengthened CommScope to serve customers in four major areas: indoor and outdoor wireless networks; data centers and central offices; connected and efficient buildings; and access and backhaul networks.
Also in 2015, CommScope acquired Airvana, a privately held leader in small cell solutions for wireless networks. The acquisition expanded CommScope’s leadership and capabilities in providing indoor wireless capacity and coverage, an increasingly important market opportunity that is growing due to consumers and businesses’ insatiable demand for wireless data.  
In November 2016, the Carlyle Group announced the sale of its remaining stock.
In the News[edit]
On October 25, 2010, The Carlyle Group announced it would pay $31.50 a share, or about $2.98 billion, to take CommScope private.[4]
In July 2011, CommScope received the 2010 Communications Solutions Product of the Year Award from Technology Marketing Corporation for its product, Wired For Wireless.[5]
On August 2, 2013, CommScope filed with the SEC to raise up to $750 million in an initial public offering. The initial public offering and first public trading took place on October 25, 2013 at NASDAQ.[6]
On May 16, 2017, CommScope introduced a High Speed Migration platform. [7]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2004 the company acquired Avaya's Connectivity Solutions business. The Avaya business acquisition included the legacy intellectual property and patents from Western Electric, AT&T, Lucent Technologies and Avaya.
In June 2007, CommScope acquired Andrew Corporation for $2.6 billion. Andrew's products included antennas, cables, amplifiers, repeaters, transceivers, as well as software and training for the broadband and cellular industries.[8]
In January 2015, CommScope agreed to purchase a unit of TE Connectivity for $3 billion. The transaction closed August 28, 2015.[9]
In October 2015, CommScope acquired Airvana,[10] a manufacturer of small cells and femtocells.

History[3][edit]
In 1975, CommScope was a product line of Superior Continental Cable. At 29-years-old, Frank Drendel headed a team charged with selling the failing product line. Frank Drendel and Jearld Leonhardt founded CommScope in August 1976 after raising $5.1 million to purchase the CommScope product line. Two years later, CommScope and Valtech merged under the Valtech name. In 1979, Valtech donated fiber optics line and equipment to link the U.S. House of Representatives to the C-SPAN studios, enabling live broadcasting of U.S. Congressional proceedings for the first time.
Continuing in the 1980s, Valtech sold to M/A-COM, Inc. and CommScope becomes part of the Cable Home Group for M/A-COM. In 1983, CommScope formed the Network Cable division for the local area network, data communications, television-receive only and specialized wire markets. In 1986, M/A-COM, Inc. sells, the Cable Home Group to General Instrument Corporation. CommScope becomes a division of General Instrument. Frank Drendel received an Emmy award in 1986 for his work on anti-pirating VideoCipher technology.
In 1990, CommScope opened a new manufacturing facility in Claremont, North Carolina to answer the increased demand for unshielded twisted pair (copper telephone wiring), television receive-only cables (used for consumer satellite reception) and personal computer cables. 
In 1997, General Instrument split into three independent, publicly traded companies, one of which was CommScope. In July 1997, Frank Drendel rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange to announce CommScope going public.
In 2000, CommScope opens its new global headquarters in Hickory, North Carolina. In 2004, CommScope acquires Avaya's Connectivity Solutions business and inherits the SYSTIMAX brand, a globally recognized world leader in enterprise cabling systems. Avaya’s Carrier Solutions – which offered products designed for switching and transmission applications in telephone central offices and secure environmental enclosures—also becomes a part of CommScope. This acquisition doubled the size of CommScope. In 2007, CommScope made another major transaction, acquiring global wireless infrastructure provider Andrew Corporation. Through its new Andrew brand, CommScope becomes a global leader in radio frequency subsystem solutions for wireless networks and again doubled CommScope’s. In 2011, the Carlyle Group, a global alternative asset manager, acquired CommScope. This acquisition makes CommScope privately owned by the Carlyle Group and removed from the New York Stock Exchange. This acquisition also changed the executive structure at CommScope. Eddie Edwards was appointed president and chief executive officer, succeeding Frank Drendel, who served as CommScope’s CEO since the company’s founding in 1976. Drendel continued as the chairman of the board. 
In October 25, 2015, CommScope celebrated its initial public offering as the NASDAQ. In 2015, CommScope acquires TE Connectivity’s Broadband Network Solutions (BNS) division. It positioned CommScope as a leading communications infrastructure provider with deeper resources to meet the world’s growing demand for network bandwidth. The acquisition strengthened CommScope to serve customers in four major areas: indoor and outdoor wireless networks; data centers and central offices; connected and efficient buildings; and access and backhaul networks.
Also in 2015, CommScope acquired Airvana, a privately held leader in small cell solutions for wireless networks. The acquisition expanded CommScope’s leadership and capabilities in providing indoor wireless capacity and coverage, an increasingly important market opportunity that is growing due to consumers and businesses’ insatiable demand for wireless data.  
In November 2016, the Carlyle Group announced the sale of its remaining stock.
In the News[edit]
On October 25, 2010, The Carlyle Group announced it would pay $31.50 a share, or about $2.98 billion, to take CommScope private.[4]
In July 2011, CommScope received the 2010 Communications Solutions Product of the Year Award from Technology Marketing Corporation for its product, Wired For Wireless.[5]
On August 2, 2013, CommScope filed with the SEC to raise up to $750 million in an initial public offering. The initial public offering and first public trading took place on October 25, 2013 at NASDAQ.[6]
On May 16, 2017, CommScope introduced a High Speed Migration platform. [7]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2004 the company acquired Avaya's Connectivity Solutions business. The Avaya business acquisition included the legacy intellectual property and patents from Western Electric, AT&T, Lucent Technologies and Avaya.
In June 2007, CommScope acquired Andrew Corporation for $2.6 billion. Andrew's products included antennas, cables, amplifiers, repeaters, transceivers, as well as software and training for the broadband and cellular industries.[8]
In January 2015, CommScope agreed to purchase a unit of TE Connectivity for $3 billion. The transaction closed August 28, 2015.[9]
In October 2015, CommScope acquired Airvana,[10] a manufacturer of small cells and femtocells.

History[3][edit]
In 1975, CommScope was a product line of Superior Continental Cable. At 29-years-old, Frank Drendel headed a team charged with selling the failing product line. Frank Drendel and Jearld Leonhardt founded CommScope in August 1976 after raising $5.1 million to purchase the CommScope product line. Two years later, CommScope and Valtech merged under the Valtech name. In 1979, Valtech donated fiber optics line and equipment to link the U.S. House of Representatives to the C-SPAN studios, enabling live broadcasting of U.S. Congressional proceedings for the first time.
Continuing in the 1980s, Valtech sold to M/A-COM, Inc. and CommScope becomes part of the Cable Home Group for M/A-COM. In 1983, CommScope formed the Network Cable division for the local area network, data communications, television-receive only and specialized wire markets. In 1986, M/A-COM, Inc. sells, the Cable Home Group to General Instrument Corporation. CommScope becomes a division of General Instrument. Frank Drendel received an Emmy award in 1986 for his work on anti-pirating VideoCipher technology.
In 1990, CommScope opened a new manufacturing facility in Claremont, North Carolina to answer the increased demand for unshielded twisted pair (copper telephone wiring), television receive-only cables (used for consumer satellite reception) and personal computer cables. 
In 1997, General Instrument split into three independent, publicly traded companies, one of which was CommScope. In July 1997, Frank Drendel rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange to announce CommScope going public.
In 2000, CommScope opens its new global headquarters in Hickory, North Carolina. In 2004, CommScope acquires Avaya's Connectivity Solutions business and inherits the SYSTIMAX brand, a globally recognized world leader in enterprise cabling systems. Avaya’s Carrier Solutions – which offered products designed for switching and transmission applications in telephone central offices and secure environmental enclosures—also becomes a part of CommScope. This acquisition doubled the size of CommScope. In 2007, CommScope made another major transaction, acquiring global wireless infrastructure provider Andrew Corporation. Through its new Andrew brand, CommScope becomes a global leader in radio frequency subsystem solutions for wireless networks and again doubled CommScope’s. In 2011, the Carlyle Group, a global alternative asset manager, acquired CommScope. This acquisition makes CommScope privately owned by the Carlyle Group and removed from the New York Stock Exchange. This acquisition also changed the executive structure at CommScope. Eddie Edwards was appointed president and chief executive officer, succeeding Frank Drendel, who served as CommScope’s CEO since the company’s founding in 1976. Drendel continued as the chairman of the board. 
In October 25, 2015, CommScope celebrated its initial public offering as the NASDAQ. In 2015, CommScope acquires TE Connectivity’s Broadband Network Solutions (BNS) division. It positioned CommScope as a leading communications infrastructure provider with deeper resources to meet the world’s growing demand for network bandwidth. The acquisition strengthened CommScope to serve customers in four major areas: indoor and outdoor wireless networks; data centers and central offices; connected and efficient buildings; and access and backhaul networks.
Also in 2015, CommScope acquired Airvana, a privately held leader in small cell solutions for wireless networks. The acquisition expanded CommScope’s leadership and capabilities in providing indoor wireless capacity and coverage, an increasingly important market opportunity that is growing due to consumers and businesses’ insatiable demand for wireless data.  
In November 2016, the Carlyle Group announced the sale of its remaining stock.
In the News[edit]
On October 25, 2010, The Carlyle Group announced it would pay $31.50 a share, or about $2.98 billion, to take CommScope private.[4]
In July 2011, CommScope received the 2010 Communications Solutions Product of the Year Award from Technology Marketing Corporation for its product, Wired For Wireless.[5]
On August 2, 2013, CommScope filed with the SEC to raise up to $750 million in an initial public offering. The initial public offering and first public trading took place on October 25, 2013 at NASDAQ.[6]
On May 16, 2017, CommScope introduced a High Speed Migration platform. [7]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 2004 the company acquired Avaya's Connectivity Solutions business. The Avaya business acquisition included the legacy intellectual property and patents from Western Electric, AT&T, Lucent Technologies and Avaya.
In June 2007, CommScope acquired Andrew Corporation for $2.6 billion. Andrew's products included antennas, cables, amplifiers, repeaters, transceivers, as well as software and training for the broadband and cellular industries.[8]
In January 2015, CommScope agreed to purchase a unit of TE Connectivity for $3 billion. The transaction closed August 28, 2015.[9]
In October 2015, CommScope acquired Airvana,[10] a manufacturer of small cells and femtocells.
