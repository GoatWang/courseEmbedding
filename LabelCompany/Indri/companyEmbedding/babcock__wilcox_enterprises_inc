Waste to Energyfor a Sustainable, Circular Economy

























New Build
 Each waste-to-energy (WtE) plant has a unique profile and achieving full potential requires a tailor-made business model.  Having supplied more than 500 WtE plants worldwide, B&W can work with you to create the best model built on our proven technology.

Contact Sales 






Aftermarket Support
 Our specialists provide a wide range of services, improvements and upgrades to support useful lifetime of a waste-to-energy, biomass, multi-fuel or fossil fuel-fired plant.

Contact Service 






Environmental Systems 
 Whatever your environmental solution requirements, however complex they may be, our engineers will work to find the right solution.

Learn More 











Did You Know?
 Ecologically Sound, Cost-Effective Energy Recovery
Waste-to-energy, including municipal solid waste and refuse-derive fuel, is a valuable renewable energy source.  

With WtE plants successfully operating worldwide, the technology and environmental benefits are proven:

There are nearly 100 WtE plants in North America,
more than 500 operating in Europe
and 1600 plants in Asia.

How waste-to-energy works 

A waste-to-energy plant converts solid waste into electricity and/or heat - an ecological, cost-effective way of energy recovery.
 
A waste-to-energy - or energy-from-waste - plant converts municipal and industrial solid waste into electricity and/or heat for industrial processing and for district heating systems – an ecologically sound, cost-effective means of energy recovery. The energy plant works by burning waste at high temperatures and using the heat to make steam. The steam then drives a turbine that creates electricity.
 
Waste-to-energy is a way to recover valuable resources
 
Waste-to-energy isn’t just a trash disposal method. It’s a way to recover valuable resources. Waste-to-energy is a vital part of a sustainable waste management chain and is fully complementary to recycling. 

Today, it is possible to reuse 90% of the metals contained in the bottom ash. And the remaining clinker can be reused as road material.
The results and benefits are proven:

Avoids methane emissions from landfills
Offsets greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fossil fuel electrical production
Recovers/recycles valuable resources, such as metals
Produces clean, reliable base-loaded energy and steam
Uses less land per megawatt than other renewable energy sources
Sustainable and steady renewable fuel source (compared to wind and solar)
Destroys chemical waste / conventional HAPs
Results in emission levels well below permitted levels
Catalytically destroys NOx, dioxins and furans

TECHNOLOGIES




Waste-to-Energy Steam Generation
Mass Burn or Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF)
B&W provides two boiler options when using waste as a combustion fuel. The first, known as mass burning of municipal solid waste, uses the refuse in its as-received, unprepared state. The second technique uses prepared refuse, or refuse-derived fuel (RDF), where the as-received refuse is first separated, classified and reclaimed in various ways to yield salable or otherwise recyclable products. The remaining material is prepared for firing in the boiler.

Combustion Technologies
B&W Vølund DynaGrate® pivoting combustion grate and Precision Jet® overfire air system – advanced designs provides environmental benefits during combustion:

Destroys dioxins and furans
Minimizes formation of NOx and CO
Minimizes unburned carbon

 












Combustion Grates & Stokers
 In a waste-to-energy plant, the grate is where waste is converted into energy – the heart of the system. As such, grates are a significant focus area for us. Over the past 80 years we have supplied more than 500 combustion grates worldwide. Many of our older grates are still in operation, running efficiently and living up to current environmental standards. 

Learn More 






Waste Fuel Feeder Systems
 Steady and continuous feeding of fuel in waste-to-energy plants is the key to stable operation, maximum efficiency, and lower operational and maintenance costs.  

Learn More 






Water-Cooled Wear Zones
 Water-cooled wear zones are a revolutionary, efficient, and economical way to improve operational accessibility and productivity for waste-fired power plants.
Experiences from the 15 plants where we have installed water-cooled wear zones show that the total annual energy production has increased significantly –  in many cases by as much as 25-30%. One plant is now handling 40% more waste after a conversion that includes the new wear zone technology.

Learn More 



















Energy Recovery
 B&W Vølund’s highly efficient waste-to-energy plants obtain a total recovery of 99%. In existing plants our flue gas condensation can increase energy recovery by 20-25%. Improved revenue, reduced greenhouse emissions, and a more positive image are three of the benefits that come from extended energy recovery by condensation of the hot flue gases.

Learn More 






VoluMix Systems
 Proper, turbulent mixing of the flue gases in the boiler furnace provides a better combustion process and burn-out in the gas phase. With the B&W Vølund VoluMix™ system, all of the primary air passes through the narrow gap between the grate bars, creating a strong, turbulent combustion zone.

Learn More 






Emissions Control
 As a single-source supplier, we can develop an integrated multi-pollutant strategy to match your long-term requirements.  Through every phase of the project, we take the time to determine your needs and recommend a customized solution.

The company was founded in 1867 in Providence, Rhode Island by partners Stephen Wilcox and George Babcock to manufacture and market Wilcox’s patented water-tube boiler.[2] B&W's list of innovations and firsts include the world’s first installed utility boiler (1881); manufacture of boilers to power New York City’s first subway (1902); first pulverized coal power plant (1918); design and manufacture of components for USS Nautilus, the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine (1953–55); the first supercritical pressure coal-fired boiler (1957); design and supply of reactors for the first U.S. built nuclear-powered surface ship, NS Savannah (1961).[3]
The company provided design, engineering, manufacturing, construction and facilities management services to nuclear, renewable, fossil power, industrial and government customers worldwide. B&W's boilers supply more than 300,000 megawatts of installed capacity in over 90 countries around the world. A reactor from B&W was destroyed by a nuclear meltdown in the Three Mile Island accident. During World War II, over half of the US Navy fleet was powered by Babcock & Wilcox boilers.
The company has its headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. It has major operations in Lynchburg, Virginia; Barberton, Ohio; Euclid, Ohio; Lancaster, Ohio; West Point, Mississippi; Mount Vernon, Indiana; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Erwin, Tennessee; Amarillo, Texas; Cambridge, Ontario; the Danish city of Esbjerg; and the German city of Straubing. B&W also has joint major joint venture companies in Beijing and the Indian city of Pune.[4]
On June 30, 2015, Babcock & Wilcox completed a spinoff from BWX Technologies, its former parent which is now headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia. The two companies began trading separately on July 1.[5]
B&W employs approximately 5,700 people, in addition to several thousand joint venture employees.[4]
Power Generation Group[edit]




The Babcock & Wilcox nuclear steam generator is seen at the company's plant at Barberton, Ohio prior to shipment via the Penn Central Railroad to a Duke Energy site in Oconee, S.C. This generator can convert more than 10 million pounds of water per hour into steam.


B&W Power Generation Group, Inc. (B&W PGG) is based in Barberton, Ohio and provides engineering, design, construction and manufacturing services to the fossil and renewable power generation sectors and to heavy industry worldwide. B&W PGG and its subsidiaries have facilities in Ohio; Wisconsin; Arona, Italy; Beijing, China; Esbjerg, Denmark; and technology licensees around the world.[6]

1913 Babcock & Wilcox boiler section



In 1867, Providence, Rhode Island, residents Stephen Wilcox and his partner George Herman Babcock patented the Babcock & Wilcox Non-Explosive Boiler, which used water filled tubes and de-nucleate boiling to generate steam more safely than either under-fire or fire-tube boilers. The boilers more safely generated higher pressure steam and was more efficient (as an energy to steam converter) than existing designs.[7]
In 1891, Babcock & Wilcox Ltd is established as a separate United Kingdom company, to be responsible for all sales outside the US and Cuba.[8]
In 1898, Robert Jurenka and Alois Seidl signed an agreement with the British Babcock & Wilcox Ltd to make the Berlin, Germany Babcock sales office into a subsidiary of the British company; a factory in Oberhausen in the Ruhr district made the boiler designed by the American engineers.[9]
In 1902 the New York City's first subway is powered by B&W boilers.[10]
During 1907 and 1909 Theodore Roosevelt's Great White Fleet were powered by B&W Boilers.
In 1929 B&W installs the world's first commercial size recovery boiler using the magnesium bisulfite process in Quebec, Canada.[11]
Between 1941 and 1945 B&W designed and delivered 4,100 marine boilers for combat and merchant ships, including 95 percent of the US fleet in Tokyo Bay at Japanese surrender.
In 1942, the company developed the cyclone furnace.
Between 1943 and 1945 B&W provided components, materials and process development for Manhattan Project.[7]
Between 1949 and 1952 B&W provided the 8 boilers for the SS United States, the fastest ocean liner ever constructed.
Between 1953 and 1955 B&W designed and fabricated components for USS Nautilus (SSN-571), world’s first nuclear-powered submarine.
In 1961 B&W designed and supplied reactors for world’s first commercial nuclear ship NS Savannah.
In 1962 B&W designed and furnished reactor systems for B&W's first commercial reactor, Indian Point, using HEU 233.
In 1975 B&W designed and built components for liquid metal fast breeder reactors.
In 1975 the long term business agreements with the British Babcock & Wilcox Ltd were ended. Subsequently, the British company was renamed Babcock International Group plc.
In 1978 B&W designed and built the nuclear reactor that was involved in the Three Mile Island accident.
In 1999 B&W was awarded the contract to develop fuel cells and steam reforming for US Navy.
On February 22, 2000, B&W filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in part as a result of thousands of claims for personal injury due to prolonged exposure to asbestos and asbestos fibers. Claims included asbestosis, lung cancer, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma. As a condition of emerging from bankruptcy, B&W created a trust fund to compensate victims, but for amounts far less than settlements paid in individual personal injury lawsuits.[12]
After B&W emerged from bankruptcy in 2006, B&W and BWX Technologies, both subsidiaries of the McDermott International, Inc., merged on 26 November 2007 to form The Babcock & Wilcox Companies, headed by President John Fees. The old company logo was changed.
On June 10, 2009, B&W unveiled B&W Modular Nuclear Energy, LLC (B&W MNE).[13] On the same day, B&W MNE announced its plans to design and develop the B&W mPower reactor, a modular, scalable nuclear reactor. The B&W mPower reactor design is a 125 megawatt, passively safe Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) (a Generation III reactor) with a below-ground containment structure.[14] The reactor is set to be manufactured in a factory, shipped by rail, then buried underground.[15][16]
On May 12, 2010, B&W announced that it and its subsidiaries would be spun off from its parent company, McDermott International, Inc.[17] The headquarters moved from Lynchburg, Virginia to Charlotte.[18] and the company became The Babcock & Wilcox Company.
On August 2, 2010, B&W began trading on the New York Stock Exchange as BWC.[19]
On July 1, 2015, Babcock & Wilcox and BWX Technologies, its former parent headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia, began trading separately.[5]

Between 1941 and 1945 B&W designed and delivered 4,100 marine boilers for combat and merchant ships, including 95 percent of the US fleet in Tokyo Bay at Japanese surrender.
In 1942, the company developed the cyclone furnace.
Between 1943 and 1945 B&W provided components, materials and process development for Manhattan Project.[7]
Between 1949 and 1952 B&W provided the 8 boilers for the SS United States, the fastest ocean liner ever constructed.
Between 1953 and 1955 B&W designed and fabricated components for USS Nautilus (SSN-571), world’s first nuclear-powered submarine.
In 1961 B&W designed and supplied reactors for world’s first commercial nuclear ship NS Savannah.
In 1962 B&W designed and furnished reactor systems for B&W's first commercial reactor, Indian Point, using HEU 233.
In 1975 B&W designed and built components for liquid metal fast breeder reactors.
In 1975 the long term business agreements with the British Babcock & Wilcox Ltd were ended. Subsequently, the British company was renamed Babcock International Group plc.
In 1978 B&W designed and built the nuclear reactor that was involved in the Three Mile Island accident.
In 1999 B&W was awarded the contract to develop fuel cells and steam reforming for US Navy.
On February 22, 2000, B&W filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in part as a result of thousands of claims for personal injury due to prolonged exposure to asbestos and asbestos fibers. Claims included asbestosis, lung cancer, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma. As a condition of emerging from bankruptcy, B&W created a trust fund to compensate victims, but for amounts far less than settlements paid in individual personal injury lawsuits.[12]
After B&W emerged from bankruptcy in 2006, B&W and BWX Technologies, both subsidiaries of the McDermott International, Inc., merged on 26 November 2007 to form The Babcock & Wilcox Companies, headed by President John Fees. The old company logo was changed.
On June 10, 2009, B&W unveiled B&W Modular Nuclear Energy, LLC (B&W MNE).[13] On the same day, B&W MNE announced its plans to design and develop the B&W mPower reactor, a modular, scalable nuclear reactor. The B&W mPower reactor design is a 125 megawatt, passively safe Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) (a Generation III reactor) with a below-ground containment structure.[14] The reactor is set to be manufactured in a factory, shipped by rail, then buried underground.[15][16]
On May 12, 2010, B&W announced that it and its subsidiaries would be spun off from its parent company, McDermott International, Inc.[17] The headquarters moved from Lynchburg, Virginia to Charlotte.[18] and the company became The Babcock & Wilcox Company.
On August 2, 2010, B&W began trading on the New York Stock Exchange as BWC.[19]
On July 1, 2015, Babcock & Wilcox and BWX Technologies, its former parent headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia, began trading separately.[5]

Background[edit]
The company was founded in 1867 in Providence, Rhode Island by partners Stephen Wilcox and George Babcock to manufacture and market Wilcox’s patented water-tube boiler.[2] B&W's list of innovations and firsts include the world’s first installed utility boiler (1881); manufacture of boilers to power New York City’s first subway (1902); first pulverized coal power plant (1918); design and manufacture of components for USS Nautilus, the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine (1953–55); the first supercritical pressure coal-fired boiler (1957); design and supply of reactors for the first U.S. built nuclear-powered surface ship, NS Savannah (1961).[3]
The company provided design, engineering, manufacturing, construction and facilities management services to nuclear, renewable, fossil power, industrial and government customers worldwide. B&W's boilers supply more than 300,000 megawatts of installed capacity in over 90 countries around the world. A reactor from B&W was destroyed by a nuclear meltdown in the Three Mile Island accident. During World War II, over half of the US Navy fleet was powered by Babcock & Wilcox boilers.
The company has its headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. It has major operations in Lynchburg, Virginia; Barberton, Ohio; Euclid, Ohio; Lancaster, Ohio; West Point, Mississippi; Mount Vernon, Indiana; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Erwin, Tennessee; Amarillo, Texas; Cambridge, Ontario; the Danish city of Esbjerg; and the German city of Straubing. B&W also has joint major joint venture companies in Beijing and the Indian city of Pune.[4]
On June 30, 2015, Babcock & Wilcox completed a spinoff from BWX Technologies, its former parent which is now headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia. The two companies began trading separately on July 1.[5]
B&W employs approximately 5,700 people, in addition to several thousand joint venture employees.[4]
Power Generation Group[edit]




The Babcock & Wilcox nuclear steam generator is seen at the company's plant at Barberton, Ohio prior to shipment via the Penn Central Railroad to a Duke Energy site in Oconee, S.C. This generator can convert more than 10 million pounds of water per hour into steam.


B&W Power Generation Group, Inc. (B&W PGG) is based in Barberton, Ohio and provides engineering, design, construction and manufacturing services to the fossil and renewable power generation sectors and to heavy industry worldwide. B&W PGG and its subsidiaries have facilities in Ohio; Wisconsin; Arona, Italy; Beijing, China; Esbjerg, Denmark; and technology licensees around the world.[6]

1913 Babcock & Wilcox boiler section



In 1867, Providence, Rhode Island, residents Stephen Wilcox and his partner George Herman Babcock patented the Babcock & Wilcox Non-Explosive Boiler, which used water filled tubes and de-nucleate boiling to generate steam more safely than either under-fire or fire-tube boilers. The boilers more safely generated higher pressure steam and was more efficient (as an energy to steam converter) than existing designs.[7]
In 1891, Babcock & Wilcox Ltd is established as a separate United Kingdom company, to be responsible for all sales outside the US and Cuba.[8]
In 1898, Robert Jurenka and Alois Seidl signed an agreement with the British Babcock & Wilcox Ltd to make the Berlin, Germany Babcock sales office into a subsidiary of the British company; a factory in Oberhausen in the Ruhr district made the boiler designed by the American engineers.[9]
In 1902 the New York City's first subway is powered by B&W boilers.[10]
During 1907 and 1909 Theodore Roosevelt's Great White Fleet were powered by B&W Boilers.

Background[edit]
The company was founded in 1867 in Providence, Rhode Island by partners Stephen Wilcox and George Babcock to manufacture and market Wilcox’s patented water-tube boiler.[2] B&W's list of innovations and firsts include the world’s first installed utility boiler (1881); manufacture of boilers to power New York City’s first subway (1902); first pulverized coal power plant (1918); design and manufacture of components for USS Nautilus, the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine (1953–55); the first supercritical pressure coal-fired boiler (1957); design and supply of reactors for the first U.S. built nuclear-powered surface ship, NS Savannah (1961).[3]
The company provided design, engineering, manufacturing, construction and facilities management services to nuclear, renewable, fossil power, industrial and government customers worldwide. B&W's boilers supply more than 300,000 megawatts of installed capacity in over 90 countries around the world. A reactor from B&W was destroyed by a nuclear meltdown in the Three Mile Island accident. During World War II, over half of the US Navy fleet was powered by Babcock & Wilcox boilers.
The company has its headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. It has major operations in Lynchburg, Virginia; Barberton, Ohio; Euclid, Ohio; Lancaster, Ohio; West Point, Mississippi; Mount Vernon, Indiana; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Erwin, Tennessee; Amarillo, Texas; Cambridge, Ontario; the Danish city of Esbjerg; and the German city of Straubing. B&W also has joint major joint venture companies in Beijing and the Indian city of Pune.[4]
On June 30, 2015, Babcock & Wilcox completed a spinoff from BWX Technologies, its former parent which is now headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia. The two companies began trading separately on July 1.[5]
B&W employs approximately 5,700 people, in addition to several thousand joint venture employees.[4]
Power Generation Group[edit]




The Babcock & Wilcox nuclear steam generator is seen at the company's plant at Barberton, Ohio prior to shipment via the Penn Central Railroad to a Duke Energy site in Oconee, S.C. This generator can convert more than 10 million pounds of water per hour into steam.


B&W Power Generation Group, Inc. (B&W PGG) is based in Barberton, Ohio and provides engineering, design, construction and manufacturing services to the fossil and renewable power generation sectors and to heavy industry worldwide. B&W PGG and its subsidiaries have facilities in Ohio; Wisconsin; Arona, Italy; Beijing, China; Esbjerg, Denmark; and technology licensees around the world.[6]

History[edit]

1913 Babcock & Wilcox boiler section



In 1867, Providence, Rhode Island, residents Stephen Wilcox and his partner George Herman Babcock patented the Babcock & Wilcox Non-Explosive Boiler, which used water filled tubes and de-nucleate boiling to generate steam more safely than either under-fire or fire-tube boilers. The boilers more safely generated higher pressure steam and was more efficient (as an energy to steam converter) than existing designs.[7]
In 1891, Babcock & Wilcox Ltd is established as a separate United Kingdom company, to be responsible for all sales outside the US and Cuba.[8]
In 1898, Robert Jurenka and Alois Seidl signed an agreement with the British Babcock & Wilcox Ltd to make the Berlin, Germany Babcock sales office into a subsidiary of the British company; a factory in Oberhausen in the Ruhr district made the boiler designed by the American engineers.[9]
In 1902 the New York City's first subway is powered by B&W boilers.[10]
During 1907 and 1909 Theodore Roosevelt's Great White Fleet were powered by B&W Boilers.
In 1929 B&W installs the world's first commercial size recovery boiler using the magnesium bisulfite process in Quebec, Canada.[11]
Between 1941 and 1945 B&W designed and delivered 4,100 marine boilers for combat and merchant ships, including 95 percent of the US fleet in Tokyo Bay at Japanese surrender.
In 1942, the company developed the cyclone furnace.
Between 1943 and 1945 B&W provided components, materials and process development for Manhattan Project.[7]
Between 1949 and 1952 B&W provided the 8 boilers for the SS United States, the fastest ocean liner ever constructed.
Between 1953 and 1955 B&W designed and fabricated components for USS Nautilus (SSN-571), world’s first nuclear-powered submarine.
In 1961 B&W designed and supplied reactors for world’s first commercial nuclear ship NS Savannah.
In 1962 B&W designed and furnished reactor systems for B&W's first commercial reactor, Indian Point, using HEU 233.
In 1975 B&W designed and built components for liquid metal fast breeder reactors.
In 1975 the long term business agreements with the British Babcock & Wilcox Ltd were ended. Subsequently, the British company was renamed Babcock International Group plc.
In 1978 B&W designed and built the nuclear reactor that was involved in the Three Mile Island accident.
In 1999 B&W was awarded the contract to develop fuel cells and steam reforming for US Navy.
On February 22, 2000, B&W filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in part as a result of thousands of claims for personal injury due to prolonged exposure to asbestos and asbestos fibers. Claims included asbestosis, lung cancer, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma. As a condition of emerging from bankruptcy, B&W created a trust fund to compensate victims, but for amounts far less than settlements paid in individual personal injury lawsuits.[12]
After B&W emerged from bankruptcy in 2006, B&W and BWX Technologies, both subsidiaries of the McDermott International, Inc., merged on 26 November 2007 to form The Babcock & Wilcox Companies, headed by President John Fees. The old company logo was changed.
On June 10, 2009, B&W unveiled B&W Modular Nuclear Energy, LLC (B&W MNE).[13] On the same day, B&W MNE announced its plans to design and develop the B&W mPower reactor, a modular, scalable nuclear reactor. The B&W mPower reactor design is a 125 megawatt, passively safe Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) (a Generation III reactor) with a below-ground containment structure.[14] The reactor is set to be manufactured in a factory, shipped by rail, then buried underground.[15][16]
On May 12, 2010, B&W announced that it and its subsidiaries would be spun off from its parent company, McDermott International, Inc.[17] The headquarters moved from Lynchburg, Virginia to Charlotte.[18] and the company became The Babcock & Wilcox Company.
On August 2, 2010, B&W began trading on the New York Stock Exchange as BWC.[19]
On July 1, 2015, Babcock & Wilcox and BWX Technologies, its former parent headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia, began trading separately.[5]

Background[edit]
The company was founded in 1867 in Providence, Rhode Island by partners Stephen Wilcox and George Babcock to manufacture and market Wilcox’s patented water-tube boiler.[2] B&W's list of innovations and firsts include the world’s first installed utility boiler (1881); manufacture of boilers to power New York City’s first subway (1902); first pulverized coal power plant (1918); design and manufacture of components for USS Nautilus, the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine (1953–55); the first supercritical pressure coal-fired boiler (1957); design and supply of reactors for the first U.S. built nuclear-powered surface ship, NS Savannah (1961).[3]
The company provided design, engineering, manufacturing, construction and facilities management services to nuclear, renewable, fossil power, industrial and government customers worldwide. B&W's boilers supply more than 300,000 megawatts of installed capacity in over 90 countries around the world. A reactor from B&W was destroyed by a nuclear meltdown in the Three Mile Island accident. During World War II, over half of the US Navy fleet was powered by Babcock & Wilcox boilers.
The company has its headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. It has major operations in Lynchburg, Virginia; Barberton, Ohio; Euclid, Ohio; Lancaster, Ohio; West Point, Mississippi; Mount Vernon, Indiana; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Erwin, Tennessee; Amarillo, Texas; Cambridge, Ontario; the Danish city of Esbjerg; and the German city of Straubing. B&W also has joint major joint venture companies in Beijing and the Indian city of Pune.[4]
On June 30, 2015, Babcock & Wilcox completed a spinoff from BWX Technologies, its former parent which is now headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia. The two companies began trading separately on July 1.[5]
B&W employs approximately 5,700 people, in addition to several thousand joint venture employees.[4]
Power Generation Group[edit]




The Babcock & Wilcox nuclear steam generator is seen at the company's plant at Barberton, Ohio prior to shipment via the Penn Central Railroad to a Duke Energy site in Oconee, S.C. This generator can convert more than 10 million pounds of water per hour into steam.


B&W Power Generation Group, Inc. (B&W PGG) is based in Barberton, Ohio and provides engineering, design, construction and manufacturing services to the fossil and renewable power generation sectors and to heavy industry worldwide. B&W PGG and its subsidiaries have facilities in Ohio; Wisconsin; Arona, Italy; Beijing, China; Esbjerg, Denmark; and technology licensees around the world.[6]

1913 Babcock & Wilcox boiler section



In 1867, Providence, Rhode Island, residents Stephen Wilcox and his partner George Herman Babcock patented the Babcock & Wilcox Non-Explosive Boiler, which used water filled tubes and de-nucleate boiling to generate steam more safely than either under-fire or fire-tube boilers. The boilers more safely generated higher pressure steam and was more efficient (as an energy to steam converter) than existing designs.[7]
In 1891, Babcock & Wilcox Ltd is established as a separate United Kingdom company, to be responsible for all sales outside the US and Cuba.[8]
In 1898, Robert Jurenka and Alois Seidl signed an agreement with the British Babcock & Wilcox Ltd to make the Berlin, Germany Babcock sales office into a subsidiary of the British company; a factory in Oberhausen in the Ruhr district made the boiler designed by the American engineers.[9]
In 1902 the New York City's first subway is powered by B&W boilers.[10]
During 1907 and 1909 Theodore Roosevelt's Great White Fleet were powered by B&W Boilers.
In 1929 B&W installs the world's first commercial size recovery boiler using the magnesium bisulfite process in Quebec, Canada.[11]
Between 1941 and 1945 B&W designed and delivered 4,100 marine boilers for combat and merchant ships, including 95 percent of the US fleet in Tokyo Bay at Japanese surrender.
In 1942, the company developed the cyclone furnace.
Between 1943 and 1945 B&W provided components, materials and process development for Manhattan Project.[7]
Between 1949 and 1952 B&W provided the 8 boilers for the SS United States, the fastest ocean liner ever constructed.
Between 1953 and 1955 B&W designed and fabricated components for USS Nautilus (SSN-571), world’s first nuclear-powered submarine.
In 1961 B&W designed and supplied reactors for world’s first commercial nuclear ship NS Savannah.
In 1962 B&W designed and furnished reactor systems for B&W's first commercial reactor, Indian Point, using HEU 233.
In 1975 B&W designed and built components for liquid metal fast breeder reactors.
In 1975 the long term business agreements with the British Babcock & Wilcox Ltd were ended. Subsequently, the British company was renamed Babcock International Group plc.
In 1978 B&W designed and built the nuclear reactor that was involved in the Three Mile Island accident.
In 1999 B&W was awarded the contract to develop fuel cells and steam reforming for US Navy.
On February 22, 2000, B&W filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in part as a result of thousands of claims for personal injury due to prolonged exposure to asbestos and asbestos fibers. Claims included asbestosis, lung cancer, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma. As a condition of emerging from bankruptcy, B&W created a trust fund to compensate victims, but for amounts far less than settlements paid in individual personal injury lawsuits.[12]
After B&W emerged from bankruptcy in 2006, B&W and BWX Technologies, both subsidiaries of the McDermott International, Inc., merged on 26 November 2007 to form The Babcock & Wilcox Companies, headed by President John Fees. The old company logo was changed.
On June 10, 2009, B&W unveiled B&W Modular Nuclear Energy, LLC (B&W MNE).[13] On the same day, B&W MNE announced its plans to design and develop the B&W mPower reactor, a modular, scalable nuclear reactor. The B&W mPower reactor design is a 125 megawatt, passively safe Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) (a Generation III reactor) with a below-ground containment structure.[14] The reactor is set to be manufactured in a factory, shipped by rail, then buried underground.[15][16]
On May 12, 2010, B&W announced that it and its subsidiaries would be spun off from its parent company, McDermott International, Inc.[17] The headquarters moved from Lynchburg, Virginia to Charlotte.[18] and the company became The Babcock & Wilcox Company.
On August 2, 2010, B&W began trading on the New York Stock Exchange as BWC.[19]
On July 1, 2015, Babcock & Wilcox and BWX Technologies, its former parent headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia, began trading separately.[5]

Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises (NYSE: BW), originally Babcock, Wilcox & Company and then The Babcock & Wilcox Company, is an American power generation company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. Historically, they are best known for their steam boilers and turbines, and later as a major supplier and designer of nuclear power plants and related products.

Background[edit]
The company was founded in 1867 in Providence, Rhode Island by partners Stephen Wilcox and George Babcock to manufacture and market Wilcox’s patented water-tube boiler.[2] B&W's list of innovations and firsts include the world’s first installed utility boiler (1881); manufacture of boilers to power New York City’s first subway (1902); first pulverized coal power plant (1918); design and manufacture of components for USS Nautilus, the world’s first nuclear-powered submarine (1953–55); the first supercritical pressure coal-fired boiler (1957); design and supply of reactors for the first U.S. built nuclear-powered surface ship, NS Savannah (1961).[3]
The company provided design, engineering, manufacturing, construction and facilities management services to nuclear, renewable, fossil power, industrial and government customers worldwide. B&W's boilers supply more than 300,000 megawatts of installed capacity in over 90 countries around the world. A reactor from B&W was destroyed by a nuclear meltdown in the Three Mile Island accident. During World War II, over half of the US Navy fleet was powered by Babcock & Wilcox boilers.
The company has its headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. It has major operations in Lynchburg, Virginia; Barberton, Ohio; Euclid, Ohio; Lancaster, Ohio; West Point, Mississippi; Mount Vernon, Indiana; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Erwin, Tennessee; Amarillo, Texas; Cambridge, Ontario; the Danish city of Esbjerg; and the German city of Straubing. B&W also has joint major joint venture companies in Beijing and the Indian city of Pune.[4]
On June 30, 2015, Babcock & Wilcox completed a spinoff from BWX Technologies, its former parent which is now headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia. The two companies began trading separately on July 1.[5]
B&W employs approximately 5,700 people, in addition to several thousand joint venture employees.[4]
Power Generation Group[edit]




The Babcock & Wilcox nuclear steam generator is seen at the company's plant at Barberton, Ohio prior to shipment via the Penn Central Railroad to a Duke Energy site in Oconee, S.C. This generator can convert more than 10 million pounds of water per hour into steam.


B&W Power Generation Group, Inc. (B&W PGG) is based in Barberton, Ohio and provides engineering, design, construction and manufacturing services to the fossil and renewable power generation sectors and to heavy industry worldwide. B&W PGG and its subsidiaries have facilities in Ohio; Wisconsin; Arona, Italy; Beijing, China; Esbjerg, Denmark; and technology licensees around the world.[6]

1913 Babcock & Wilcox boiler section



In 1867, Providence, Rhode Island, residents Stephen Wilcox and his partner George Herman Babcock patented the Babcock & Wilcox Non-Explosive Boiler, which used water filled tubes and de-nucleate boiling to generate steam more safely than either under-fire or fire-tube boilers. The boilers more safely generated higher pressure steam and was more efficient (as an energy to steam converter) than existing designs.[7]
In 1891, Babcock & Wilcox Ltd is established as a separate United Kingdom company, to be responsible for all sales outside the US and Cuba.[8]
In 1898, Robert Jurenka and Alois Seidl signed an agreement with the British Babcock & Wilcox Ltd to make the Berlin, Germany Babcock sales office into a subsidiary of the British company; a factory in Oberhausen in the Ruhr district made the boiler designed by the American engineers.[9]
In 1902 the New York City's first subway is powered by B&W boilers.[10]
During 1907 and 1909 Theodore Roosevelt's Great White Fleet were powered by B&W Boilers.
In 1929 B&W installs the world's first commercial size recovery boiler using the magnesium bisulfite process in Quebec, Canada.[11]
Between 1941 and 1945 B&W designed and delivered 4,100 marine boilers for combat and merchant ships, including 95 percent of the US fleet in Tokyo Bay at Japanese surrender.
In 1942, the company developed the cyclone furnace.
Between 1943 and 1945 B&W provided components, materials and process development for Manhattan Project.[7]
Between 1949 and 1952 B&W provided the 8 boilers for the SS United States, the fastest ocean liner ever constructed.
Between 1953 and 1955 B&W designed and fabricated components for USS Nautilus (SSN-571), world’s first nuclear-powered submarine.
In 1961 B&W designed and supplied reactors for world’s first commercial nuclear ship NS Savannah.
In 1962 B&W designed and furnished reactor systems for B&W's first commercial reactor, Indian Point, using HEU 233.
In 1975 B&W designed and built components for liquid metal fast breeder reactors.
In 1975 the long term business agreements with the British Babcock & Wilcox Ltd were ended. Subsequently, the British company was renamed Babcock International Group plc.
In 1978 B&W designed and built the nuclear reactor that was involved in the Three Mile Island accident.
In 1999 B&W was awarded the contract to develop fuel cells and steam reforming for US Navy.
On February 22, 2000, B&W filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in part as a result of thousands of claims for personal injury due to prolonged exposure to asbestos and asbestos fibers. Claims included asbestosis, lung cancer, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma. As a condition of emerging from bankruptcy, B&W created a trust fund to compensate victims, but for amounts far less than settlements paid in individual personal injury lawsuits.[12]
After B&W emerged from bankruptcy in 2006, B&W and BWX Technologies, both subsidiaries of the McDermott International, Inc., merged on 26 November 2007 to form The Babcock & Wilcox Companies, headed by President John Fees. The old company logo was changed.
On June 10, 2009, B&W unveiled B&W Modular Nuclear Energy, LLC (B&W MNE).[13] On the same day, B&W MNE announced its plans to design and develop the B&W mPower reactor, a modular, scalable nuclear reactor. The B&W mPower reactor design is a 125 megawatt, passively safe Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) (a Generation III reactor) with a below-ground containment structure.[14] The reactor is set to be manufactured in a factory, shipped by rail, then buried underground.[15][16]
On May 12, 2010, B&W announced that it and its subsidiaries would be spun off from its parent company, McDermott International, Inc.[17] The headquarters moved from Lynchburg, Virginia to Charlotte.[18] and the company became The Babcock & Wilcox Company.
On August 2, 2010, B&W began trading on the New York Stock Exchange as BWC.[19]
On July 1, 2015, Babcock & Wilcox and BWX Technologies, its former parent headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia, began trading separately.[5]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
