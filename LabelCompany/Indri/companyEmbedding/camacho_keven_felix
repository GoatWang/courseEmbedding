Sanctuary, Inc. is a community-based organization which exists to improve the quality of life for Guam's youth to promote reconciliation during times of family conflicts, to foster the development of responsible community members, and to advocate for their needs in an effort to preserve family unit. Finally, he is a co-owner of TSC, Inc. which is a web design, maintenance, and hosting company that maintains and hosts websites for island businesses and organizations. He is a graduate of Arizona State University and received an MBA from the University of Guam in 2005, In 2003, he also graduated from the Pacific Coast Banking School at the University of Washington.
