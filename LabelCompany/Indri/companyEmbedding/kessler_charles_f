Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

      Highest paid under 40 - Charles F. Kessler (11) - FORTUNE
    




























Highest paid under 40







11 of 20






                  11. Charles F. Kessler
                






EVP Female Merchandising
                Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF)Age: 372008 Total compensation*: $2.32 million
                The trendy teen retailer known for blasting club music in its dimly lit stores has lost some of its sizzle: it recorded a second quarter net loss of $27 million, compared to a profit
                of $78 million over the same period a year earlier. The business hopes to catch up by lowering prices and expanding internationally.
                
                  Kessler, who goes by Chad, started out at vice president of merchandising at Hollister, A&F's surf clothing brand, before moving to the parent company.
