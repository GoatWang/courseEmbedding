                                Report abuseTranscript of Robert E. LeeRobert E. Lee Presentation by Sarah Klinger A biography by Emory M. ThomasPublished in 1995 Robert E. Lee was the leader of theConfederate Army in the Civil War.He was a great strategist and     executor of battle strategy. "He was the most exemplary pupilin every respect. He was never behind, never failed, and was perfectly observant of the rules and regulations."(Thomas. 43) Thomas, Emory M. Robert E. Lee: A Biography. New York: W.W. Norton, 1995. Print. The book is about the life and times of Robert E. Lee. It goes into depth of his family, personal life, childhood, and his military career. I liked this book, because it showcased how hard work can help you in life. An example would be of Robert E. Lee's military career, in order to get into West Point, he had to go back to school, and there he finished every single math problem, down to the finest detail, even though he would just erase it to work on the next one. (Thomas. 43) I would recommend this book to anyone who likes history, especially the Civil War and leaders of it. "Second in his class at West Point, he went 4 years without incurring a single demerit." (Thomas.48) "Now Lee was an orphan at age 22 and still a houseguest." (Thomas.56) {Father died when Leewas 11, mother died when Lee was 22} "Some time during that summer of 1830, Lee asked Mary Custis to marry him...and married on June 30, 1831."(Thomas.61,64) "Robert has but little time for going about as his duties require his presence daily and keep him pretty well employed but this you     know is no misfortune."      {Mary Lee to her mother}                                                       (     (Thomas.70) "I shall leave my family in the care of my eldest son who will take care of them over the mountains somewhere this summer, and his GrMother along with them." (Thomas.85) This was 1837, his wife and 2 small children went to live with her family,   while he went to St. Louis to work on the Mississippi River with the Engineer Corps. On July 7, 1838 Lee was promoted to Captain, rare because it was peacetime, with less than 2 years as First Lieutenant."(Thomas.94) "The years from 1840 to 1846 were unexciting and unproductive at the surface; Lee neither achieved great engineering success nor found any measure of fame at this time. Beneath the surface, however, Lee's was a life in ferment, and this period was important."(Thomas.102) "Rooney recovered completely, in part because Robert Lee was such a sensitive, engaged parent." (Thomas.104) Rooney, their third child had leg problems, and recovered thanks to the care of his father.  "In 1852, Lee was appointed superintendent of West Point Military Academy, and reluctantly accepted." (Thomas.150) "On July 17, 1853, all of the Lees (minus Custis) were reunited and attended Christ Church, were Lee and two of his daughters presented themselves for confirmation." (Thomas.160) "Wednesday morning found us still watching - a lovely October day - the 12th 1870 - at 9, he seemed to be struggling - I rushed out for the doctor (Madison). He came, looked at him, and without saying a word walked quietly away." (Thomas.415) {Mildred recalling} Full transcriptPopular presentationsSee more popular or the latest prezisProductCompanyCareersSupportCommunityContactApps

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Robert Klinger has the following 1 specialty and 1 board certification.                     Pediatrics
    A pediatrician is a doctor who specializes in the regular care of children, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of illness in children. Young patients are often more complicated to treat because they are still growing and developing.


    While pediatricians may sub-specialize in specific therapy areas like oncology, surgery, ophthalmology, and anesthesiology, in general, pediatricians provide services like vaccinations, health exams, and treatment of common ailments and injuries. In addition, pediatricians are trained to handle the complex emotional and behavioral issues faced by children, especially during puberty.


    Pediatricians normally see their patients from birth until the age of 18, although some may agree to treat patients into their early 20s, if requested.
