CJ was recently inducted into the Cutlery Hall of Fame, following his father's induction in the 90's and his Grandfather's induction in the 80's. He is married with 3 children, 2 stepchildren and 3 grandchildren.LORI BUCK, OWNER & DIRECTOR    Lori Buck married the late Charles T. Buck (Chuck) in 1958. She, along with her husband (third  generation leader and Owner/Chairman of Buck Knives for 56 years), was involved with Buck Knives  when it was incorporated in 1961. Lori has two children, Marilyn Houser and President & CEO of Buck Knives, Charles Brian Buck (CJ). She  also has 5 grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren. Lori now serves on the Board of Directors and is  actively involved with Buck promotional events throughout the U.S. "God has been gracious to our company and our family throughout the years and I give God the glory."-Lori Buck  CHUCK BUCK (1936- 2015)Chuck, son of Al Buck and grandson of Buck Knives founder, Hoyt Buck, worked his way up through the company serving as President and CEO for many years, before handing over the reins to his son, CJ in 1999. Chuck remained active as Chairman of the Board until his death in 2015. "My grandfather, Hoyt Buck and my dad, Al Buck founded this company on a simple premise, to make a better knife. Our longtime, best-selling knives reflect that tradition. But we also recognize the importance of keeping pace with changing times. As we look to the future, you can be assured that the same attention to quality, performance and craftsmanship will continue.I spent a lot of my time traveling the USA to various events, meeting our customers. It is fun to hear the stories of how you received your Buck Knife. I can always tell when a knife is pulled out, the blade is sharpened to almost nothing, the handle has dings from years of use and your face lights up at the memory of the first time you used your knife - that your knife has been your friend."- Chuck Buck (1936-2015) AL BUCK (1910 - 1991) Back in the early days of Buck Knives, Al worked hard with his father, Hoyt Buck, to help develop the company into what it is today. Al revolutionized the knife industry and put Buck on the map with the creation of the 110 Folding Hunter. He also helped instill the core Christian values the company was founded upon and still abides by today.  As written in 1976If you are a new Buck knife owner, "welcome aboard." You are now part of a very large family. Although we're talking about a few million people, we still like to think of each one of our users as a member of the Buck Knives Family and take a personal interest in the product that was bought. With normal use, you should never have to buy another.Now that you are family, you might like to know a little more about our organization. The fantastic growth of Buck Knives was no accident. From the beginning, management determined to make God the Senior Partner. In a crisis, the problem was turned over to Him, and He hasn't failed to help us with the answer. Each product must reflect the integrity of management, including our Senior Partner. If sometimes we fail on our end, because we are human, we find it imperative to do our utmost to make it right. Of course, to us, besides being Senior Partner, He is our Heavenly Father also; and it's a great blessing to us to have this security in these troubled times. If any of you are troubled or perplexed and looking for answers, may we invite you to look to Him, for God loves you.I know that I still hold a special place in my heart for my mother and father, with an extra spot for what my father taught me, about life and about making a good knife. My hope is that I've done a good job in passing those same beliefs on to the next generations."For God so loved the world that he gave His only begotten son; that whoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John: 3:16- Al BuckPaul Bos We give credit where credit is due. Without this man, we would not have the patented heat treating system that has made our blades so legendary.Paul Bos, a nationally known heat-treat authority has been heat-treating since 1956. Before his retirement from Buck Knives in 2010, he served 70% of America's custom knifemakers as well as overseeing all of the heat-treating in Buck Knives factory, where he was able to consult with Buck's engineers. Paul's link to Buck Knives goes back to his early years when he worked on custom knives for Al Buck in the late 1950s. Buck Knives continues to operate Paul's heat treating business out of our factory, led now by Paul Farner who worked under Bos for many years. The process Bos developed, which involves heating, freezing and then reheating of the steel is like none other in the business, and is why Buck knives are famous for being sharper out of the box and staying sharp longer.In 2007 Bos was the recipient of the "Blade Magazine Industry Achievement Award" for the contributions and advances he made in heat treating technology. Furthermore, in 2010 he was inducted into the "Blade Magazine Cutlery Hall of Fame©" in recognition of nearly 50 years as the foremost authority on the heat treatment of steel for knife blades."No one could match Paul's dedication to the art of heat treating knife blades or his unwavering commitment to supporting custom knifemakers world-wide. He is living proof to the conviction that it takes more than just using good steel for making a fine blade; it's what you do with the steel that makes the difference," said Chuck Buck, Chairman of Buck Knives.Even in his retirement, Bos continues in an advisory role for Buck Knives, and makes trips to the Idaho plant as needed. For more information on heat treating, or our heat treating services, see our Heat Treating page under About Buck.Board Members Paul Holt Paul has been a member of Board of Directors of Buck Knives since 2013. Paul is a grandson of the founder, Al Buck. Paul is passionate about supporting the legacy and mission of Buck Knives and the core Christian values which made Buck what it is today.

History[edit]
Company origins[edit]
Buck Knives Inc. dates it history back over 100 years to the first knives made by Hoyt H. Buck. Hoyt H. Buck became a blacksmith's apprentice in Kansas in 1899 at the age of 10.[2][3] During his tenure Hoyt learned to make knives and in 1902 when he was 13, he developed a method of heat-treating the steel in hoes and other tools so they would hold an edge longer.[2] Hoyt left Kansas in 1907 for the American northwest and eventually enlisted in the United States Navy.[2] He is not known to have made knives until 1941 in Mountain Home, Idaho after the attack on Pearl Harbor.[2] Hoyt made each knife by hand, using worn-out file blades as raw material.[4] These early knives are called "four strikes" by collectors, because each of the letters in BUCK was struck with an individual letter stamp, which in 1961, was replaced by a one-piece stamp.[3]
With the entry of the USA into WW2 the government asked the public for donations of fixed blade knives to arm the troops.[1] Upon learning there were not enough knives for soldiers who needed them, Hoyt Buck bought an anvil, forge and grinder to set up a blacksmith shop in the basement of his church and started making knives for US troops.[1] Hoyt later explained, “I didn’t have any knives, (to offer) but I sure knew how to make them”.[1]
After World War II, Hoyt and his son Al moved to San Diego and set up shop as "H.H. Buck & Son" in 1947.[1] These early knives were handmade and more expensive than a typical mass-produced knife. Hoyt Buck made 25 knives a week until his death in 1949.[1] In the 1950s, the company began making knives on a much larger scale and marketed through dealers as opposed to direct mail.[5]
The Model 110[edit]
On April 18, 1963, just two years after their incorporation, the Buck board of directors voted to authorize development of a new folding utility and hunting knife.[1] The new design featured a sturdy locking mechanism and a substantial clip point blade suitable for butchering and skinning large game.[1] This would become the world-famous Buck Model 110 Folding Hunter.[1]
The Buck Model 110 has a 3 3⁄4–inch blade, a high-tension lock and a low-pressure release, the handles are typically wood and the bolsters are made of heavy-gauge brass.[1] Introduced in 1964, the Buck Folding Hunter was one of the first lockback folding knives considered strong enough to do the work of a fixed-blade knife.[6] Its debut revolutionized hunting knives, rapidly becoming one of the most popular knives ever made,[1] with some 15 million Model 110 knives produced since 1964.[6][7] Before 1981, the specially heat treated stainless steel used was 440C, from 1981 to 1992 it was 425M, and after 1993 Buck has used 420HC stainless steel. Its design is one of the most imitated knife patterns in the world.[1]
The Buck Model 112 has a three-inch blade, slightly smaller version of the 110 better suited for carry.
Models[edit]
There are many different models of Buck knives, including:

the Buck Model 110
the Buck 112
the Buck 119 BR Special
the Buck 65 Hood Punk Knife
the Buck 301 BKS Stockman
the Buck Model 501

Recent developments[edit]
In 1984, Buck introduced a survival knife with a hollow handle for storage and a 7.5 inch blade with a serrated spine and prongs so the knife could double as a grappling hook.[8] Dubbed the Buckmaster, it was marketed to the military and fans of the Rambo movies of the 1980s.[1] The Buckmaster was soon followed by the M9 Bayonet manufactured for the US Army, with an initial order of 315,600.[1]
In 1992–1993, Buck introduced the Nighthawk, a fixed-blade knife with a 6.5 inch blade and a black, handle made of Zytel for an ergonomic grip.[1] This knife [Best M9]was submitted to the United States Marines for evaluation for use by the USMC.[9]
In 2000, due to a demand from major retailers to reduce prices, Buck opened a plant in China. Imports from this plant had reached a high of 30 percent at one time,[10] but have dropped to 13 percent with the majority of these knives going to large retailers as opposed to sporting goods stores or knife shops.[11]
In 2005, the company relocated to Post Falls, Idaho.[10] Leaders of the San Diego business community considered this move a blow to San Diego County's economic landscape and a symbol of the state of California's problems in attracting and keeping businesses.[10]
Buck Knives has collaborated with different custom knifemakers such as Tom Mayo, Mick Strider,[12] David Yellowhorse,[13] and the late Rob Simonich.[14]
Al and Chuck Buck were inducted into the Blade Magazine Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1982 and 1996 Blade Shows respectively in Atlanta, Georgia in recognition for the impact that their designs and Company has made upon the cutlery industry.[15] Buck's heat treater, Paul Bos who heat treats knives for other custom makers and production companies at Buck's facility was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2011.
Products[edit]




Buck Ranger 112, a smaller version of the Buck Hunter 110


Buck Knives is an American manufacturer of different styles of knives including the first successful folding lock-blade, introduced in 1964.[1] Folding lock-blade knives and "Buck Knife" thereby became strongly linked in the public mind, and the Buck design was much imitated, so that a buck knife, has come to mean any folding lock-blade design, even while Buck Knife is yet a trademark and not limited to folding lock-blades.[16]
Buck licensed art knives[edit]
Buck Knives has produced art knives for and under license with other companies and organizations such as: the National Rifle Association, the Boy Scouts of America, Colt Firearms, Anheuser-Busch (Budweiser), Republic Studios, Harley Davidson, Indian Motorcycles, Ford Motor Company, Chevy Truck, Elvis Presley Estate, John Wayne Estate, Roy Clark, Purina, NHRA, Monroe Auto and Ducks Unlimited.[3] Additionally Buck has worked with many commissions to produce art knives for state anniversaries (Texas Sesquicentennial), state agencies (West Virginia State Police), commemorations (Battle Iowa) or celebrations (Apple Harvest Festival).
In popular culture[edit]

In the 1984 film Red Dawn, a carton of Buck Knives was one of the survival items the future Wolverines took with them when they were heading for the mountains. Patrick Swayze's character Jed Eckert keeps a Buck Folding Hunter in a sheath on his belt.
In the popular television show The Dukes of Hazzard both of the main protagonists carry Buck Model 110 Folding Hunter knives, and are seen making frequent use of them throughout the course of the series. In various episodes, the Duke boys use their knives both as general tools (e.g. cutting rope, whittling branches), and to help get them out of adverse situations poised by their adversaries (e.g. puncturing the tires of their foes.) It is worth noting that due to network regulations of the 1970s-1980's, as well as the general "family-friendly" nature of the show, at no point did the characters use their knives as weapons against another person.
In the Scream film series, Ghostface's primary weapon is a Buck 120 e.[citation needed]
A drawing of the Model 110 appears on the cover art of the indie rock band The Front Bottoms sophomore album,Talon of the Hawk.

The Model 110[edit]
On April 18, 1963, just two years after their incorporation, the Buck board of directors voted to authorize development of a new folding utility and hunting knife.[1] The new design featured a sturdy locking mechanism and a substantial clip point blade suitable for butchering and skinning large game.[1] This would become the world-famous Buck Model 110 Folding Hunter.[1]
The Buck Model 110 has a 3 3⁄4–inch blade, a high-tension lock and a low-pressure release, the handles are typically wood and the bolsters are made of heavy-gauge brass.[1] Introduced in 1964, the Buck Folding Hunter was one of the first lockback folding knives considered strong enough to do the work of a fixed-blade knife.[6] Its debut revolutionized hunting knives, rapidly becoming one of the most popular knives ever made,[1] with some 15 million Model 110 knives produced since 1964.[6][7] Before 1981, the specially heat treated stainless steel used was 440C, from 1981 to 1992 it was 425M, and after 1993 Buck has used 420HC stainless steel. Its design is one of the most imitated knife patterns in the world.[1]
The Buck Model 112 has a three-inch blade, slightly smaller version of the 110 better suited for carry.
Models[edit]
There are many different models of Buck knives, including:

the Buck Model 110
the Buck 112
the Buck 119 BR Special
the Buck 65 Hood Punk Knife
the Buck 301 BKS Stockman
the Buck Model 501

Recent developments[edit]
In 1984, Buck introduced a survival knife with a hollow handle for storage and a 7.5 inch blade with a serrated spine and prongs so the knife could double as a grappling hook.[8] Dubbed the Buckmaster, it was marketed to the military and fans of the Rambo movies of the 1980s.[1] The Buckmaster was soon followed by the M9 Bayonet manufactured for the US Army, with an initial order of 315,600.[1]
In 1992–1993, Buck introduced the Nighthawk, a fixed-blade knife with a 6.5 inch blade and a black, handle made of Zytel for an ergonomic grip.[1] This knife [Best M9]was submitted to the United States Marines for evaluation for use by the USMC.[9]
In 2000, due to a demand from major retailers to reduce prices, Buck opened a plant in China. Imports from this plant had reached a high of 30 percent at one time,[10] but have dropped to 13 percent with the majority of these knives going to large retailers as opposed to sporting goods stores or knife shops.[11]
In 2005, the company relocated to Post Falls, Idaho.[10] Leaders of the San Diego business community considered this move a blow to San Diego County's economic landscape and a symbol of the state of California's problems in attracting and keeping businesses.[10]
Buck Knives has collaborated with different custom knifemakers such as Tom Mayo, Mick Strider,[12] David Yellowhorse,[13] and the late Rob Simonich.[14]
Al and Chuck Buck were inducted into the Blade Magazine Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1982 and 1996 Blade Shows respectively in Atlanta, Georgia in recognition for the impact that their designs and Company has made upon the cutlery industry.[15] Buck's heat treater, Paul Bos who heat treats knives for other custom makers and production companies at Buck's facility was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2011.
Products[edit]




Buck Ranger 112, a smaller version of the Buck Hunter 110


Buck Knives is an American manufacturer of different styles of knives including the first successful folding lock-blade, introduced in 1964.[1] Folding lock-blade knives and "Buck Knife" thereby became strongly linked in the public mind, and the Buck design was much imitated, so that a buck knife, has come to mean any folding lock-blade design, even while Buck Knife is yet a trademark and not limited to folding lock-blades.[16]
Buck licensed art knives[edit]
Buck Knives has produced art knives for and under license with other companies and organizations such as: the National Rifle Association, the Boy Scouts of America, Colt Firearms, Anheuser-Busch (Budweiser), Republic Studios, Harley Davidson, Indian Motorcycles, Ford Motor Company, Chevy Truck, Elvis Presley Estate, John Wayne Estate, Roy Clark, Purina, NHRA, Monroe Auto and Ducks Unlimited.[3] Additionally Buck has worked with many commissions to produce art knives for state anniversaries (Texas Sesquicentennial), state agencies (West Virginia State Police), commemorations (Battle Iowa) or celebrations (Apple Harvest Festival).
In popular culture[edit]

In the 1984 film Red Dawn, a carton of Buck Knives was one of the survival items the future Wolverines took with them when they were heading for the mountains. Patrick Swayze's character Jed Eckert keeps a Buck Folding Hunter in a sheath on his belt.
In the popular television show The Dukes of Hazzard both of the main protagonists carry Buck Model 110 Folding Hunter knives, and are seen making frequent use of them throughout the course of the series. In various episodes, the Duke boys use their knives both as general tools (e.g. cutting rope, whittling branches), and to help get them out of adverse situations poised by their adversaries (e.g. puncturing the tires of their foes.) It is worth noting that due to network regulations of the 1970s-1980's, as well as the general "family-friendly" nature of the show, at no point did the characters use their knives as weapons against another person.
In the Scream film series, Ghostface's primary weapon is a Buck 120 e.[citation needed]
A drawing of the Model 110 appears on the cover art of the indie rock band The Front Bottoms sophomore album,Talon of the Hawk.

Buck Knives is an American knife manufacturer founded in San Diego, California and now located in Post Falls, Idaho. The company has a long history through five generations of the Buck family from 1902 to the present day. Buck Knives primarily manufactures sport and field knives and is credited with inventing the "folding hunting knife" and popularizing it to such a degree that the term "buck knife" has become synonymous with folding lockback knives, including those made by other manufacturers.

History[edit]
Company origins[edit]
Buck Knives Inc. dates it history back over 100 years to the first knives made by Hoyt H. Buck. Hoyt H. Buck became a blacksmith's apprentice in Kansas in 1899 at the age of 10.[2][3] During his tenure Hoyt learned to make knives and in 1902 when he was 13, he developed a method of heat-treating the steel in hoes and other tools so they would hold an edge longer.[2] Hoyt left Kansas in 1907 for the American northwest and eventually enlisted in the United States Navy.[2] He is not known to have made knives until 1941 in Mountain Home, Idaho after the attack on Pearl Harbor.[2] Hoyt made each knife by hand, using worn-out file blades as raw material.[4] These early knives are called "four strikes" by collectors, because each of the letters in BUCK was struck with an individual letter stamp, which in 1961, was replaced by a one-piece stamp.[3]
With the entry of the USA into WW2 the government asked the public for donations of fixed blade knives to arm the troops.[1] Upon learning there were not enough knives for soldiers who needed them, Hoyt Buck bought an anvil, forge and grinder to set up a blacksmith shop in the basement of his church and started making knives for US troops.[1] Hoyt later explained, “I didn’t have any knives, (to offer) but I sure knew how to make them”.[1]
After World War II, Hoyt and his son Al moved to San Diego and set up shop as "H.H. Buck & Son" in 1947.[1] These early knives were handmade and more expensive than a typical mass-produced knife. Hoyt Buck made 25 knives a week until his death in 1949.[1] In the 1950s, the company began making knives on a much larger scale and marketed through dealers as opposed to direct mail.[5]
The Model 110[edit]
On April 18, 1963, just two years after their incorporation, the Buck board of directors voted to authorize development of a new folding utility and hunting knife.[1] The new design featured a sturdy locking mechanism and a substantial clip point blade suitable for butchering and skinning large game.[1] This would become the world-famous Buck Model 110 Folding Hunter.[1]
The Buck Model 110 has a 3 3⁄4–inch blade, a high-tension lock and a low-pressure release, the handles are typically wood and the bolsters are made of heavy-gauge brass.[1] Introduced in 1964, the Buck Folding Hunter was one of the first lockback folding knives considered strong enough to do the work of a fixed-blade knife.[6] Its debut revolutionized hunting knives, rapidly becoming one of the most popular knives ever made,[1] with some 15 million Model 110 knives produced since 1964.[6][7] Before 1981, the specially heat treated stainless steel used was 440C, from 1981 to 1992 it was 425M, and after 1993 Buck has used 420HC stainless steel. Its design is one of the most imitated knife patterns in the world.[1]
The Buck Model 112 has a three-inch blade, slightly smaller version of the 110 better suited for carry.

There are many different models of Buck knives, including:

Buck Knives is an American knife manufacturer founded in San Diego, California and now located in Post Falls, Idaho. The company has a long history through five generations of the Buck family from 1902 to the present day. Buck Knives primarily manufactures sport and field knives and is credited with inventing the "folding hunting knife" and popularizing it to such a degree that the term "buck knife" has become synonymous with folding lockback knives, including those made by other manufacturers.

History[edit]
Company origins[edit]
Buck Knives Inc. dates it history back over 100 years to the first knives made by Hoyt H. Buck. Hoyt H. Buck became a blacksmith's apprentice in Kansas in 1899 at the age of 10.[2][3] During his tenure Hoyt learned to make knives and in 1902 when he was 13, he developed a method of heat-treating the steel in hoes and other tools so they would hold an edge longer.[2] Hoyt left Kansas in 1907 for the American northwest and eventually enlisted in the United States Navy.[2] He is not known to have made knives until 1941 in Mountain Home, Idaho after the attack on Pearl Harbor.[2] Hoyt made each knife by hand, using worn-out file blades as raw material.[4] These early knives are called "four strikes" by collectors, because each of the letters in BUCK was struck with an individual letter stamp, which in 1961, was replaced by a one-piece stamp.[3]
With the entry of the USA into WW2 the government asked the public for donations of fixed blade knives to arm the troops.[1] Upon learning there were not enough knives for soldiers who needed them, Hoyt Buck bought an anvil, forge and grinder to set up a blacksmith shop in the basement of his church and started making knives for US troops.[1] Hoyt later explained, “I didn’t have any knives, (to offer) but I sure knew how to make them”.[1]
After World War II, Hoyt and his son Al moved to San Diego and set up shop as "H.H. Buck & Son" in 1947.[1] These early knives were handmade and more expensive than a typical mass-produced knife. Hoyt Buck made 25 knives a week until his death in 1949.[1] In the 1950s, the company began making knives on a much larger scale and marketed through dealers as opposed to direct mail.[5]
The Model 110[edit]
On April 18, 1963, just two years after their incorporation, the Buck board of directors voted to authorize development of a new folding utility and hunting knife.[1] The new design featured a sturdy locking mechanism and a substantial clip point blade suitable for butchering and skinning large game.[1] This would become the world-famous Buck Model 110 Folding Hunter.[1]
The Buck Model 110 has a 3 3⁄4–inch blade, a high-tension lock and a low-pressure release, the handles are typically wood and the bolsters are made of heavy-gauge brass.[1] Introduced in 1964, the Buck Folding Hunter was one of the first lockback folding knives considered strong enough to do the work of a fixed-blade knife.[6] Its debut revolutionized hunting knives, rapidly becoming one of the most popular knives ever made,[1] with some 15 million Model 110 knives produced since 1964.[6][7] Before 1981, the specially heat treated stainless steel used was 440C, from 1981 to 1992 it was 425M, and after 1993 Buck has used 420HC stainless steel. Its design is one of the most imitated knife patterns in the world.[1]
The Buck Model 112 has a three-inch blade, slightly smaller version of the 110 better suited for carry.
Models[edit]
There are many different models of Buck knives, including:

the Buck Model 110
the Buck 112
the Buck 119 BR Special
the Buck 65 Hood Punk Knife
the Buck 301 BKS Stockman
the Buck Model 501

Recent developments[edit]
In 1984, Buck introduced a survival knife with a hollow handle for storage and a 7.5 inch blade with a serrated spine and prongs so the knife could double as a grappling hook.[8] Dubbed the Buckmaster, it was marketed to the military and fans of the Rambo movies of the 1980s.[1] The Buckmaster was soon followed by the M9 Bayonet manufactured for the US Army, with an initial order of 315,600.[1]
In 1992–1993, Buck introduced the Nighthawk, a fixed-blade knife with a 6.5 inch blade and a black, handle made of Zytel for an ergonomic grip.[1] This knife [Best M9]was submitted to the United States Marines for evaluation for use by the USMC.[9]
In 2000, due to a demand from major retailers to reduce prices, Buck opened a plant in China. Imports from this plant had reached a high of 30 percent at one time,[10] but have dropped to 13 percent with the majority of these knives going to large retailers as opposed to sporting goods stores or knife shops.[11]
In 2005, the company relocated to Post Falls, Idaho.[10] Leaders of the San Diego business community considered this move a blow to San Diego County's economic landscape and a symbol of the state of California's problems in attracting and keeping businesses.[10]
Buck Knives has collaborated with different custom knifemakers such as Tom Mayo, Mick Strider,[12] David Yellowhorse,[13] and the late Rob Simonich.[14]
Al and Chuck Buck were inducted into the Blade Magazine Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1982 and 1996 Blade Shows respectively in Atlanta, Georgia in recognition for the impact that their designs and Company has made upon the cutlery industry.[15] Buck's heat treater, Paul Bos who heat treats knives for other custom makers and production companies at Buck's facility was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2011.
Products[edit]




Buck Ranger 112, a smaller version of the Buck Hunter 110


Buck Knives is an American manufacturer of different styles of knives including the first successful folding lock-blade, introduced in 1964.[1] Folding lock-blade knives and "Buck Knife" thereby became strongly linked in the public mind, and the Buck design was much imitated, so that a buck knife, has come to mean any folding lock-blade design, even while Buck Knife is yet a trademark and not limited to folding lock-blades.[16]
Buck licensed art knives[edit]
Buck Knives has produced art knives for and under license with other companies and organizations such as: the National Rifle Association, the Boy Scouts of America, Colt Firearms, Anheuser-Busch (Budweiser), Republic Studios, Harley Davidson, Indian Motorcycles, Ford Motor Company, Chevy Truck, Elvis Presley Estate, John Wayne Estate, Roy Clark, Purina, NHRA, Monroe Auto and Ducks Unlimited.[3] Additionally Buck has worked with many commissions to produce art knives for state anniversaries (Texas Sesquicentennial), state agencies (West Virginia State Police), commemorations (Battle Iowa) or celebrations (Apple Harvest Festival).
In popular culture[edit]

In the 1984 film Red Dawn, a carton of Buck Knives was one of the survival items the future Wolverines took with them when they were heading for the mountains. Patrick Swayze's character Jed Eckert keeps a Buck Folding Hunter in a sheath on his belt.
In the popular television show The Dukes of Hazzard both of the main protagonists carry Buck Model 110 Folding Hunter knives, and are seen making frequent use of them throughout the course of the series. In various episodes, the Duke boys use their knives both as general tools (e.g. cutting rope, whittling branches), and to help get them out of adverse situations poised by their adversaries (e.g. puncturing the tires of their foes.) It is worth noting that due to network regulations of the 1970s-1980's, as well as the general "family-friendly" nature of the show, at no point did the characters use their knives as weapons against another person.
In the Scream film series, Ghostface's primary weapon is a Buck 120 e.[citation needed]
A drawing of the Model 110 appears on the cover art of the indie rock band The Front Bottoms sophomore album,Talon of the Hawk.

Buck Knives is an American knife manufacturer founded in San Diego, California and now located in Post Falls, Idaho. The company has a long history through five generations of the Buck family from 1902 to the present day. Buck Knives primarily manufactures sport and field knives and is credited with inventing the "folding hunting knife" and popularizing it to such a degree that the term "buck knife" has become synonymous with folding lockback knives, including those made by other manufacturers.

History[edit]
Company origins[edit]
Buck Knives Inc. dates it history back over 100 years to the first knives made by Hoyt H. Buck. Hoyt H. Buck became a blacksmith's apprentice in Kansas in 1899 at the age of 10.[2][3] During his tenure Hoyt learned to make knives and in 1902 when he was 13, he developed a method of heat-treating the steel in hoes and other tools so they would hold an edge longer.[2] Hoyt left Kansas in 1907 for the American northwest and eventually enlisted in the United States Navy.[2] He is not known to have made knives until 1941 in Mountain Home, Idaho after the attack on Pearl Harbor.[2] Hoyt made each knife by hand, using worn-out file blades as raw material.[4] These early knives are called "four strikes" by collectors, because each of the letters in BUCK was struck with an individual letter stamp, which in 1961, was replaced by a one-piece stamp.[3]
With the entry of the USA into WW2 the government asked the public for donations of fixed blade knives to arm the troops.[1] Upon learning there were not enough knives for soldiers who needed them, Hoyt Buck bought an anvil, forge and grinder to set up a blacksmith shop in the basement of his church and started making knives for US troops.[1] Hoyt later explained, “I didn’t have any knives, (to offer) but I sure knew how to make them”.[1]
After World War II, Hoyt and his son Al moved to San Diego and set up shop as "H.H. Buck & Son" in 1947.[1] These early knives were handmade and more expensive than a typical mass-produced knife. Hoyt Buck made 25 knives a week until his death in 1949.[1] In the 1950s, the company began making knives on a much larger scale and marketed through dealers as opposed to direct mail.[5]
The Model 110[edit]
On April 18, 1963, just two years after their incorporation, the Buck board of directors voted to authorize development of a new folding utility and hunting knife.[1] The new design featured a sturdy locking mechanism and a substantial clip point blade suitable for butchering and skinning large game.[1] This would become the world-famous Buck Model 110 Folding Hunter.[1]
The Buck Model 110 has a 3 3⁄4–inch blade, a high-tension lock and a low-pressure release, the handles are typically wood and the bolsters are made of heavy-gauge brass.[1] Introduced in 1964, the Buck Folding Hunter was one of the first lockback folding knives considered strong enough to do the work of a fixed-blade knife.[6] Its debut revolutionized hunting knives, rapidly becoming one of the most popular knives ever made,[1] with some 15 million Model 110 knives produced since 1964.[6][7] Before 1981, the specially heat treated stainless steel used was 440C, from 1981 to 1992 it was 425M, and after 1993 Buck has used 420HC stainless steel. Its design is one of the most imitated knife patterns in the world.[1]
The Buck Model 112 has a three-inch blade, slightly smaller version of the 110 better suited for carry.
Models[edit]
There are many different models of Buck knives, including:

the Buck Model 110
the Buck 112
the Buck 119 BR Special
the Buck 65 Hood Punk Knife
the Buck 301 BKS Stockman
the Buck Model 501

Recent developments[edit]
In 1984, Buck introduced a survival knife with a hollow handle for storage and a 7.5 inch blade with a serrated spine and prongs so the knife could double as a grappling hook.[8] Dubbed the Buckmaster, it was marketed to the military and fans of the Rambo movies of the 1980s.[1] The Buckmaster was soon followed by the M9 Bayonet manufactured for the US Army, with an initial order of 315,600.[1]
In 1992–1993, Buck introduced the Nighthawk, a fixed-blade knife with a 6.5 inch blade and a black, handle made of Zytel for an ergonomic grip.[1] This knife [Best M9]was submitted to the United States Marines for evaluation for use by the USMC.[9]
In 2000, due to a demand from major retailers to reduce prices, Buck opened a plant in China. Imports from this plant had reached a high of 30 percent at one time,[10] but have dropped to 13 percent with the majority of these knives going to large retailers as opposed to sporting goods stores or knife shops.[11]
In 2005, the company relocated to Post Falls, Idaho.[10] Leaders of the San Diego business community considered this move a blow to San Diego County's economic landscape and a symbol of the state of California's problems in attracting and keeping businesses.[10]
Buck Knives has collaborated with different custom knifemakers such as Tom Mayo, Mick Strider,[12] David Yellowhorse,[13] and the late Rob Simonich.[14]
Al and Chuck Buck were inducted into the Blade Magazine Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1982 and 1996 Blade Shows respectively in Atlanta, Georgia in recognition for the impact that their designs and Company has made upon the cutlery industry.[15] Buck's heat treater, Paul Bos who heat treats knives for other custom makers and production companies at Buck's facility was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2011.
Products[edit]




Buck Ranger 112, a smaller version of the Buck Hunter 110


Buck Knives is an American manufacturer of different styles of knives including the first successful folding lock-blade, introduced in 1964.[1] Folding lock-blade knives and "Buck Knife" thereby became strongly linked in the public mind, and the Buck design was much imitated, so that a buck knife, has come to mean any folding lock-blade design, even while Buck Knife is yet a trademark and not limited to folding lock-blades.[16]
Buck licensed art knives[edit]
Buck Knives has produced art knives for and under license with other companies and organizations such as: the National Rifle Association, the Boy Scouts of America, Colt Firearms, Anheuser-Busch (Budweiser), Republic Studios, Harley Davidson, Indian Motorcycles, Ford Motor Company, Chevy Truck, Elvis Presley Estate, John Wayne Estate, Roy Clark, Purina, NHRA, Monroe Auto and Ducks Unlimited.[3] Additionally Buck has worked with many commissions to produce art knives for state anniversaries (Texas Sesquicentennial), state agencies (West Virginia State Police), commemorations (Battle Iowa) or celebrations (Apple Harvest Festival).
In popular culture[edit]

In the 1984 film Red Dawn, a carton of Buck Knives was one of the survival items the future Wolverines took with them when they were heading for the mountains. Patrick Swayze's character Jed Eckert keeps a Buck Folding Hunter in a sheath on his belt.
In the popular television show The Dukes of Hazzard both of the main protagonists carry Buck Model 110 Folding Hunter knives, and are seen making frequent use of them throughout the course of the series. In various episodes, the Duke boys use their knives both as general tools (e.g. cutting rope, whittling branches), and to help get them out of adverse situations poised by their adversaries (e.g. puncturing the tires of their foes.) It is worth noting that due to network regulations of the 1970s-1980's, as well as the general "family-friendly" nature of the show, at no point did the characters use their knives as weapons against another person.
In the Scream film series, Ghostface's primary weapon is a Buck 120 e.[citation needed]
A drawing of the Model 110 appears on the cover art of the indie rock band The Front Bottoms sophomore album,Talon of the Hawk.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. SoftCover. Book Condition: New. Reprinted from 1699 edition. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper.

Antarctic missions[edit]




The Paul Buck harbored next to an Ice breaker in Polar Bear Bay


Paul Buck made frequent deliveries of fuel to the Antarctic for resupply. This was the most common route that this ship made delivering a variety of fuel types to the base. It was always escorted by an ice breaker.
Paul Buck went out of service in June 2010 and was transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposal. Paul Buck is now awaiting bids to be converted to a Training Ship for SUNY Maritime College. General plans of the converted ship have been submitted to the College for review.
Conversion to T/S Empire State VII[edit]
In September 2012, general plans were submitted to MARAD and SUNY Maritime College for the conversion of the USNS Paul Buck to the Empire State VII. For a time, these plans were put on hold and no further discussions regarding conversions or purpose-built ships were made. In 2014 MARAD reopened the conversion plans and SUNY Maritime College's new President, Rear Admiral Michael Alfutis stated that one of his long-term goals for the school would be to acquire a new training ship within the next four to six years. A series of sea trials conducted on the T.S. Empire State VI in August 2014 concluded that she had a useful life of at least another five years.

Doe Urine
Adrenaline enters the blood stream of a frightened deer, and is pumped into its muscles to enable them to quickly free from danger. It is also assumed the sensitive nose of other deer that smell this urine detect a distress signal, which may result in setting off an alarm response to other deer that smell this urine. Pollick's doe urine is collected only from tame, adult, bottle-fed doe, raised by hand from a few days old. This assures our hunters are getting the highest quality deer urine available. We also lightly freeze proof our deer urine with a modest amount of odorless glycerin before we bottle it. This allows more odor dispersal in cold weather and helps to retard spoilage. Our doe urine will perform with excellent results now and also next year if you haven't used it yet. Plain doe urine is most effective during pre-rut, as buck begin to test doe urine for its sexual advertising scent phermones. Doe urine dispersed in a few areas around your stand on a dry limb or a few pieces of bark will assist in drawing the attention of other deer in the area. This also serves as a natural cover scent.

Fur Trapping Lures
For over 50 years, I never missed a single trapping season. This is something I always did for the pure love of it, regardless of the fur prices. With the large number of deer we process during the fall and winter Pennsylvania hunting seasons, I do not have time to run a full line trapping supply business. However, during the spring and summer months, I relish my time in the lure sheds making my natural gland deer scents and lures.
2 years ago, I decided to add my line of quality trapping scents and lures to our respected line of whitetail deer scent, lures, and urines. You won't find cheaper, more reliable baits and lures formulated with the finest ingredients and years of experience behind them. And best of all, they will perform well and save a lot of money on your trap line expenses. Our 8 oz. trapping lures are only $2.50/oz.
