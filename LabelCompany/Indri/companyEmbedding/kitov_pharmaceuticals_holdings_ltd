KIT-302





 




KIT-302 is a combination drug that treats osteoarthritis pain and hypertension simultaneously. KIT-302 is comprised of two FDA-approved drugs, celecoxib (the active ingredient in Pfizer’s Celebrex®) for the treatment of pain caused by OA, and amlodipine besylate (amlodipine – the active ingredient in Pfizer’s Norvasc®), a drug designed to treat hypertension. 
In December 2015, it was announced that the Phase III clinical trial for KIT-302 successfully met the primary efficacy endpoint of the trial protocol as approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA). The trial’s primary efficacy endpoint was to show that KIT-302 lowers daytime systolic blood pressure by at least 50% of that achieved in patients treated only with amlodipine. The trial data, in fact, revealed that KIT-302 was more efficacious at reducing blood pressure than when amlodipine was used on its own.
The trial data also showed that the favorable blood pressure effects of KIT-302 were present in all blood pressure variables measured in the study. Kitov determined that the blood pressure reduction synergy seen with combining celecoxib and amlodipine was present in daytime systolic blood pressure — the study’s primary efficacy endpoint. Based on the data, however, the blood pressure reduction synergy was also present with all other blood pressure variables and at all times of day — i.e. daytime diastolic blood pressure, nighttime systolic blood pressure, and nighttime diastolic blood pressure. Although celecoxib, when combined with amlodipine, appears to have a synergistic effect by lowering blood pressure, it lacks this effect when administered by itself.
These results not only confirm the study’s top-line findings, but also reveal that using a combination drug for treating pain can improve patient health.
Kitov plans to file a new drug application (NDA) for marketing approval of KIT-302 with the FDA by early 2017.
Additional data from the Phase III clinical trial of KIT-302 also suggest beneficial effects on renal (kidney) function, as compared to negative effects on renal function caused by other NSAIDS.  The data also suggest that KIT-302 may protect against the amlodipine side effect of causing fluid retention by the kidneys.
We intend to conduct a clinical trial designed to validate and better quantify these potential beneficial renal effects. The trial may also provide an explanation for the synergistic antihypertensive effect, where the reduction in blood pressure demonstrated with KIT-302 was higher than that observed with amlodipine alone.

About






Profile





 




Business
Kitov Pharmaceuticals is an innovative biopharmaceutical company focused on late-stage drug development. The company’s current product pipeline features two combination drugs intended to treat osteoarthritis (OA) pain and hypertension (HTN) simultaneously. By lowering development risk and cost through streamlined regulatory approval of novel therapeutics, Kitov plans to delivers rapid ROI while making a meaningful impact on people’s lives.
Products
Kitov’s current pipeline products, KIT-301 and KIT-302, are combination drugs that treat OA pain and HTN simultaneously. In December 2015, KIT-302 successfully achieved the primary efficacy endpoint for its Phase III clinical trial. In August 2016, the United States Patent Office issued a patent covering KIT-302.
Market
Of the 27 million Americans with OA, 50% also suffer from HTN, which is also a common side effect of stand-alone OA drugs. With no single medication currently treating both conditions, KIT-301 and KIT-302 are targeting this multi-billion dollar market.
Team
Kitov features a world-caliber team with decades of managerial, entrepreneurial, scientific, medical and financial experience. Chaired by a former FDA medical officer, the Kitov team has a proven track record leveraging deep regulatory and clinical-trial expertise that leads to streamlined end-to-end drug development and approval.
Partnership
Kitov maintains a strategic partnership with Dexcel Pharma, a global pharma company, for providing chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) services for KIT-302. Active in 20 countries, Dexcel is involved in the manufacture of 55 drug products. The partnership calls for Dexcel to develop the final formulation of KIT-302, including chemical development, analytical methodology and validation, stability testing, and production of batches for pharmacokinetic studies. Dexcel will also scale-up production for the anticipated new drug application (NDA) submission to the FDA.
Ownership
Founded in 2010, Kitov became a public company in 2013 when its shares were first traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE). Kitov successfully issued an IPO on NASDAQ in November 2015. The company currently trades on both stock exchanges.

Kitov Pharmaceuticals Holdings Ltd., an innovative biopharmaceutical company, announced results of a pre-clinical study demonstrating that NT-219, the lead drug candidate of its subsidiary TyrNovo Ltd., in combination with Keytruda, converted non-responding tumors to responders and blocked tumor progression in an immune-oncology preclinical model.
The study, conducted in collaboration with researchers at Bar Ilan University and Rabin Medical Center, assessed NT-219`s ability to overcome cancer drug resistance in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of immune-deficient mice, in which a tumor originated from an esophagus cancer biopsy was implanted. The mice were supplemented with immune cells from the same patient (double autologous). While no response was observed with Keytruda alone or with NT-219 alone, and the tumors aggressively progressed, mice treated concomitantly with a combination of Keytruda and NT-219 demonstrated complete blockage of tumor progression.
"We are excited with these initial results obtained with NT-219 in combination with pembrolizumab (Keytruda)," stated Dr. J. Paul Waymack, Chairman of Kitov`s board and chief medical officer. "Previous results obtained with NT-219 demonstrated its efficacy in overcoming drug resistance in a variety of cancers and in combination with various pharmacologic cancer therapies. We are focused on advancing this highly promising therapeutic candidate to clinical trials as quickly as possible in order to provide enhanced treatment options to cancer patients."
TyrNovo Ltd., a Kitov Pharmaceuticals company, is developer of novel small molecules in the oncology therapeutic field. TyrNovo is developing NT-219, an oncology product designed to be used in combination with other oncology drugs. NT-219 is a small molecule that presents a new concept in cancer therapy. In combination with various approved oncology drugs, NT-219 has demonstrated potent anti-tumor effects and increased survival in various cancer models, including sarcoma, melanoma, pancreatic, lung, ovarian, head & neck, prostate and colon cancers.(c)  2017 Gulf Sports Media All rights reserved.

Paul Waymack, Chairman of Kitov's Board and Chief Medical Officer.

Zacks Rank:



                                                 3-Hold     3     




Style Scores:



D Value | C Growth | C Momentum | D VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 





 Share

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
