        I have health insurance. Will LabCorp file the claim? How does billing work with insurance?      




LabCorp will file claims directly to Medicare, Medicaid, and many insurance companies and managed care plans. Before you have lab tests performed, please make sure:

Your insurance information is up to date.
LabCorp is a contracted laboratory for your insurance company. Contact your insurance company for information.

Once your insurer has processed your claim, you will receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from your insurer informing you of the amount it will pay for your laboratory services.

The EOB is not a bill, but it may indicate that a balance remains which is your responsibility. That balance may include your copayment, deductible, or other costs outlined in your terms of coverage. If you have a question about your EOB or your terms of coverage, contact your insurance company.
Your insurer will inform LabCorp about any balance you owe, and we will send you a bill for that amount.

        How can patients participate in the LabAccess Partnership program?      




Patients must present their test request paperwork at a LabCorp patient service center for specimen collection. To take advantage of the LabAccess Partnership (LAP) program, patients must pay the discounted fees of the ordered laboratory tests in full at the time of service. Patients with unpaid laboratory charges will not be eligible for the program until overdue balances are satisfied.

        What is the benefit of using an in-network provider for my laboratory testing?      




Using an in-network provider can help maximize your healthcare benefits and can help minimize your out-of-pocket costs. You should check with your insurance provider to see if LabCorp is a contracted laboratory provider.

Please read your bill carefully. A line-item adjustment will be printed on the first bill you receive from LabCorp if we have received payment from your insurance company. If you are still uncertain, you can either contact your insurance company directly or contact LabCorp Patient Billing at 800-845-6167.

          Using LabCorp      











How it works   










Start

Ordering a Test Your doctor orders a lab test. 



Providing a SpecimenA specimen is collected in your doctor's office or at a LabCorp lab (patient service center). 



Processing and ResultsA LabCorp lab processes your test and the results are sent to your ordering doctor. 



BillingLabCorp will file your insurance claim and bill you for any remaining charges. 

Done 









Ordering a Test
Your doctor orders a laboratory test from LabCorp. If you would like more information about a test, speak with your doctor or see the patient test information (see button below) provided by Lab Tests Online.


Patient Test Info









Providing a Specimen
Your specimen is collected for testing in your doctor’s office or at a LabCorp lab – also referred to as a patient service center (PSC). If you need to go to a PSC for specimen collection, click Lab Search to find one near you. 


Lab Search









Processing and Results
A LabCorp courier picks up the test orders and specimens from the collection location (doctor’s office or PSC) and transports them to the lab for processing. Once testing is complete, test results are sent to the ordering doctor for review. Depending on the complexity of the test being performed, it could take a few hours or as long as several days before your results are reported to your doctor. You may access your lab results in the LabCorp patient portal after they have been reported to your doctor. Any questions about your results should be directed to your doctor.


Get Your Results









Billing
Once the lab order with your test(s) is successfully resulted in the lab system, LabCorp files the claim with your insurance carrier or bills you or the appropriate account holder. If you receive a bill from LabCorp, click Pay Your Bill below.

Same as before but better. In and out without fuss. Best blood draw in memory. My veins are hard to find, but not here. Nice new modern facility. Very nice vibe.







Most clean, tranquil (!!?), speedy and painless blood draw experience ever. I made an appointment and was in and out in less than 10 minutes from start to finish.







Rodel was very polite, cheerful and great at drawing blood -- even after I started to faint he kept me from falling and revived me back to full health!

There was no one else in there at 11am and I was in-and-out with 0 waiting, super convenient and fast. Definitely recommend coming here.







Place is sooooooo slow. Only one guy works here!!

And I called earlier to try to make an appointment and the guy said they don't take appointments and to just walk in. Then I come in and you're basically waiting forever unless you have an appointment, in which case you wait a little less than forever. Freaking ridiculous







Lab Corp - Channing Rd. is my go-to lab.  The phlebotomist is great and she gets the job done right the first time which is important when you have to go for recurring bloodwork.  She is very experienced.  We've been going to this site & Welch Rd before that just to see her.







I love this office. Fast, efficient, highly qualified woman working there. People complain she isn't friendly. I like her, and she's very smart. (also excellent at her job). I wrote a blog post about her and according to analytics it has been read by other labs and medical centers.  As to what the place looks like - looks fine to me. You want more, you'll pay more. It is functional and clean. 

Note to YELP: You have the zip code wrong. It isn't 94309.  It is 94301.

(I haven't been there in about 6 months so I hope I am giving the thumbs up to the right person!)







HORRIBLE! I will never use this lab ever again.

1) I arrived and signed in at 8.24 for an 8.30 appointment. Another patient arrived at the same time. She did not have an appointment. We were there for the same routine lab tests and she was taken ahead of me. Why bother making an appointment?

2) The tech collected my blood and vigorously shook the tubes. I had not seen this before. The following is the correct procedure for collecting blood according to the website of another lab:

...Whole Blood
The tube must be filled completely and gently inverted at least 10 times immediately after drawing. Do not shake the tube. Shaking may cause hemolysis and result in specimen rejection.

3) Multiple urine samples, including mine, were left unattended in the bathroom on the back of the toilet. They were not secured or supervised.







Very fast. I was in and out in 15 minutes and I did not have an appointment. However, the place was difficult to find. It is not on Middlefield,  but channing. There's no way you can access the place through Middlefield, a new office building obstructs the old Middlefield road entrance. They should change the address to Channing.







Fast and efficient!  I had a Friday 8:30 am appointment.  I got there early at 8:10 and I was processed and out by 8:15.  The test results came through the following morning.

The woman doing the paperwork and tests didn't say much, but she was professional, efficient and seemed experienced.  It all seemed good to me!







The woman who works here (and it seems she's the entire staff) appears to be the same person who worked at the LabCorp at the old Welch Road location.

The good news: she appears to be an experienced Phlebotomist. She draws blood efficiently and painlessly.

The bad news: as others have noted, she gives off a very unhappy vibe. All I can think is that she hates her job, hates her customers, and wishes she was anywhere but at work.

Clearly it doesn't seem to bother LabCorp as they've obviously invested zero dollars in training her in any semblance of customer service skills.







Okay, so the person at the front desk isn't always the friendliest, but they've been holed up by themselves all day.  Once the paperwork is done and you're starting your lab work, it goes quickly and painlessly.

The place is clean, however the bathroom always has issues.  Either you can't use the sink or the toilet has to be flushed 47 times, but I still like this place because the ease of their billing process makes it all worth it.  They bill your insurance, and they know how to bill so you don't get a million calls and letters.

I was in the other day getting my blood drawn, and I had to take a call from my doctor in the middle of all of it and next thing I know I'm done.  Didn't feel a thing and the young lady was kind as could be, even after I was rude and on my cell the whole time!   

Quick, clean, convenient and fast.







Would not suggest showing up at 8 when they open because they are busy checking email and ignoring customers, creating a huge pileup first thing in the morning.

This place is staffed only by one person and she's not the friendliest. Would recommend going to another LabCorp if you can do so conveniently.







I had a horrible time at this place. It is so small it can only hold 3 people in its waiting room and the receptionist was very rude and could barely speak English. I had to take a drug test by 2:55pm for my job and i took it at 2:50pm..I almost didn't make it because the place is so unprofessional.







Jury is out on this place.  Personally, I was  unimpressed by the facility.  There were 5 people in the waiting room (which can only accommodate 6 people) and 1 employee who is the receptionist, specimen collector, blood draw technician, etc.  Seemed like more of a fly-by-night deal than a serious lab.







I am shocked that this place has negative reviews. But after closer inspection, the reviews were from a few years ago. I suspect things have changed since those reviews were posted. I have come here twice and I am always pleased. Both times I have been here, there has only been one person working, Sedique and she is great. Very good plebotomist, she hits the vein perfectly every time, she is very efficient and fast too, so I am in and out quick.







I am a community provider and I send patients to Labcorp at the Middlefield Rd. location.  I am surprised by the negative reviews because I have not had many complaints about them from my patients. I am able to get results online and quickly send them to my patients via fax or email. As a provider I would suggest that Labcorp work quickly to automate the requisition process as well as the results process. It is important to be able to order labs online instead of having multiple page requisitions.

Also, staff should be trained to make sure that providers have given a diagnosis code at the time of requisition so that the provider does not get bothered on the back end when the lab is ready to bill.

Quest and Labcorp are pretty similar, it seems, when I speak to my patients.







First experience with Labcorp was a mess. They misplaced my lab results and it took my physician's office a couple days to locate them. 

My doctor recently told me that they have a been a disaster in terms of billing with lots of problems.

Labcorp took over most of the Stanford Hospital labs and they have gone downhill faster than an avalanche. Pathetic outsourcing. Stanford should be ashamed.

Make sure to use the labs that are still Stanford operated. One is in the hospital itself and the other is in the Blake Wilbur building.







I had a 9am appointment and arrived about 5 minutes early.  The lady working said she was finishing up with another client and it would be just a few minutes.  Sure enough, a few minutes later we went over my paperwork, she made a copy of insurance info and inside I went.  The process was fairly efficient.  The waiting room is small and if there were people waiting it might have been annoying.  Since there is only one staffer I suppose it could get backed up, but if you make an appointment you should be fine.  The patient log didn't seem that full and it didn't seem like many people had to wait too long in the morning.







Efficient and quick.  Just dropped in and was out in minutes.







I'm surprised by the 2 negative reviews below. I've been at Labcorp several times since 2005 and found it quick and easy. I've been a patient at PAMF for 14 years and used to go to their lab, but after they moved to the building on El Camino in 1999 or 2000, I found the wait to average 45 min. for a phlebotomist, often with an attitude.  No way would I waste time waiting in their small basement room now.  Plus, I have a high-deductible health care plan and have to pay cash for my labs, so I actually save some money by getting my  labs done at Labcorp instead of PAMF. I've also had blood drawn at Stanford Hospital and had 2 negative experiences: the first time I walked out after waiting for 30 min. and listening to the phlebotomists argue over which tubes to use (speaking of incompetence...) and another time I was stabbed in the arm 4x by one person before someone competent replaced her and got blood from another vein.  In all the years of getting blood draws, that was the only time someone didn't get blood at the first stick (I have very accessible arm veins).  I ended up with an ugly hematoma for a few days where the incompetent Stanford lab person had stabbed me.

This is a good place to get your medical lab work done. I have found their offices to have the latest technology, their technicians to be highly competent, and the ambience to be comfortable (nice waiting room) and efficient.And, you can book your appointment online. Bring a copy of the  appointment slip, the note from you physician, and your medical card.See if there's one in your neighborhood.

Very fast. I was in and out in 15 minutes and I did not have an appointment. However, the place was difficult to find. It is not on Middlefield,  but channing. There's no way you can access the place through Middlefield, a new office building obstructs the old Middlefield road entrance. They should change the address to Channing.

Fast and efficient!  I had a Friday 8:30 am appointment.  I got there early at 8:10 and I was processed and out by 8:15.  The test results came through the following morning.The woman doing the paperwork and tests didn't say much, but she was professional, efficient and seemed experienced.  It all seemed good to me!

The woman who works here (and it seems she's the entire staff) appears to be the same person who worked at the LabCorp at the old Welch Road location.The good news: she appears to be an experienced Phlebotomist. She draws blood efficiently and painlessly.The bad news: as others have noted, she gives off a very unhappy vibe. All I can think is that she hates her job, hates her customers, and wishes she was anywhere but at work.Clearly it doesn't seem to bother LabCorp as they've obviously invested zero dollars in training her in any semblance of customer service skills.

Okay, so the person at the front desk isn't always the friendliest, but they've been holed up by themselves all day.  Once the paperwork is done and you're starting your lab work, it goes quickly and painlessly.The place is clean, however the bathroom always has issues.  Either you can't use the sink or the toilet has to be flushed 47 times, but I still like this place because the ease of their billing process makes it all worth it.  They bill your insurance, and they know how to bill so you don't get a million calls and letters.I was in the other day getting my blood drawn, and I had to take a call from my doctor in the middle of all of it and next thing I know I'm done.  Didn't feel a thing and the young lady was kind as could be, even after I was rude and on my cell the whole time!   Quick, clean, convenient and fast.

Would not suggest showing up at 8 when they open because they are busy checking email and ignoring customers, creating a huge pileup first thing in the morning.This place is staffed only by one person and she's not the friendliest. Would recommend going to another LabCorp if you can do so conveniently.

I had a horrible time at this place. It is so small it can only hold 3 people in its waiting room and the receptionist was very rude and could barely speak English. I had to take a drug test by 2:55pm for my job and i took it at 2:50pm..I almost didn't make it because the place is so unprofessional.

Jury is out on this place.  Personally, I was  unimpressed by the facility.  There were 5 people in the waiting room (which can only accommodate 6 people) and 1 employee who is the receptionist, specimen collector, blood draw technician, etc.  Seemed like more of a fly-by-night deal than a serious lab.

I am shocked that this place has negative reviews. But after closer inspection, the reviews were from a few years ago. I suspect things have changed since those reviews were posted. I have come here twice and I am always pleased. Both times I have been here, there has only been one person working, Sedique and she is great. Very good plebotomist, she hits the vein perfectly every time, she is very efficient and fast too, so I am in and out quick.

I am a community provider and I send patients to Labcorp at the Middlefield Rd. location.  I am surprised by the negative reviews because I have not had many complaints about them from my patients. I am able to get results online and quickly send them to my patients via fax or email. As a provider I would suggest that Labcorp work quickly to automate the requisition process as well as the results process. It is important to be able to order labs online instead of having multiple page requisitions.Also, staff should be trained to make sure that providers have given a diagnosis code at the time of requisition so that the provider does not get bothered on the back end when the lab is ready to bill.Quest and Labcorp are pretty similar, it seems, when I speak to my patients.

First experience with Labcorp was a mess. They misplaced my lab results and it took my physician's office a couple days to locate them. My doctor recently told me that they have a been a disaster in terms of billing with lots of problems.Labcorp took over most of the Stanford Hospital labs and they have gone downhill faster than an avalanche. Pathetic outsourcing. Stanford should be ashamed.Make sure to use the labs that are still Stanford operated. One is in the hospital itself and the other is in the Blake Wilbur building.

I had a 9am appointment and arrived about 5 minutes early.  The lady working said she was finishing up with another client and it would be just a few minutes.  Sure enough, a few minutes later we went over my paperwork, she made a copy of insurance info and inside I went.  The process was fairly efficient.  The waiting room is small and if there were people waiting it might have been annoying.  Since there is only one staffer I suppose it could get backed up, but if you make an appointment you should be fine.  The patient log didn't seem that full and it didn't seem like many people had to wait too long in the morning.

I'm surprised by the 2 negative reviews below. I've been at Labcorp several times since 2005 and found it quick and easy. I've been a patient at PAMF for 14 years and used to go to their lab, but after they moved to the building on El Camino in 1999 or 2000, I found the wait to average 45 min. for a phlebotomist, often with an attitude.  No way would I waste time waiting in their small basement room now.  Plus, I have a high-deductible health care plan and have to pay cash for my labs, so I actually save some money by getting my  labs done at Labcorp instead of PAMF. I've also had blood drawn at Stanford Hospital and had 2 negative experiences: the first time I walked out after waiting for 30 min. and listening to the phlebotomists argue over which tubes to use (speaking of incompetence...) and another time I was stabbed in the arm 4x by one person before someone competent replaced her and got blood from another vein.  In all the years of getting blood draws, that was the only time someone didn't get blood at the first stick (I have very accessible arm veins).  I ended up with an ugly hematoma for a few days where the incompetent Stanford lab person had stabbed me.

2500 Hospital DrBldg 11Mountain View, CA 94040


        (650) 968-8216
    






Popped in for some routine bloodwork today and things went pretty seamlessly. I arrived at 1:20pm and they were closed for lunch from 12:30pm-1:30pm, so I had to wait ten minutes, but that wasn't a big deal... when they returned I was up first, and it took me about two minutes to get 'checked in' and another two to get called back. In and out in twenty minutes, counting the ten I waited.

Most importantly, the phlebotomist was good with the needle, it barely hurt. All good.







LabCorp has two locations in Mountain View,  this location does not seem as busy as the one on Grant Road.  I was able to book a 9am appointment online the night before.    I showed up a few minutes early and was out of there by 9:12.   Nicky checked me in, then did the blood draw.   She is an excellent phlebotomist.    They take walk-ins but recommend making an appointment.







Was an OK experience. My doctor didn't make the lab orders particularly clear, so it took a long time for the phlebotomist to get everything coded into the computer. She was trying her best, but was unable to do some of the tests, even after being on the phone for 20-30 minutes. There really should be at least 2 people in here-- one doing the tests, one working at the front, etc. She was quick and efficient with the blood draw, but as others had mentioned, it didn't seem super clean. I prefer PAMF when I can go.







Nicky was really nice and if you get anxious about blood draws they have an area where you can lay down and get the blood drawn. This is the best location in the South Bay for blood draws.







I cannot say enough amazing things about this location. After a loyal Quest customer for 5 years, I decided to give labcorp a try out of my frustrations with quest. And boy, it's been such a pleasant change. 

Things I like about Labcorp-
1) walk in wait time no more than 10 minutes, usually lower (quest in contrast can take more than 2 hours at times)
2) no wait time if you have an appt (quest in contrast can take more than 30 mins)
3) lab results online within 4/5 business days (quest in contrast takes 30 days)
4) the staff greets you with a smile (all quest staff are grumpy and overworked in contrast)

I've been to this labcorp on weekdays and weekends. On the weekends a lady by the name of Marina Dubkin works here. Although my interactions with all staff at labcorp mtn view have been pleasant, Marina has been by far amazing. She goes an extra mile. She is willing to work over time (she was with me till 45 mins after close time today - much of it related to the fact I came in the nick of time and my physician kept changing her requests), and put up with erratic requests from my physicians (she added a lab order last minute to my list of tests after my physician wanted one more test added  -  mind you, all this was well over time). Also, her blood draw skills are superb. I never felt anything.  I wish she worked here everyday.  

To summarize- go to labcorp mtn view for your lab needs. And if you have a chance, go when Marina is working.







In and out in 5 mins. The front desk lady can be more welcoming but I'm here for blood work which the phlebologist handled well. On top of it all it was damn quick. Went in on Saturday morning at 8.







Saw Nicky today for my huge blood draw she was amazing, one of the best draws ever experienced. I get very scared and she was super compassionate and it was painless. Val was very helpful too with all my confusing paperwork. Def return here. Thank you for the great service.







Very very Slow service, if you do not have an appointment, it may take few hours to get a turn.

I have waited for more than 2.5 hours. Staff in this location is very slow in attending visitors.







It was terrible, seems like lab staff is not aware how to collect blood from child. My baby and wife was shocked. It is a first time we faced with such low skilled stuff in a laboratory.

Nicky was really nice and if you get anxious about blood draws they have an area where you can lay down and get the blood drawn. This is the best location in the South Bay for blood draws.

I cannot say enough amazing things about this location. After a loyal Quest customer for 5 years, I decided to give labcorp a try out of my frustrations with quest. And boy, it's been such a pleasant change. Things I like about Labcorp-1) walk in wait time no more than 10 minutes, usually lower (quest in contrast can take more than 2 hours at times)2) no wait time if you have an appt (quest in contrast can take more than 30 mins)3) lab results online within 4/5 business days (quest in contrast takes 30 days)4) the staff greets you with a smile (all quest staff are grumpy and overworked in contrast)I've been to this labcorp on weekdays and weekends. On the weekends a lady by the name of Marina Dubkin works here. Although my interactions with all staff at labcorp mtn view have been pleasant, Marina has been by far amazing. She goes an extra mile. She is willing to work over time (she was with me till 45 mins after close time today - much of it related to the fact I came in the nick of time and my physician kept changing her requests), and put up with erratic requests from my physicians (she added a lab order last minute to my list of tests after my physician wanted one more test added  -  mind you, all this was well over time). Also, her blood draw skills are superb. I never felt anything.  I wish she worked here everyday.  To summarize- go to labcorp mtn view for your lab needs. And if you have a chance, go when Marina is working.

In and out in 5 mins. The front desk lady can be more welcoming but I'm here for blood work which the phlebologist handled well. On top of it all it was damn quick. Went in on Saturday morning at 8.

Saw Nicky today for my huge blood draw she was amazing, one of the best draws ever experienced. I get very scared and she was super compassionate and it was painless. Val was very helpful too with all my confusing paperwork. Def return here. Thank you for the great service.

Very very Slow service, if you do not have an appointment, it may take few hours to get a turn.I have waited for more than 2.5 hours. Staff in this location is very slow in attending visitors.

It was terrible, seems like lab staff is not aware how to collect blood from child. My baby and wife was shocked. It is a first time we faced with such low skilled stuff in a laboratory.

Like several other reviewers, I came here for the employer wellness check -- a fasted blood test (aka kill me now). I had an 8:30am appointment, showed up around 8:15, and I was seen and back in my car before my original appointment time.

If that isn't impressive, I don't know what is.

The cherry on top was that my blood test actually was painless. Sometimes they say, "Now you're going to feel a little poke" and it's a brutal, insanely painful attack on your arm. Not this time. A+ to the woman who did my test. She was quick, friendly and efficient.







Easy to find, lots of parking and I had minimal wait.  As a walk in patient, I signed in and within 5 minutes, I was seen.  Clean facility, professional phlebotomists...an overall nice experience (as far as blood giving goes).  My advice: get there just when it opens.







I have always arrived here at 8 am (as soon as they open). Everything from billing to sample collection is fast and efficient as well as painless. Highly recommend this location.







Pretty terrible wait time if you come first thing in the morning, get ready to wait 45 minutes to an hour. They are not very nice either and are unable to clearly state how much they would expect me to pay!







Made an appointment on line for a Monday morning.  Came here & the doors were locked. Hardly anyone in the parking lot & thought they were closed; maybe a holiday or something.

After 10 minutes, someone from inside their office saw me standing outside came & unlocked the door.

Went to the correct suite where the lab was located. Small little hole-in-the-wall place that did not look much like a medical facility. No one else was there. When inquired about whether people were coming in, the gal at the desk said yes. Informed her that the doors were locked & couldn't get in, she said that "maybe someone accidentally locked doors while exiting". You can't "accidentally" lock  the doors b/c these doors open up automatically when you approach them & the switch to lock the doors is well above the average person's height.

The same person at the front desk doing the paperwork is the same person drawing the blood in the lab. The blood drawing room is one small, dingy room with one chair. It did not look very sanitary cleaned. The gal who drew my blood did not change gloves. She wore the same glove taking my paperwork & drawing my blood. 

Even though I was late for the appointment because I couldn't get in, there was no waiting. Got in & out of there in 5 minutes. 

No other issues encountered. 

Order blood tests & paid for them on-line thru Direct Labs. Got my results within 24 hours. Fast , quick and easy and reasonable as well. Glad I did not get the blood work done at the hospital or through QUEST Diagnostic (which is another story).







Went there the other day for a blood test. Things were smooth. The receptionist/nurse was really helpful and the procedure was painless. Finding out the place was a little difficult.







On the scale of fun, getting a blood test ranks pretty high... right next to having a car run over your foot or getting poked in the eye by a circus midget. So when my doctor said I should get a blood test, I could hardly contain my enthusiasm.

Though the LabCorp branch in Sunnyvale is closer to me, I went with the Mountain View branch because of its better reviews. The office is on the ground floor of a small medical complex. Parking was ample.

Making an appointment online can be helpful, but in my case I arrived at 9:37am without one and there was only one person ahead of me. At 10:05, I was asked to take a seat in the Chair of Fun, and in a few minutes the nurse was about to initiate the ritual blood sacrifice.

How much this process hurts depends largely on the skill of the person performing it. Sometimes the person will prick you a few times with the needle trying to find the vein; that's the worst. My nurse certainly knew her craft and put the needle in smoothly; it felt like nothing more than a pinch. And before I could say "hemoglobin" 50 times, the blood draw was over and she was putting gauze over my arm.

Alas, our blood test fun was too short. I can't wait till the next time my doctor says I need a blood test so I can come back to LabCorp Mountain View!







Same person doing the signup and blood draw, but given that there was nobody else in line, I don't see that as a problem. She changed gloves before the draw. Pretty painless.

I did have to wait about 10 minutes after my appointment time though.







The gal who took my blood was nice and very caring. I have a tendency to faint and she quickly moved me to a place to lie down and was nice about accommodating me. 

They were quick. We went in just before 4 pm and there was no wait which shocked me.







I was super nervous about coming here since some lab corps had really negative reviews. This place was awesome! Got there around 8:45am, waited about ten minutes, was in and out in a heartbeat.

The actual blood draw was smooth and the woman who drew my blood was so chill. I was wriggling and panicky but she is such a pro. I went in scared and left smiling because it was such a pleasant experience.







5 minutes or less and you're done. 

Benefits:
1. Nurse is a pro and has done blood draws so many times that it's near painless when she draws blood
2. Friendly staff
3. Quick and easy
4. Reiterate number 1







Worst experience! I was fasting, didn't take an appointment and I went there around 8:30am. I saw four people ahead of me, so I thought would make it by 9:10am. Only one person working, she takes care of insurance and goes to the lab and takes the test, on an average 15 mins per patient (no complaints about her, she is doing her best). After 2 patients, another comes from outside and says he has an appointment. So, no wait time for him, she immediately takes him.. I just couldn't take it, with this speed I'll not be done by 9:30am as well. Felt very bad and left. I cannot believe the fact that even Dr's appointment takes 5 mins and just for blood test, you have to wait for an hour..... there's huge flaw in the system.







This has become my go-to place for blood work. I've been on three separate occasions and have worked with two different technicians. I am a hard draw and really appreciated that the techs were adept and left me with no bruising. There was little to no wait each time. Plus, the blood draw room and adjacent bathroom (sample time!) were both well-organized and clean.







Good place to go for routine blood work.  I made an appointment.  I arrived about 10 minutes early and there was another person just finishing up.  After a very short wait it was my turn.  Process was simple and lab person was very good - couldn't feel anything when the needle went in.

This has become my go-to place for blood work. I've been on three separate occasions and have worked with two different technicians. I am a hard draw and really appreciated that the techs were adept and left me with no bruising. There was little to no wait each time. Plus, the blood draw room and adjacent bathroom (sample time!) were both well-organized and clean.

Good place to go for routine blood work.  I made an appointment.  I arrived about 10 minutes early and there was another person just finishing up.  After a very short wait it was my turn.  Process was simple and lab person was very good - couldn't feel anything when the needle went in.

        (408) 255-3064
    






Pleasant and professional.  Been here many times and they always do a good job drawing blood.  No pain, no bruising (but I do have easy veins).

I also like that I can get access to LabCorp test results online.







I have only been there a couple of times, the most recent one made me feel very bad. the assistant lady had a bad attitude toward me simply because I tried to check the sign-in sheet.







OMG. Run as far away from this place as you can. 

This is a shady, dingy corner off Prospect Road that has very unfriendly and aggressive staff. They first ask you to sign in and give them your credit card before they will even answer a simple question like whether they accept my insurance or not. When I showed them the doctors prescription and asked about the approximate out of pocket cost of the blood procedures, their best response was "First give us your credit card info, then we will draw blood, and then answer questions". Terrible way to treat a prospective customer. I bolted.







This is a very shady location for few reasons:

(1) The staff is not pleasant to deal with.
(2) They ask you for your credit card information which I've never had to give at my other labcorp locations.
(3) The building looks very old and the office looks very unorganized/unsanitary.
(4) I have really good veins but it took the guy 3 tries to find my veins. I never have this problem at other locations. I think Labcorp needs to train this location's staff all over.

I would avoid coming to this location if I were you.







The office is small, dingy, and disorganized. I felt awkward and uncomfortable getting a medical procedure preformed here... I waited 30 minutes after my appointment. How awkward! There was NO privacy for the patients whatsoever. Every patient waiting could hear everything said anywhere in the tiny office. We could quite plainly hear even the goings on of the restroom! When they collected a urine sample the bathroom was RIGHT NEXT TO the waiting room... How uncomfortable. The lab tech had no respect for privacy, although he was not an unkind man and though it's difficult to blame him in such a small, dingy office, there wasn't even an attempt at discretion.

They had to take a lot of very important blood samples, and they had a "order entry" error on the most important one, and didn't even preform he test in San Diego. They sent a notice to my doctor that they would contact me again about rescheduling an appointment, but I have yet to hear from them after 2 weeks. Granted, it is around the holidays, but this is MY LIFE.

I have no choice but to use LabCorp, but I will NEVER  return to this office if I can avoid it...







Current phlebotomist incorrectly didn't complete the paperwork and testing, used a large straight needle (looked like a 10 gauge) vs a smaller 20 something gauge and left me bruised and sore for a week.  Now I have to get stuck again so all of the doctor's tests are correctly drawn.   Obviously I'm driving to a different lab - first time shame on you; second time shame on me. :(







Small space and very slow. There is no point in making an appointment because they don't honor it. There were people waiting that didn't make an appointment and regardless of mine they all got to go before me. The staff was not friendly and did not communicate well with all the people waiting.







This place is extremely bad . I got there and they couldn't tell me if the except my insurance. It was stinky and dirty as well . Will never ever go back .,







I went here for my blood tests that my doctor ordered, what a filthy place. The bathroom was disgusting and I was not so sure about the hygiene of the people that worked there.







Although the wait can be long at times, the staff is always nice and professional.  Plus, they are good at what they do: draw blood.  I have been to places where it takes several pokes to get my vein, but this place always gets it on the first try.  i don't know if I've just been lucky, but the people who come here to get their blood drawn seem to be really nice too.  Getting blood tests is not what I would consider a "fun" activity, but this place comes close.

Pleasant and professional.  Been here many times and they always do a good job drawing blood.  No pain, no bruising (but I do have easy veins).I also like that I can get access to LabCorp test results online.

I have only been there a couple of times, the most recent one made me feel very bad. the assistant lady had a bad attitude toward me simply because I tried to check the sign-in sheet.

OMG. Run as far away from this place as you can. This is a shady, dingy corner off Prospect Road that has very unfriendly and aggressive staff. They first ask you to sign in and give them your credit card before they will even answer a simple question like whether they accept my insurance or not. When I showed them the doctors prescription and asked about the approximate out of pocket cost of the blood procedures, their best response was "First give us your credit card info, then we will draw blood, and then answer questions". Terrible way to treat a prospective customer. I bolted.

This is a very shady location for few reasons:(1) The staff is not pleasant to deal with.(2) They ask you for your credit card information which I've never had to give at my other labcorp locations.(3) The building looks very old and the office looks very unorganized/unsanitary.(4) I have really good veins but it took the guy 3 tries to find my veins. I never have this problem at other locations. I think Labcorp needs to train this location's staff all over.I would avoid coming to this location if I were you.

The office is small, dingy, and disorganized. I felt awkward and uncomfortable getting a medical procedure preformed here... I waited 30 minutes after my appointment. How awkward! There was NO privacy for the patients whatsoever. Every patient waiting could hear everything said anywhere in the tiny office. We could quite plainly hear even the goings on of the restroom! When they collected a urine sample the bathroom was RIGHT NEXT TO the waiting room... How uncomfortable. The lab tech had no respect for privacy, although he was not an unkind man and though it's difficult to blame him in such a small, dingy office, there wasn't even an attempt at discretion.They had to take a lot of very important blood samples, and they had a "order entry" error on the most important one, and didn't even preform he test in San Diego. They sent a notice to my doctor that they would contact me again about rescheduling an appointment, but I have yet to hear from them after 2 weeks. Granted, it is around the holidays, but this is MY LIFE.I have no choice but to use LabCorp, but I will NEVER  return to this office if I can avoid it...

Current phlebotomist incorrectly didn't complete the paperwork and testing, used a large straight needle (looked like a 10 gauge) vs a smaller 20 something gauge and left me bruised and sore for a week.  Now I have to get stuck again so all of the doctor's tests are correctly drawn.   Obviously I'm driving to a different lab - first time shame on you; second time shame on me. :(

Small space and very slow. There is no point in making an appointment because they don't honor it. There were people waiting that didn't make an appointment and regardless of mine they all got to go before me. The staff was not friendly and did not communicate well with all the people waiting.

I went here for my blood tests that my doctor ordered, what a filthy place. The bathroom was disgusting and I was not so sure about the hygiene of the people that worked there.

Although the wait can be long at times, the staff is always nice and professional.  Plus, they are good at what they do: draw blood.  I have been to places where it takes several pokes to get my vein, but this place always gets it on the first try.  i don't know if I've just been lucky, but the people who come here to get their blood drawn seem to be really nice too.  Getting blood tests is not what I would consider a "fun" activity, but this place comes close.

Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, more commonly known as LabCorp, is an American S&P 500 company headquartered in Burlington, North Carolina. It operates one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the world, with a United States network of 36 primary laboratories. Before a merger with National Health Laboratory in 1995, the company operated under the name Roche BioMedical. LabCorp performs its largest volume of specialty testing at its Center for Esoteric Testing in Burlington, North Carolina, where the company is headquartered.[2][3]
LabCorp was an early pioneer of genomic testing using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, at its Center for Molecular Biology and Pathology in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, where it also performs other molecular diagnostics. It also does oncology testing, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genotyping and phenotyping.[2][3]
LabCorp also operates the National Genetics Institute, Inc. (NGI) in Los Angeles, California which develops PCR testing methods.[4]
LabCorp's ViroMed facility, originally in Minnetonka, Minnesota until closing this site in 2013,[5] is now housed in Burlington, NC[6] and performs real-time PCR microbial testing using laboratory-developed assays.
LabCorp also provides testing in Puerto Rico and, outside the United States, in three Canadian provinces.[2]
LabCorp Utilizes 7 PA-31-350's and 1 PC-12 aircraft on nightly runs from Burlington, NC for use on the east coast.
LabCorp has been criticized for its practice of paying the salaries of genetic counselors in hospitals and doctors' offices, which is perceived to be a possible conflict of interest.[7]

History[edit]
Revlon[edit]
National Health Laboratories Incorporated began in 1978.[8] The company was a national blood and pathology laboratory owned by the Revlon Health Care Group, and managed by Michael E. Lillig for seven years. Lillig had earlier been with Becton, Dickinson and Company. At National Health Laboratories, Inc. he grew annual sales of the company each year by 43%, with revenue reaching $12 million by the end of his tenure. Lillig then left to found several health-care companies, including Syscor, Inc., Intelysis, Inc., Asterion, LLC and MetaCyte's 3DR in Louisville, Kentucky.[9]
National Health Laboratories, Inc.[edit]
In 1988, National Health Laboratories became publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange.[10] Revlon retained 24% ownership of the common shares,[10] for the next six years.[11] Revlon had been a publicly traded company since the 1950s, as it was during most of its ownership of National Health Laboratories. But in 1985, Revlon had been taken over by Ronald Perelman.
Through early 1995, the National Health Laboratories principal executive offices were located at 4225 Executive Square, Suite 805 in La Jolla, California.[12]
In 1989, the company generated revenue of about US$400 million, with about US$70 million in earnings.[13]
In 1990, the company's revenues reached US$500 million, with over US$70 million in earnings.[13] That year, the company began paying a cash dividend to shareholders.[11]
In 1991, National Health Laboratories moved from the NASDAQ OTC exchange to the New York Stock Exchange, where it began to trade under the new ticker symbol NH.[13] Up until that time the company had performed very well, including through the 1990-1991 recession. Its earnings peaked that year at almost US$90 million, and its stock price had risen from its low within the prior few years by several-fold.[11]
However, beginning in 1991 the company became embroiled in Operation "Labscam," a nationwide crackdown on fraud in the health-care system, initiated by the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Diego, California. The charges were that the company and others routinely submitted false claims to the government health-care agencies Medicare and Medicaid for unnecessary tests which physicians had never ordered. In 1992, National Health Laboratories became the first of the companies to be prosecuted in the government operation.[14]
In 1992, the company reported revenues of over US$720 million, however with earnings of only US$40 million. The small gain that year reflected a fourth quarter charge of US$80 million, which the company paid in a settlement agreement with state and federal governments related to the LABSCAM investigation.[15] The total payments made by National Health Laboratories in the settlement came to US$111 million that year,[16] and ultimately reached US$173 million.[14]
In 1993, revenues were up to US$761 million, with new peak earnings of nearly US$113 million.[15] By that time the company had 22 major laboratories.[17] The stock price reached a new all-time high in 1993, which became the peak for the next couple of years, and the company was added to the S&P MidCap 400 list.[11]
National Health Laboratories Holdings[edit]
On March 8, 1994 National Health Laboratories Inc. reorganized as a holding company, National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc.[12]
By 1994, MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc. then owned the Revlon Holdings Group's former 24 percent of National Health Laboratories Holdings.[17] That company was a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate, which had previously been taken over, along with Revlon, by Ronald Perelman in the 1980s.[16]
On May 4, 1994, National Health Laboratories announced that it would acquire Allied Clinical Laboratories, Inc. of Nashville, Tennessee,[16] reducing their takeover offer to $204 million after federal officials issued new subpoenas in an investigation of Medicare billing practices at Allied Clinical Laboratories Inc.[18] In 1993, Allied generated revenues of US$163 million. The former President and CEO of Allied Clinical, Haywood D. Cochrane, Jr., then became Vice Chairman of National Health Laboratories. In order to complete the cash transaction, the company discontinued paying its dividend at that time.[19]
By the end of 1994, the company had run into financial difficulty again, as it struggled through the economic soft landing that year. Its earnings dropped by over two-thirds, to only US$30 million. The stock never traded that year at more than half of its 1993 peak, and at its 1994 low, it was down by nearly two-thirds from the all-time high.[11]
Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings[edit]
On April 28, 1995 National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. merged with Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. and changed its name to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings. It began trading under its new ticker symbol LH.[20] Shareholders of National Health Laboratories received 0.72 shares of the new company, plus $5.60 in cash, for a 50.1 percent interest in the new company. At the time, James R. Maher was President and Chief Executive Officer of National Health Laboratories. Following the merger, Maher relinquished those positions, and instead became Chairman of the new company, succeeding the financier Ronald O. Perelman in that position. Perelman received about US$100 million from the deal, which made the new company the largest blood-testing company in the United States.[16][17]
The merged company created revenues of US$1.7 billion.[17] National Health Laboratories already held long-term debt of US$351 million.[11] Together with the Roche debt, the combined companies owed US$590 million prior to the merger. Another US$288 million was added to help finance the payout to shareholders.[16] By year-end 1995, the new company's total debt reached US$959 million.[11]
Roche Biomedical Laboratories had been created by and was a wholly owned subsidiary of Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., the American arm of the Swiss medical conglomerate, Roche Holding, Limited. Before 1982, the core of Roche Biomedical Laboratories had been Biomedical Reference Laboratories, which dated from the late 1960s, and was located in Burlington, North Carolina. That core company had become publicly traded in 1979. Hoffman-La Roche acquired it for US$163.5 million in 1982 and then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company that year as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical had become one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with US$600 million in sales.[21]
By 1993 Roche Biomedical Laboratories had revenues of US$712 million, with 17 major laboratories. Dr. James Powell was President of Roche Biomedical, and after the merger with National Health Laboratories he became President and CEO of the new company, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, which then relocated from La Jolla, California to the Roche Biomedical headquarters in Burlington, North Carolina. Hoffmann-La Roche also contributed US$186.7 million in cash to the deal, and retained 49.9 interest in the new merged company.[17]
By year-end 1995, the new Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings suffered a marginal loss of a few million dollars. The stock price dropped by almost half again through the year, to within 10% of its all-time low since going public a half dozen years earlier. By early the next year, it broke marginally below that level, and set a new all-time low.[11]
In July 1998, LabCorp acquired the Michigan-based laboratory division of Universal Standard Healthcare (UHCI). LabCorp also acquired an equity position in Universal Standard Healthcare and has become UHCI's clinical laboratory long-term testing provider[22] but terminated this agreement one year later.[23]
In June 2000, LabCorp completed the acquisition of San Diego-based Pathology Medical Laboratories for an undisclosed amount.[24]
In 2000, LabCorp generated revenues of US$1.9 billion with over 18,000 employees.[3]
In May 2001, LabCorp completed its acquisition of Path Lab Holdings Inc., the largest regional laboratory in New England,[25] and just a few weeks later the acquisition of Minneapolis-based ViroMed Inc., specialized on clinical diagnostic testing in virology, molecular biology, serology, microbiology, mycology and mycobacteriology, as well as in tissue/eye bank testing, for an undisclosed amount.[26]
In December 2001, LabCorp became the exclusive marketer for genomics and proteomics predictive cancer test products made by Myriad Genetics, Inc.[27]
In May 2002, LabCorp announced the acquisition of all outstanding Shares of Canadian medical laboratory services company Dynacare Inc. for $480 million in cash and own shares.[28]
In January 2003, LabCorp acquired all of the outstanding shares of Dianon, a provider of anatomical pathology and oncology testing]] services,[29] for $598 million in cash.[30]
In 2005, LabCorp's revenues totaled $3.3 billion; in 2006, revenues were $3.6 billion; and in 2007, revenues reached $4.1 billion.[31]
In March 2005, LabCorp announced the acquisition of all outstanding Shares of Esoterix, Inc., a leading provider of specialty reference testing, for approximately $150 million in cash from private equity firm Behrman Capital.[32]
In November 2006, LabCorp acquired Litholink Corporation, a kidney stone analysis laboratory.[2]

In June 2009, LabCorp acquired Monogram Biosciences, a diagnostic lab specializing in HIV resistance testing, headquartered in South San Francisco, CA, in a cash tender of $4.55 per share for approximately $155 million including debt.[34]
In May 2010, LabCorp acquired the assets of its Santa Ana, California-based rival Westcliff Medical Laboratory which had just filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy action in federal court.[35] The FTC challenged this acquisition[36] but lost in court.[37]
In September 2010, LabCorp announced the acquisition of Genzyme Genetics, formerly a division of Genzyme, with 9 testing laboratories and approximately 1900 employees, for $925 million in cash.[38]
In June 2011, LabCorp acquired their Canadian central labs partner Clearstone from investment firm Czura Thornton for an undisclosed amount, thus adding Clearstone's global network of central laboratories, including sites in China, France, Singapore and Canada, and the central laboratory protocol management system APOLLO CLPM to their portfolio.[39]
In November 2011, LabCorp completed the acquisition of more than 90% of the shares of DNA testing company Orchid Cellmark for $85 million but had to sell parts of Orchid's paternity business to DNA Diagnostics Center.[40]

Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, more commonly known as LabCorp, is an American S&P 500 company headquartered in Burlington, North Carolina. It operates one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the world, with a United States network of 36 primary laboratories. Before a merger with National Health Laboratory in 1995, the company operated under the name Roche BioMedical. LabCorp performs its largest volume of specialty testing at its Center for Esoteric Testing in Burlington, North Carolina, where the company is headquartered.[2][3]
LabCorp was an early pioneer of genomic testing using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, at its Center for Molecular Biology and Pathology in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, where it also performs other molecular diagnostics. It also does oncology testing, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genotyping and phenotyping.[2][3]
LabCorp also operates the National Genetics Institute, Inc. (NGI) in Los Angeles, California which develops PCR testing methods.[4]
LabCorp's ViroMed facility, originally in Minnetonka, Minnesota until closing this site in 2013,[5] is now housed in Burlington, NC[6] and performs real-time PCR microbial testing using laboratory-developed assays.
LabCorp also provides testing in Puerto Rico and, outside the United States, in three Canadian provinces.[2]
LabCorp Utilizes 7 PA-31-350's and 1 PC-12 aircraft on nightly runs from Burlington, NC for use on the east coast.
LabCorp has been criticized for its practice of paying the salaries of genetic counselors in hospitals and doctors' offices, which is perceived to be a possible conflict of interest.[7]

History[edit]
Revlon[edit]
National Health Laboratories Incorporated began in 1978.[8] The company was a national blood and pathology laboratory owned by the Revlon Health Care Group, and managed by Michael E. Lillig for seven years. Lillig had earlier been with Becton, Dickinson and Company. At National Health Laboratories, Inc. he grew annual sales of the company each year by 43%, with revenue reaching $12 million by the end of his tenure. Lillig then left to found several health-care companies, including Syscor, Inc., Intelysis, Inc., Asterion, LLC and MetaCyte's 3DR in Louisville, Kentucky.[9]
National Health Laboratories, Inc.[edit]
In 1988, National Health Laboratories became publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange.[10] Revlon retained 24% ownership of the common shares,[10] for the next six years.[11] Revlon had been a publicly traded company since the 1950s, as it was during most of its ownership of National Health Laboratories. But in 1985, Revlon had been taken over by Ronald Perelman.
Through early 1995, the National Health Laboratories principal executive offices were located at 4225 Executive Square, Suite 805 in La Jolla, California.[12]
In 1989, the company generated revenue of about US$400 million, with about US$70 million in earnings.[13]
In 1990, the company's revenues reached US$500 million, with over US$70 million in earnings.[13] That year, the company began paying a cash dividend to shareholders.[11]
In 1991, National Health Laboratories moved from the NASDAQ OTC exchange to the New York Stock Exchange, where it began to trade under the new ticker symbol NH.[13] Up until that time the company had performed very well, including through the 1990-1991 recession. Its earnings peaked that year at almost US$90 million, and its stock price had risen from its low within the prior few years by several-fold.[11]
However, beginning in 1991 the company became embroiled in Operation "Labscam," a nationwide crackdown on fraud in the health-care system, initiated by the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Diego, California. The charges were that the company and others routinely submitted false claims to the government health-care agencies Medicare and Medicaid for unnecessary tests which physicians had never ordered. In 1992, National Health Laboratories became the first of the companies to be prosecuted in the government operation.[14]
In 1992, the company reported revenues of over US$720 million, however with earnings of only US$40 million. The small gain that year reflected a fourth quarter charge of US$80 million, which the company paid in a settlement agreement with state and federal governments related to the LABSCAM investigation.[15] The total payments made by National Health Laboratories in the settlement came to US$111 million that year,[16] and ultimately reached US$173 million.[14]
In 1993, revenues were up to US$761 million, with new peak earnings of nearly US$113 million.[15] By that time the company had 22 major laboratories.[17] The stock price reached a new all-time high in 1993, which became the peak for the next couple of years, and the company was added to the S&P MidCap 400 list.[11]
National Health Laboratories Holdings[edit]
On March 8, 1994 National Health Laboratories Inc. reorganized as a holding company, National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc.[12]
By 1994, MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc. then owned the Revlon Holdings Group's former 24 percent of National Health Laboratories Holdings.[17] That company was a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate, which had previously been taken over, along with Revlon, by Ronald Perelman in the 1980s.[16]
On May 4, 1994, National Health Laboratories announced that it would acquire Allied Clinical Laboratories, Inc. of Nashville, Tennessee,[16] reducing their takeover offer to $204 million after federal officials issued new subpoenas in an investigation of Medicare billing practices at Allied Clinical Laboratories Inc.[18] In 1993, Allied generated revenues of US$163 million. The former President and CEO of Allied Clinical, Haywood D. Cochrane, Jr., then became Vice Chairman of National Health Laboratories. In order to complete the cash transaction, the company discontinued paying its dividend at that time.[19]
By the end of 1994, the company had run into financial difficulty again, as it struggled through the economic soft landing that year. Its earnings dropped by over two-thirds, to only US$30 million. The stock never traded that year at more than half of its 1993 peak, and at its 1994 low, it was down by nearly two-thirds from the all-time high.[11]
Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings[edit]
On April 28, 1995 National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. merged with Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. and changed its name to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings. It began trading under its new ticker symbol LH.[20] Shareholders of National Health Laboratories received 0.72 shares of the new company, plus $5.60 in cash, for a 50.1 percent interest in the new company. At the time, James R. Maher was President and Chief Executive Officer of National Health Laboratories. Following the merger, Maher relinquished those positions, and instead became Chairman of the new company, succeeding the financier Ronald O. Perelman in that position. Perelman received about US$100 million from the deal, which made the new company the largest blood-testing company in the United States.[16][17]
The merged company created revenues of US$1.7 billion.[17] National Health Laboratories already held long-term debt of US$351 million.[11] Together with the Roche debt, the combined companies owed US$590 million prior to the merger. Another US$288 million was added to help finance the payout to shareholders.[16] By year-end 1995, the new company's total debt reached US$959 million.[11]
Roche Biomedical Laboratories had been created by and was a wholly owned subsidiary of Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., the American arm of the Swiss medical conglomerate, Roche Holding, Limited. Before 1982, the core of Roche Biomedical Laboratories had been Biomedical Reference Laboratories, which dated from the late 1960s, and was located in Burlington, North Carolina. That core company had become publicly traded in 1979. Hoffman-La Roche acquired it for US$163.5 million in 1982 and then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company that year as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical had become one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with US$600 million in sales.[21]
By 1993 Roche Biomedical Laboratories had revenues of US$712 million, with 17 major laboratories. Dr. James Powell was President of Roche Biomedical, and after the merger with National Health Laboratories he became President and CEO of the new company, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, which then relocated from La Jolla, California to the Roche Biomedical headquarters in Burlington, North Carolina. Hoffmann-La Roche also contributed US$186.7 million in cash to the deal, and retained 49.9 interest in the new merged company.[17]
By year-end 1995, the new Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings suffered a marginal loss of a few million dollars. The stock price dropped by almost half again through the year, to within 10% of its all-time low since going public a half dozen years earlier. By early the next year, it broke marginally below that level, and set a new all-time low.[11]
In July 1998, LabCorp acquired the Michigan-based laboratory division of Universal Standard Healthcare (UHCI). LabCorp also acquired an equity position in Universal Standard Healthcare and has become UHCI's clinical laboratory long-term testing provider[22] but terminated this agreement one year later.[23]
In June 2000, LabCorp completed the acquisition of San Diego-based Pathology Medical Laboratories for an undisclosed amount.[24]
In 2000, LabCorp generated revenues of US$1.9 billion with over 18,000 employees.[3]
In May 2001, LabCorp completed its acquisition of Path Lab Holdings Inc., the largest regional laboratory in New England,[25] and just a few weeks later the acquisition of Minneapolis-based ViroMed Inc., specialized on clinical diagnostic testing in virology, molecular biology, serology, microbiology, mycology and mycobacteriology, as well as in tissue/eye bank testing, for an undisclosed amount.[26]
In December 2001, LabCorp became the exclusive marketer for genomics and proteomics predictive cancer test products made by Myriad Genetics, Inc.[27]
In May 2002, LabCorp announced the acquisition of all outstanding Shares of Canadian medical laboratory services company Dynacare Inc. for $480 million in cash and own shares.[28]
In January 2003, LabCorp acquired all of the outstanding shares of Dianon, a provider of anatomical pathology and oncology testing]] services,[29] for $598 million in cash.[30]
In 2005, LabCorp's revenues totaled $3.3 billion; in 2006, revenues were $3.6 billion; and in 2007, revenues reached $4.1 billion.[31]
In March 2005, LabCorp announced the acquisition of all outstanding Shares of Esoterix, Inc., a leading provider of specialty reference testing, for approximately $150 million in cash from private equity firm Behrman Capital.[32]
In November 2006, LabCorp acquired Litholink Corporation, a kidney stone analysis laboratory.[2]

In June 2009, LabCorp acquired Monogram Biosciences, a diagnostic lab specializing in HIV resistance testing, headquartered in South San Francisco, CA, in a cash tender of $4.55 per share for approximately $155 million including debt.[34]
In May 2010, LabCorp acquired the assets of its Santa Ana, California-based rival Westcliff Medical Laboratory which had just filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy action in federal court.[35] The FTC challenged this acquisition[36] but lost in court.[37]
In September 2010, LabCorp announced the acquisition of Genzyme Genetics, formerly a division of Genzyme, with 9 testing laboratories and approximately 1900 employees, for $925 million in cash.[38]
In June 2011, LabCorp acquired their Canadian central labs partner Clearstone from investment firm Czura Thornton for an undisclosed amount, thus adding Clearstone's global network of central laboratories, including sites in China, France, Singapore and Canada, and the central laboratory protocol management system APOLLO CLPM to their portfolio.[39]
In November 2011, LabCorp completed the acquisition of more than 90% of the shares of DNA testing company Orchid Cellmark for $85 million but had to sell parts of Orchid's paternity business to DNA Diagnostics Center.[40]
In May 2012, LabCorp Clinical Trials sold its European biological sampling kit building operation located in Hamburg to clinical supply chain solutions provider Marken.[41]

Before a merger with National Health Laboratory in 1995, the company operated under the name Roche BioMedical. LabCorp performs its largest volume of specialty testing at its Center for Esoteric Testing in Burlington, North Carolina, where the company is headquartered.[2][3]
LabCorp was an early pioneer of genomic testing using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, at its Center for Molecular Biology and Pathology in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, where it also performs other molecular diagnostics. It also does oncology testing, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genotyping and phenotyping.[2][3]
LabCorp also operates the National Genetics Institute, Inc. (NGI) in Los Angeles, California which develops PCR testing methods.[4]
LabCorp's ViroMed facility, originally in Minnetonka, Minnesota until closing this site in 2013,[5] is now housed in Burlington, NC[6] and performs real-time PCR microbial testing using laboratory-developed assays.
LabCorp also provides testing in Puerto Rico and, outside the United States, in three Canadian provinces.[2]
LabCorp Utilizes 7 PA-31-350's and 1 PC-12 aircraft on nightly runs from Burlington, NC for use on the east coast.
LabCorp has been criticized for its practice of paying the salaries of genetic counselors in hospitals and doctors' offices, which is perceived to be a possible conflict of interest.[7]

History[edit]
Revlon[edit]
National Health Laboratories Incorporated began in 1978.[8] The company was a national blood and pathology laboratory owned by the Revlon Health Care Group, and managed by Michael E. Lillig for seven years. Lillig had earlier been with Becton, Dickinson and Company. At National Health Laboratories, Inc. he grew annual sales of the company each year by 43%, with revenue reaching $12 million by the end of his tenure. Lillig then left to found several health-care companies, including Syscor, Inc., Intelysis, Inc., Asterion, LLC and MetaCyte's 3DR in Louisville, Kentucky.[9]
National Health Laboratories, Inc.[edit]
In 1988, National Health Laboratories became publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange.[10] Revlon retained 24% ownership of the common shares,[10] for the next six years.[11] Revlon had been a publicly traded company since the 1950s, as it was during most of its ownership of National Health Laboratories. But in 1985, Revlon had been taken over by Ronald Perelman.
Through early 1995, the National Health Laboratories principal executive offices were located at 4225 Executive Square, Suite 805 in La Jolla, California.[12]
In 1989, the company generated revenue of about US$400 million, with about US$70 million in earnings.[13]
In 1990, the company's revenues reached US$500 million, with over US$70 million in earnings.[13] That year, the company began paying a cash dividend to shareholders.[11]
In 1991, National Health Laboratories moved from the NASDAQ OTC exchange to the New York Stock Exchange, where it began to trade under the new ticker symbol NH.[13] Up until that time the company had performed very well, including through the 1990-1991 recession. Its earnings peaked that year at almost US$90 million, and its stock price had risen from its low within the prior few years by several-fold.[11]
However, beginning in 1991 the company became embroiled in Operation "Labscam," a nationwide crackdown on fraud in the health-care system, initiated by the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Diego, California. The charges were that the company and others routinely submitted false claims to the government health-care agencies Medicare and Medicaid for unnecessary tests which physicians had never ordered. In 1992, National Health Laboratories became the first of the companies to be prosecuted in the government operation.[14]
In 1992, the company reported revenues of over US$720 million, however with earnings of only US$40 million. The small gain that year reflected a fourth quarter charge of US$80 million, which the company paid in a settlement agreement with state and federal governments related to the LABSCAM investigation.[15] The total payments made by National Health Laboratories in the settlement came to US$111 million that year,[16] and ultimately reached US$173 million.[14]
In 1993, revenues were up to US$761 million, with new peak earnings of nearly US$113 million.[15] By that time the company had 22 major laboratories.[17] The stock price reached a new all-time high in 1993, which became the peak for the next couple of years, and the company was added to the S&P MidCap 400 list.[11]
National Health Laboratories Holdings[edit]
On March 8, 1994 National Health Laboratories Inc. reorganized as a holding company, National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc.[12]
By 1994, MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc. then owned the Revlon Holdings Group's former 24 percent of National Health Laboratories Holdings.[17] That company was a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate, which had previously been taken over, along with Revlon, by Ronald Perelman in the 1980s.[16]
On May 4, 1994, National Health Laboratories announced that it would acquire Allied Clinical Laboratories, Inc. of Nashville, Tennessee,[16] reducing their takeover offer to $204 million after federal officials issued new subpoenas in an investigation of Medicare billing practices at Allied Clinical Laboratories Inc.[18] In 1993, Allied generated revenues of US$163 million. The former President and CEO of Allied Clinical, Haywood D. Cochrane, Jr., then became Vice Chairman of National Health Laboratories. In order to complete the cash transaction, the company discontinued paying its dividend at that time.[19]
By the end of 1994, the company had run into financial difficulty again, as it struggled through the economic soft landing that year. Its earnings dropped by over two-thirds, to only US$30 million. The stock never traded that year at more than half of its 1993 peak, and at its 1994 low, it was down by nearly two-thirds from the all-time high.[11]
Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings[edit]
On April 28, 1995 National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. merged with Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. and changed its name to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings. It began trading under its new ticker symbol LH.[20] Shareholders of National Health Laboratories received 0.72 shares of the new company, plus $5.60 in cash, for a 50.1 percent interest in the new company. At the time, James R. Maher was President and Chief Executive Officer of National Health Laboratories. Following the merger, Maher relinquished those positions, and instead became Chairman of the new company, succeeding the financier Ronald O. Perelman in that position. Perelman received about US$100 million from the deal, which made the new company the largest blood-testing company in the United States.[16][17]
The merged company created revenues of US$1.7 billion.[17] National Health Laboratories already held long-term debt of US$351 million.[11] Together with the Roche debt, the combined companies owed US$590 million prior to the merger. Another US$288 million was added to help finance the payout to shareholders.[16] By year-end 1995, the new company's total debt reached US$959 million.[11]
Roche Biomedical Laboratories had been created by and was a wholly owned subsidiary of Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., the American arm of the Swiss medical conglomerate, Roche Holding, Limited. Before 1982, the core of Roche Biomedical Laboratories had been Biomedical Reference Laboratories, which dated from the late 1960s, and was located in Burlington, North Carolina. That core company had become publicly traded in 1979. Hoffman-La Roche acquired it for US$163.5 million in 1982 and then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company that year as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical had become one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with US$600 million in sales.[21]
By 1993 Roche Biomedical Laboratories had revenues of US$712 million, with 17 major laboratories. Dr. James Powell was President of Roche Biomedical, and after the merger with National Health Laboratories he became President and CEO of the new company, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, which then relocated from La Jolla, California to the Roche Biomedical headquarters in Burlington, North Carolina. Hoffmann-La Roche also contributed US$186.7 million in cash to the deal, and retained 49.9 interest in the new merged company.[17]
By year-end 1995, the new Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings suffered a marginal loss of a few million dollars. The stock price dropped by almost half again through the year, to within 10% of its all-time low since going public a half dozen years earlier. By early the next year, it broke marginally below that level, and set a new all-time low.[11]
In July 1998, LabCorp acquired the Michigan-based laboratory division of Universal Standard Healthcare (UHCI). LabCorp also acquired an equity position in Universal Standard Healthcare and has become UHCI's clinical laboratory long-term testing provider[22] but terminated this agreement one year later.[23]
In June 2000, LabCorp completed the acquisition of San Diego-based Pathology Medical Laboratories for an undisclosed amount.[24]
In 2000, LabCorp generated revenues of US$1.9 billion with over 18,000 employees.[3]
In May 2001, LabCorp completed its acquisition of Path Lab Holdings Inc., the largest regional laboratory in New England,[25] and just a few weeks later the acquisition of Minneapolis-based ViroMed Inc., specialized on clinical diagnostic testing in virology, molecular biology, serology, microbiology, mycology and mycobacteriology, as well as in tissue/eye bank testing, for an undisclosed amount.[26]
In December 2001, LabCorp became the exclusive marketer for genomics and proteomics predictive cancer test products made by Myriad Genetics, Inc.[27]
In May 2002, LabCorp announced the acquisition of all outstanding Shares of Canadian medical laboratory services company Dynacare Inc. for $480 million in cash and own shares.[28]
In January 2003, LabCorp acquired all of the outstanding shares of Dianon, a provider of anatomical pathology and oncology testing]] services,[29] for $598 million in cash.[30]
In 2005, LabCorp's revenues totaled $3.3 billion; in 2006, revenues were $3.6 billion; and in 2007, revenues reached $4.1 billion.[31]
In March 2005, LabCorp announced the acquisition of all outstanding Shares of Esoterix, Inc., a leading provider of specialty reference testing, for approximately $150 million in cash from private equity firm Behrman Capital.[32]

In June 2009, LabCorp acquired Monogram Biosciences, a diagnostic lab specializing in HIV resistance testing, headquartered in South San Francisco, CA, in a cash tender of $4.55 per share for approximately $155 million including debt.[34]
In May 2010, LabCorp acquired the assets of its Santa Ana, California-based rival Westcliff Medical Laboratory which had just filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy action in federal court.[35] The FTC challenged this acquisition[36] but lost in court.[37]
In September 2010, LabCorp announced the acquisition of Genzyme Genetics, formerly a division of Genzyme, with 9 testing laboratories and approximately 1900 employees, for $925 million in cash.[38]
In June 2011, LabCorp acquired their Canadian central labs partner Clearstone from investment firm Czura Thornton for an undisclosed amount, thus adding Clearstone's global network of central laboratories, including sites in China, France, Singapore and Canada, and the central laboratory protocol management system APOLLO CLPM to their portfolio.[39]
In November 2011, LabCorp completed the acquisition of more than 90% of the shares of DNA testing company Orchid Cellmark for $85 million but had to sell parts of Orchid's paternity business to DNA Diagnostics Center.[40]
In May 2012, LabCorp Clinical Trials sold its European biological sampling kit building operation located in Hamburg to clinical supply chain solutions provider Marken.[41]
