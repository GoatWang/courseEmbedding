Its marketed product portfolio is focused on applications for spine fusion surgery. Its product offering includes a minimally-disruptive surgical platform called Maximum Access Surgery (MAS). The MAS platform combines three categories of solutions that collectively minimize soft tissue disruption during spine fusion surgery, provide visualization and are designed to enable reproducible outcomes for the surgeon and the patient.

Form 13G is used when the filer owns between 5% and 20% of the company and plans to hold it only as a passive investor. If the filler intend to exert control and if the stake’s size exceeds 20%, then a 13D must be filed. Therefore, activist investors and practices such as: hostile takeovers, company breakups, and other “change of control” events, are not permitted by 13G filers.
