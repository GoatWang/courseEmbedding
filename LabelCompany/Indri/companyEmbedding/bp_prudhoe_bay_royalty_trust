Did Your Broker Recommend BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (BPT)? 


Soreide Law Group is currently investigating claims on behalf of clients whose brokers recommended a high concentration of BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty (BPT). Many of these investors were recommended by their brokers that they invest heavily in this oil stock. These investors watched as the price of crude oil plummeted along with their investments, and experienced devastating losses.
BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (BPT)



52-Week Change 
-40.36%






52 Week High
32.95


52 Week Low 
11.29



BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (BPT) operates as a grantor trust in the United States. The company holds overriding royalty interest comprising a non-operational interest in minerals in the Prudhoe Bay oil field located on the North Slope of Alaska.  BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust(BPT) was founded in 1989 and is based in Houston, Texas.
Shares of BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (BPT), which is a spin-off of BP, has fallen more than 67% over the past two years.
BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (BPT) pays out royalties based on production in Alaska’s North Slope, the state’s biggest oil field operated by BP Alaska. Weak revenues have hurt their bottom line and per-share earnings have fallen for the past two years.
The trust disclosed in February of 2016 that it expects to not pay royalties after 2020, based on the price of crude oil at the time.
If your broker or financial advisor recommended that you invest in the very volatile energy stock, BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (BPT), in your otherwise conservative portfolio and you experienced devastating losses, call for a no-cost consultation with an attorney on the possibility of recovering your losses at: 888-760-6552.

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group. Dominic M. • CLIENT5.0 Out of 5.0 Overall Superb Client Review RatingLawyers.com

Founded

Products

The BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust is a United States oil and natural gas royalty trust based in New York, New York. With a market capitalization of US$ 1.6 billion in early 2008, and an average trading volume of 121,000 shares, BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust is the largest conventional oil and gas trust in the United States. Its assets are in the huge Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, the largest oil field in North America, and at the end of 2006 the Trust claimed to have proved reserves of 85.1 million barrels of crude oil. As of the end of 2012 the Trust claimed to have proved reserves of 75.517 million barrels of crude oil.[2]
Standard Oil Company and BP Exploration, both now branches of British Petroleum, set up the trust on February 28, 1989. They distribute royalties on a portion of the oil produced from the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, typically 16.4246%[3] of the first 90,000 barrels of net daily production. In their 2011 Annual Report, the Trust estimated it would continue to make royalty payouts through at least the year 2027.[4]
Royalty trusts typically pay enormous dividends by Wall Street standards, making them popular with investors, particularly during times when the price of oil is high, or other market sectors are performing poorly. Investing advice firm Motley Fool listed the trust in the top four dividend payers of the decade from 1997 to 2007, giving a total return on investment during that time of 1,369%.[5] In early 2008, the Trust's quarterly dividend per share was $3.05, which equated to an annual payout of approximately 16%. It pays its dividend quarterly, unlike many of the royalty trusts, which pay monthly.[6] Unanticipated oilfield mishaps can occasionally cause volatility of the stock price, as happened in August 2006, when BP needed to shut down its operations at Prudhoe Bay to replace 22 miles (35 km) of corroded lines. The BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust sued BP over its poor maintenance practices and reached a settlement of $29,469,081. The shutdown only affected one dividend payment, which was subsequently made up for with the settlement.[7][8]

BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust Was Obliterated in March -- and It May Get Worse
Down 44% in March, this trust yielding 17% could be toxic for your portfolio. 











                Sean Williams
            

                (TMFUltraLong)



            
            Apr 4, 2016 at 1:05PM
            
            





Image source: BP.
What: Shares of BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (NYSE:BPT), a royalty interest trust in the Prudhoe Bay oil field located on the North Slope of Alaska, collapsed in March, with its share price plunging 44% according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. There appear to be three primary culprits for the tumble.
So what: First, BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust is dependent on rising crude oil prices to pay out its handsome and highly coveted cash distribution. But as we all know, crude prices have sunk by roughly two-thirds in less than two years, crushing the average per-barrel royalty that BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust would net by 63% between Q3 2011 and Q3 2015. All the while, its contractual costs are rising.

Second, in March BP (NYSE:BP) announced that it would be cutting production in the Prudhoe Bay region of Alaska to just two rigs from the current five, largely on account of persistently low crude oil prices. BP Prudhoe Bay's royalty interest allows the company to receive a royalty on up to 90,000 barrels a day, but it appears as if production in the region is about to be slashed, hurting its royalty-earning capacity. That's also bad news for investors who count on the cash distribution.
The final nail in the coffin came from the company's 10-K, which suggested that the Trust is on pace to fund cash distributions through 2020, but did not expect to pay out any distributions thereafter. Here's the pertinent information from BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust's 10-K:

Based on the 2015 twelve-month average WTI Price of $50.28 per barrel, current Production Taxes, and the Chargeable Costs adjusted as prescribed by the Overriding Royalty Conveyance, it is estimated that royalty payments to the Trust will continue through the year 2020, and would be zero in the following year. Therefore, no proved reserves are currently attributed to the BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust after that date. 

Now what: With an end to cash distributions in sight, we're simply witnessing investors not overpaying for future distributions, which is a smart move.






Royalty trusts can offer substantial yields that can lure in inexperienced investors who are chasing yield, but their distributions are based solely on their ability to control their costs and maintain production, all while their primary product, oil in this case, rises in price. Right now, we're seeing BP Prudhoe Bay's costs rise each and every year, as expected. Meanwhile, production is falling, crude prices remain weak, and an end may be in sight for the Trust. Keep in mind that when it discontinues paying cash distributions, its share price would be expected to head to $0.
What could BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust pay in cash distributions over the next five years? That depends on a number of factors, but the general consensus (that I happen to agree with) is that BP Prudhoe Bay is a huge gamble even after a nearly 50% haircut in a month. I'd suggest you avoid this mess altogether.

BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust Was Obliterated in March -- and It May Get Worse @themotleyfool #stocks $BP, $BPT




































BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust sell-off continuesHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreYahooSearchSearchSkip to NavigationSkip to Main ContentSkip to Related Content0BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust sell-off continuesTheflyonthewall.comAugust 29, 2012ReblogShareTweetShareBP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (BPT) is retreating for a third straight day following a Wall Street Journal report on Friday night that stated the royalty trust's market cap appears to be larger than the amount of cash it has available for distributions. In its last annual report, BP Prudhoe said that it had $1.4B available for distribution, according to The Journal’s Jason Zweig. Even after the stock declined for two days, the trust's market cap was still about $1.87B before the market opened today. Since royalty trusts can't acquire new assets, their yield tends to drop as the wells and mines in which they own stakes become depleted, causing the trusts to eventually disappear, The Journal explained on August 24. In late morning trading, BP Prudhoe sank $7.26, or 7.77%, to $86.20. The stock has declined over 27% so far this week. Whiting USA Trust I (WHX), another trust mentioned by Zweig, has also been in a downward trend.ReblogShareTweetSharePopular in the CommunityKristin Beck, transgender Navy SEAL hero: 'Let's meet face to face and you tell me I'm not worthy'3,863 reactions5%66%29%Discover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredWildfires force French Riviera evacuations14 reactions0%75%25%Trump: U.S. military won’t allow transgender people ‘to serve in any capacity’14,920 reactions9%69%22%These Sorority Sisters Did a ‘Melanin Illustrated’ Photo Shoot377 reactions7%65%28%A Penny-Crypto Miracle Making Some Americans RichAgora FinancialSponsoredVladimir Putin: The man, the spy, the president29 reactions4%66%30%Rick Perry gets duped by Russian pranksters15 reactions7%57%36%Luis Fonsi On Justin Bieber's Spanish, 'Despacito' Hitting No. 1516 reactions4%79%17%Women Everywhere Should Carry This Tiny DeviceSiren SongSponsoredA Senate vote to repeal Obamacare could rattle markets252 reactions2%66%32%Wasserman Schultz fires IT staffer following fraud arrest1,345 reactions2%70%28%7-Year-Old Runs to Neighbor For Help as Her 14-Year-Old Sister is Allegedly Being Raped: 'Senseless and Awful'2,986 reactions5%70%25%Start Earning Miles With The Best Travel CardWise BreadSponsoredMobile medical clinics deliver needed care in Virginia113 reactions7%75%18%At Ohio rally, Trump brags about how presidential he can be138 reactions9%68%23%How Hollywood Is Reacting to Donald Trump's Transgender Military Ban: 'Most Incompetent President Ever'Scott: Why not write an article about how everyday American's are reacting instead of just Hollywood?

					Full Description



BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust, incorporated on February 21, 1989, is a grantor trust. The property of the Trust consists of an overriding royalty interest (the Royalty Interest), and cash and cash equivalents held by the Trustee from time to time. The Royalty Interest entitles the Trust to a royalty on 16.4% of the lesser of the first 90,000 barrels of the average actual daily net production of crude oil and condensate per quarter from the working interest of BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. (BP Alaska) as of February 28, 1989 in the Prudhoe Bay oil field located on the North Slope in Alaska or the average actual daily net production of crude oil and condensate per quarter from that working interest. The Prudhoe Bay field is one of four contiguous North Slope oil fields that are operated by BP Alaska and are known collectively as the Prudhoe Bay Unit.The Royalty Interest is a non-operational interest in minerals. The Prudhoe Bay field is located on the North Slope of Alaska, 250 miles north of the Arctic Circle and 650 miles north of Anchorage. The Prudhoe Bay field extends approximately 12 miles by 27 miles. As of December 31, 2016, the Prudhoe Bay field contained approximately 150,000 gross productive acres. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 11.72 billion barrels of oil and condensate had been produced from the Prudhoe Bay field. The principal hydrocarbon accumulations at Prudhoe Bay are in the Ivishak sandstone of the Sadlerochit Group at a depth of 8,700 feet below sea level. The Ivishak is overlain by four minor reservoirs of varying extent which are designated the Put River, Eileen, Sag River and Shublik (PESS) formations. Underlying the Sadlerochit Group are the oil-bearing Lisburne and Endicott formations. The net production allocated to the Royalty Interest pertains only to the Ivishak and PESS formations, collectively known as the Prudhoe Bay (Permo-Triassic) Reservoir. The oil produced from the Prudhoe Bay (Permo-Triassic) Reservoir is a medium grade, low sulfur crude. The Royalty Interest is based upon oil produced from the oil rim and condensate produced from the gas cap, but not upon gas production or natural gas liquids production stripped from gas produced.

Did Your Broker Recommend BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust (BPT)? 


Soreide Law Group is currently investigating claims on behalf of clients whose brokers recommended a high concentration of BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty (BPT). Many of these investors were recommended by their brokers that they invest heavily in this oil stock. These investors watched as the price of crude oil plummeted along with their investments, and experienced devastating losses.

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group. Dominic M. • CLIENT5.0 Out of 5.0 Overall Superb Client Review RatingLawyers.com

The BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust is a United States oil and natural gas royalty trust based in New York, New York. With a market capitalization of US$ 1.6 billion in early 2008, and an average trading volume of 121,000 shares, BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust is the largest conventional oil and gas trust in the United States. Its assets are in the huge Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, the largest oil field in North America, and at the end of 2006 the Trust claimed to have proved reserves of 85.1 million barrels of crude oil. As of the end of 2012 the Trust claimed to have proved reserves of 75.517 million barrels of crude oil.[2]
Standard Oil Company and BP Exploration, both now branches of British Petroleum, set up the trust on February 28, 1989. They distribute royalties on a portion of the oil produced from the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, typically 16.4246%[3] of the first 90,000 barrels of net daily production. In their 2011 Annual Report, the Trust estimated it would continue to make royalty payouts through at least the year 2027.[4]
Royalty trusts typically pay enormous dividends by Wall Street standards, making them popular with investors, particularly during times when the price of oil is high, or other market sectors are performing poorly. Investing advice firm Motley Fool listed the trust in the top four dividend payers of the decade from 1997 to 2007, giving a total return on investment during that time of 1,369%.[5] In early 2008, the Trust's quarterly dividend per share was $3.05, which equated to an annual payout of approximately 16%. It pays its dividend quarterly, unlike many of the royalty trusts, which pay monthly.[6] Unanticipated oilfield mishaps can occasionally cause volatility of the stock price, as happened in August 2006, when BP needed to shut down its operations at Prudhoe Bay to replace 22 miles (35 km) of corroded lines. The BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust sued BP over its poor maintenance practices and reached a settlement of $29,469,081. The shutdown only affected one dividend payment, which was subsequently made up for with the settlement.[7][8]

Products
Oil and natural gas; royalty trust


The BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust is a United States oil and natural gas royalty trust based in New York, New York. With a market capitalization of US$ 1.6 billion in early 2008, and an average trading volume of 121,000 shares, BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust is the largest conventional oil and gas trust in the United States. Its assets are in the huge Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, the largest oil field in North America, and at the end of 2006 the Trust claimed to have proved reserves of 85.1 million barrels of crude oil. As of the end of 2012 the Trust claimed to have proved reserves of 75.517 million barrels of crude oil.[2]
Standard Oil Company and BP Exploration, both now branches of British Petroleum, set up the trust on February 28, 1989. They distribute royalties on a portion of the oil produced from the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, typically 16.4246%[3] of the first 90,000 barrels of net daily production. In their 2011 Annual Report, the Trust estimated it would continue to make royalty payouts through at least the year 2027.[4]
Royalty trusts typically pay enormous dividends by Wall Street standards, making them popular with investors, particularly during times when the price of oil is high, or other market sectors are performing poorly. Investing advice firm Motley Fool listed the trust in the top four dividend payers of the decade from 1997 to 2007, giving a total return on investment during that time of 1,369%.[5] In early 2008, the Trust's quarterly dividend per share was $3.05, which equated to an annual payout of approximately 16%. It pays its dividend quarterly, unlike many of the royalty trusts, which pay monthly.[6] Unanticipated oilfield mishaps can occasionally cause volatility of the stock price, as happened in August 2006, when BP needed to shut down its operations at Prudhoe Bay to replace 22 miles (35 km) of corroded lines. The BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust sued BP over its poor maintenance practices and reached a settlement of $29,469,081. The shutdown only affected one dividend payment, which was subsequently made up for with the settlement.[7][8]

Why royalties may be the best income investment on earth









Why Buy Royalties
In today’s investing landscape, investors are looking for new ways to insulate their money from unpredictable stock market fluctuations. This has led to a substantial rise in the popularity of alternative investments like royalties. Investing in royalties offers buyers the opportunity to purchase future royalty stream revenue generated by royalty assets.
At Royalty Exchange, you will now have access to purchase some of these alternative assets in an online marketplace:

Auctions
Royalty Exchange take royalty transactions out of the private, backroom deal and into the open marketplace through online public auctions. Every listing provides all the relevant rights and catalog information, financial data, media, and any other information needed to make a sound investment decision. 
Advances [beta]
Royalty Exchange’s Peer Advance platform allows you to provide advances with fixed rates and terms to royalty rightsholders, backed by their royalty income. It’s as close to a guaranteed return as you can get.

Steady Income
Royalties are generally stable investments, they pay consistent income every year. Each asset listing on our site will include historical financial data.


Longevity
Royalty streams last for the life of the copyright or patent. In many cases, with royalties generated from copyrights, those payments can last up to 75 years.


Diversification
Royalties from intellectual property, especially music royalties, are uncorrelated assets. Meaning they are not influenced by fluctuations in the stock market. This is a good way to stabilize the income your portfolio generates.


Potential Upside
Some royalties, especially in music, experience large spikes in revenue based on increased use. For example, when a song is used in a popular commercial, revenue spikes... or when a popular artist covers an older song, the owners of the copyright enjoy a major boost in royalty payments.








Why royalties could be the perfect income investment
Intellectual property assets with a strong track record of consistent earnings may be the perfect investment for those seeking income. Owners of intellectual property of any kind are paid every time their IP is used. They create an asset once, and then collect payment over and over again.
Imagine this… you’re a songwriter. You write a song for a film and this move becomes a classic; the type of film that people watch many times over a period of years. One of these films–even 20 years after its release date–still airs on TV nearly every week and is purchased or streamed on iTunes, Amazon Video, Netflix, and even on DVD.Every time one this film is bought, streamed, or aired on TV you get paid.
Billy Goodrum is one of these songwriters. He penned original music for the hit comedy Dumb and Dumber (1994), among others. Below, you can see that the royalties he earned from that movie increased at least 15% every year from 2011 through 2014, ultimately reaching a 12-month total of over $22,000 before he sold it in early 2015.


Royalties don't rust. They don't get sued by angry workers. And they don't require expensive tools or machinery to make money. Somebody creates it once and they make money for decades.
Until recently, you probably never had the opportunity to own income-producing intellectual property. That’s where Royalty Exchange comes in. We’re a marketplace where these types of royalty assets are bought and sold. We specialize in intellectual property with a documented track record of regular, consistent income.

Through our one-of-a-kind platform, investors can buy privately owned royalty rights directly from the artists, inventors and creators. In a world of negative interest rates, these income-generating royalty rights just might be the perfect investment.
To view all our current and past auctions, simply create a free account via the link below. The process takes less than 2 minutes, and you'll be able to explore all the fantastic income investments available across both Auctions and Advances.
