Becker, William C. Memorial Scholarship
The William C. Becker Memorial Scholarship was established in remembrance of William C. Becker, September 1, 1929 – July 14, 2003, by his wife, Judy. After his family, University of Akron School of Law Professor Emeritus Bill Becker loved his country, the legal profession, and teaching. He was a generous and selfless man who put the interests of the community and others ahead of his own. Professor Becker’s sense of duty, work ethic, and desire to give to the community were high and strong, as evidenced by his receipt of the Sir Thomas More Award in 2000, the Ohio State Bar Foundation Honorary Life Fellowship Award in 1999, and the United Way Person of the Year Award in 1983.
Following a career that encompassed service in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War; 20 years in the naval reserves; three years in private practice at the law firm of Squire, Sanders & Dempsey; 26 years with the BFGoodrich Company in the Law Department; and numerous volunteer activities, including bar counsel for the Akron Bar Association, vice chair of the State Bar Ethics Committee, and member of the Supreme Court of Ohio Task Force to consider revisions in the code of responsibility for the State of Ohio, Bill Becker embarked upon a second career, devoting his time, wisdom, and knowledge to law students at The University of Akron School of Law. Professor Becker taught Products Liability, Alternative Dispute Resolution, and Lawyer as Negotiator classes; held the position of Associate Dean of Students; and served as chair of the School of Law Admissions Committee. He was best known, however, for his work in the field of ethics and professional responsibility. He co-founded The Joseph G. Miller and William C. Becker Institute for Professional Responsibility and served as its first director.
Professor Becker loved the School of Law, and he loved the law students. The subject of legal ethics and professional responsibility was a “big deal” to Professor Becker. His simple and direct telephone greeting of “Becker!” or “Becker, here!” mirrored the way in which he considered, analyzed, and discussed issues of importance. Perhaps because his own education was interrupted by the War, Professor Becker had a special concern for evening law students and others who followed a non-traditional path to law school. The William C. Becker Memorial Scholarship pays tribute to the many ways Bill Becker — husband, father, grandfather, friend, colleague, teacher, Naval Officer, business executive, author, volunteer, community citizen — made a difference.
The purpose of The William C. Becker Memorial Scholarship is to provide assistance for a second-year evening law student enrolled in Professional Responsibility at The University of Akron School of Law. In awarding the scholarship, the faculty responsible for teaching Professional Responsibility will provide the School of Law Scholarship Committee three to five students who best exemplify the qualities and characteristics of Professor Becker, as noted above, and have a demonstrated interest/achievement in the field of ethics and professional responsibility. The School of Law Scholarship Committee will select The William C. Becker Memorial Scholar from the list of candidates based on financial need, with approval from the dean of The University of Akron School of Law.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Becker Inc carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
Becker Inc currently holds license 713248 (General Building Contractor), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Becker Inc



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Becker Inc



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.
Becker Inc has a $12,500 bond with American Contractors Indemnity Company. 











What else should I know before hiring Becker Inc



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
