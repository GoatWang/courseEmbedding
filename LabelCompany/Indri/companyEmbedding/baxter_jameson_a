Enteral & Oral Syringes


View Products


IV Preparation & Compounding

It takes spikes, syringes, and pumps to make an intravenous (IV) solution. A pharmacy workflow management system and automated compounding system can help streamline pharmacy operations. Though vastly different, these tools share a basic truth. Behind every IV dose there is a pharmacist and behind every pharmacist there is the means to not only make that dose, but also support pharmacy workflow. 
View Products


Parenteral Nutrition Solutions & Additives

One size does not fit all for nutrition therapy. Prescribing practices are as unique as patient populations, and pharmacies have varying levels of nutrition compounding capability and expertise.  Baxter's leading Parenteral Nutrition Portfolio offers pharmacy technology, premixes and a comprehensive selection of macro and micronutrients to support specific requirements.
