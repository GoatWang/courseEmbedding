We will receive up to $90,000 in proceeds from the sale of shares offered by us
under this prospectus. There is no assurance that we will be able to raise any
funds from this offering as we are conducting this offering on a “best-efforts”
basis. The proceeds we receive shall be used to pay for offering expenses
consisting of legal and accounting fees. The use of proceeds may include:
consulting services and hiring personnel or engaging in joint ventures with
other companies.

If all the shares being offered by the Company are sold, the gross proceeds from
this offering will be $90,000. The proceeds from this offering are expected to
be used in the priority set forth below after successful completion of this
offering:

Our Use of Proceeds is divided into four categories: Consulting Services,
Salaries and Wages, Other, and Reserve. Consulting Services are services
provided by Lawyers, Consultants, and Overseas Agencies. Salaries and Wages are
paid to our internal administrative staff. Other will consist of travel and
hotel expenses, communication expenses, and meals and entertainment. Reserves
are funds withheld for unexpected costs.

Other working capital will consist of travel expenses, communication expenses,
international calls, mobile, hotels, meal and entertainment.

There is no guarantee the Company will be able to sell the shares being offered
in this prospectus.


The education consulting business in China is rapidly evolving, highly
fragmented and competitive, and we expect competition in this sector to persist
and intensify. We face competition in each major program we offer and each
geographic market in which we operate. For example, we face competition for our
student services from Boya International Elite Company, which offers overseas
education programs for students from China. We face competition from the Study
Abroad Foundation for our institutional services, which offers advice on
attracting international students to universities. We face competition from the
First Abroad Organization for our educator placement services, which introduce
American teachers to China. Because we cover three major aspects of the
education service industry, we have several competitors in each of our areas of
service. However, we do not believe that we have competitors who integrate and
provide services to cover all three major targeted clients (students,
institutions and educators) like our business.

We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include
the following:

. provide one-stop integrated services to students, teachers, and institutions;

. brand recognition and reputation;

. a service model that aligns personalized services to the specific needs of     
  students and institutions;                                                     

. overall customer satisfaction;

. size and coverage of service network and proximity of services to customers;

. scope, quality and consistency of service.

Our key competitive strengths lie in our individualized attention to students,
its ability to place educators at top universities around the globe and in the
US, and its understanding of the globalization needs of top universities in
recruiting both international students and faculty in an ever evolving education
landscape. We provide a one-stop service to students, teachers, and
institutions. However, some of our existing and potential competitors may have
more resources than we do. These competitors may be able to devote greater
resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of their programs,
services and products and respond more quickly than we can to changes in student
demands, testing materials, admissions standards, market needs or new
technologies.
