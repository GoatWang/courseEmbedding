 White Paper 


















 
Discover what your |  can actually do.
 











Our purpose is to expose and measure the in-demand skills to thrive in today’s economy. 







EDUCATORSCredibly assess competency-based learning and workplace readiness







EMPLOYERSIdentify and develop talent for specific competencies







INDIVIDUALSTake responsibility for their own job readiness and demonstrate what they can doOur mission is to broaden opportunity, close skill gaps, and reduce organizational risk. 















Only the Competent Thrive.Industry leaders are looking for people who can communicate, creatively solve problems, and adapt to change.Breakthrough organizations are those best able to identify, cultivate, and optimize talent.Because untapped competency wastes human potential, restricts growth, and introduces risk. 
11%
of business leaders strongly agree graduating students have the skills and competencies that their businesses need.
Source: Gallup
But how do you know if they have the right skills? 











Multiple choice tests won’t tell you. Personality testsreveal suitability, but not competency. Job Ready. Not Test Ready.We don’t need to know how people test. We need to know what people can do—efficientlyand accurately—to fulfill our missions, grow ourbusinesses, and adapt to change. 















A New EconomyOur competitive, information-based economy requires employees who can think creatively, use evidence to support their solutions to complex problems, and communicate clearly in a variety of contexts. To understand if candidates or employees can do the work required, we need to see how they tackle complex, open-ended problems like those they will encounter on the job.Using sophisticated machine learning and data analytics,  Authess delivers this capability.

Authess Inc., a Boston company cofounded by an MIT professor that licenses educational assessment tools, has raised $675,000 in a seed round.
The company makes mobile and online assessment systems that better reflect a person’s abilities, instead of his or her ability to memorize information for a multiple-choice test, according to its website. Paul Crockett, the company’s chief executive and an alumnus of the education giant Pearson, said it would use the funds to keep developing products and to serve early adopters.
Chris Kaiser, a biology professor at MIT, cofounded the company, which completed a stint at the education-technology focused LearnLaunch Accelerator early this year. Sundar Subramaniam, an alumnus of the MIT Sloan School of Management, is another co-founder. The funding came from US investors and Manipal Global Education, an Indian company, Authess said Tuesday.

Authess Accepts Seed Venture Capital





















Tuesday, November 17, 2015 5:34:00 AM PDT | VentureDeal
   Boston, Massachusetts  --  Software technology company Authess has landed $675,000 in seed stage venture capital funding.

Authess says that it has a full technology solution that aims to reduce the "time and cost of developing performance-based assessment while increasing effectiveness."

The assessments promise to determine a learner's ability to apply his or her existing knowledge.

Manipal Global Education and other undisclosed investors made the investment.

The company said it would use the funding for product development and servicing its early customers.
