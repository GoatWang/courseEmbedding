AEterna Zentaris (AEZS) Stock: If You Don’t Own It You Might Want To Consider It!

InvestingBiotechBreaking News Jul 20, 2017 0 1290 












AEterna Zentaris Inc. (NASDAQ: AEZS) is having an overwhelmingly strong day in the market today, and for good reason. Not only has the FDA accepted a New Drug Application from the company, it is also the center of a key price target raise. All of this is leading to excitement among investors, causing gains in the stock and prompting our partners at Trade Ideas to alert us to the gains. At the moment (9:34), AEZS is trading at $2.81 per share after a gain of $0.47 per share (20.09%) thus far today.






AEZS Receives A Nod From The FDA
As mentioned above, AEterna Zentaris is having an incredibly strong day in the market today after the company received a favorable ruling from the United States Food and Drug Administration. News broke late yesterday that the FDA has accepted the company's New Drug Application for Macrilen. The decision with regard to whether or not the drug will be approved will likely be made by the PDUFA date of December 30th. In a statement, David Didd, CEO at AEZS, had the following to offer:
“We remain confident that the FDA will approve our NDA and, therefore, we are moving forward with our preparations to launch the product in the first quarter of 2018.”




Maxim Group Upgrade 
As if the FDA news wasn't good enough, AEZS also received great news from Maxim Group. The analyst firm increased the price target on the stock from $2.00 per share to $4.00 per share, maintaining their buy rating.
The FDA news was a big part of this upgrade. If Macrilen is approved for growth hormone deficiency in adults, the stock could see some incredible action, as the treatment will provide increased value. The analyst points out that the only test used for AGHD is an insulin tolerance test, but is very difficult to perform and comes with significant risks to the patient. However, Macrilen is a safer test and can be repeated with accuracy multiple times. As a result, the analyst believes that “Macrilen could become the new standard for addressing AGHD and rapidly adopted by physicians.”

What We'll Be Watching For Ahead
Moving forward, the CNA Finance team will be keeping a close eye on AEZS. In particular, we're interested in following the NDA to see of Macrilen is indeed approved. If so, it could become the goose that lays the golden egg for the company and its shareholders. Nonetheless, we'll continue to follow the story closely and bring the news to you as it breaks!

Aeterna Zentaris Forms Strategic Review Committee and Appoints 
      Michael Ward as CEO






July 20, 2017 05:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHARLESTON, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aeterna 
      Zentaris Inc. (NASDAQ: AEZS) (TSX: AEZS) (the “Company”), announced 
      today that it has formed a special committee of independent directors 
      (the “Strategic Review Committee”) to consider and evaluate various 
      strategic and financing alternatives available to the Company to 
      maximize shareholder value, including continuing to execute on its 
      existing business plan and/or considering and recommending changes to 
      the Company’s management and governance. The Strategic Review Committee 
      will be chaired by Carolyn Egbert, and includes Michael Cardiff. The 
      Strategic Review Committee is in the course of engaging a financial 
      advisor to assist with this process. On July 18, the Company announced 
      that it has been notified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
      (“FDA”), that the Company’s New Drug Application (“NDA”) seeking 
      approval of Macrilen™ (macimorelin) for the evaluation of growth hormone 
      deficiency in adults (“AGHD”) has been accepted as a complete response 
      to the FDA’s November 5, 2014 Complete Response Letter and granted a 
      PDUFA date of December 30, 2017. The Company has reached an important 
      point in its evolution and wishes to conduct a strategic review of its 
      plans, resources and opportunities, in order to best position itself to 
      maximize stakeholder value.
    


      David A. Dodd has ceased to be the Company’s President and CEO with 
      immediate effect. The board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) 
      has appointed Michael Ward as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.
    

      Mr. Ward has over thirty years of executive and legal experience in the 
      healthcare, pharmaceutical and technology industries. Most recently, Mr. 
      Ward served as Chief Compliance & Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary 
      for Sagent Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:SGNT), a global specialty generic 
      pharmaceutical company, and led its sale to Nichi-Iko Pharmaceutical 
      Co., Ltd. for $736 million. Mr. Ward has served as Strategic Advisor to 
      Benevolent Capital Partners for the last five years and is currently a 
      Partner with Outside GC LLC. Prior to Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Mr. Ward

About MacrilenTM (macimorelin)


      Macimorelin, a ghrelin agonist, is an orally-active small molecule that 
      stimulates the secretion of growth hormone. Macimorelin has been granted 
      orphan drug designation by the FDA for diagnosis of AGHD. The Company 
      owns the worldwide rights to this patented compound and has significant 
      patent protection left. The Company’s U.S. composition of matter patent 
      expires in 2022 and its U.S. utility patent runs through 2027. The 
      Company proposes, subject to FDA approval, to market macimorelin under 
      the tradename Macrilen™.
    

About AGHD


      AGHD affects approximately 75,000 adults across the U.S., Canada and 
      Europe. Growth hormone not only plays an important role in growth from 
      childhood to adulthood, but also helps promote a hormonally-balanced 
      health status. AGHD mostly results from damage to the pituitary gland. 
      It is usually characterized by a reduction in bone mineral density, lean 
      body mass, exercise capacity, and overall quality of life as well as an 
      increase of cardiovascular risks.

      This press release contains forward-looking statements made pursuant to 
      the safe harbor provision of the U.S. Securities Litigation Reform Act 
      of 1995, which reflect our current expectations regarding future events. 
      Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to 
      statements preceded by, followed by, or that include the words 
      “expects,” “believes,” “intends,” “anticipates,” and similar terms that 
      relate to future events, performance, or our results. Forward-looking 
      statements involve known risks and uncertainties, many of which are 
      discussed under the caption “Key Information – Risk Factors” in our most 
      recent Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the relevant Canadian 
      securities regulatory authorities in lieu of an annual information form 
      and with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Such 
      statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the 
      progress of our research, development and clinical trials and the timing 
      of, and prospects for, regulatory approval and commercialization of our 
      product candidates, the timing of expected results of our studies, 
      anticipated results of these studies, statements about the status of our 
      efforts to establish a commercial operation and to obtain the right to 
      promote or sell products that we did not develop and estimates regarding 
      our capital requirements and our needs for, and our ability to obtain, 
      additional financing. Known and unknown risks and uncertainties could 
      cause our actual results to differ materially from those in 
      forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among 
      others, the availability of funds and resources to pursue our research 
      and development projects and clinical trials, the successful and timely 
      completion of clinical studies, the risk that safety and efficacy data 
      from any of our Phase 3 trials may not coincide with the data analyses 
      from previously reported Phase 1 and/or Phase 2 clinical trials, the 
      rejection or non-acceptance of any new drug application by one or more 
      regulatory authorities and, more generally, uncertainties related to the 
      regulatory process (including whether or not the regulatory authorities 
      will definitively accept the Company’s conclusions regarding Macrilen™ 
      and approve its registration following the Company’s re-submission of an 
      NDA for the product as described elsewhere in this press release), the 
      ability of the Company to efficiently commercialize one or more of its 
      products or product candidates, the degree of market acceptance once our 
      products are approved for commercialization, our ability to take 
      advantage of business opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry, our 
      ability to protect our intellectual property, and the potential of 
      liability arising from shareholder lawsuits and general changes in 
      economic conditions. Investors should consult the Company’s quarterly 
      and annual filings with the Canadian securities commissions and the SEC 
      for additional information on risks and uncertainties. Given these 
      uncertainties and risk factors, readers are cautioned not to place undue 
      reliance on these forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligation 
      to update any such factors or to publicly announce any revisions to any 
      of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future 
      results, events or developments, unless required to do so by a 
      governmental authority or applicable law.

AEterna Zentaris's stock more than doubles on heavy volume after favorable FDA ruling
Shares of AEterna Zentaris Inc.  more than doubled on heavy volume in afternoon trade Wednesday, after the biotechnology company received a favorable ruling by regulators regarding its treatment for growth hormone deficiency in adults, Macrilen. Volume exploded to 38.9 million shares in recent trade, compared with the full-day average of about 260,000 shares. The company said late Tuesday that the Food and Drug Administration accepted the new drug application (NDA) seeking approval of Macrilen as a "complete response." The FDA granted a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of Dec. 30. "We remain confident that the FDA will approve our NDA and, therefore, we are moving forward with our preparations to launch the product in the first quarter of 2018," said Chief Executive David Dodd. The stock has still lost 30% year to date, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  has climbed 20% and the S&P 500  has gained 10%. The FDA had issued a "complete response letter" (CRL) on Nov. 5, 2014 saying it couldn't approve the NDA in its present form because the clinical trial didn't by itself support the indication. The stock closed at a split-adjusted $129.00 the day before the CRL was announced.

AEterna's stock plunges toward record low after cancer treatment fails in Phase 3 trial
Shares of AEterna Zentaris Inc.  plummeted 57% Monday toward a record low, after the biopharmaceutical company reported disappointing trials results for its cancer treatment. The company said a Phase 3 trial of Zoptrex, a treatment for women with metastatic endometrial cancer, did not meet its primary endpoint of an increase in survival. "Based on this outcome, we do not anticipate conducting clinical trials of Zoptrex™ with respect to any other indications," said Chief Executive David Dodd. He said the company's focus has "shifted entirely" to filing a new drug application for Macrilen to treat adult growth hormone deficiency, which is expected to be submitted in the third quarter of 2017. The stock had lost 6.9% year to date through Friday, while the S&P 500  had gained 6.5%.

CHARLESTON, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE) February 13, 2017 --Aeterna Zentaris Inc. (NASDAQ: AEZS) (TSX: AEZ) (the “Company”) today announced that, following a comprehensive review of data obtained from the confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial of Macrilen™ (macimorelin) for the evaluation of growth hormone deficiency in adults (“AGHD”), using the insulin tolerance test (the “ITT”) as a comparator, it concluded that Macrilen™ demonstrated performance supportive of achieving registration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). The FDA has agreed to consider the Company’s conclusions during a Type A meeting, which is currently being scheduled.
Following a comprehensive analysis of the data from the confirmatory trial, the Company concluded as follows:
Macrilen™ stimulates the pituitary gland to produce growth hormone more effectively than the ITT; in approximately 80% of all patients, measured growth hormone levels following the administration of Macrilen™ were equal to or higher than the growth hormone levels produced by the ITT;
The Macrilen™ test performed well in the study:
Sensitivity (87%) and specificity (96%) of the Macrilen™ test were satisfactory;
Data of the previous study (82% sensitivity, 92% specificity) could be reproduced;
The co-primary endpoint “negative agreement” with the ITT, which is considered as the more relevant endpoint, was met, demonstrating that the Macrilen™ test provides medical benefit;
The co-primary endpoint “positive agreement” with the ITT was not met;
In the repeatability part of the study, conducted upon request of the European Medicines Agency, Macrilen™ results proved to be highly reproducible:
94% reproducibility (32 out of 34 cases at the cut-off point defined in the study protocol);
Reproducibility of the ITT, which was not investigated in this study, appears worse than the Macrilen™ test as demonstrated by a high number of non-evaluable ITTs in the study;
Study results can be further optimized by modulation of the pre-defined cut-off point of 2.8 ng/mL:
Any cut-off point for Macrilen™ between 4.6 ng/mL and 8.6 ng/mL would have resulted in a positive study outcome in that both protocol-defined co-primary endpoints would have been met; and
The dose of Macrilen™ used in the study was adequate and appropriate.
Commenting on the Company’s review of the data, Dr. Richard Sachse, the Company’s Chief Scientific Officer, stated, “Macrilen™ stimulated the pituitary gland more powerfully than the ITT and demonstrated good specificity and sensitivity in this study, thus reproducing the results of our previous study. In our confirmatory study, we demonstrated that Macrilen™ achieves a high degree of correlation with the ITT, which could be further optimized when a higher cut-off point, such as the ITT cut-off point, is used for the Macrilen™ test. We believe that such an increased cut-off point would be justified by the more powerful stimulation of MacrilenTM as compared to the ITT. We look forward to having a discussion with the regulatory authorities regarding our conclusions and hope that they will concur with us. The ITT is inconvenient for patients and physicians and contraindicated in certain patients, such as patients with coronary heart disease or seizure disorder, requiring the patient to experience hypoglycemia to obtain a result. Patients and physicians need and deserve a better option than the ITT.”
David A. Dodd, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company stated, “We are delighted to report these successful and impressive results following a comprehensive analysis of the data from our confirmatory trial. We look forward to upcoming discussions with the FDA and, hopefully, to the subsequent registration and commercialization of Macrilen™ in the U.S., providing a much needed new option and alternative to the ITT.”
About the Study
The confirmatory Phase 3 clinical study of Macrilen™, entitled Confirmatory validation of oral macimorelin as a growth hormone (GH) stimulation test (ST) for the diagnosis of adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) in comparison with the insulin tolerance test (ITT), was designed as a two-way crossover study with the ITT as the benchmark comparator and involved some 26 sites in the U.S. and Europe. The trial involved 157 subjects, of whom 140 completed two evaluable tests for AGHD using both Macrilen™ and the ITT. Thirty-four of the patients were evaluated using Macrilen™ a second time to measure the repeatability of the result obtained using Macrilen™ as the evaluation method. The study population consisted of 115 patients who were suspected of having AGHD as a result of the presence of one or more symptoms or risk factors. This segment of the population included a range of patients from those considered at low risk of having AGHD to those considered at high risk. The study population also included 25 healthy subjects, who had no risk of having AGHD. Under the study protocol, the evaluation of AGHD with Macrilen™ will be considered successful, if the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (or lower bound of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval) for the primary efficacy variables is 75% or higher for “percent negative agreement,” and 70% or higher for the “percent positive agreement.” Based on meetings with the FDA as well as the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and subsequent written scientific advice, the Company believes that the study meets the FDA’s and the EMA’s study-design expectations allowing U.S. and European approval, if successful. Dr. Jose M. Garcia, MD, PhD, an Associate Professor of Medicine at the Puget Sound VA Hospital and the University of Washington in Seattle, was the principal investigator of the confirmatory Phase 3 clinical trial. More details about the trial are available at the following link: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02558829?term=macimorelin&rank=1.
About Macrilen (macimorelin)
Macimorelin, a ghrelin agonist, is an orally-active small molecule that stimulates the secretion of growth hormone. Macimorelin has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for diagnosis of AGHD. The Company owns the worldwide rights to this patented compound and has significant patent protection left. The Company’s U.S. composition of matter patent expires in 2022 and its U.S. utility patent runs through 2027. The Company proposes, subject to FDA approval, to market macimorelin under the tradename Macrilen™.
About AGHD
AGHD affects approximately 75,000 adults across the U.S., Canada and Europe. Growth hormone not only plays an important role in growth from childhood to adulthood, but also helps promote a hormonally-balanced health status. AGHD mostly results from damage to the pituitary gland. It is usually characterized by a reduction in bone mineral density, lean body mass, exercise capacity, and overall quality of life as well as an increase of cardiovascular risks.

					Full Description



Aeterna Zentaris Inc., incorporated on October 12, 1990, is a specialty biopharmaceutical company engaged in developing and commercializing treatments in oncology, endocrinology and women's health. The Company operates through the biopharmaceutical segment. The Company is engaged in drug development activities and in the promotion of products for others. The Company's principal product candidates are Zoptrex (zoptarelin doxorubicin) and Macrilen (macimorelin) in oncology and endocrinology. The Company focuses on its product candidates Zoptrex and Macrilen, which are in Phase III clinical development, and on a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)-disorazol Z conjugate (AEZS-138), which is in pre-clinical development in oncology and is available for partnering. The Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries include AEZS GmbH, Zentaris IVF GmbH and Aeterna Zentaris, Inc.ZoptrexZoptrex represents a targeting concept in oncology using a hybrid molecule composed of a synthetic peptide carrier, zoptarelin, and a chemotherapy agent, doxorubicin, resulting in a cytotoxic conjugate. Zoptrex is an intravenous drug that is considered to direct the chemotherapy agent specifically to LHRH-receptor expressing tumors. The Company is conducting a Phase III clinical study of Zoptrex in women with recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer who have progressed and who have received a chemotherapeutic regimen with platinum and taxane (either as adjuvant or first-line treatment). The clinical study is known as the ZoptEC study (zoptarelin doxorubicin in endometrial cancer). ZoptEC is a fully-recruited (over 500 patients), open-label, randomized-controlled study, comparing the safety of Zoptrex to doxorubicin alone. The Company is attempting to commercialize Zoptrex as a treatment for endometrial cancer.MacrilenMacrilen is an orally available peptidomimetic ghrelin receptor agonist that stimulates the secretion of growth hormone by binding to the ghrelin receptor (GHSR-1a) and that has uses in both endocrinology and oncology indications. Macrilen has been granted orphan-drug designation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in evaluating growth hormone deficiency (GHD).
