Our Story
Why Choose Bay Mountain Capital
Welcome to Bay Mountain Capital – your source for both capital and real estate expertise. We’re a direct lender that provides financing to real estate investors that is easy to obtain and quick to close. Our principals here have extensive experience in all facets of real estate, so we can frequently add value to your investment decision making process.
Bay Mountain Capital has been making loans since 2009, and since then we’ve made loans on more than 1500 residential and commercial properties. We fill an important niche for real estate professionals who, for any of a number of different reasons, do not have the time, credit or capability of using bank financing. Our loans are based primarily on the completed value of your property, including any proposed improvements, which generally allows for higher leverage than a bank could offer.
We lend on many different property types and situations and are active primarily in the major markets of Texas. About half of our business is focused on non-owner-occupied single family homes. The rest of our business is for a variety of multi-family and commercial properties, including retail, office and other income producing assets. Our funds are used for a variety of purposes including acquisition and renovation, bridge to a refinance or sale, or even cash out on an investment property.
Borrowing from Bay Mountain Capital is a fast and easy process. We use a simple, common sense approach and we get your deal closed as quickly and efficiently as possible.
We believe that our depth of knowledge and experience allows us to understand the keys drivers of value. At Bay Mountain Capital, we are dedicated to being more than just a lender – we are your partner and together we will make your real estate transaction a success.
