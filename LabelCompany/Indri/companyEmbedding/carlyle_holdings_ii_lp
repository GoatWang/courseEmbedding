(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Carlyle Group L.P. (the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership formed on July 18, 2011. Pursuant to a reorganization into a holding partnership structure, the Partnership became a holding partnership and its sole material assets are equity interests through wholly owned subsidiary entities representing partnership units in Carlyle Holdings I L.P., Carlyle Holdings II L.P. and Carlyle Holdings III L.P. (collectively," Carlyle Holdings") that the Partnership acquired using proceeds from the Partnership's initial public offering on May 8, 2012. Beginning on May 8, 2012, through wholly owned subsidiary entities, the Partnership is the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings and operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Carlyle Holdings and, through Carlyle Holdings and its subsidiaries, continues to conduct the business now conducted by these subsidiaries. Carlyle Group Management L.L.C. is the general partner of the Partnership. On May 2, 2012, our senior Carlyle professionals, the California Public Employees' Retirement System ("CalPERS"), and entities affiliated with Mubadala Development Company, the Abu-Dhabi based strategic development and investment company ("Mubadala") contributed all of their interests in the Parent Entities, and our senior Carlyle professionals and other individuals engaged in our business contributed a portion of the equity interests they owned in the general partners of our existing carry funds, to Carlyle Holdings in exchange for an aggregate of 274,000,000 Carlyle Holdings partnership units. Carlyle Holdings did not conduct any activity prior to May 2, 2012. As the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings, the Partnership consolidates the financial position and results of operations of Carlyle Holdings into its financial statements, and the ownership interests of the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships are reflected as a non-controlling interest in the Partnership's financial statements. The historical combined and consolidated financial statements of TC Group, L.L.C., TC Group Cayman, L.P., TC Group Investment Holdings, L.P. and TC Group Cayman Investment Holdings, L.P., as well as their majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, "Carlyle Group"), reflect the predecessor financial statements of the Partnership, and are based on the historical ownership interests of the senior Carlyle professionals, CalPERS, and Mubadala in Carlyle Group. The following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of the Partnership and, for periods prior to May 8, 2012, the financial condition and results of operations of Carlyle Group, the predecessor of the Partnership. Such analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Partnership's final prospectus dated May 2, 2012, included in the Partnership's Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended (SEC File No. 333-176685). For ease of reference, we refer to the historical financial results of Carlyle Group as being "our" historical financial results. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to "we", "us", "our", and "the Partnership" are intended to mean the business and operations of the Partnership since May 8, 2012. When used in the historical context (i.e., prior to May 8, 2012), these terms are intended to mean the business and operations of Carlyle Group. Overview We conduct our operations through four reportable segments: Corporate Private Equity, Global Market Strategies, Real Assets and Investment Solutions (formerly referred to as Solutions).   Corporate Private Equity - Our Corporate Private Equity segment advises our 22 buyout and 9 growth capital funds, which seek a wide variety of investments of different sizes and growth potentials. As of December 31, 2014, our Corporate Private Equity segment had approximately $65 billion in AUM and approximately $40 billion in Fee-earning AUM. Global Market Strategies - Our Global Market Strategies segment advises a group of 69 funds that pursue investment opportunities across structured credit, distressed debt, corporate and energy mezzanine debt, middle-market and senior debt, as well as credit, emerging markets and commodities-focused hedge funds and a mutual fund. As of December 31, 2014, our Global Market Strategies segment had approximately $37 billion in AUM and approximately $34 billion in Fee-earning AUM. Real Assets - Our Real Assets segment advises our nine U.S. and internationally focused real estate funds, our infrastructure fund, our two power funds, our international energy fund, as well as our five Legacy Energy funds (funds that we jointly advise with Riverstone). The segment also includes seven NGP management fee funds and three carry funds advised by NGP. As of December 31, 2014, our Real Assets segment had approximately $42 billion in AUM and approximately $28 billion in Fee-earning AUM.   Investment Solutions - Our Investment Solutions segment advises a global private equity fund of funds program and related co-investment and secondary activities across 101 fund of funds vehicles. On July 1, 2011, we acquired a 60% interest in AlpInvest; on August 1, 2013 we acquired the remaining 40% equity interest in AlpInvest. On November 1, 2013, we acquired Metropolitan Real Estate Equity Management, LLC ("Metropolitan"), one of the largest managers of indirect investments in global real estate, which manages 26 fund of funds vehicles. Additionally, on February 3, 2014, we acquired Diversified Global Asset Management Corporation ("DGAM"), a global manager of fund of hedge funds vehicles, which manages 15 fund of funds vehicles. As of December 31, 2014, our Investment Solutions segment had approximately $51 billion in AUM and approximately $33 billion billion in Fee-earning AUM.  We earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements with the investment funds that we manage and fees for transaction advisory and oversight services provided to portfolio companies of these funds. We also typically receive a performance fee from an investment fund, which may be either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income, which we refer to as a carried interest, in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"), we are required to consolidate some of the investment funds that we advise. However, for segment reporting purposes, we present revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates these investment funds. Accordingly, our segment revenues primarily consist of fund management and related advisory fees, performance fees (consisting of incentive fees and carried interest allocations), investment income, including realized and unrealized gains on our investments in our funds and other trading securities, as well as interest and other income. Our segment expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits expenses, including salaries, bonuses, performance payment arrangements, and equity-based compensation excluding awards granted in our initial public offering or in connection with acquisitions and strategic investments, and general and administrative expenses. Refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the differences between our financial results reported pursuant to U.S. GAAP and our financial results for segment reporting purposes. Trends Affecting our Business  We believe that on an annual basis, our diversified, multi-product global platform, which invests across numerous industries, asset classes and geographies generally enhances the stability of our management fee revenues and distributable earnings and decreases our exposure to a negative event associated with any specific fund, investment or vintage. However, our results of operations, particularly our quarterly results, are affected by a variety of factors including global economic, market and financial conditions, particularly in the United States, Europe and Asia. In general, a climate of reasonable interest rates and high levels of liquidity in the debt and equity capital markets provide a positive environment for us to generate attractive investment returns in our carry funds, but periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets can present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future revenue growth. For our hedge funds, opportunities to generate revenue depend on their respective investment strategies, certain of which may benefit from higher market volatility. These strategies include, but are not limited to, low levels of correlation in equity and debt markets, differences in market prices versus fundamental value and opportunities to profit from trading inefficiencies.  During 2014, the general economic climate started the year weaker, but by the second half of the year, the U.S. macroeconomic outlook improved with gross domestic product growth averaging nearly 4% at an annualized rate. This acceleration in growth helped to offset the 2.1% contraction in the first quarter of 2014 and bring GDP growth for the year to roughly 2.5%. Economic strength in the second half of the year contributed to an 11% increase in the S&P 500 index for the year. Stock markets outside of the U.S. were generally weaker in 2014, with the EuroStoxx index up by 3%, the MSCI ex-U.S. index down by 5.7% and the MSCI Emerging index down by 3.5%. The U.S. dollar strengthened against almost all other currencies in 2014, with gains of 14% versus the Japanese yen and the Euro and 2% versus the Chinese yuan renminbi. On a trade-weighted basis, the U.S. dollar rose by 9% for 2014. The increase in the value of the U.S. dollar likely will depress the foreign earnings of U.S. businesses, which could cause asset prices to decline or valuation ratios to increase further. While this may pressure the U.S. dollar values of our assets and portfolio outside the United States, we also expect it to create opportunities for our funds to invest in assets at more reasonable prices than have been available over the past several years.  In October 2014, the Federal Reserve ended its large scale asset purchase program and has signaled its intention to raise interest rates during 2015, depending on the results of incoming economic data during the year. Despite the expected increase in policy rates, market-based interest rates generally declined in 2014, with the 10-year yield falling from 3% at the end of 2013 to just 1.8% in early 2015. Yields on 10-year German and Japanese government debt fell to 0.48% and 0.27%, respectively, by January 2015. The decline in interest rates has been partially due to increased monetary accommodation in Japan and the expectation that the European Central Bank will launch an asset purchase program in the first quarter of 2015.  Some of the considerations informing our strategic decisions include:   Our ability to grow our fee-earning AUM. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we raised more than $24 billion of new capital commitments across our fund platform. Although the time required to raise a fund remains lengthened relative to historical years prior to the recession and the environment is competitive, our fundraising levels exceeded expectations in 2014 during which several of our larger funds were in the market. If our fundraising levels decline, this decline also will impact our fee-earning AUM. Our fee-earning AUM declined from $140 billion in 2013 to $136 billion in 2014, primarily due to large distributions from our funds stemming from significant exit activity. During 2015, we expect that much of our fundraising will come from mid-size funds and we will continue to sell remaining investments in many of the older, larger buyout funds, which may make it difficult to grow fee-earning AUM. In our open-ended funds, to the extent we face significant investor redemptions that are not replaced with subscriptions, our fee-earning AUM would be adversely impacted. Effective January 1, 2015, we had $2.2 billion net redemptions in our GMS hedge fund operations. Furthermore, from time to time, we may raise funds or managed accounts where we take fees on invested capital rather than on committed capital so we will not earn any fees from such commitments until we make an investment. As of December 31, 2014, we also had $9.4 billion of newly raised capital for which we have not yet commenced charging management fees. To the extent we fail to grow our fee-earning AUM, our management fee revenues also will be adversely impacted.   Our ability to offer and market differentiated products that engage new fund investors. Our ability to attract new capital and investors in our funds is driven, in part, by the extent to which they continue to see the alternative asset management industry generally, and our investment products specifically, as an attractive vehicle for capital appreciation. We continually seek to create avenues to meet our investors' evolving needs and broaden the appeal of our investment products by offering an expansive range of investment funds, developing new products and creating managed accounts and other investment vehicles tailored to our investors' goals. One area of recent attention has been the expansion of access to our products for a new base of individual fund investors, including through the launch of a mutual fund. We utilize both external strategies, including the use of feeder funds and other registered investment products, and our internal team of LP relations professionals to reach out to and expand our investor base. We have dedicated and expect to continue to dedicate significant resources to maintain our existing relationships, further develop external avenues to reach investors and support our LP relations personnel, which could increase our fundraising costs.   Our successful deployment of capital. Our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon our ability to deploy successfully the capital that our investors have committed to our investment funds. Greater competition, high valuations, cost of credit and other general market conditions may impact our ability to identify and execute attractive investments. Because we maintain a disciplined investment approach and analyze each carry fund transaction based on our ability to achieve our targeted returns while taking on a reasonable level of risk, we will not deploy our capital until we have sourced a suitable investment opportunity at an attractive price. We have a long-term investment horizon and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year. During 2014, we invested approximately $10 billion in new and existing investments in our carry funds. Over the past five years, we have invested an average of more than $9 billion a year in new and existing investments in our carry funds. As of December 31, 2014, we had capital available for investment through our carry funds of $41 billion.   Our ability to generate strong absolute and risk adjusted returns. The strength of our investment performance affects investors' willingness to commit capital to our funds. The capital we are able to attract is one of the main drivers of the growth of our AUM and the management fees we earn. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we realized proceeds of approximately $20 billion for our carry fund investors. Our decision to realize carry considers such factors as the level of embedded valuation gains, the portion of the fund invested, the portion of the fund returned to limited partner investors, and the length of time the fund has been in carry, as well as other qualitative measures. The valuation of our carry fund portfolio increased 15% overall during 2014 with a 23% increase in our Corporate Private Equity segment, a 20% increase in our Global Market Strategies segment and a 2% decline in our Real Assets segment. The decline in Real Assets was primarily driven by depreciation in funds in our energy platform in late 2014, but was partially mitigated by the lower economics of our interests in the performance fees from our Legacy Energy funds as opposed to the enhanced economics we hold in funds in our broadened energy and natural resources platform. We believe that this broadened platform will provide significant opportunities for future returns on our investment as we seek to deploy significant capital into the sector at current attractive values. Given increased competition for investments, and the effect, particularly in Europe and Asia, of the rising dollar against foreign currencies, the internal rates of return we are able to generate may be lower than our historical rates, but we continue to follow our core investment tenets and disciplined approach to make investments where we believe we can create value and achieve appreciation.  Recent Transactions  On February 18, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-2, Consolidation (Topic 820):  Key Financial Measures  Management fees attributable to Carlyle Partners VI, L.P. ("CP VI"), our sixth U.S. buyout fund with approximately $12.0 billion of Fee-earning AUM as of December 31, 2014, were approximately 14% of total management fees recognized . . .

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Carlyle Group L.P. (the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership formed on July 18, 2011. The Partnership is a holding partnership and its sole material assets are equity interests through wholly owned subsidiary entities representing partnership units in Carlyle Holdings I L.P., Carlyle Holdings II L.P. and Carlyle Holdings III L.P. (collectively," Carlyle Holdings"). Through wholly owned subsidiary entities, the Partnership is the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings and operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Carlyle Holdings and, through Carlyle Holdings and its subsidiaries, continues to conduct the business now conducted by these subsidiaries. Carlyle Group Management L.L.C. is the general partner of the Partnership. As the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings, the Partnership consolidates the financial position and results of operations of Carlyle Holdings into its financial statements, and the ownership interests of the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships are reflected as a non-controlling interest in the Partnership's financial statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview We conduct our operations through four reportable segments: Corporate Private Equity, Real Assets, Global Market Strategies, and Investment Solutions.   Corporate Private Equity - Our Corporate Private Equity segment advises our 20 buyout and 10 growth capital funds, which seek a wide variety of investments of different sizes and growth potentials. As of December 31, 2016, our Corporate Private Equity segment had approximately $51 billion in AUM and approximately $36 billion in Fee-earning AUM. Real Assets - Our Real Assets segment advises our ten U.S. and internationally focused real estate funds, our infrastructure fund, our two power funds, our international energy fund, as well as our four Legacy Energy funds (funds that we jointly advise with Riverstone). The segment also includes five NGP management fee funds and three carry funds advised by NGP. As of December 31, 2016, our Real Assets segment had approximately $34 billion in AUM and approximately $27 billion in Fee-earning AUM. Global Market Strategies - Our Global Market Strategies segment advises a group of 57 funds that pursue investment opportunities across structured credit, distressed debt, corporate and energy mezzanine debt, middle-market and senior debt. As of December 31, 2016, our Global Market Strategies segment had approximately $29 billion in AUM and approximately $24 billion in Fee-earning AUM. Investment Solutions - Our Investment Solutions segment advises global private equity and real estate fund of funds programs and related co-investment and secondary activities across 168 fund vehicles. As of December 31, 2016, our Investment Solutions segment had approximately $43 billion in AUM and approximately $27 billion in Fee-earning AUM.  We earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements with the investment funds that we manage and fees for transaction advisory and oversight services provided to portfolio companies of these funds. We also typically receive a performance fee from an investment fund, which may be either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income, which we refer to as a carried interest, in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"), we are required to consolidate some of the investment funds that we advise. However, for segment reporting purposes, we present revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates these investment funds. Accordingly, our segment revenues primarily consist of fund management and related advisory fees, performance fees (consisting of incentive fees and carried interest allocations), investment income, including realized and unrealized gains on our investments in our funds and other trading securities, as well as interest and other income. Our segment expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits expenses, including salaries, bonuses, performance payment arrangements, and equity-based compensation excluding awards granted in our initial public offering or in connection with acquisitions and strategic investments, and general and administrative expenses. While our segment expenses include depreciation and interest expense, our segment expenses exclude acquisition-related charges and amortization of intangibles and impairment. Refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the differences between our financial results reported pursuant to U.S. GAAP and our financial results for segment reporting purposes.  Trends Affecting our Business  During 2016, intensifying over the second half of the year and into 2017, significant events in the global political landscape, including the results of the U.S. Presidential election, the vote on the "Brexit" referendum in the United Kingdom and the populist movement more broadly, have introduced macroeconomic and political risks that are difficult to quantify and could have far-reaching implications for the United States and global economy. These events meaningfully increased the uncertainty surrounding the probable future direction of interest rates, inflation, foreign exchange rates, trade volumes and fiscal and monetary policy. As a result, the evolution of the global economy and regional economies is increasingly difficult to predict and there is a smaller margin of error for economic misjudgments by market participants.  Uncertainty also persists regarding global regulation, trade agreements and taxation, particularly in the United States where the new administration has suggested or proposed changes to existing regulations, some of which could have a material impact on personal and corporate tax rates and tax deductions. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the effects on trade and taxation as a result of the Brexit vote remain unclear, but are likely to constrain significant investment until there is clarity around these issues. In Europe, increased focus on tax receipts and policy for local companies and multi-national corporations could have a substantial impact on investment structuring and domicile decisions. While few details have been finalized regarding potential tax reform, we continue to evaluate our fund, investment and partnership organizational structures in light of these potential changes in the regulatory and tax landscape.  In addition to increasing uncertainty, the general rebound in commodities prices during 2016 had far-reaching effects as the rebound caused inflationary pressures to re-emerge across the global economy. While this rebound in commodities prices, including those in oil and industrial metals, generally has benefited our energy and other commodities-related investments, both the actual increase in inflation and the perception and expectation of continuing increased inflation led to an increase in U.S. Treasury yields in the second half of 2016. The U.S. Federal Reserve raised its target for short-term interest rates by 25 basis points in December 2016, which followed a similar rate hike in December 2015. Rising rates also put upward pressure on property yields (cap rates), which depressed the market value of some categories of real estate in the latter part of 2016. While our U.S. real estate business invests a majority of its capital in assets with more sensitivity to demographic changes than to fluctuations in interest rates, it is possible that valuations for certain types of real estate investments such as commercial real estate and multifamily housing, could be negatively impacted if interest rates or inflation increase from current levels.  During 2016, we were able to take advantage of strong asset prices by exiting many investments at attractive prices, which resulted in favorable returns for our fund investors. Looking forward into 2017, however, we believe that there is some risk that larger fiscal deficits in the U.S. or accelerating inflation tied to rising commodity prices may force the Federal Reserve to raise rates at a faster pace than currently expected by the futures markets. As a result, higher interest rates could depress valuations of private equity assets, real estate and net asset values of fixed income products, and potentially could increase the cost of financing for acquisition transactions. In addition, when the Federal Reserve increases interest rates at the same time as major central banks in the rest of the world are on hold or are easing monetary policy, the U.S. dollar is likely to appreciate relative to a basket of non-U.S. currencies. Since 2013, the U.S. dollar has appreciated by 30% on a trade-weighted basis.  The rising U.S. dollar has benefited some of our existing fund investments, but has created operational headwinds and increased risks in certain portfolio companies. For example, a strong dollar has enhanced margins at certain globally-focused portfolio companies that generate significant revenue in dollars, but whose cost structures are primarily denominated in a non-dollar currency. In contrast, a strong dollar has had a negative effect on certain U.S.-based portfolio companies that are large exporters because it reduces the domestic value of their foreign sales and earnings. A rising dollar also increases the default risk of dollar-denominated bonds issued by companies outside of the U.S. Across our buyout funds in Europe and Asia, several of our portfolio companies have issued dollar-denominated bonds, though none have defaulted on their debt obligations.  Since the U.S. election in early November 2016, global stocks have risen more than 7%, on average, alongside an approximate 70 basis point increase in 5- and 10-year Treasury yields. Taking advantage of the strong financial market conditions in the period before and after the U.S. election, we were able to sell several portfolio companies on beneficial terms in 2016 and realized $29.6 billion for our carry fund investors during the year. We also liquidated a large portion of the public portfolio in our CPE, Real Assets and GMS carry funds at attractive prices over the course of the year, which decreased the portion of remaining fair value held in public securities to 17% as of December 31, 2016, from 26% as of December 31, 2015. As we had a record year in overall exits and returned $30 billion in realized proceeds to our carry fund investors in 2016, we anticipate that our level of exit activity may decline in 2017 as compared to 2016, which could affect the amount of distributable earnings available for distributions to our unitholders in 2017.  Buoyed by strong equity markets and an active M&A environment, our largest carry funds appreciated significantly in 2016. Our latest vintage U.S. buyout and Asia buyout funds appreciated by 29% and 31%, respectively, and our opportunistic U.S. real estate funds collectively appreciated by 21%. The increase in oil prices had a positive effect on the latest fund sponsored by NGP, which also had exceptional performance during the year. While CPE funds currently generate a large percentage of our performance fees, we believe that over time our other business units will meaningfully contribute to our performance fees and earnings and we will decrease our reliance on these funds.  The same trends that bolster asset prices of our existing portfolio companies and foster attractive exit opportunities, can also create headwinds for investment activity due to high valuation multiples and rising interest rates that may increase the cost of financing if not offset by higher growth opportunities. Despite these conditions, during 2016 we were able to identify and close on many investments with strong underlying business fundamentals that met our strategic objectives and investment criteria and which we believe also have the potential to generate attractive returns for our fund investors. We made many of these investments in demographic driven industries such as consumer and healthcare, though our total mix of investments continues to span a diverse set of asset classes, industries and geographies. In 2016, we put $17.9 billion in capital to work through our carry funds, an increase over the $14.0 billion we invested in 2015. Although interest rates for corporate borrowing in the United States continued to rise modestly during the year, we were often able to obtain financing on better terms than were originally anticipated due primarily to the strong underlying fundamentals of the investments we made.  We expect that 2017 will be a transition year for our funds since many of our largest funds-in-carry have been harvesting their assets over the past few quarters and, during 2017, we expect that they will be in the final stages of selling down their portfolios. As a result, our net accrued carry balance has declined from $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2014, to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2016. During 2017, we will seek to continue to invest capital through our current generation of large funds, including CP VI, CEP IV, CAP IV and CRP, as well as NGP X, to the generate strong returns that will facilitate the replenishment of our accrued carry balance. At the same time as we are completing the investment cycle for several of our large buyout funds, we will continue to work diligently to create value in the remaining investments in the portfolio and to move these funds (as well as others) into carry positions. While we continue to invest in new transactions and monetize our existing portfolio and create value for our investors, during 2017 another significant element of the transition will be our increased focus on fundraising for the next generation of our large buyout funds and several of our Real Assets funds, as well as for new fund strategies. In 2016, we commenced a four-year fundraising cycle (the pace of which we expect will accelerate through 2019) during which we are targeting to raise approximately $100 billion in new capital commitments. Our ability to raise these funds and replenish our dry powder and the timing of such raises, will depend on our pace of capital deployment and the performance of our investments. At different parts of this fundraising cycle, some of our largest funds may overlap in terms of raising capital for their next generation of funds, which could impact our financial performance in various ways. For example, as we are raising these new funds, the current generation of our funds will continue to realize existing investments and as a result, we could see a further reduction in our Fee-Earning AUM until fees on these new funds are activated. We also expect to see an increase in fundraising costs associated with these new capital commitments which will impact our earnings as we generally expense fundraising costs upon raising new capital.  Recent Transactions  its founders. This transaction closed on January 31, 2017. See Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.  Key Financial Measures  Performance Fees. Performance fees consist principally of the performance-based capital allocation from fund limited partners to us, commonly referred to as carried interest, from certain of our investment funds, which we refer to as the "carry funds." Carried interest revenue, which historically has comprised over 80% of all performance fees in our consolidated financial statements, is recognized by Carlyle upon appreciation of the valuation of our funds' investments above certain return hurdles as set forth in each respective partnership agreement and is based on the amount that would be due to us pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were liquidated at such date. Accordingly, the amount of carried interest recognized as performance fees reflects our share of the fair value gains and losses of the associated funds' underlying investments measured at their then-current fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period. As a result, the performance fees earned in an applicable reporting period are not indicative of any future period, as fair values are based on conditions prevalent as of the reporting date. Refer to " - Trends Affecting our Business" for further discussion.   $124.8 million from Carlyle Partners V, L.P. ("CP V") (with total AUM of approximately $5.0 billion at December 31, 2016), and $89.4 million from Carlyle Realty Partners VII, L.P. ("CRP VII") (with total AUM of approximately $4.5 billion at December 31, 2016).  Performance fees in excess of 10% of the total for the year ended December 31, 2015 were generated primarily from the following funds:  below certain return hurdles, previously recognized performance fees are reversed. In all cases, each investment fund is considered separately in evaluating carried interest and potential giveback obligations. For any given period, performance fee revenue on our statement of operations may include reversals of previously recognized performance fees due to a decrease in the value of a particular fund that results in a decrease of cumulative performance fees earned to date. Since fund return hurdles are cumulative, previously recognized performance fees also may be reversed in a period of appreciation that is lower than the particular fund's hurdle rate. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, the reversals of performance fees were $109.6 million, $253.4 million, and $255.4 million, respectively. Additionally, unrealized performance fees reverse when performance fees are realized, and unrealized performance fees can be negative if the amount of realized performance fees exceed total performance fees generated in the period. As of December 31, 2016, accrued performance fees and accrued giveback obligations were approximately $2.5 billion and $160.8 million, respectively, after amounts eliminated related to the Consolidated Funds. Each balance assumes a hypothetical liquidation of the funds' investments at December 31, 2016 at their then current fair values. These assets and liabilities will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the fair values of the fund investments until they are realized. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $102.3 million of the accrued giveback obligation is the responsibility of various current and former senior Carlyle professionals and other limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships, and the net accrued giveback obligation attributable to Carlyle Holdings is $58.5 million. The Partnership uses "net accrued performance fees" to refer to the accrued performance fees net of accrued giveback obligations, accrued performance fee compensation, performance fee-related tax obligations, . . .
