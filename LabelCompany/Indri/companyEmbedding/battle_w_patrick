Bill Battle walked past the sprawling live oaks, between the stately two-story columns and into the University of Alabama’s Rose Administration Building looking for answers.

This was the fall of 1981, long before Battle wore that distinguished head of white hair and was known as the Southern gentleman whose company built the $4.3 billion collegiate licensing industry.

Back then, in fact, Battle was known as a former football player for Bear Bryant at Alabama and a fired football coach at Tennessee who shocked his peers by walking away from the game to run a window company in Selma, Ala. His wins came in the form of deals like the $42 million project to install thermal windows in a Saudi Arabian building.

Collegiate licensing? Such a concept was so foreign in 1981 that Battle couldn’t find anyone at the University of Alabama who knew what licensing was. Battle, himself, wasn’t sure.

“I must have gone to six or seven offices that day asking where the licensing department was,” Battle said. “They said, ‘Licensing for what?’ Nobody knew what I was talking about.”

Battle’s concept for a collegiate licensing business became the basis for a company that redefined what it meant to make hats, T-shirts and other items with college marks. He didn’t just build a company; he forged an industry that has become an important revenue source for athletic departments across the country and made the licensing of marks easier for manufacturers.

Battle’s Collegiate Licensing Co. eventually represented more than 200 schools, bowl games, conferences and other college entities, creating a valuable revenue stream while cleaning up a rogue business that turned out unsavory products like condoms and beer with unofficial school marks.

For larger schools like Alabama, licensing now brings in $7 million to $8 million annually, more in years when the Crimson Tide wins championships, all from the model that Battle put in place with CLC. He sold the company to IMG in 2007 for more than $100 million.

But 30 years ago, Battle’s vision of consolidating school licensing rights into a model that resembled the NFL’s had not even come into focus. He certainly had no idea how the events of the next year would not only change his life, but also give shape to a fledgling industry. 

No, on this day, he just wanted to find someone at Alabama who had a clue what he was talking about.

STARTS WITH THE BEAR

Every quarter, Battle delivered the financial report for the Decatur Iron and Steel Co. — otherwise known as DISCO — to the board of directors at its Selma headquarters. But on a particular January day in 1981, Battle, the company’s president, couldn’t stay focused. All he could think about was his old coach, Bear Bryant.

Bryant was a mostly ceremonial member of DISCO’s board and he attended (to most everyone’s surprise) just about all of the board meetings. Battle, who played for the legendary coach 20 years earlier, made it his routine to drive over to the Selma Holiday Inn, pick up Bryant, and take him to the office for the board meetings.

During the drive on this chilly morning, though, Bryant nonchalantly dropped some news on his former player that would forever alter the course of Battle’s life.







Bill Battle’s early college contacts came from his days as an Alabama football player.




The old coach in the houndstooth hat had decided that he no longer would be represented by IMG.

“He said those guys up in New York just weren’t doing anything for him,” Battle said. “Shoot, I didn’t even know that he had an agent.”

As a distracted Battle delivered his quarterly report, he kept thinking about how he could represent Bryant, who was nine victories away from breaking the all-time wins record.

“I couldn’t get it out of my mind,” Battle said. “To me, he was the most well-known coach in the country, the greatest figure in college athletics. All I could think about was, ‘Holy cow, he’s about to change agents.’”

So after the meeting, Battle steadied himself and said, “Coach, I don’t know that much about licensing, and I don’t know that much about being an agent, but I know you and I’ll make sure we do it the way you want to do it.”

“In that old, gravely voice, Coach Bryant said, ‘Aw, I ain’t got nothing to sell. The best in the business has been trying to sell me for years. All I want is somebody to take all these requests for speaking engagements and tell them I can’t come.’”

Battle tells the story with a raucous laugh that just about busts a gut. The most famous and revered coach in college football was going to be represented by the president of a window company.

As Bryant neared the wins record the following season, requests began to flow in for licensing rights to the Bear’s image and likeness. Manufacturers wanted to make hats, T-shirts — anything they could produce that had Bryant’s likeness on it. One company made bronze-colored busts of the Bear, one of which sits in the CLC offices in Atlanta today.

What Golden Bear taught Battle about the licensing business

Bill Battle freely admits he didn’t know much about licensing in 1981, when he began representing Bear Bryant and, in the same year, became the licensing agent for the University of Alabama, deals that led to the formation of the Collegiate Licensing Co.

So how did he learn?

During that time, Battle was president of a window company in Selma, Ala., owned by Larry Striplin. He had known Striplin for years and went to work for him after being fired as Tennessee’s head football coach in 1977.

One of Striplin’s other businesses was Golden Eagle Enterprises, which made Otey Crisman hickory-shafted putters and eyewear with Jack Nicklaus’ Golden Bear logo. Striplin had purchased both the putter and eyewear companies and merged them into something that could only loosely be called a sports marketing business.

Battle still laughs out loud when he reminisces about “our little putter and eyewear company.”

“We were losing our rear end,” he said.

Striplin invited Battle to tag along on a 1980 visit to Nicklaus’ Golden Bear headquarters in Florida to discuss the licensed eyewear business. They were there to meet with Nicklaus’ trusted adviser, Chuck Perry.
Battle, like a lot of college licensees years later, didn’t understand why Golden Eagle paid the Golden Bear so much money for a logo on a pair of sunglasses.

Eddie Dobbs, who ran the Golden Eagle business for Striplin, explained it to Battle this way: “Look, consumers don’t have the first clue who we are. But they understand Jack Nicklaus and the Golden Bear.”
“One of the things I learned,” Battle said, “is that Jack Nicklaus’ heirs will be making lots of money from the Golden Bear long after Jack is gone. So that’s how I learned about licensing.

“When the opportunity to represent Coach Bryant came along, I thought that we could do for him what the Golden Bear did for Jack Nicklaus.”

When Battle won the right to represent Bryant and the University of Alabama in licensing matters in 1981, those rights were rolled into Golden Eagle. Three years later, armed with the rights to more than a dozen schools, Battle bought Golden Eagle from Striplin, moved it to Atlanta and renamed it the Collegiate Licensing Co.

Striplin, who died at age 82 in January, remains one of Battle’s inspirations, even though he was about as opposite as you can get from Battle. Striplin wasn’t afraid to take a chance on anything, while the financially conservative Battle “really hates to borrow money,” said Rod Knowles, his banker for 30 years.
But it was Striplin’s entrepreneurial spirit that fed Battle’s own pioneering desire to consolidate the fragmented collegiate licensing world.

“Not bad for a little putter and eyewear company,” Battle laughs, with a sense of satisfaction.

“Things picked up dramatically,” Battle said. “That’s when it got fun. And what happened as more people wanted the license for Coach Bryant? They wanted to use Alabama’s logos too.”

Finding the gatekeeper for Alabama’s marks, however, presented a problem. The Crimson Tide, like most schools 30 years ago, didn’t have a licensing program.

Finally, after walking the halls and fruitlessly knocking on doors inside the Rose Administration Building that day on the Tuscaloosa campus, Battle came across a familiar face in the school’s purchasing office.

Battle had known Finus Gaston because of their mutual connection to Alabama football — Battle as a player for Bryant’s first national championship team, in 1961, and Gaston as a team manager years later. Gaston’s father also had been the sports information director at Alabama when Battle was a player.

Maybe Gaston would know the answer to Battle’s licensing question. What Battle didn’t know when he entered the office is that Gaston had been talking to other administrators on SEC campuses about just such a program. They just weren’t sure how to get it going. How could these colleges sell licenses, manage the licensees, make sure they get paid, and enforce the program against rogue T-shirt makers who were pumping product out of their basements?

In walked Bill Battle.

“As soon as we started talking about a licensing program, we knew there was a lot of synergy there with Coach Bryant and Alabama,” said Gaston, now the athletic department’s chief financial officer. “The more we talked, the more sense it made. It was just logical for everything to come together right there.”

That conversation late in 1981 set the table for Alabama to become Battle’s first collegiate client in what was then Golden Eagle Enterprises, the company that became CLC in 1984. Golden Eagle, a company that made hickory-shafted mallet putters and Jack Nicklaus-licensed eyewear, was owned by the same man, Larry Striplin, who owned DISCO — and it had just enough of a licensing flavor to serve as the agency for that college business that Battle was starting to bring in.

Think it was strange for a window company president to serve as Bear Bryant’s agent? How about a putter and eyewear company representing the University of Alabama’s licensing?

But this is how it all started.

“After we talked for a while, Bill said he wanted to submit a licensing proposal to the university,” Gaston said. “We just didn’t know who you’d submit it to.”

After Battle secured Alabama with approval from the school’s president, Mississippi soon jumped on board. Within a few years, seven of the ACC’s eight schools at the time became clients, too.

Wake Forest was one of those first ACC clients. Ben Sutton, now IMG College’s president, was the Deacons’ licensing director in the 1980s.

“Bill used to say that ‘We’ve got everybody from Alabama to Wake Forest,’” Sutton said. “I took it to mean alphabetical. … Bill blazed the path onto campus for a lot of businesses. We all owe him a great debt for that.”

A BUSINESS ALLY

Battle’s path into the ACC was cleared by Clemson’s athletic director at the time, Bill McLellan, who proved to be an important ally. The Tigers won the national football championship in 1981, and products with Tiger paws started showing up everywhere in the following months. Clemson couldn’t regulate it.

McLellan had seen one of Battle’s licensing proposals, similar to what he had sent to Alabama, and arranged for Battle to meet with all of the ACC’s athletic directors, which led to discussions with the schools’ business chiefs. Battle liked to pitch to the vice presidents in charge of business because they typically oversaw the bookstores. 

With McLellan opening the door, Battle signed nearly all of the conference’s schools. Virginia was the lone ACC school that didn’t sign — a notable exception, because a rival was beginning to emerge. Steve Crossland, a former bookstore manager at the University of Southern California, was attempting to corral some schools of his own, and Virginia represented a big early win. Battle and Crossland eventually decided to join forces, and when they did, CLC’s list of schools grew to 25. Crossland remained a partner until Battle bought him out in 1993.

Through the developing years, Battle made college administrators see that there was strength and efficiency in numbers, and his efforts to aggregate collegiate rights was on its way. 

The schools, the licensees and the retailers all could win if they were in this together, Battle said. Sure, they’d have to pay royalties, but with the top schools finally available from the same licensing agent, licensees could go one place to acquire 40 or 50 licenses, and eventually, the overall pie would grow so much faster.

The schools liked the enforcement that came with it, too. Administrators used to throw up their hands every time they saw unlicensed products that didn’t reflect well on the school, thinking they couldn’t do anything about it.

Battlin’ Bulldog Beer was one of those products. The cans featured a hung-over Georgia Bulldog in a school sweater with bloodshot eyes. The school took the beer’s distributor, Bill Laite of Macon, Ga., to court in 1985 to make him stop marketing the beer cans with the unlicensed Bulldog mascot.

CLC also developed the first label that identified “officially licensed collegiate products.”

Despite some of those wins, not everyone was on board. Many administrators doubted that there was any money in licensing. Arkansas AD Frank Broyles had to be convinced that the school even owned the rights to its own marks.

University bookstores, the only place consumers could find school merchandise back then, weren’t in favor of the new model, either. They already had the market cornered. Bookstores bought from whichever manufacturers they wanted, and royalties weren’t being paid. Battle had to convince them that his model would make them more money eventually.

“One of the smartest things we did was put incentives for the schools in the contracts,” Battle said. “Once I saw that we could get the schools to sign, I wasn’t worried about making enough money. I was worried about making too much. I didn’t want anyone on campus asking why they were paying us all that money. So we put incentives in there that paid the school even more as sales went up. The more we got, the more they got.”

Before Battle consolidated the college market, it was extremely fragmented, requiring a licensee to go from school to school to buy the rights. Battle had to sell administrators on his vision of a model that resembled the NFL’s, where all of the marks were available in one place. 

Along the way, CLC broadened its business to represent NASCAR — Battle actually started NASCAR’s licensing business — and the PGA Tour, but it never strayed from its college roots.

“You just couldn’t conceive of someone better suited to start CLC than Bill,” said Russ Richards, Battle’s attorney for the last 20 years. “He’s this tall, handsome guy with this disarming personality who just sets everyone at ease. He had been an athlete and a coach, and he knew how the college administrators thought. 

“This is the guy who is the smartest guy in the room, but he never acts like he’s the smartest guy in the room.”

Over the years, schools saw Battle as less of an old coach and more of a business ally who understood the challenges on campus and could respond with a service-oriented approach. That’s why athletic directors still call him, whether they have a question about business or they’re looking to hire a position. 

He remains one of the most quietly influential figures in college athletics today, even though he has slipped away from the day-to-day duties of running the company. Working as CLC’s chairman and an adviser for the company’s management, Battle, 70, remains that important figure because of his deep relationships with clients and his ties to CLC’s past.

His sons, Pat and Mike, and daughter Shannon worked in the business through the years, and Pat became an influential figure in the sale of CLC to IMG. He led the growth of IMG College from 2007 to 2011, when he left the company.
Consolidating the college marketplace from a marketing and sponsorship standpoint was Pat’s ultimate goal at IMG College, but he took his cue from his dad, he said.

More than 30 years ago, Bill Battle saw how the fragmented college marketplace could be brought together, and CLC came as close to doing it as anyone could.

“The original vision for all of this was my dad’s,” Pat Battle said. “He saw that it could be done.”

‘DOING THE RIGHT THING’

The halls inside CLC’s Atlanta office today are a testament to Battle’s vision. Boots with Oklahoma State marks, a red Georgia tool box and a UCLA No. 1 foam finger are among the hundreds of licensed products that line the walls.

As long as Battle is in town and not visiting one of his vacation homes or his favorite retreat, a several-hundred-acre farm northeast of Atlanta, he’s in the office taking calls from longtime associates like Alabama AD Mal Moore or serving as a resource to IMG College’s Sutton, who oversees CLC’s business now. Mostly, though, Battle enjoys the spoils of what he’s built. He’d just as soon be outside, hunting turkeys or dropping a line the water.

Then there are days like the one a few weeks ago, when Barry White called and wanted to go to lunch. White was fresh out of college from the University of Alabama-Birmingham when he called Battle and asked for a job in the early 1980s. White, who would become the first non-family employee at CLC, grew up a huge Crimson Tide fan and he knew Battle’s story as a former player for Bear Bryant and the youngest coach in the country when he took the Tennessee job at 28.

“Honestly, I couldn’t believe it when Bill Battle called me back,” White said. “My parents couldn’t believe it. I knew he had this little sports marketing company down in Selma, and to me, working for him was my dream job.”

White had been onboard just a year or so and was still green to the licensing business when Battle shocked him with an assignment to go pitch Tennessee for its licensing business. 

White guessed at the time that Battle didn’t want to go because of how the Volunteers treated the former coach when he was there. Even though Battle took the Vols to a bowl game in each of his first five seasons, he was fired in year seven, and throughout his tenure, the local fans never warmed to him. One day, Battle pulled up to his house in Knoxville to find a moving van sitting there. Other times, fans would come by in the middle of the night and express their displeasure by putting “For Sale” signs in his front yard.

Battle was an Alabama guy, and even his 59-22-2 record with the Vols wasn’t enough to satisfy the Big Orange faithful.

When White returned from making his pitch to Tennessee administrators, Battle commended him for a job well done. It was later White found out that Battle already had secured the business. He just sent White for a confidence-building experience. Battle hired a lot of recent college graduates at CLC just like White because he liked their enthusiasm and energy.

That day over lunch, White, now a high-ranking marketing executive with Chick-fil-A in Atlanta, repeated to Battle something he’s said a hundred times.

“Bill, I can’t believe you gave me a chance,” White told him. “He gave a young guy a chance, and I’ll forever be appreciative of that. And the thing is that he’s done that for a lot of people.”

Cory Moss, a senior vice president at CLC and a veteran of nearly 20 years at the company, runs the day-to-day business now. He’s one of those many young people who dreamed of a profession in sports and started at CLC. 

Moss can recall two occasions that he’s been in the hospital during that span, and Battle was the first non-family member to visit each time, including once when Moss’ wife had triplets, only to lose two of them from complications of a premature birth.

“Bill was right there for us,” Moss said. “He is the consummate leader by example. … The one thing he always talks about is doing the right thing for the client, even if it might not be the best financial decision for the company. He believes that if you do the right thing for the client, the program will grow.”

Just look at Battle’s associations through the years and you’ll understand why so many people call him the Southern gentleman of the college business. His banker, Rod Knowles, has been his friend and adviser for 30 years. Richards, his attorney, has worked with Battle for some 20 years.

He still goes bird hunting with his college roommate and Crimson Tide teammate Butch Wilson, and he still goes to visit Alabama’s Moore, who played with Battle on that 1961 national championship team, to talk about the good old days.

Nobody, it seems, just does business with Battle. They form relationships, and more times than not, those relationships last a lifetime.

“Bill has backed an untold number of people,” Knowles said. “He probably wouldn’t want me to tell this, but he has given support to so many people who have fallen on hard times, just because he believed in them or wanted to help them.”

CLC is the perfect reflection of Battle. IMG has owned the company for five years now, but a trip around the CLC home office near the Chattahoochee River in Atlanta reveals just one small IMG logo. CLC has maintained its name and an identity separate from parent company IMG because of all the personal equity Battle built into it over the last 30 years.

“There’s just a great reverence for Coach Battle and for CLC,” Sutton said. “A lot of people thought that Bill probably would have moved on after IMG bought the company, but I’ve pleaded for him to stay and remain engaged. He’s a great visionary, a great entrepreneur and he’s been a role model for somebody like me. He has an amount of good will, of social capital, that’s really unmatched. The way I hear schools talk about CLC and Bill Battle, that’s how I want them to talk about IMG College.”

Battle recalls thrills of competition from both football and business


Bill Battle’s ability to recall details is legendary among his friends. The way old coaches remember an otherwise obscure 3-yard run from a game 30 years ago, Battle, 70, remembers details about meetings and chance encounters that played integral roles in the development of the Collegiate Licensing Co.

Here are a few of the stories he shared from his days playing for Bear Bryant at Alabama, through coaching at Tennessee, and finally building CLC into a national licensing powerhouse.

■ Battle’s Tennessee team squared off against Joe Paterno’s Penn State squad during the 1971 and ’72 seasons, with both games played in Knoxville. In the 1972 game, Tennessee pulled out a hard-fought win, 28-21, and at the midfield handshake, Paterno asked Battle if he could speak to the team in the Volunteers’ locker room.

Paterno came over and told the Vols that they played the game the way it ought to be played and offered his congratulations on the win. Then he added, “But the real reason I’m here is that I told all my friends back in State College that I wasn’t leaving Knoxville without being in the winning team’s locker room. I just didn’t think I was going to have to do it this way.”

Battle said he came to appreciate Paterno after playing him and beating him both times.

“Joe had that Bronx accent and I thought he talked too much,” Battle said with a laugh. “But after we played them, I became a big Joe Paterno fan. I was saddened tremendously by the way he went out.”


■ The A Club for lettermen at Alabama was one of the most prestigious clubs on campus when Battle was in school there in the late 1950s and early ’60s. And back in the day, initiation into the A Club came with some pretty severe hazing, including a shaved head. One player, Joe Namath, decided that he didn’t care to endure the hazing and passed on an invitation to join the A Club. Alabama’s coach, Bear Bryant, himself a former Alabama athlete and A Club member, heard about this and called Namath into a private meeting.









Battle led the program at Tennessee from 1970 to ‘76 as one of the youngest college coaches in the country.

“I don’t know what happened in that meeting, but when Joe came out, all of the sudden he wanted to go through initiation for A Club,” said Battle, who was president of the club his senior year.

■ One of Battle’s best friends in sports business is Jim Host. While Battle was building his collegiate licensing business, Host was building his own multimedia rights business. But the models were drastically different. CLC paid a royalty to a school after a sale had been made, which worked for Battle’s conservative financial philosophy. Host, on the other hand, paid out millions in guarantees to his college clients and then sold the advertising and sponsorship to make his money back. Even though that model made Battle nervous, he had several conversations about partnering with Host and merging their companies.

“Jim is a much bigger risk taker than I am,” Battle said. “I don’t do well with that. I love Jim; he’s one of my favorite people and I’ve learned a lot from him. We talked about trading stock, or getting together. I was willing to seriously entertain it, so we went through the exercise. We opened our books and our numbers were pretty straightforward. Their numbers kept moving. They were based more on ‘What we’re going to do.’ I don’t want to know what you’re going to do. What are you doing right now? I got a little nervous. I didn’t see where we needed to be together.”

■ On the decision to sell CLC to IMG in 2007 for more than $100 million, Battle said, “I would have been happy either way. I was happy to leave it the way it was, hoping my grandchildren would get in the business someday. But if you’re going to sell, the time we sold was about as good a time as you could want.”

Overview



Patrick McLanahan is back — and this time he faces his most difficult challenge. He must pull together a team of aggressive, maverick young pilots to face a world on the brink of massive nuclear conflict. It begins with a joint U.S.-Japanese-South Korean mock bombing raid. But the South Korean fighter pilots don't stick to the script. Instead, they race across the border into North Korea to support a massive people's revolt against the Communists.Virtually overnight, the fledgling United Korea is the world's newest nuclear power, igniting a fuse that threatens to blow Asia apart and trigger World War III. Only McLanahan has the top-secret aviation technology and the brash young heroes to stop the coming inferno — if he can get them to stop fighting each other and start fighting as a team before the world is reduced to cinders!

Editorial Reviews


From the Publisher
"A first-class thriller." -- Abilene Reporter-News"Brown serves up enough ... lethal hardware and over-the-top action to satisfy the most discerning techno-thriller fan." -- USA Today"Brown's poetry lies in his exhaustive tribute to the machinery of war, and fans will thrill to it once again in this solid addition to the series."-- Publishers WeeklyAlso by Dale Brown:The Tin Man

Get Ready for World War III
Dale Brown returns to the world stage in Battle Born, picking up loose ends from his 1997 technothriller, Fatal Terrain. That novel began as China launched a small-scale nuclear assault on Taiwan after it declared full independence and sovereignty. At the same time, a nuclear explosion in Yokosuka Harbor outside Tokyo destroyed several American warships, including the aircraft carrier USS Independence. Although the Chinese were suspected, the actual culprit was never positively identified. When the United States tried to halt the PRC's attacks against Taiwan, the Chinese retaliated by launching a nuclear attack against U.S. military bases on Guam. A stunned U.S. struck back, effectively destroying both China's air force and its last remaining ICBMs, but afterward chose not to escalate the conflict. 

Two years later, the U.S. is keeping a wary eye on the Chinese and trying to mend fences with nervous allies. Japan, for example, fearful of Chinese aggression, has closed down all U.S. military bases. Little does anyone know that another wild card is about to be played, this time by South Korea. A joint U.S.-Japanese-South Korean military exercise goes horribly awry when South Korean pilots race across the DMZ to support a massive people's revolt against the communists. To everyone's surprise, the bold initiative succeeds. Armed with weapons the Chinese provided to the North, the newly minted United Korea becomes the world's newest nuclear power. Ironically, its most likely target is China, who many fear will launch a preemptive strike on the fledgling nation. 

Seeking to contain the situation, a shaken U.S. president turns to Generals Terrill Samson and Patrick McLanahan. Backed by technological marvels developed at Groom Lake (a top-secret military facility) and supported by a feisty group of fliers appropriated from the Nevada Air National Guard ("Battle Born" is Nevada's state motto), McLanahan once again enters the fray, this time trying desperately to avert the beginning of World War III. The odds are against him, but this doesn't phase McLanahan a bit -- he's made a career out of bucking the odds. 

Obviously pitched toward technothriller fans (Tom Clancy fans will feel right at home here), Battle Born will satisfy general readers as well. For those who crave a charismatic hero, it stars Brown's long-running series character, Patrick McLanahan. For political junkies, it brims with domestic and international intrigue. There's hardware aplenty for techno geeks, air battles for avionics buffs, and plenty of thrills for action fans. 

The book also has a serious side. Although Brown could have better depicted the human cost of the carnage (basically, all we get are numbers), he does a great job of casting light on the current global situation. McLanahan's volatile world differs from our own, but not by much. The Korean situation he depicts is especially plausible -- the conditions described in Battle Born are eerily close to those that exist in those troubled countries today. Hopefully, should events develop in our reality as they do in Battle Born, soldiers like Patrick McLanahan will step forward to save the day. 
Hank Wagner 



Publishers Weekly  - Publisher's Weekly
Last spotted on a singlehanded crusade against international terrorism in The Tin Man, veteran hero Patrick McLanahan, now a one-star general, is back at the head of a U.S. Air Force team in this 12th military techno-thriller from the ever-popular Brown. The general's crew--a motley gang of rule-breaking hotheads from the Nevada Air National Guard--is unorthodox, but desperate times call for desperate measures. It's April 2000, and a starving North Korean pilot has just tried to take out Seoul with nuclear weapons. This leads to the Second Korean War, as American flyers help their South Korean allies conquer a seriously weakened enemy. But a new united Korea is soon threatening China, and only McLanahan's team, flying Megafortress bombers equipped with sophisticated antiballistic missiles, can prevent nuclear conflict. Sidestepping obstructive air force bureaucracy and quelling the feuds smoldering among his pilots, McLanahan takes on the role of a renegade elder statesman in his latest foray, leaving most of the flying to his Nevada team, headed by Rinc "Rodeo" Seaver and Rinc's clandestine lover and commanding officer, Rebecca Furness. Seaver, accused of causing the deaths of three officers in a training maneuver, has a lot to prove, and it is his story that drives the personal subplot. Brown's strongest suit, however, has always been his ability to generate tension through high-wire aeronautics and technological breakthroughs, and in this tale he flourishes an ace: top secret plasma-yield warheads, subatomic weapons that silently vaporize their targets. His dialogue is as stilted as ever, and the acronym count as high, but Brown's poetry lies in his exhaustive tribute to the machinery of war, and fans will thrill to it once again in this solid addition to the series. Agent, Robert Gottlieb at William Morris. Simultaneous BDD audio. (Nov.) Copyright 1999 Cahners Business Information.


Library Journal
Aerial warfare expert Patrick MacLanahan is back and, as in Fatal Terrain, he's battling his cowardly military superiors, egotistical politicians in Washington, and just about everyone else on the globe. He must risk his career and his life to deploy newly developed Air Force technology and nullify the threat of global thermonuclear war (posed by a conflict between China and Korea). Longtime action-fiction writer Brown has created a world dominated by paranoia, military concerns, and the hardware of modern war. His characters have the annoying habit of repeating and contradicting themselves. They also speak at great length about their fondness for weaponry--pages of description and detail about aircraft and ordinance slow down an otherwise fast-moving if predictable story. Public libraries with Brown fans will want to purchase this title, but there is little reason for anyone else to do so. [Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 8/99.]--Patrick J. Wall, University City P.L., MO Copyright 1999 Cahners Business Information.


USAToday
...[T]he real heroes are sleek, supersonic Air Force B-1B bombers.  Brown isn't big on character development.  Some of the humans in Battle Born are little more than names and a few adjectives.  

Kirkus Reviews
 The return of the tin man, retired USAF Brigadier General Patrick McLanahan, Brown's chief hero among those who have saved the world from China's invasion of the Philippines in Sky Masters, of Taiwan in both Fatal Terrain and The Tin Man (1998), and in various novels saved Europe from a war between Lithuania and Byelorussia, Europe from invasion by Russia, and been on hand for Gulf War II. Bestseller Brown's technothrillers never involve small stakes. The man himself is civilian director of a high-tech company making cutting-edge advances in strategic devices for the armed services. Battle Born kicks off the Second Korean War when a joint US/South Korean–Japanese aerial war game goes awry as South Korean pilots break away and give a supportive attack on Communist forces facing a massive popular uprising. Not long after, the South Koreans come into possession of two North Korean thermonuclear gravity bombs. Will Asia ignite WWIII? Will Dale Brown? As it happens, technospecialist McLanahan has been training a hot-shot group of young pilots who simmer to save the world should North Korea boldly attack South Korea, which in itself means that, yes, China will come the aid of a fellow Communist nation and Brown & McLanahan be right at home fending off the Chinese Air Force. Meanwhile, how will he romance Lt. Col. Rebecca Catherine Furness, and how will the new EB-1 Megafortress with its amazing LADAR (laser radar) navigation device come into play?  Chockablock technotalk lifts skyward on plottoblast as Brown flips on all the electrosensors seeking the next Danger! Danger! Danger! signal. (Note: Brown names as US Vice President one Ellen Christine Whiting just as New Jersey GovernorChristine Whitman gets touted for the VP slot with George W. Bush. Now that's futurific.)

Read an Excerpt


MILITARY TECHNOLOGY SUBCOMMITTEE, SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE, RAYBURN BUILDING, WASHINGTON, D.C. "I hoped we'd never be facing this question again in my lifetime," the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee said, his voice serious. "But here it is. Looks like the devil's goin' to the prom, and we're praying he don't ask us to dance."The main part of the morning's classified, closed hearing had already concluded; the scientists and comptrollers had packed up their charts and spreadsheets, leaving only the subcommittee members, several general officers, and a few aides. This was the open debate portion of the session, a "chat session" where everything was fair game and the uniformed officers had a last chance to persuade. It was usually more casual and more freewheeling than formal subcommittee testimony, and it gave all involved a chance to vent their frustrations and opinions."I'd say, Senator," Air Force General Victor G. Hayes, the chief of staff of the Air Force, responded, "that we've got no choice but to dance with that devil. The question is, can we keep him from only tipping over the punch bowl, or is he going to burn down the whole school gymnasium if we don't do something?""You characterize the attacks on Taiwan and Guam as just a tipped-over punch bowl, General?" a committee member asked.General Hayes shook his head and wiped the smile from his face. He knew better than to try to get too chummy or casual with these committee members, no matter how plain-talking and down-home they sometimes sounded.This was the first time Victor "Jester" Hayes had testified before any committee in Congress. Although the Pentagon gave "charm school" classes and seminars to high-ranking officers on how to handle reporters, dignitaries, and civilians in a variety of circumstances, including giving testimony before Congress, it was simply impossible to fully prepare for ordeals like this. He did not feel comfortable here, and he was afraid it showed. Big-time.The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Navy Admiral George Balboa, was seated beside Hayes. The other members of the Joint Chiefs -- General William Marshall, Army chief of staff; Admiral Wayne Connor, chief of Naval Operations; and General Peter Traherne, commandant of the Marine Corps, along with senior deputies and aides -- were also seated at the table facing the subcommittee. Out of the corner of his eye, Hayes could see the barely disguised amusement on some of their faces. Balboa in particular seemed to be enjoying the sight of Hayes roasting a little in front of a congressional subcommittee.Screw 'em all, Hayes told himself resolutely. I'm a fighter pilot. I'm an aerial assassin. These congressmen may be high-ranking elected government officials, but they wouldn't understand a good fight if it kicked them in the ass. Be yourself. Show 'em what you got. As far as Balboa was concerned -- well, he was a weasel, and everyone knew it. He was virtually powerless, allowed to keep his position by the good graces of powerful opposition party members in Congress even though he publicly ambushed his Commander in Chief."Forgive me for trying to take some of the doomsday tone out of this discussion, Senator," Hayes responded. "After two days of secret testimony on some of the new 'black' weapons programs we've included in the Air Force budget, I thought it might be time for a little break. But I assure you: this is a very serious matter. The future of the United States Air Force, and indeed the fate of our military forces and the nation itself, will be determined in the next several years by the decisions we make today."I characterize the ballistic missile attacks on Taiwan and Guam by the People's Republic of China as a repudiation of thirty years of arms reduction efforts and a warning to the United States armed forces that we must develop a multilayered antimissile defense system immediately. We bargained away our antimissile capabilities in the 1970s, believing that nonproliferation would lead to peace. Now, in the face of renewed aggression, rearmament, terrorism, and the spread of small-scale and black-market weapons of mass destruction, I feel we have no choice but to rebuild our defensive forces. The days of believing that our conventional precision war-fighting capability obviated and obsoleted decades of nuclear warfare strategy and technology are history.""Apparently so," one committee member said ruefully. "I for one am mystified and angry about this waste of time, money, and resources. We've spent hundreds of billions of dollars on these new 'smart' weapons, and now you're saying they won't protect us?""I'm saying that the rules are changing, Senator," General Hayes said earnestly, "and we must change with them."We gave away our defensive capability because we kept a large, strong offensive force, including nuclear deterrent forces. We then dismantled those deterrent forces when the threat from other superpowers diminished. Now the threat is back, but we have neither defensive nor deterrent forces in place. That leaves us vulnerable to criticism at best and attack at worst. The China incident is a perfect example.""That's all fine and good, General, but these budget numbers are staggering, and the path you want to embark on here reminds me of the nuclear nightmare times of Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Reagan," the senator went on, motioning to his staff report. "You're asking for billions more on some truly horrifying programs, like antiballistic missile lasers, space-based lasers, and these so-called plasma-yield weapons. What's going on, General? Is the Air Force so desperate for a mission right now that you'll even go back to 'mutually assured destruction' doctrines of the Cold War?""Members of the committee, I asked Secretary of Defense Chastain and Secretary of the Air Force Mortonson to give the Air Force a budget for the deployment of a new class of weapons not to shock or galvanize the Congress, but because I truly believe the time has long passed for us to be thinking about this kind of war fighting," General Hayes went on. "China's recent nuclear attacks on Taiwan; its suspected nuclear sabotage of the aircraft carrier USS Independence in Yokosuka Harbor; and its shocking, unprovoked, and horrific ballistic missile nuclear attack on the island of Guam, which all but wiped Anderson Air Force Base off the map three years ago, all are a warning to the United States.""It's a warning, all right," another senator offered. "But it seems more a warning to avoid stepping up to the edge of that slippery slope. Do we want to start another nuclear arms race?"It seemed as if most folks in America had all but forgotten what had happened only three years ago, Hayes thought grimly. In 1997, just before their "Reunification Day" celebrations, the People's Republic of China launched a small-scale nuclear assault on Taiwan, which had just declared full independence and sovereignty from the mainland. Several Taiwanese military bases were decimated; over fifty thousand persons lost their lives. At the same time, a nuclear explosion in Yokosuka Harbor outside Tokyo destroyed several American warships, including the soon-to-be-retired aircraft carrier USS Independence. China was accused of that unconscionable act, but the actual culprit was never positively identified. When the United States tried to halt the PRC's attacks against Taiwan, China retaliated by launching a nuclear ballistic missile attack on the island of Guam, shutting down two important American military bases in the Pacific.The reverberations of that fateful summer of 1997 were still being felt. Japan had closed down all U.S. military bases on their soil and had only recently begun allowing some limited access to U.S. warships -- provisioning and humanitarian shore leave only, with ships at anchor in the harbor, not in port, and no weapons transfers in their territorial waters. South Korea was permitting only routine provisioning and shore leave -- they were allowing no weapons transfers within five miles of shore and prohibited staging military operations from their ports. It was the same for most ports of call in the western Pacific. American naval presence in the Pacific was almost nil.And America's response to China's attacks was ... silence. Except for one massive joint Air Force/Navy defensive air armada around Taiwan that all but destroyed China's Air Force, and an isolated but highly effective series of air raids inside China -- largely attributed to American stealth bombers, aided by Taiwanese fighters -- the Americans had not retaliated. It was world condemnation alone that eventually forced China to abandon its plan to force Taiwan back into its sphere of influence."I'm concerned about the path Russia, Japan, and North Korea are taking in the wake of the economic collapse in Asia and the conflict in the Balkans," Hayes went on. "Russia appears to be back in the hands of hard-liners and neo-Communists. Food riots in North Korea have led to the slaughter of thousands of civilians by military forces foraging for food. Japan has isolated us out of the Pacific and is proceeding with plans to remilitarize, all in an apparent attempt to shore up confidence in its government. I don't believe the United States sparked this return to the specter of the Cold War, but we must be prepared to deal with it.""We are all shocked and horrified about all those events as well, General," the senator pointed out, "and we agree with the President that we must be better prepared for radical changes in the political climate. But this ... this buildup of such powerful weapons that you're asking for seems to be an overreaction. What you are proposing goes far beyond what any of us see as a measured response to world events."General Hayes swallowed hard. This was turning into a much harder sell than he had expected. While the world slowly went back to an uneasy, suspicious peace, President Kevin Martindale was roundly criticized for his inaction. Although China was stopped and an all-out nuclear conflict was averted, many Americans wanted someone to pay a bigger price for the hundreds of thousands who had died on Taiwan, Guam, and onboard the four Navy warships destroyed in Yokosuka Harbor. The hawkish President was slammed in the press for abandoning the capital onboard Air Force One during the attacks on Taiwan, while failing to use most of the military power he had spent his entire career in Washington trying to build up.No one could say precisely what Martindale should have done, but everyone was convinced he should have done something more.

                                Brown brings a lot to the table with his previous SAC experience.  He really wowed me with "Flight of the Old Dog" and I've been a fan ever since.  He does get rather fanciful in making things up, and the technology he invents is almost 23rd Century, but he spins a great yarn and I love reading his tales.  It's a great escape from the real world when I need one, so his books get re-read quite a bit.

                                I've read several of Dale Brown's books in this series.  This one is not his best work.

                                Although I am only 5/8 of the way through the audio version of this book, I am rivitted.  With a 45 minute commute (each way), each night I've found myself anxiously anticipating my next days commute so that I can hear the next part of this story (if only I could be so excited about returning to my job).  This story revolves around a north Korean situation that is all-too-real these days. It's an interesting twist to the current national/political climate present in early 2003 and I hope and pray that N. Korea does not escallate to the level depicted in this book.  If they do, I would definitely wonder if we have a 'Lancelot' project. Even with a family connection to the Pentagon I don't know if we really do,  but I sure as  Shinola hope so!

                                After writing a whole bunch of great air warfare books it seemed like Mr. Brown was in cruise control in Battle Born.  Wait for the paperback.

                                I just finished reading Battle Born and to tell you the truth, it was a waste of time. Dale Brown goes into so much detail about who, what and when. Do we really need to know how many people are in a room, their names, families, bad habits etc.. This book is almost 400 pages and there is only about 20 to 30 pages out of the whole book related to the actual Battle Born Nevade Guard Unit in action. Otherwise just boring details, geeesh!!  I have always loved Dale Brown's work and have read them cover to cover with great excitement. I had to force myself to read this book hoping with each page that it would get better. Dale Brown always likes to associate himself with Tom Clancy. Tom Clancy has not written a good book by himself in years. Dale I guess is now so succesful that he can turn out any junk and put his name on it and it sells. I was really burned  and VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!! Hopefully Dale will go back to his roots and start writing about flying and the excitement of that. What a waste of $24.95!!!

                                I have every book that Brown has written, its good to see that he is going back into the military aspect in his novels.  This book dragged though.  Too much preparation for action and not enough action.  That was kind of dissapointing.  But the book is written masterfully and i would recommend it to anyone.
