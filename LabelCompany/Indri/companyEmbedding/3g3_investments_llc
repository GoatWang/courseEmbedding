What does success mean to you?  
            More Money?  Or more Happiness?  The two do not 
            necessarily go together.  I know many wealthy yet unhappy 
            people and I know many happy yet not so wealthy people.
We 
            approach success as a combination of health and wealth.  We

Health Wealth Equation

 What 
            is MonaVieTM 
? 




MonaVie™ is 
                a balanced beverage of natural nutrients.

If “an apple 
                a day keeps the doctor away,” imagine what a blend of 19 power 
                packed super fruits will do for your health and energy levels!

The crown 
                jewel in the Mona Vie formula is the 
A�ai berry, found only in 
                the Amazon Rain Forest.  MonaVie™ uses a patent pending 
                freeze drying process to lock in the A�ai berry’s full 
                antioxidant potential.  MonaVie™ combines this with 18 
                of the world’s most nutrient dense fruits, each selected for its 
                unique nutritional properties, into one delicious blend.





                Drink It  Feel It Share It






MonaVie™ 
set out to 
                develop a unique nutritional product that provides the greatest 
                variety and proper balance of antioxidants and phytonutrients 
                needed to support a healthy and active lifestyle.  So, 
                after an extensive scientific search of over 200 fruits, they 
                selected the following 18 to complement the 
powerful      A�ai berry. 
                . .

                    Aronia Acerola Purple Grape Passion Fruit Camu 
                    Camu Banana Lychee Fruit Nashi Pear
 



                    Kiwi Pomegranate Prune Wolfberry, Pear      Bilberry 
                    Cranberry Blueberry White Grape


��like 
                many former players, I�ve experienced ongoing aches and pains, 
                constant reminders of the gridiron glory days.  I started 
                drinking Mona Vie, and it�s really helped.�  

                                    Deron Cherry, retired professional 
                football player







                This complete, whole food, blend provides the following benefits: 






                Antioxidants - Phtonutrients - Essential Fatty Acids (Omegas 3, 
                6, & 9) -     Amino Acids - Vitamins & 
                Minerals - Complex Carbohydrates - Dietary Fiber






                And you get all of this in a liquid designed for easy absorption 
                in the body.  So many people today take a pill that 
                basically passes through them with little actual benefit to 
                their system.  With just 2 to 4 ounces of 
MonaVie� 

a day you 
                get the equivalent of 9-13 servings of fruit a day!




                 







�After I was involved in what was 
                arguably the worst accident in NASCAR history, I experienced 
                aches and pains... As soon as I saw what MonaVie was doing for me, 
                I said, �This is awesome.�.   I started calling everybody and 
                sending them products, and I haven�t stopped since�  

 Geoff Bodine, 
                former NASCAR Daytona 500 Champion









The MonaVie� 
                Original formula offers all of these benefits.  

MonaVie� 

also offers 
                their Active Formula that adds Glucosamine and esterfied 
                fatty acids to provide help for your joints.  The Active 
                formula leads to healthier joints and a better range of motion.  
                Ideal for your active lifestyle! 








 


                    Boston, MA � November 2007 � Greetings, MonaVie! 2007 was 
                    another great year for me and baseball. Although it's an 
                    incredibly busy time, I wanted to personally say thank you 
                    for providing me with Mona Vie this year. 

                    As a closing pitcher in baseball, I'm always looking to gain 
                    a competitive advantage throughout the grueling, 
                    eight-month-long baseball season. And I can definitely say 
                    that I've noticed the benefits my body receives from MonaVie. In fact, many of my teammates have also made Mona Vie a 
                    part of their daily regimen, and I think the results speak 
                    for themselves. 

                    As I've stated in the past, whether it's the product or the 
                    business opportunity, MonaVie is a home run...and it's the 
                    only home run I'll allow... 



                    Jonathan Papelbon - 


                    2007 World Series Champion Red Sox Closer 



So, no matter where you are with your health today,
                

MonaVie� 
can help.  
                You may end up with more energy, or feel those nagging aches and 
                pains melt away, and, better yet, you could start preventing 
                future disease development.
Thanks to
                MonaVie� 
                it is now this simple to put yourself on the road to better 
                health.  Don't wait any longer.

                business opportunity.

Health Wealth Equation 


Everyone likes to play 
            games and compete. Look at the multi-billion dollar business of 
            sports. But unless you are a pro athlete, being paid millions of 
            dollars and playing just to increase your endorsement deals, then 
            you are just playing for fun and bragging rights.






I like to play games where the prize is something more, something 
            better. Playing the game of wealth generation is one of those games. 
            If played right you risk losing very little and, if you win, you end 
            up with more money! That�s my kind of game.

            The second game I like to play is health generation. In this game 
            you really can�t lose and, if you win, you are a healthier person! 
            Again, my kind of game. It is true there are no shortcuts to getting 
            healthy. You need to eat right, exercise, blah, blah, blah. You�ve 
            heard it all before. But there are simple, better steps you can take 
            right now to get you on the path to better health.

            It�s true, money can�t buy happiness. But I firmly believe happiness 
            can lead to money. If you are not a happy person then you�ll find 
            every excuse to not be wealthy. It really is a state of mind. Can 
            you be happy if you�re not healthy? I don�t believe so. That�s why I 
            truly believe health and wealth go hand in hand.

            So if you weren�t lucky enough to be born into wealth or hit that 
            lottery number then please join in at 3G3 Investments and let�s work 
            on your wealth/health equation.

Are You Rich? 
            by Kimberly Danger

            Money is the number one topic couples argue about, and is a common 
            reason for divorce. Financial strain can also contribute to health 
            problems like stress, anxiety and even depression. The average 
            household carries some $7,000 as a credit card balance every month. 
            If not having money is bad, then having lots of it is certainly much 
            better then, right? Well, maybe not.

            There�s no doubt that financial security can bring about a less 
            stressful environment in your home. It can also bring you 
            opportunities that you might not otherwise have. It should be every 
            household's goal to be free of consumer debt, but beyond that, the 
            amount of money that is "enough" widely varies.

            We can get into trouble when we start projecting what's right for 
            ourselves onto others. The amount each of us needs can be very 
            different depending on where we live, our fixed expenses and what 
            our personal goals are. Someone may be very content on a small 
            income, while others with big aspirations or goals may be prompted 
            to "go for the gold". There's nothing wrong with either philosophy. 
            As the saying goes, �Different strokes for different folks.�

            What numbers do you use to define who is rich or poor? The 
            government defines poverty lines according to income, but I think 
            we've all seen examples of families on very small incomes do better 
            with their money than those who make six figures. A net worth 
            calculator can be a valuable tool in letting you know if you're on 
            track in achieving your goals, but they're just that: YOUR GOALS. 
            Not your neighbor's goals. It's up to each and every individual to 
            define that for him or herself. 

            The slogan "He Who Dies with the Most Toys Wins" is a destructive 
            way to lead your life. If you're wrapped up in only accumulating 
            more things, you're bound to miss out on life's simple pleasures. 
            While material things can certainly enhance your life, they can't be 
            your main focus. Live your life in pursuit of experiences that 
            nourish your soul, and allow you to give back. Only then will you 
            truly feel rich.

            Five Ways to Feel Truly Rich:

        What is
        MonaVie?


The Product    
        The Business



Why You need MonaVie Daily

The A�ai 
    berry has attracted national attention in a big way


“The next big workout 
    cocktail.” 
Vogue

“The 
    fruit that packs a punch.”
The 
    Men’s Journal


“Nature’s perfect food.”

The US Health and Sciences Institute

 “The 
    A�ai berry is one of the most nutritious and powerful foods in the world… It 
    is nature’s perfect energy fruit and the #1 super food for age defying 
    beauty.” 
              Dr. Nicholas Perricone, author of “the Perricone Promise”


    A�ai and Your Health

 What 
            is MonaVieTM 
? 




MonaVie™ is 
                a balanced beverage of natural nutrients.

If “an apple 
                a day keeps the doctor away,” imagine what a blend of 19 power 
                packed super fruits will do for your health and energy levels!

The crown 
                jewel in the Mona Vie formula is the 
A�ai berry, found only in 
                the Amazon Rain Forest.  MonaVie™ uses a patent pending 
                freeze drying process to lock in the A�ai berry’s full 
                antioxidant potential.  MonaVie™ combines this with 18 
                of the world’s most nutrient dense fruits, each selected for its 
                unique nutritional properties, into one delicious blend.





                Drink It  Feel It Share It






MonaVie™ 
set out to 
                develop a unique nutritional product that provides the greatest 
                variety and proper balance of antioxidants and phytonutrients 
                needed to support a healthy and active lifestyle.  So, 
                after an extensive scientific search of over 200 fruits, they 
                selected the following 18 to complement the 
powerful      A�ai berry. 
                . .



 



                    Apricot 
                    
                    Aronia Acerola Purple Grape Passion Fruit Camu 
                    Camu Banana Lychee Fruit Nashi Pear
 



                    Kiwi Pomegranate Prune Wolfberry, Pear      Bilberry 
                    Cranberry Blueberry White Grape


��like 
                many former players, I�ve experienced ongoing aches and pains, 
                constant reminders of the gridiron glory days.  I started 
                drinking Mona Vie, and it�s really helped.�  

                                    Deron Cherry, retired professional 
                football player







                This complete, whole food, blend provides the following benefits: 






                Antioxidants - Phtonutrients - Essential Fatty Acids (Omegas 3, 
                6, & 9) -     Amino Acids - Vitamins & 
                Minerals - Complex Carbohydrates - Dietary Fiber






                And you get all of this in a liquid designed for easy absorption 
                in the body.  So many people today take a pill that 
                basically passes through them with little actual benefit to 
                their system.  With just 2 to 4 ounces of 
MonaVie� 

a day you 
                get the equivalent of 9-13 servings of fruit a day!




                 







�After I was involved in what was 
                arguably the worst accident in NASCAR history, I experienced 
                aches and pains... As soon as I saw what MonaVie was doing for me, 
                I said, �This is awesome.�.   I started calling everybody and 
                sending them products, and I haven�t stopped since�  

 Geoff Bodine, 
                former NASCAR Daytona 500 Champion









The MonaVie� 
                Original formula offers all of these benefits.  

MonaVie� 

also offers 
                their Active Formula that adds Glucosamine and esterfied 
                fatty acids to provide help for your joints.  The Active 
                formula leads to healthier joints and a better range of motion.  
                Ideal for your active lifestyle! 








 


                    Boston, MA � November 2007 � Greetings, MonaVie! 2007 was 
                    another great year for me and baseball. Although it's an 
                    incredibly busy time, I wanted to personally say thank you 
                    for providing me with Mona Vie this year. 

                    As a closing pitcher in baseball, I'm always looking to gain 
                    a competitive advantage throughout the grueling, 
                    eight-month-long baseball season. And I can definitely say 
                    that I've noticed the benefits my body receives from MonaVie. In fact, many of my teammates have also made Mona Vie a 
                    part of their daily regimen, and I think the results speak 
                    for themselves. 

                    As I've stated in the past, whether it's the product or the 
                    business opportunity, MonaVie is a home run...and it's the 
                    only home run I'll allow... 



                    Jonathan Papelbon - 


                    2007 World Series Champion Red Sox Closer 



So, no matter where you are with your health today,
                

MonaVie� 
can help.  
                You may end up with more energy, or feel those nagging aches and 
                pains melt away, and, better yet, you could start preventing 
                future disease development.
Thanks to
                MonaVie� 
                it is now this simple to put yourself on the road to better 
                health.  Don't wait any longer.

                business opportunity.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

 One Man's 9-Minute Secret to Retiring Rich  by Investing Daily Staff - May 1, 2017     Years ago Jim Fink knew he’d need to make a change if he was ever going to retire.
It's a similar problem a lot of Americans are dealing with as they approach retirement.
He had a good job, was squirreling away money in his IRA, and investing in stocks—but wasn’t really getting anywhere.
The piddly returns he was making that way seemed like a waste of time. He needed something better.
Luckily Jim worked at an office building in Chicago, close to the financial district.
One day he ran into a "trader" who shared an approach that would go on to change Jim's life forever.
So Jim started experimenting with the approach he learned...
Before long he was generating extra monthly income like $1,200, $1,800, and $2,100... and all in a matter of weeks!
His nest egg began to grow exponentially, and before long he had turned a mere $50,000 into a massive $5.3 million.
Now, years later, Jim trades full-time—and lets independent-minded investors follow the exact approach he's now perfected.
It’s an easy, step-by-step process that takes just 9 minutes to per week.
Best of all, unlike many risky approaches to making money, there's a built-in safety net unique to his strategy that can make it safer than traditional investing.
In fact, safety-loving Warren Buffett pulled in $4.7 billion following this exact approach not too long ago.
The full story behind how Jim makes his trades is right here.
