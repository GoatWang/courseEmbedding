Salma Hayek's Nuance Facial Serum









Pros
Cactus pear and a peptide


Cons
Thin consistency absorbs badly

Keenly priced with a couple of good actives but kojic acid may irritate sensitive skin


Salma Hayek’s much anticipated skincare line, Nuance, has finally been launched and, naturally, I immediately bought the nothing if not affordable Renewing and Brightening Facial Serum ($19.99 for 1oz at CVS) and tried it out for the first time over the weekend.  The 44-year old actress says that the line is inspired by her grandmother and the Facial Serum makes a big feature out of licorice. Before Salma Hayek’s line was launched there was a flurry of speculation that the star of the show would be something called concha nacar (mother of pearl) and that the actress would be using it to make a “lightening cream”. But now that the Nuance serum has debuted, it doesn’t even have a bit part.  In fact, the lightening role looks to be the job of a stable form of kojic acid (the third ingredient listed - aminopropyl kojyl phosphate). Now kojic acid, typically used as a skin whitener, is somewhat controversial and is certainly a strong irritant or sensitizer. In 2008, the European Union concluded that “data support the conclusion, that skin penetration in rats and humans is considerable” and that “the use of kojic acid at a maximum concentration of 1.0% in skin care formulations poses a risk to the health of the consumer.”  So at less than 1%, kojic acid may be relatively safe. However, the industry body, CIR says that at less than 1%, while safe, skin lightening wouldn’t be seen. I don’t know what the concentration is in Nuance, but I would assume that it is 1% or less. That’s good, but then am I to have low expectations for this product to work?  Despite my misgivings about kojic acid, I’m giving Nuance a try out on my neck. My skin seems a bit reaction-prone right now, so I am taking a cautious approach in case this serum irritates me.  Although the most dominant ingredient after water is unimpressively a thickening agent, pentaerythrityl tetraisostearate, I found the consistency of the Nuance Facial Serum to be a little on the thin side. Nor does it absorb very well, which tends to make the metal roller with which it is applied a bit redundant since I resorted to rubbing it in with my fingers.  There are a good number of decent botanicals in Nuance. I especially like omega 7 rich macadamia and mimosa (albizzia julibrissin) seems to have exciting possibilities as a free radical scavenger that is more potent than L-ascorbic acid. Probably the most impressive track record is held by cactus pear (opuntia), a cancer fighter that deploys an array of different antioxidants. Nuance also contains blue agave extract, but I’ve never been able to find much justification for its role in skincare. Licorice is supposed to play a key role in Nuance's serum and it is certainly an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, although less convincing as a skin lightener.  Another interesting inclusion is hexanoyl dipeptide-3 (which is lecithin and norleucine acetate) activates skin cell regeneration by stimulating the natural desquamation process of the skin, leading to a gentle peeling.  There are, of course, the usual suspects in the preservative department (sodium hydroxide and phenoxyethanol) and undisclosed fragrance. The above mentioned thickener emollient (pentaerythrityl tetraisostearate) has way too big a role. But that may be how the price of Nuance Facial Serum is kept at such a keen level. And for something that is under twenty bucks, I think the formulation is, on the face of it, pretty good. Now I just hope that my skin can cope with the kojic acid. I’ll report back in a while.

Can't find this product in the store or online anymore. Has it been discontinued? I love washing my face with it!!! What happened to it?

I am on first name bases with a dermatologist!  Frequent visits and expensive purchases resulted in this familiarity...I recently tried Nuance when it was on sale!

I can not believe the difference it has made in my complexion. The "Rosacea Redness" is completely gone..Truth!!!  The product is so much more reasonable than the dermatologist's products...I am so pleased and the product feels so refreshing!

I am radiant....

I am THRILLED.  After years of trying product after product with little in the result departments, I am THRILLED with the Nuance line.  This morning I noticed for the first time how much smoother my face is, how much the lines in my face and neck have been diminished.  Better still is an overall tightening of my skin.  I am a Nuance user for life.

I love her line omg I brought the facial gel with green tea extract and my skin felt great! I think her and her billionare truly invested some serious money to get this product right. I also use chanel and kheils but am adding if few if her products to my regimen in love!

This is to Salma:  I have been meaning to contact you for awhile.  I am a user of your Nuance product line, in particular, the cheek trio (Mauve).  Without fail, when ever I venture out, I receive so many compliments on my skin!!! Just out of the clear blue, people will walk up to me and tell me how beautiful my skin is! This product is luminiscent, and my skin looks healthy! (Even my Oncology doc is amazed!) I tell them it is the product I use.  One gal wanted to know if I could make her look as good as me.  It has been hard to find your products (in particular at CVS), I was afraid your line did not make it.  I bought a couple more products to try.  Your product has blessed me, for you see, I have terminal cancer.  No hair, (I wear caps - no wigs) no eylashes and no eyebrows!! So to have people tell me I have pretty skin, or compliment me, has really helped my state of mind.  I think this has a lot to do with my attitude with healing.  Even though I have baffled the docs with how I look, God and I will decide when it is time for me to go!! Thank you!!!  Love and Hugs!

I love her products especially since it is hard to find a paraben free and natural product that works! The moisturizer is a little creamy just use a little that is enough. Her makeup is great too love her lipstick! I am addicted to the packaging, smell and how it works! Please buy her products I need it to stay in stores!

I rarely rave about a product. I am raving. I love the AM/PM cream, and the Anti-Aging Eye Cream. I have not tried any of the other products, but love that these are obtainable locally, are affordable, and bring results! I will be 60, this August of 2012, and really am quite impressed, to say the least!

I picked up a trial size tube of the Curl Cream for my daughter's curly hair and allergy to man-made perfumes.  The cream is beyond amazing; how it smells, how it works, the cost... I'm sure there are other wonderful products in department stores for loads.  I love everything in the hair care line.  Now that I've found other people who've tried the skin care products, I'll be trying those out too.  For the cost, I love the products.

I find it beyond amazing, and confounding, that celebrities with the resources- not only financial, but say putting an assistant to work researching skincare and finding products and sites to obtain knowledge (textbook, critical knowledge, maybe not for themselves to knock around, but for the team who is going to put the product together) when they want to take the plunge themselves into this industry.

As you've cited, Marta, Salma's products isn't "bad," and my guess is she's aiming at the drugstore market who can't afford more. For this purpose I think she's probably offered an acceptable product... awaiting your approval. There are concerns, and I do trust your judgement.

My arguement here is celebrities on whole seem so clueless. It's my impression they will see a $500 price tag and believe that means they MUST be purchasing a select and dependable product. What I wouldn't give if TIA could reach in and help even more... more... ~jk

BUYERS: Salma Hayek and Francois-Henri PinaultSELLERS: Kelsey and Camille GrammerLOCATION: Bel Air Road, Bel Air, CAPRICE: $13,500,135SIZE: 6,811 square feet, 7 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms
YOUR MAMAS NOTES: All the tabs and blogs have been reporting on Salma Hayek’s purchase of the Bel Air Road mansion of perpetual house movers Kelsey Grammer and his wife Camille. Because of all the coverage, it’s not really necessary for Your Mama to weigh in on the subject. But we’re going to anyway. We can’t help it.
Kelse and Cammy have become well know by real estate gossips for their constant buying, selling, and moving. The chef barely has time to stock the pantry before these two are calling the movers and having their shit schlepped across town. For a full run down on the Grammer’s real estate run around, you should head over to Mister Big Time‘s impressive and long list of properties that have been bought and sold by this peripatetic pair in the last few years.







Your Mama confesses to a bit of anxiety about the Grammer’s constant property shuffle. We don’t worry so much about Kelse and Cammy, they’re grown and know how to read maps. It’s the two small children that have Your Mama breaking out in a cold sweat. The Grammer tykes have easily called four Los Angelese estates home in the last few years, and that’s not even counting the family properties in Hawaii, the Hamptons or the farm at the Delaware Water Gap. What happens if one of these little Grammer children gets lost? What’s the likelihood they’re going to remember the address of the estate they’re currently living? Poor things.
As far as we can tell, the big ol‘ house on Bel Air Road was not on the open market. But thanks to our Fairy Godmother in Bel Air, Your Mama was able to get our greedy little hands on a couple of photos. Now children, please note the photos above were taken before Mister Kelsey and his bleached blond wifey with the fake boobs purchased the home.
In early 2006, soon after selling their monstrous $22,000,000, 17,781 square foot house up in fancy-schmancy guard gated Beverly Park at a $4,5000,000 profit, the Grammers bought this house on swanky Bel Air Road from music executive Steve Drath. Property records show Kelse and Cammy paid $10,500,105 in February 2006 for the considerably smaller 6,811 square foot house with 7 bedrooms and 7 bathrooms. They must have felt down right cramped in this house compared to the hotel sized house in Bev Park.
Reports are all saying the Grammer’s sold the house to Salma Hayek and her baby daddy Francois-Henri Pinault for around $20,000,000. An extraordinary and upsetting profit if true. Can a house in Bel Air really double in value in just one year’s time?
It’s no wonder preggers Miz Hayek would want a big house in Bel Air nowadays. The Mexican actress has long owned a modestly sized 2,874 square foot house on secluded Chelan Place in the Hollywood Hills that is unlikely to comfortably house a new baby, a nanny, and the super rich baby daddy.
Plus, if your baby daddy is Monsieur Pinault, he had better be buying you some impressively big digs up in Bel Air to house the family. For those of you not well schooled in luxury goods, let Your Mama educate you a wee bit on French bizness man Monsieur Pinault. The man heads up a company called PPR, whose subsidiaries include glitzy fashion houses such as Gucci, Yves St. Laurent, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga. So you know this expecting behatcha has had some fierce maternity clothes custom made by the French couturiers, and baby Pinault will no doubt grow up with carte blanche expense accounts all up and down Rodeo Drive and the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.







The Bel Air Road house is surrounded by some of Bel Airs most expensive and impressive estates including that of Robert Tuttle, car dealership owner and Bush Jr. appointee as Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Also nearby, Sandy Krause, heir to the Pep Boys fortune, the Joregensen’s, who made their fortune selling metal tubes and rods, and the unnervingly large estate of Fresno-born billionaire Jerrold Perenchio, the Univision media mogul who was ranked as the 85th richest person in the world on the Forbes 400 list in 2006.
The 1930s era house occupies nearly an acre of plush grounds overlooking Bel Air and Los Angeles. Your Mama always finds it puzzling that a $20,000,000 property would not include a tennis court. Shouldn’t all estates over $10 million include every recreational bell and whistle imaginable? For that amount of money we expect a house will not only include a tennis court, but a resident tennis instructor with a deathly difficult to return serve and strong and sensitive hands for our after-match massage in the pool house.
Given that Miz Hayek has owned the Chelan Place house since 1986, when property records reveal she purchased the house for $375,000 (our records somehow, oddly, reflect different specifics than those of Mister Big Time), Your Mama doubts she will sell the place. It just doesn’t make sense to sell it. She can house her assistant there and let Monsieur Pinault pick up the landscaping bills.
As for the Grammers? Well, Your Mama hears they’re getting ready to close on yet another pricy property. This time it’s a 10,567 square foot, 5 bedroom, 6 bathroom estate located on Baroda Drive in the Holmby Hills, which they’re buying from baking soda heir Michael Hammer.
Your Mama sincerely hopes one of the nannies thinks to shove a slip of paper with the address of the new house in the pockets of the Grammer children so the poor dears know where to go after school.

Hunny,you don’t have to aplogize for nuthin. You are absolutely correct. Baroda Drive is indeed in the Homlby Hills and we’re going to amend the post to reflect.
For those that don’t know, the Holmby Hills is a small area North of Sunset (South of Sunset is Little Holmby) that is sandwiched between Beverly Hills and Bel Air. The properties in this area have a Bel Air address and a Bel Air zip code.

Regarding the steep profit Mr. Pinault is lining Mr. Grammar’s pockets with, it seems to be a growing trend among those with more money than they know what to do with when it comes to acquiring their dream home. Oprah was the first, and Tom Cruise the most recent before this. I like the older, traditional architecture of the house. The natural wood tone bank of doors across the bottom of the back looks out of place to me though.
