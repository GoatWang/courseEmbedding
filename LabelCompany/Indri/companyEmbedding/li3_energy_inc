NI 43-101: Summary
May 2012, Li3 reported the completion of the NI 43-101 Compliant Measured Report that summarizes and validates the results of Li3's $8 million Phase One Exploration and Development Program on its Maricunga Project in Chile, completed in December 2011.  The report was authored Mr. Don Hains, P.Geo and Frederik Reidel, CPG, both "Qualified Persons" (QPs), who are independent of Li3 as such terms are defined by Canadian Instrument NI 43-101.  While Li3 is not a Canada-listed issuer, among other things, the provisions of Li3's agreement with POSCO Canada refers to the Canadian standards for certain milestones.
 
The key highlights of the Compliant Measured Report include:
 

Further exploration work and expenditures are warranted to advance the Maricunga Project to the Feasibility Stage;
The property holds significant potential for development as a source of lithium, potassium and boron;
Exploration work indicates that the brines in the property are enriched in lithium and potassium and that the brine has a Mg/Li ratio permitting lithium recovery;
Lithium and potassium in situ resources are summarized below:

 





 


Notes:

Canadian Institute of Mining definitions were followed for Mineral Resources.
The Qualified Persons for this Mineral Resource estimate are Donald H. Hains, P. Geo and Frederik Reidel, CPG.
No cut-off values have been applied to the resource estimate
Numbers may not add due to rounding.
 


 

Expressed as compounds resources are estimated at:

 





 

It is believed that through the application of proprietary technology developed by Li3's strategic partners, lithium recovery from the Maricunga brine can be significantly enhanced and may increase from the typical 45% to over 70% of the contained lithium in the recovered brine:

 
The analysis of brine chemistry and laboratory testing at the University of Antofagasta indicates that lithium carbonate and potash can be economically recovered utilizing conventional technology. Li3 believes that using conventional production methods (50%), the company would achieve 300,000 tons of Recoverable Lithium Carbonate sufficient for a 20-year mine life at a rate of 15,000 tons per year of Lithium Carbonate production. A process flow-sheet has been developed for this conventional technology as Li3's "base case" process by Process and Environmental Consultancy of La Serna, Chile.  The extraction yield of the base case process from well brine to lithium carbonate is estimated to be 50%.
 
An improved process is being developed through the application of proprietary technology from Li3's Strategic Partner POSCO which has the potential to potentially improve the extraction yield from well brine to lithium carbonate to 70%.
 
The following table presents the potential Recoverable Lithium Carbonate based on the information presented in Table 1.2 and 1.3 of the NI 43-101 Report:
 





 
With  the NI 43-101 Compliant Measured Report complete, Li3 has begun to implement  the necessary development work to advance the Maricunga project into the  Feasibility Study stage.
 
 

Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors
 
 The United States Securities and Exchange Commission permits U.S. mining companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only those mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce. We use certain terms in this press release, such as "measured," "indicated," and "inferred" "resources," which the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit U.S. registered companies from including in their filings with the SEC. U.S. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q which may be secured from us, or accessed from the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml.

Li3 Energy Company Profile







 

 
Li3 Energy, Inc. is a South American-based exploration company in the lithium and potassium mining sector. Our

                        common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB under the ticker LIEG. We aim to acquire and develop lithium and

                        potassium brine deposits in South America and beyond.
 
Currently, we are focused on further exploring, developing and commercializing our flagship "Maricunga Project",

                        which consists of two adjacent properties: i) 60% controlling interest in SLM Litio 1-6 (1,438 hectares), and ii) the

                        Cocina Mining Concessions (450 hectares) acquired in April 2013. The project is fully funded until all construction

                        permits are obtained due to our partnership with BBL. We currently hold 49% of the project, which is located in the

                        northeast section of the Salar de Maricunga in Region III of Atacama in Northern Chile and is the second largest

                        lithium-bearing salt brine deposit in Chile. We are one of the only companies with an advanced exploration stage

                        lithium and potassium project within this region.
 
Company Goals:

Advance the Maricunga Project to the Feasibility Study stage
 Support global implementation of clean and green energy initiatives
 Meet growing lithium market demand
Become a mid-tier, low cost secondary supplier of lithium, potassium and other strategic minerals, serving

                        global clients in the energy, fertilizer and specialty chemical industries
 
Li3 Energy is led by a management team with extensive expertise in exploration, mining, minerals, finance and

                        commercialization. Our Board of Directors have advised, led and operated numerous mining entities. We also have a

                        highly experienced technical team.
 
Through our strategic partner POSCAN, we have been evaluating the use of advanced process technologies that

                        may further improve upon the economics and shorten the commercial production timeline of the Maricunga Project.

                        These technologies have been recently evaluated by POSCO in a pilot test facility, proving effective when measured

                        against the conventional lithium and potassium commercialization process.
 
According to the signumBOX Performance Index published in March 2014, the SLM Litio 1-6 mining concessions are

                        ranked as the fourth best undeveloped lithium project in the world out of 37 other brine salars, subject to obtaining

                        lithium exploitation permits. Maricunga is the highest ranked undeveloped lithium brine project in Chile and after

                        Atacama, the Salar de Maricunga has the second highest quality deposit of lithium in Chile.

                        We are an exploration stage company and as such, we have never generated revenues from operations and

                        currently do not expect to generate any such revenues in the near term.

SANTIAGO, Chile, April 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Li3 Energy, Inc., (OTCQB: LIEG) ("Li3", "Li3 Energy" or the "Company"), a US-listed and South America based global exploration company in the lithium and minerals sector which holds an interest in the Maricunga lithium project in Northern Chile, announced today the commencement of the next phase of exploration and development work on its flagship Maricunga Project in northern Chile.  Work began in February with pumping tests and geophysical work, as well as other work to further progress towards the production phase.  
Additionally, Li3 announces several other initiatives:
-  After careful review by the Board of Directors, the decision was taken to continue the quotation of the Company's common stock on the OTCQB Marketplace to provide shareholders with the most appropriate measure of our commitment and transparency.
-  The Company has reduced a significant amount of its liabilities, including approximately $800,000 in penalties, fees, and interest relating to Registration Statement penalties.  The Company successfully reached a settlement with the investors that were entitled to this penalty and fees at a significant discount, in exchange for shares in Li3, thus also preserving its cash resources.  This is a significant milestone for the Company in its efforts to improve its balance sheet.
-  The Board of Directors approved a wide range of additional cost cutting initiatives designed to continue to reduce costs and preserve cash, which the Company believes will further enable the advancement of the Maricunga project.  The cost reductions included administrative and operational expenses, streamlining various Board committees, salary reductions for senior management and the reduction of liabilities resulting in the termination of key employees.  Through this cash saving exercise, Li3's management and Board remains committed to Li3 and advancing its projects.
-  Li3 continues to evaluate various strategic options and financing alternatives to further strengthen its position during these challenging market conditions.
Luis Saenz, CEO of Li3 commented, "Whereas many other companies have been forced to shut down given the difficult market conditions, Li3 continues to move forward in conjunction with the positive signs coming from the Chilean government, as stated in our January 28, 2015 press release, and the lithium markets as a whole."
"We believe the work being done on the Maricunga Project and the settlement of the liabilities is a significant step that will make a considerable difference as we look at strategic opportunities, and that the drastic reduction in costs will ensure the long - term viability of the Company given its limited cash and uncertain equity markets," commented Patrick Cussen, Chairman of Li3.
