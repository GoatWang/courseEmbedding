Investment Philosophy
The equity management strategy employed by Cambridge Financial Group is based on the belief that quantitative disciplines, which contain both buying and selling parameters, will add value to a portfolio. The use of two independent, contrasting styles, and defensive action when the market is determined to be in a high-risk period, will add consistency.
