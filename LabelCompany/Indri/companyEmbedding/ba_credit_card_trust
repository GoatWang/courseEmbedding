                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Industry Developments


Bank of America, National Association (�BANA�) issues credit cards on MasterCard�s and Visa�s networks.� MasterCard and Visa are subject to settlement obligations relating to certain litigations and continue to be subject to significant ongoing litigations, including class actions, and increased competition.� These settlements and litigations are based on, among other things, claimed violations of United States federal antitrust laws, claims that currency conversion fees were wrongly applied on purchases of goods and services in foreign countries, and claims alleging that the interchange charged by MasterCard and Visa is impermissible.� The costs associated with these settlements, litigations and other matters could cause MasterCard and Visa to invest less in their networks and marketing efforts and could adversely affect the interchange paid to their member banks, including BANA.

Litigation


In 2005, a group of merchants filed a series of putative class actions and individual actions directed at interchange fees associated with Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions.� These actions, which were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the caption In Re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Anti-Trust Litigation (�Interchange�), named Visa, MasterCard and several banks and bank holding companies, including Bank of America Corporation, as defendants.� Plaintiffs alleged that defendants conspired to fix the level of default interchange rates and that certain rules of Visa and MasterCard related to merchant acceptance of payment cards at the point of sale were unreasonable restraints of trade under the Sherman Act. Plaintiffs sought unspecified damages and injunctive relief.


On October 19, 2012, defendants, including Bank of America Corporation (�BAC�), settled the matter. The settlement provides for, among other things, (i) payments by defendants to the class and individual plaintiffs totaling approximately $6.6 billion, allocated proportionately to each defendant based upon loss-sharing agreements; (ii) distribution to class merchants of an amount equal to 10 basis points of default interchange across all Visa and MasterCard credit card transactions for a period of eight consecutive months, which period began on July 29, 2013, which otherwise would have been paid to Visa and MasterCard issuers, including BAC, and which effectively reduces credit interchange for that period of time; and (iii) modifications to certain Visa and MasterCard rules regarding merchant point of sale practices.


The court granted final approval of the class settlement agreement on December 13, 2013. Several class members have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In addition, a number of the class members opted out of the settlement of their past damages claims. The cash portion of the settlement was adjusted downward as a result of these opt-outs.


BAC was named as a defendant in two of the opt-out suits brought by merchant class members. As a result of various sharing agreements from the main Interchange litigation, BAC remains liable for any settlement or judgment in opt-out suits where it is not named as a defendant. All but one of the opt-out suits filed to date have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. In addition, in December 2013, a putative class action was filed by cardholders in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging claims under the Sherman Act and under California state law. In June 2014, the cardholder action was transferred to the Eastern District of New York and consolidated with the opt-out suits. On July 18, 2014, the court denied defendants� motion to dismiss the complaints filed by the merchant class members who opted out of the settlement, and one
of the two suits brought by the merchant class members has since been settled. On November 26, 2014, the court granted defendants� motion to dismiss the Sherman Act claim brought by the cardholder plaintiffs, but denied the motion as to the state law claims; the parties have moved for reconsideration of this decision, and have also appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.


Regulatory Developments


On April 7, 2014, FIA Card Services, National Association (�FIA�) and BANA entered into separate Consent Orders with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the �OCC�) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the �CFPB�). The Consent Order with the OCC resolves its investigation into billing and fulfillment practices concerning identity theft protection products, including those marketed and billed by vendors. The Consent Order with the CFPB resolves its investigation into billing and fulfillment practices concerning identity theft protection products, including those marketed and billed by vendors, and also resolves its investigation into marketing, sales and fulfillment practices concerning certain credit card debt cancellation products. Pursuant to the Consent Orders, FIA and BANA paid, in April 2014, $45 million in civil monetary penalties and will provide approximately
$738 million in refunds to affected consumers, a substantial amount of which has previously been refunded to consumers. The penalties and customer refund payments are covered by previously established reserves. In addition, BANA has agreed to certain enhancements in its vendor, third-party provider and risk management programs for certain products.

Legal Proceedings Involving The Bank of New York Mellon


In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New York Mellon is named as a defendant in or made a party to pending and potential legal actions. In connection with its role as trustee of certain residential mortgage-backed securitization (�RMBS�) transactions, The Bank of New York Mellon was named as a defendant in a lawsuit brought by a group of institutional investors. This lawsuit alleges that the trustee had expansive duties under the governing agreements, including the duty to investigate and pursue breach of representation and warranty claims against other parties to the RMBS transactions. While it is inherently difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of pending actions, The Bank of New York Mellon denies liability and intends to defend the litigation vigorously.


The Bank of New York Mellon has provided us with the information in the paragraph above in response to the requirements of Regulation AB.� Other than the above paragraph and the information concerning The Bank of New York Mellon specified in this Form 10-K under the caption Item 1122 of Regulation AB: Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria and in Exhibit 33.2 to this Form 10-K, The Bank of New York Mellon has not participated in the preparation of, and is not responsible for, any other information contained in this Form 10-K.

Item 1122 of Regulation AB: Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria.


Merger of FIA into BANA:�On October 1, 2014, FIA and BANA consummated the merger of FIA with and into BANA, with BANA as the surviving entity. References to �BANA� in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include BANA�s predecessors, including FIA, unless the context requires otherwise.


In connection with the merger, BANA assumed FIA�s rights and obligations with respect to its credit card business, including responsibility for originating the accounts in the Bank Portfolio and servicing the credit card receivables in the Master Trust II Portfolio.


(a) Item 1122 Reports: Each of BANA, with respect to itself and its affiliated servicing participants, and The Bank of New York Mellon (each, a �Servicing Participant�) has been identified by the registrant as a party participating in the servicing function with respect to the pool assets held by each of BA Master Credit Card Trust II and BA Credit Card Trust.� Each Servicing Participant has completed a report on assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to such Servicing Participant (each, a �Report on Assessment�), which Reports on Assessment are attached as exhibits to this Form 10-K.� In addition, each of the Servicing Participants has provided an attestation report (each, an �Attestation Report�) by a registered independent public accounting firm regarding its related Report
on Assessment.� Each Attestation Report is attached as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. We have not independently verified the accuracy of The Bank of New York Mellon�s assertions or the related attestations of its registered independent public accounting firm.


A Servicing Participant may engage one or more vendors to perform specific and limited activities that address all or a portion of one or more servicing criteria applicable to such Servicing Participant.� Each Servicing Participant indicates that it has instituted policies and procedures to monitor whether its vendors� activities comply in all material respects with such servicing criteria, and has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to its vendors� activities in such Servicing Participant�s Report on Assessment.


Except as disclosed below, no Report on Assessment or related Attestation Report has identified (i) any material instance of noncompliance with the servicing criteria identified in such Report on Assessment as applicable to the related Servicing Participant or (ii) any material deficiency in such Servicing Participant�s policies and procedures to monitor vendor compliance.


Exceptions:


Bank of America, National Association:� BANA�s Report on Assessment and the related Attestation Report prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have identified material noncompliance with one servicing criterion applicable to BANA � servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(v), which contemplates that BANA�s records regarding the pool assets agree with its records with respect to an obligor�s unpaid principal balance.


Prior to February 5, 2015, BANA utilized two payment prioritization methodologies when servicing credit card accounts.� The cardholder cycle payment methodology was utilized for customer calculations such as balance subject to finance charge, finance charges billed, and statement balance reporting functions.� The daily trust payment methodology was utilized for reporting on the assets in the BA Master Credit Card Trust II portfolio.


The two previously utilized methodologies agreed on the total outstanding balance and total payments received for each credit card account, but they varied with respect to the component principal receivable and finance charge receivable balances.� This variance was primarily due to differences in the prioritization applied to payments and credit adjustments under each of the two methodologies. Please refer to the endnotes to Exhibit 99.1 in the registrant�s distribution report on Form 10-D, filed with the SEC on March 16, 2015, for a description of the two payment prioritization methodologies previously utilized by BANA.


On February 5, 2015, BANA implemented a systems initiative that consolidated these methodologies into a single payment prioritization methodology.� This consolidated methodology prioritizes payments and credit adjustments to balances similar to the cardholder methodology but does so on a daily basis similar to the trust methodology.
�

Platform-Level Reports:


Regulations of the SEC require that each servicing participant complete a report on assessment at a �platform� level, meaning that the transactions covered by the report on assessment should include all asset-backed securities transactions involving such servicing participant that are backed by the same asset type.� Subsequent guidance from the SEC staff identifies additional parameters that a servicing participant may apply to define and further limit its platform.� For example, a servicing participant may define its platform to include only transactions that were completed on or after January 1, 2006 (the effective date for Regulation AB) and that were registered with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933.� Each servicing participant is responsible for defining its own platform, and each platform will naturally differ based on various factors, including the servicing participant�s business
model, the transactions in which it is involved and the range of activities performed in those transactions.


(b) Other Reports:� BANA has completed an assertion letter which states that, as of June 30, 2015, its controls over the functions performed as servicer of BA Master Credit Card Trust II and BA Credit Card Trust are effective in providing reasonable assurance that BA Master Credit Card Trust II and BA Credit Card Trust assets in the possession of or under the control of BANA, as servicer, are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, as specified in the applicable agreements.� PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has produced an accountants report attesting to the fairness of such assertion as of June 30, 2015.� Such assertion letter and related accountants report is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K.


Item 1123 of Regulation AB: Servicer Compliance Statement.


BANA has been identified by the registrant as a servicer with respect to the pool assets held by each of BA Master Credit Card Trust II and BA Credit Card Trust.� BANA has provided a statement of compliance with the related servicing agreement (the �Compliance Statement�), signed by an authorized officer of BANA.� The Compliance Statement is attached as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

Fitch Affirms BA Credit Card TrustHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,469.91-2.63 (-0.11%)Dow 3021,513.17-66.90 (-0.31%)Nasdaq6,410.81+23.05 (+0.36%)Fitch Affirms BA Credit Card TrustBusiness WireDecember 9, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed the long-term ratings and Rating Outlooks assigned to BA Credit Card Trust as follows:BA Credit Card Trust (BACCT)--2004-3A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--2007-1A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--2007-4A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable--2007-11A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--2014-1A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--2014-3A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--2015-1A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--2015-2A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations are based on continued stable trust performance and robust breakeven multiples. Fitch has maintained the Stable Outlook on the notes due to the strong trust performance and ability to generate robust excess spread.Over the past 12 months, gross yield has been performing within Fitch's steady state expectations. As of the November 2016 reporting period, the 12-month average gross yield was 16.12% compared to the 12-month average of 16.18% as of the November 2015 reporting period.Gross charge-offs registered a slight improvement over the past year. The current 3- and 12- month averages are 2.89% and 3.04%, respectively. At last year's review over the same period, the 12-month average was 3.11%.Sixty-plus-day delinquencies fell to an all-time low of 1.12% at the November 2016 reporting period, compared to 1.24% at the November 2016 reporting period.Monthly payment rate (MPR), a measure of how quickly consumers are paying off their debt, has remained relatively stable over the past year. The current 12-month average was 17.08%, compared to 16.97% a year ago.Fitch runs cash flow breakeven analysis by applying stress scenarios to 3-, 6-, and 12-month average performance to test that under the stressed conditions, the transaction can withstand a level of losses commensurate with the risk associated to a rating level with the available credit enhancement. The variables that Fitch stresses are the gross yield, MPR, gross charge-off, and purchase rates. The break-even loss level output for the notes provides an indication of the remoteness of the class of notes to stressed performance deterioration. For further information, please review Fitch's U.S. Credit Card ABS Issuance updates published on a monthly basis.The affirmations are based on the performance of the trusts in line with expectations. The Stable Outlook on the senior notes indicates that Fitch expects the ratings will remain stable for the next one to two years.Fitch's analysis included a comparison of observed performance trends over the past few months to Fitch's base case expectations for each outstanding rating category. As part of its ongoing surveillance efforts, Fitch will continue to monitor the performance of this trust.CRITERIA VARIATIONSEligible Investments: Fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing counterparty risk and assessing a counterparty's creditworthiness, as per the Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds, dated Sept. 1, 2016. The definition of eligible investments for this deal allows for the possibility of using investments not rated by Fitch, which represents a criteria variation. Since the only available funds to invest are monthly collections, and the funds can only be invested for a short duration of one month given the payment frequency of the notes, Fitch doesn't currently believe such variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned.Eligible Institution: Fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing counterparty risk and assessing a counterparty's creditworthiness, as per the Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds, dated Sept. 1, 2016. The definition of eligible institutions for this deal allows for the possibility of using a depository institution rated at a level which does not meet the Fitch counterparty criteria for a 'AAAsf' rated note. Since Bank of America, National Association (BANA) as holder of the collection account currently maintains a 'A+'/'F1'/Stable Outlook rating and The Bank of New York Mellon, as holder of the finance charge and principal accounts currently maintains a 'AA/'F1+'/Stable Outlook rating, Fitch doesn't currently believe such a variation has a measurable impact upon the ratings assigned.RATING SENSITIVITIESFitch models three different scenarios when evaluating the rating sensitivity compared to expected performance for credit card asset-backed securities transactions: 1) increased defaults; 2) a reduction in purchase rate, and 3) a combination stress of higher defaults and lower MPR.Read MoreIncreasing defaults alone has no impact on rating migration even in the most severe scenario of a 75% increase in defaults. The rating sensitivity to a reduction in purchase rate also does not result in rating migration even in the most severe scenario of a 100% reduction in purchase rate. The harshest scenario assumes both stresses to defaults and MPR to occur simultaneously. The ratings would only be downgraded under the severe stress of a 75% increase in defaults and 40% reduction in MPR. To date, the transactions have exhibited strong performance with all performance metrics within Fitch's initial expectations. For further discussion of sensitivity analysis, please see the new issue report related to one of the transactions listed above.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action.Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Interest Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bonds (pub. 26 Oct 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/888492Global Credit Card ABS Rating Criteria (pub. 21 Jul 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/885146Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1016235Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1016235Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
