For Damaged ACLs, It’s Aperion and Pig Tendons to the Rescue- Featured in Xconomy
















2 October 2015




"The premise of Aperion Biologics’ business is a bit of a no-brainer: Provide the market with a product used to repair anterior cruciate ligaments of the knee, because there is demand and not necessarily enough supply.
The way the San Antonio, TX-based company does that is a bit more complicated. Aperion uses a patented process to make pig tissue such as tendons, which are readily available, usable for human ACL reconstruction. Normally, the human body rejects animal tissue that doctors try to use surgically..."

9 September 2015




"Aperion Biologics has taken major steps towards making xenografts a competitive alternative for use in the nearly one million ACL reconstruction surgeries performed globally every year. A xenograft is tissue taken from one species and transplanted into another, however they are not commonly used since there is a high risk that the transplant will be rejected by the human immune system and lead to serious complications..."

Animal ligaments can repair human knees - ABC 7 News Story on Kevin R. Stone's work on the Z-Lig
















14 April 2015




Bay Area researchers have developed a new technique to help repair injured knees. It could someday change the way many surgeries are done. 
From bike riding to basketball, it would be hard to find a sport that Marty doesn't like. But the financial manager, who asked us not use his last name, also paid a painful price with his right knee.
"I'd just torn my ACL playing basketball for the second time in that knee. I had a pretty bad experience the first time, I had a patellar tendon graft, very painful, took a long time getting back to being active," he says.

 The Downsides of Autografts in ACL Injuries 
 14 Oct 2015  

 Just How Common are ACL Injuries, and Where Does Replacement Tissue Come From?  
 23 Sep 2015  

 Animal Tissue that Becomes Your Own 
 25 Aug 2015  


 



 





 
















For Patients
What is Z-Lig? 


Z-Lig is new option for revision and multiligament ACL reconstruction surgeries. It is safe and effective, and is used in a standard surgical approach. Z-Lig addresses the risk of tissue rejection and is designed to create better results for the patient.
The ACL (the anterior cruciate ligament) lives inside of your knee joint.  When the ACL is torn, it affects function of the knee, limits movement and causes pain.










How Z-Lig works: 





1







We take the safe tissues ...


Animal tissue is harvested from ISO certified facilities with the strongest attention to safety and quality.










2







... and strip them of antigens that cause rejection.


Tissue is chemically processed.  Alpha-galactosidase enzyme is used to remove the key carbohydrate responsible for acute rejection.










3







After implementation, the Z-Lig, regenerates into the patient's own tissue.


Z-Lig is humanized, through our patented process which produces human immune system compatible tissue.










4







Surgeons use Z-Lig like any other graft.


Z-Lig is ready to use, and has been designed to require no changes in surgical technique.










5







This is designed to create better results for patients.


After surgery, the tissue remodels itself over time to be indistinguishable from the patient's own tissue.

Real patient story













 

ACL reconstruction for pro-skier using Z-Lig, a natural alternative tissue - 11 years post op



In 2002, Canadian Pro Skier Rick Lewon had his right ACL reconstructed by Dr. Kevin Stone, using a Z-Lig replacement device a natural alternative tissue engineered from porcine tissue. Dr. Stone's treatment was a medical breakthrough and the first non-human biologic method for ACL reconstruction of the knee. After this surgery, Lewon went on to win numerous Canadian Downhill Masters titles. 11 years later, his Xenograft is still going strong and is doing a lot better than the ACL reconstruction he had done on his left leg, which used his own hamstring. Lewon says he is hoping to one day get the Z-Lig on on that knee too.
Z-Lig is approved for use in select indications in the European Union

















 

ACL reconstruction using Z-Lig, a natural alternative tissue | Patient Story - 13 years post op



One of the first patients in the world to have a xenograft ligament replacement using porcine tissue, Canadian Pro Skier Rick Lewon had his right ACL reconstructed by Dr. Kevin Stone. After this surgery, Lewon went on to win numerous Canadian Downhill Masters titles. Now 13 years later the Z-Lig, is still going strong and is doing a lot better than the ACL reconstruction he had done on his left leg, which used his own hamstring.

ACL reconstruction using Z-Lig, a natural tissue alternative | Patient Story - 9 years post op



Mike had both of his ACLs replaced at different times with different procedures. He is able to compare what it's like to have his ACLs rebuilt with the Z-Lig replacement device vs an autograft (using his own tissue). His first ACL replacement was in his left knee and was done using tissue harvested from his own patella tendon.

ACL reconstruction using Z-Lig, a natural tissue alternative | Patient Story- 9 years post op



Marlise tore her Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) in a ski accident. She had an ACL reconstruction using a Z-Lig replacement device, a a natural tissue alternative engineered from porcine tissue (rather than relying on scarce human donor tissue or using tissue from her own body such as a patella tendon.) Less than a year after surgery she reported that her knee had full range of motion, no pain and was totally back to normal. She says "It's now 9 years later and I feel great. I ski, I run, I hike, I can do anything I want."
Z-Lig is approved for use in select indications in the European Union

















 

World Champion Ski Racer and Z-Lig Patient for Knee Surgery



Ski Racing in 2003, RL ruptured his right knee ACL. In the previous decade, he had torn his left ACL and had it surgically reconstructed with his own tissue or autograft. RL was enrolled in the pilot FDA clinical trial of the Z-Lig BTB device (an investigational ACL reconstruction device) developed by Aperion Biologics, Inc. Twelve years post ACL reconstruction, this device continues to perform successfully. RL continues as a professional ski instructor and racer and has averaged over 100 ski days a year. In addition, RL has won the Canadian Masters Ski Championship three times with the Z-Lig device.

ACL reconstruction using Z-Lig, a natural tissue alternative | Patient Story - 12 years post op



Our patient Mike ruptured his right ACL while Limbo dancing at a wedding. He had it repaired using the Z-Lig ligament replacement device engineered from porcine tissue. Previously, Mike had ruptured his left ACL and had it repaired using an autograft from his own patella tendon. "The experiences could not have been more different" he says. Unlike the autograft, the Z-Lig procedure and the recovery was minimal. "In fact, I was a bit worried because my knee was so stable and so pain free that I thought I might damage the knee somehow because it felt so good so soon!" He now does all the things he does before the surgery, league basketball, coaches baseball, plays with his dog. In fact, he says "because of the physical therapy and the activities I went though, I think it's better than it was before the injury"

About









It's not just about the knee.
Aperion Biologics, Inc. is a commercial-stage medical device company. Aperion Biologics’ solutions fall into the category of regenerative medicine, one of the most promising areas in medicine.
The company has developed and patented a technique to make animal-tissues usable for human applications without causing rejection. This platform, Z-Process®, is the basis for many potential new applications in human health, with many different kinds of tissues in the body.
Our first product, Z-Lig provides biologic solutions to orthopedic problems, specifically the knee. We started with the knee as it’s part of a larger mission of wanting to see people live more active lives for a longer period of time. The demand for alternative orthopedic solutions is expected to grow, due to the expanding aging and active population suffering from degenerative ailments. 
Aperion Biologics is committed to expanding the benefits of our regenerative biologic devices in the global community, with the highest value on safety. Z-Lig tissue is sourced from ISO 22442 compliant facilities. In addition, the European Commission has issued legislation on the welfare of farmed animals throughout their lifecycle. Any meat or animal products imported into European union countries must follow these guidelines.

Z-Lig Comparison Chart


















Product Information


The Z-Lig family of devices are tissue based ACL reconstruction devices. The tissue source is porcine. 
The device comes in a BTB (bone-tendon-bone) or a BT+ (bone-tendon-bone extension) configuration.
BTB: Part Number 7100
BT+: Part Number 7300















The Science behind Z-Lig


ACL injuries are common. There are an estimated 2,6M ACL injuries annually globally, and about a third of them require reconstruction. Z-Lig is designed to make ACL reconstruction procedures easier for patients and surgeons
The Z-Lig device as an immunocompatible, porcine-derived ACL reconstruction alternative which potentially provides a readily available, off-the-shelf solution and is strong, sterile, and reproducible.
The Z-Lig has been granted CE Mark approval for revision and multi-ligament ACL reconstruction procedures
It is the first and only solution of it’s kind, with 14 patents worldwide.
Aperion Biologics, Inc. developed and patented a technique to make animal-tissues usable for human applications without causing rejection.
The core platform technology is an enzymatic stripping of the key carbohydrate antigens followed by a unique conversion process that both “humanizes” and sterilizes the tissues without affecting their biomechanical or biological properties. This tissue scaffold provides mechanical stability and function while being biologically integrated and remodeled.
Rejection is the major obstacle preventing the use of animal derived tissue in human transplantation. Historically, tissue rejection was addressed by complete tissue crosslinking incorporating associated antigens into a non-remodelable prosthesis, much like leather. The complete crosslinking process renders a “permanent” tissue implant that inhibits human host cells of being incorporated and remodeled into natural biological tissue. Previous attempts at developing an animal derived tissue device have failed due to inflammation or adverse biological reactions.
To solve the xenotransplant rejection problems mentioned above, Aperion developed the Z-Process™. The Z-Process™ is a proprietary process that immunochemically modifies animal tissue to be compatible with the human immune system. Aperion uses α-galactosidase enzyme to cleave the terminal α-gal antigen so that the carbohydrate chain remaining on the animal tissue is the same in its structure as the carbohydrate chains present in humans. The Z-Process™ deactivates both αalpha-gal and non-gal antigens on the xenograft tissue to prevent rejection.
Aperion’s proprietary method addresses both the xenograft rejection as well as the ability to encourage a biological response to an implant.
The Z-Lig device as an immunocompatible, porcine-derived ACL reconstruction alternative which provides a readily available, off-the-shelf solution and is strong, sterile, and reproducible. The manufacturing process and subsequent product are protected by over 14 issued patents.
Aperion’s Z-Process™ of humanizing and sterilizing tissue can be applicable to a variety of tissues from orthopedic ligaments, bone, and meniscus to valves and vessels to soft tissue grafts for augmentation and repair.

Patents & Intellectual Property


An extensive intellectual property portfolio protects Aperion product candidates and Z-Process™ technology. Currently, 14 U.S. and international patents have been issued and a number are pending. Aperion’s patent portfolio includes claims relating to treatment and application of specific tissues for a variety of medical and surgical uses. The intellectual property portfolio includes combined patents of process and material composition that support deantigenation, sterilization and viral inactivation of a wide range of biological tissues. Aperion has exclusive rights to the only known method for humanizing non-primate animal grafts for replacement of ligaments, bone, etc. in humans without making the graft inert.
Patents regarding Z-Process™ include coverage of key immunochemical modification and sterilization techniques as applied to a variety of animal-derived tissues, including connective tissue grafts (tendon, ligament, articular cartilage and fibrocartilage); cardiovascular tissues (heart valve and pericardium); and calcified and de-calcified bone (granular bone matrix, cortical and cancellous structural bone for struts, cages and machined implants). The patent portfolio also includes immunochemical modifications of solubilized and homogenized dermal- and tendon-derived injectable collagen formulations.

About









It's not just about the knee.
Aperion Biologics, Inc. is a commercial-stage medical device company. Aperion Biologics’ solutions fall into the category of regenerative medicine, one of the most promising areas in medicine.
The company has developed and patented a technique to make animal-tissues usable for human applications without causing rejection. This platform, Z-Process®, is the basis for many potential new applications in human health, with many different kinds of tissues in the body.
Our first product, Z-Lig provides biologic solutions to orthopedic problems, specifically the knee. We started with the knee as it’s part of a larger mission of wanting to see people live more active lives for a longer period of time. The demand for alternative orthopedic solutions is expected to grow, due to the expanding aging and active population suffering from degenerative ailments. 
Aperion Biologics is committed to expanding the benefits of our regenerative biologic devices in the global community, with the highest value on safety. Z-Lig tissue is sourced from ISO 22442 compliant facilities. In addition, the European Commission has issued legislation on the welfare of farmed animals throughout their lifecycle. Any meat or animal products imported into European union countries must follow these guidelines.

Key Points About Aperion
Blogs: Aperion











Aperion Biologics, Inc. (Closely held)
Aperion is a medical device company seeking to improve the supply, cost, and performance of new types of tissue graft material, as is used in knee reconstruction among other procedures. The Company has developed and patented the Z-Process® technology, which enables immunochemical modifications to animal tissue to make it compatible with the human immune system. Aperion’s lead product, the Z-Lig®, targets the $2 billion anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction market. There are an estimated 2.6 million ACL injuries worldwide every year. Z-Lig® may be the first “off-the-shelf,” biologic xenograft (porcine-derived) to provide a consistently healthy and strong tissue graft option for ACL reconstruction, as Z-Lig® has been shown to maintain a biological scaffold that supports the regeneration of a new ligament. This is a key development as existing non-human synthetic graft options (which are to date available only in parts of Europe) cannot regenerate native tissue and thus ultimately have a high failure rate. Aperion’s Z-Lig® received a CE Mark in April 2014 for revision and multi-ligament procedures and is available to registered physicians and surgical facilities through distribution partners in Europe and South Africa. Aperion has FDA clearance to begin pivotal U.S. trials of Z-Lig® and has completed a pilot safety study in the U.S. with favorable results. In addition, the Company has a pipeline of product candidates in development, based on the Z-Process® technology for reducing the likelihood of xenograft tissue rejection, for applications in orthopaedics, general and urogynecological surgery, bone grafting, wound healing, and heart valve replacement.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, Sept. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- For immediate release: Today Aperion Biologics, Inc. announces that it has filed an Offering Statement on Form 1-A with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise $20 million in a public offering of common stock under SEC Regulation A. The offering will be conducted on a best-efforts basis by WR Hambrecht + Co. as the sole underwriter.  The number of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined.
Regulation A, an exemption from registration for smaller issuers of securities under SEC rules, was recently updated and expanded by the SEC, as mandated by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act. The new rules are often referred to as Regulation A+ and are designed to facilitate smaller companies' access to capital and provide investors with more investment choices. WR Hambrecht + Co, like Hambrecht & Quist, the storied boutique investment bank that came before it, is at the vanguard of this new trend to provide growth capital to early stage companies.
About Aperion Biologics
Aperion Biologics, Inc. is a commercial-stage medical device company addressing the significant need for an alternative to human-based sources of tissues to be used in surgical procedures.  Its lead product, the Z-Lig®, is produced by a patent-protected process for porcine tendons and its safety and performance was demonstrated in clinical trials in the U.S., Europe and South Africa.  The Company received a CE Mark (the regulatory permission to market the product in Europe) for use initially as a knee joint anterior cruciate ligament replacement in revision and multiligament procedures, which allows the Company to distribute the Z-Lig in any market which recognizes this approval.  The Company also has FDA unconditional approval to conduct a pivotal clinical trial in the United States for its Z-Lig product.
About WR Hambrecht + Co 
WR Hambrecht + Co focuses on raising growth capital for a variety of different enterprises, including life sciences companies.  Like its predecessor firm, Hambrecht & Quist, WRH+Co, seeks to identify high prospect growth-stage companies, and then enable access to the capital necessary to fund development, marketing and infrastructure so that these companies can achieve their full potential.  WRH+Co's Regulation A+ strategy is a continuation of Bill Hambrecht's legacy of conducting small public offerings for what were once considered high-risk start-ups that are now household names and Fortune 500 companies.
The offering is being made only by means of an offering circular.  An offering statement on Form 1-A relating to these securities has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission but has not yet become qualified.  You may obtain a copy of the most recent version of the preliminary offering circular with the following link: http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1439026/000092963815000751/a69629_partsiiandiii.htm These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the offering statement is qualified. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
No money or other consideration is being solicited in connection this press release, and if sent in response, will not be accepted. No offer to buy the securities can be accepted and no part of the purchase price can be received until the offering statement on Form 1-A is qualified pursuant to Regulation A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and any such offer may be withdrawn or revoked, without obligation or commitment of any kind, at any time before notice of its acceptance given after the qualification date.  Any person's indication of interest involves no obligation or commitment of any kind.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, April 22, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Aperion Biologics, Inc. was granted the CE Mark approval for its lead product, the Z-Lig™ ACLR device, to be used by surgeons in the European Union and other territories that accept the CE Mark.
The Z-Lig™ is the first engineered biologic device for treatment of revision and multiligament anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee reconstruction to be granted a CE Mark or to be approved anywhere worldwide.
Aperion conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial in Europe and South Africa that demonstrated biological acceptance of its bioengineered porcine tendons, re-establishment of knee stability, and remodeling over time into the patient's own human ligament. U.S. clinical evaluation is pending final discussions with the FDA on its approved pivotal clinical study of the Z-Lig™.
Over 600,000 ACL reconstruction surgeries are performed around the globe annually, using either a patient's own tissue (autografts) or cadaver tissue (allografts). Prior attempts at use of animal tissue or synthetic grafts to meet the high demands of the knee have proven unsuccessful. The Z-Lig™ provides a revolutionary new option for patients around the world. Aperion's device is designed to provide immediate stability and function to the knee while promoting gradual remodeling into human tissue over time.
"The international trial and CE Mark approval independently confirm the successful results we saw in our US pilot study which now has patients with Z-Lig™ devices 10 years after implantation," says Kevin R. Stone, M.D., the founder of Aperion Biologics. "The advantage of an off-the-shelf, biologic device is it avoids the weakening of the patient by taking their own tissue." (Dr. Stone was not a participant in the CE Mark trial).
About Aperion Biologics, Inc.
Aperion Biologics, Inc., located in San Antonio, Texas, is a privately owned, medical device company addressing the need for alternatives to human-based grafts with animal-based tissue technology. Aperion developed and patented a technique to make animal tissues compatible for challenging human applications. The core platform technology utilizes the Company's proprietary Z-Process™, which removes the key antigens from animal tissues, followed by a conversion process that both stabilizes and sterilizes the tissue without affecting its biomechanical or biological properties. This creates functioning scaffolds capable of remodeling into healthy tissue. Aperion's Z-Process™ is applicable to a variety of tissues used in orthopaedic, cardiovascular, plastic, general and other surgical specialties. The Z-Lig™ ACLR Device is approved for revision and multiligament ACL procedures in the EU, and Aperion now has the opportunity to pursue markets recognizing the CE Mark. Currently, the device is not commercially approved for sale in the United States or other markets.
