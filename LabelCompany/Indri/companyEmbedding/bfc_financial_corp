Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Bfc Financial Corporation (NYSE:BBX) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Overview  BFC Financial Corporation ("BFC" or, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, "we", "us", "our" or the "Company") is a holding company. BFC's principal holdings include its investment in BBX Capital Corporation (including its subsidiaries, ("BBX Capital") and a direct 54% equity interest in Woodbridge Holdings, LLC ("Woodbridge"). Woodbridge owns 100% of Bluegreen Corporation including its subsidiaries, ("Bluegreen"). BBX Capital owns the remaining 46% equity interest in Woodbridge.  We hold shares of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock, which is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), and Class B Common Stock representing an approximately 90% voting interest and 81% equity interest in BBX Capital. BBX Capital's current operations and business plans involve investments in income producing real estate, real estate developments and real estate joint ventures, and investments in middle market operating businesses.  Bluegreen is a sales, marketing and management company focused on the vacation ownership industry. Bluegreen markets, sells and manages VOIs in resorts, which are generally located in popular, high-volume, "drive-to" vacation destinations, and were either developed or acquired by Bluegreen or developed and owned by others in which case Bluegreen earns fees for providing these services. Bluegreen also provides other fee-based services, including property association management services, mortgage servicing, VOI title services, reservation services, and construction design and development services. In addition, Bluegreen provides financing to individual purchasers of its VOIs, which generates significant interest income.  We currently report the results of our business activities through two segments: Bluegreen and BBX Capital.  As of December 31, 2015, we had total consolidated assets of approximately $1.3 billion and shareholders' equity attributable to BFC of approximately $376.8 million. Net income attributable to BFC for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $122.5 million. Net income attributable to BFC for the year, ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $13.9 million and $29.1 million, respectively.  Recent Events  Increase in Ownership of Shares of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock  On April 30, 2015, the Company consummated a cash tender offer pursuant to which it purchased from the shareholders of BBX Capital a total of 4,771,221 shares of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock, at a purchase price of $20.00 per share, for a total purchase price of approximately $95.4 million. As a result, the Company's ownership interest in BBX Capital increased from approximately 51% to approximately 81% and its voting interest in BBX Capital increased from approximately 74% to approximately 90%.  On September 4, 2015, BFC entered into Share Exchange Agreements with Alan B. Levan, John E. Abdo, Jarett S. Levan and Seth M. Wise (collectively, the "BBX Capital Executives") as holders of restricted stock units of Class A Common Stock of BBX Capital ("BBX Capital RSUs"). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreements, (a) each BBX Capital Executive granted BFC the option to acquire, simultaneously with the vesting of each BBX Capital RSU, some or all of the shares of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock which, absent the Share Exchange Agreement, would (after withholding) have been received by the BBX Capital Executive upon the vesting of the BBX Capital RSU and (b) BFC agreed to issue to the BBX Capital Executive shares of BFC's Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock having an aggregate market value equal to the aggregate market value of the shares of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock acquired by BFC upon the option exercise. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreements, the market value of the shares of BFC's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock and of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock is the closing price of the applicable class of stock on the trading day immediately preceding the date of closing of the share exchange.  On September 1, 2015, BFC's Board of Directors approved (a) the exercise in full of BFC's options with respect to all of the BBX Capital RSUs held by the BBX Capital RSU Holders which vested on September 30, 2015 and (b) the issuance of shares of BFC's Class B Common Stock in exchange therefor. In connection with this option exercise, on September 30, 2015, BFC issued a total of 1,218,476 shares of its Class B Common Stock to the BBX Capital RSU  Holders and received a total of 221,821 shares of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock in exchange therefor. The share exchanges were effected simultaneously with the vesting of the applicable BBX Capital RSUs on September 30, 2015 and were based on the closing prices of BFC's Class B Common Stock and BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock on September 29, 2015 of $2.88 per share and $15.82 per share, respectively. The following table sets forth the number of shares of BFC's Class B Common Stock issued to each BBX Capital RSU Holder on September 30, 2015 and the number of shares of BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock which BFC received in exchange therefor.   Number of Shares of BFC's Class B Number of Shares of BBX BBX Capital RSU Common Stock Issued to the BBX Capital's Class A Common Stock Holder Capital RSU Holder Received by BFC Alan B. Levan 405,624 73,843 John E. Abdo 405,624 73,843 Jarett S. Levan 204,413 37,213 Seth M. Wise 202,815 36,922 Total 1,218,476 221,821  On April 17, 2015, BFC entered into a Loan Agreement and Promissory Note with Bluegreen Specialty Finance, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bluegreen ("BSF"), pursuant to which BSF provided an $80 million loan to BFC. BFC used the proceeds of the loan and approximately $15.4 million in cash on hand to fund the purchase of shares in the tender offer. Amounts outstanding on the loan bear interest at a rate of 10% per annum. Payments of interest only are required on a quarterly basis, with all outstanding amounts being due and payable at the end of five years. BFC is permitted to prepay the loan in whole or in part at any time, and prepayments will be required, to the extent necessary, in order for Bluegreen or its subsidiaries to remain in compliance with covenants under their outstanding indebtedness. The $80 million loan to BFC from BSF is eliminated in BFC's consolidated financial statements.  As a result of the increase in BFC's ownership interest in BBX Capital, BFC will be filing a consolidated group tax return which will include the operations of BBX Capital, Woodbridge and Bluegreen.  Woodbridge Acquisition of Bluegreen; Settlement of Merger Litigation  On April 2, 2013, Bluegreen merged with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Woodbridge in a cash merger transaction (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Bluegreen merger" or the "Bluegreen cash merger"). Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Bluegreen's shareholders (other than Woodbridge) received consideration of $10.00 in cash for each share of Bluegreen's common stock that they held at the effective time of the merger, including unvested restricted securities. The aggregate merger consideration was approximately $149.2 million. As a result of the merger, Bluegreen, which was the surviving corporation of the merger, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Woodbridge. Prior to the merger, the Company indirectly through Woodbridge owned approximately 54% of Bluegreen's outstanding common stock. Woodbridge was a wholly-owned subsidiary of BFC prior to BBX Capital's investment in Woodbridge.  In connection with the financing of the merger, BFC and Woodbridge entered into a Purchase Agreement with BBX Capital on April 2, 2013 (the "Purchase Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, BBX Capital invested $71.75 million in Woodbridge contemporaneously with the closing of the merger in exchange for a 46% equity interest in Woodbridge. BFC continues to hold the remaining 54% of Woodbridge's outstanding equity interests. BBX Capital's investment in Woodbridge consisted of $60 million in cash, which was utilized to pay a portion of the aggregate merger consideration, and a promissory note in Woodbridge's favor in the principal amount of $11.75 million.  Several class action lawsuits were brought against Bluegreen, the directors of Bluegreen, BFC, Woodbridge, certain directors and officers of BFC and others, which challenged the terms of the merger. The plaintiffs, former Bluegreen shareholders, in the lawsuit sought the "fair value" of the shares of Bluegreen's common stock on behalf of Bluegreen's minority shareholders. On June 5, 2015, the parties in the action agreed to the settlement of the litigation. Pursuant to the settlement, Woodbridge paid $36.5 million, which amounts to approximately $2.50 per share, into a "Settlement Fund" for the benefit of former shareholders of Bluegreen whose shares were acquired in connection with the merger (the "Class"). Woodbridge used the proceeds from BBX Capital's repayment of its $11.75 million promissory note to Woodbridge and additional capital contributions from BFC and BBX Capital of $13.4 million and $11.4 million, respectively, based on their respective 54% and 46% ownership interests in Woodbridge to fund the Settlement Fund. All litigation arising from or relating to the merger was dismissed with prejudice, together with a full release of BFC, Bluegreen, Woodbridge, BBX Capital and others. BFC, Bluegreen, Woodbridge, BBX Capital and all of the defendants denied and continue to deny that any of them violated any laws or breached any duties to the plaintiffs or Bluegreen's former shareholders.  Bluegreen  The Company's consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of Bluegreen. BFC owns a direct 54% equity investment in Woodbridge, Bluegreen's parent company. BBX Capital, which is 81% owned by BFC, owns the remaining 46% equity interest in Woodbridge. Bluegreen comprises one of the two reportable segments of BFC.  Executive Overview  Bluegreen Corporation ("Bluegreen" or "Bluegreen Vacations") is a sales, marketing, and management company focused on the vacation ownership industry. Bluegreen Vacations markets, sells and manages vacation ownership interests in resorts, which are generally located in popular, high-volume, "drive-to" vacation destinations. The resorts in which Bluegreen Vacations markets, sells or manages VOIs were either developed or acquired by Bluegreen, or were developed and are owned by third parties. Bluegreen Vacations earns fees for providing sales and marketing services to these third party developers. Bluegreen Vacations also earns fees by providing management services to the Bluegreen Vacation Club and property owners' associations, mortgage servicing, VOI title services, reservation services, and construction design and development services. In addition, Bluegreen Vacations provides financing to FICO(R) score-qualified individual purchasers of VOIs, which generates significant interest income.  In addition to Bluegreen's traditional vacation ownership operations, Bluegreen has in recent years pursued a business strategy, referred to herein as the "capital-light" business strategy, involving activities that typically do not require the significant costs and capital investments generally incurred in connection with the acquisition and development of VOIs under Bluegreen's traditional vacation ownership business. Bluegreen believes its capital-light business strategy enables it to leverage its expertise and existing infrastructure in resort management, sales and marketing, mortgage servicing, title services, and construction management to generate recurring revenues from third parties. Bluegreen's goal is for its capital-light business activities to become an increasing portion of its business over time; however, these efforts may not be successful. As of December 31, 2015, Bluegreen's capital-light business activities consisted of the following: fee-based sales and marketing arrangements; just-in-time inventory acquisition arrangements; secondary market arrangements; and other fee-based services. Each of these categories is described below.  Fee-Based Sales and Marketing Arrangements  In 2009, Bluegreen began offering sales and marketing services to third-party developers for a fee. Under these arrangements, Bluegreen sells third-party VOIs as Bluegreen Vacation Club interests through its distribution network of sales offices, typically on a non-committed basis. Bluegreen seeks to structure its fee for these services to cover its selling and marketing costs, plus an operating profit. Because the completed VOI was built by a third-party, Bluegreen is not at risk for the development financing of these projects and Bluegreen has little to no capital requirements. Notes receivable originated in connection with Bluegreen's sale of third party VOIs under commission-based arrangements are held by the third party developer, and in certain cases are serviced by Bluegreen for a fee. Bluegreen refers to sales made on behalf of third-party developers as "FBS Sales".  Just-In-Time Arrangements  In 2013, Bluegreen began entering into agreements with third-party developers that allow Bluegreen to buy VOI inventory from time to time in close proximity to the timing of when Bluegreen intends to sell such VOIs. Bluegreen strives to enter into such arrangements on a non-committed basis, although Bluegreen may engage in committed arrangements under certain circumstances. Because the completed VOI was built by a third-party, Bluegreen is not at risk for the development financing of these projects. Unlike FBS Sales, receivables originated in connection with sales of just-in-time inventory are held by Bluegreen. Bluegreen refers to sales of inventory acquired through these arrangements as "Just-In-Time Sales".  Secondary Market Arrangements  In 2012, Bluegreen began a program to acquire VOI inventory from POAs and other third parties on a non-committed basis, in close proximity to the timing of when Bluegreen intends to sell such VOIs. Such VOIs are typically obtained by the POAs through foreclosure in connection with maintenance fee defaults, and are generally acquired by Bluegreen at a significant discount. Bluegreen refers to sales of inventory acquired through these arrangements as "Secondary Market Sales".  Other Fee-Based Services  Bluegreen also earns fees for providing management services to the Bluegreen Vacation Club and to certain POAs. In connection with the management services provided to the Bluegreen Vacation Club, Bluegreen manages the club reservation system and provides owner services as well as billing and collection services. In connection with Bluegreen's management of POAs, Bluegreen provides day-to-day management services, including oversight of housekeeping services, maintenance, and certain accounting and administrative services. As of December 31, 2015, Bluegreen provided management services to 46 timeshare resort properties and hotels. Other fee-based services also include the processing of sales of VOIs through Bluegreen's wholly-owned title company subsidiary, which earns title fees in connection with the closing of the VOI transactions.  Bluegreen also generates fee-based income by providing construction, design and management services, and mortgage servicing.  During the year ended December 31, 2015:  � Bluegreen generated "free cash flow" (cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures) of $72.1 million compared to $129.5 million during 2014. Capital expenditures incurred during 2015 relating to the construction of VOI inventory at Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations' resorts was the primary reason for this decrease.  � Bluegreen earned net income of $82.0 million compared to $69.0 million for 2014.  � System-wide sales of VOIs, which include sales of traditional inventory, Secondary Market Sales, FBS Sales, and Just-In-Time Sales, were $552.7 million compared to $523.8 million during 2014.  � Bluegreen sold $251.4 million of third-party inventory under FBS Sales arrangements and earned sales and marketing commissions of $173.7 million in connection with those sales. During 2014, Bluegreen sold $221.3 million of third-party inventory under FBS Sales arrangements and earned sales and marketing commissions of $144.2 million in connection with those sales. In addition, Bluegreen sold $27.6 million of inventory under Just-In-Time Sales arrangements, gross of equity trade allowances compared to $56.8 million during 2014. Including Bluegreen resort management, title services, construction management and other fee-based operations, and based on an allocation of Bluegreen's selling, marketing and field general and administrative expenses, Bluegreen generated $77.3 million in pre-tax profits by providing fee-based services compared to $71.1 million during 2014.  � Bluegreen sold $138.5 million of inventory under Secondary Market Arrangements, gross of equity trade allowances compared to $88.3 million during 2014.  During the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, 46% and 50%, respectively, of Bluegreen's VOI sales were realized in cash within approximately 30 days from the contract date. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for additional information.  Bluegreen-Woodbridge Cash Merger  On April 2, 2013, Woodbridge acquired all of the shares of Bluegreen's common stock not previously owned by Woodbridge in a cash merger transaction. As a result, Bluegreen became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Woodbridge. Woodbridge is currently owned 54% by BFC and 46% by BBX Capital Corporation.  In connection with the merger, Bluegreen issued $75 million of senior secured notes on March 26, 2013 in a private transaction the proceeds of which were used to fund a portion of the merger consideration.  Seasonality  Bluegreen has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenues and results of operations. This seasonality has resulted, and may continue to result, in fluctuations in Bluegreen's quarterly operating results. Although Bluegreen typically sees more potential customers at its sales offices during the quarters ending in June and September, ultimate recognition of the resulting sales during these periods may be delayed due to down payment requirements for recognition of real estate sales under GAAP or due to the timing of development and the required use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.  VOI Notes Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses  Bluegreen offers financing to buyers of VOIs and accordingly, Bluegreen is subject to the risk of defaults by these customers. Pursuant to GAAP, sales of VOIs are reduced by an estimate of future uncollectible note balances on  originated VOI notes receivable, excluding any benefit for the value of future recoveries of defaulted VOI inventory. Bluegreen updates its estimate of such future losses each quarter, and consequently, the charge against sales in a particular period may be impacted, favorably or unfavorably, by a change in expected losses related to notes originated in prior periods.  Bluegreen's notes receivable also include amounts outstanding under Bluegreen Communities' notes receivable portfolio, which was excluded from Bluegreen's sale during May 2012 of substantially all of the assets of Bluegreen Communities.  Substantially all defaulted VOI notes receivable result in a recovery of the related VOI that secured the note receivable, typically soon after default and at a nominal cost. Bluegreen then seeks to resell the recovered VOI in the normal course of business.  Bluegreen generally seeks to monetize its notes receivable by transferring the notes to warehouse purchase facilities, in which case the notes are legally sold to a special purpose entity for the benefit of a financial institution or conduit, or by pledging the notes as collateral for a receivables hypothecation loan. Bluegreen attempts to maintain these diversified liquidity sources for its notes receivable in order to mitigate the risks of being dependent on a single source of credit. Each such facility has eligibility standards for the notes receivable that may be sold or pledged under the facility. It is generally expected that notes receivable transferred to a warehouse purchase facility will ultimately be included in a future securitization of the transferred notes. The notes receivable securitized are determined during the negotiation of the securitization transaction, with the characteristics of the notes receivable selected determining the terms of the transaction. Notes receivable previously pledged as collateral for a receivable hypothecation loan may also be included in a term securitization transaction, however such notes are generally not included if doing so would result in a significant prepayment penalty. Further, based on the size and timing of the securitization, Bluegreen may also choose to include newly originated notes receivable. Additionally, the specific characteristics of the notes receivable factor into whether such notes would be desirable to include in a securitization. Such factors may include delinquency status, FICO(R) score of the borrower, interest rate, remaining term, outstanding balance, and whether the borrower is foreign or domestic.  The average annual default rates and delinquency rates (more than 30 days past due) on Bluegreen's notes receivable were as follows:   Average Annual Default Rates For Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Notes receivable secured by VOIs: Loans originated prior to December 15, 2008(1) 6.5% 6.9% 7.7% Loans originated on or after December 15, 2008(1) 7.0% 6.8% 6.4% Notes receivable secured by homesites 2.3% 4.1% 3.5% Average Annual Delinquency Rates (2) As of December 31, 2015 2014 2013 Notes receivable secured by VOIs: Loans originated prior to December 15, 2008(1) 4.2% 4.2% 4.2% Loans originated on or after December 15, 2008(1) 3.1% 3.1% 3.3% Notes receivable secured by homesites 2.0% 1.1% 4.6%  (1) On December 15, 2008, Bluegreen implemented its FICO(R)-score based credit underwriting program.  (2) The percentage of Bluegreen's notes receivable portfolio that was over 30 days past due as of the dates indicated.
