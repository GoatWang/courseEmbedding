Products[edit]
AccuVein's first product was the AV300 a hand held device that is shined on the body of a patient to enhance the visual contrast of the veins. Because venipuncture is a procedure that requires both hands to be free, AccuVein also offers hands-free stands to allow the user to position the device over the patient's body. This device works by shining an infrared light on the area, observing it with a camera, and projecting the image onto the patient's skin.[2] AccuVein's second generation product the AV400 also displays the veins on the surface of the skin. This second generation vein illuminator allows the user to hold the device in any direction, sees deeper and can be held at a wider range of distance from the skin, though it is still small and hand held.[3]
Certifications[edit]
AccuVein has an ISO 13485:2003 Quality System registered by BSI, certificate FM 546323

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 06/24/2009
            

                BBB has determined that AccuVein, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means: 
1. provide any required product labeling information

                            2. disclose the nature and terms of shipping, including any known delays or shortages of stock
                        
3. provide an opportunity to review and confirm the transaction before the sale is completed

                            4. provide a receipt summarizing the transaction after the purchase
                        









Honor Promises









            Abide by all written agreements and verbal representations.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Tourniquet Time for PIV Blood Draw 
		

Questions are often posed about whether to wait until all blood samples are collected before releasing the tourniquet and applying the dressing to the IV site. The 2016 Infusion Therapy Standards of Practice does state that tourniquet time should be limited to 1 minute. Find out more information about why from Cora Vizcarra in her Infusion... 
		







Taking Steps to Prevent Infiltrations in Children 
		

The incidence of infiltration can occur quickly and cause a great deal of damage. Complications of infiltration can include localized swelling and discomfort, compartment syndrome and necrosis.

In an effort to reduce the incidence of infiltration an evidence based practice change project (EBPCP) was tested. The EBPCP included a comprehensive education plan focused on guidelines... 
		







Considerations When Selecting an IV Needle 
		

One of the of the important considerations when starting an IV is the needle size. IV needles are sized by gauges, and the smaller the gauge number, the bigger the needle.

"The goal when selecting the proper gauge of an peripheral IV catheter is to ensure that the best device meets the patient’s needs.  This means taking into consideration... 
		







Long Term Care Hospital Readmissions An Issue… Adopt Vein Illumination! 
		

At long term care facilities access to veins can mean the difference between keeping the patient in the facility and being forced to readmit them to the hospital. Venipuncture is the most common invasive medical procedure and is increasingly difficult on the elderly. Attempts for access can fail and in the geriatric patient group these... 
		







FDA Suggests Injectors Familiarize Themselves With The Patient's Anatomy 
		

"The FDA is alerting health care providers and consumers about the possibility of rare, but serious, injuries that may occur due to unintentional injection of soft tissue filler into blood vessels in the face".

New labeling requirements have been implemented by the FDA regarding soft tissue fillers and with these changes the FDA suggests:

	"Make sure... 
		







The Tech Behind Tattoo-Gate 
		

We’ve been watching the latest tech scandal, Tattoo-Gate, with interest. Not simply for the entertainment value, but because it's about technology that we know a great deal about – the optical characteristics of blood and the surrounding tissue. AccuVein uses the same bit of physics magic to... 
		







Don't Touch Your Face 
		

Touching your face is a common behavior and it can be difficult to realize it is happening. By touching your face you can be exposing yourself to contaminants from your surroundings and/or exposing your patients to illness if you are not well.

" A behavioral observation study was undertaken involving medical students at the University of... 
		







IV Needles That Are Too Small Can Be Unreliable 
		

Fred Mihm M.D., a Stanford doctor who is involved in Global Health medical missions just returned from India where he and a surgical team provided free surgical care for children with cleft lip/palate defects.

Dr. Mihm brought along an AccuVein AV400 device to not only help on patients with difficult to find veins but also to... 
		







Heat Use During Peripheral IV Insertion 
		

The Journal of Infusion Nursing reported in their November/December 2014 issue that a survey was completed that looked at the common practices regarding heat use during PIV catheter insertion. Of the 907 healthcare workers who responded, 73% reported using heat at least sometimes to facilitate IV insertion. Only 6% reported always using heat. When... 
		







Tips for Avoiding CLABSIs 
		

Reducing the the number of unnecessary central lines done at your facility is the first step in avoiding central line associated bloodstream infections or CLABSIs. This can be done by improving IV insertion techniques through training and enforcement or standard operating procedures. Vein illumination has also been proven to reduce IV access escalations by 45%... 
		







Australian Red Cross Looks at Vein Visualization for Blood Draw 
		

The Australian Red Cross has done a study on the use of vein visualization for blood draw. AccuVein was among the devices they examined in the study. The key results of the study were as follows:

	53.4% return donors receiving vein visualization technology report that they would be more likely to donate blood if this... 
		







Avoiding Inadvertent Arterial Puncture 
		

Though it is rare to puncture an artery in an attempt to cannulate a vein, it does happen. The brachial artery is located near the basilic vein, and is one that is of importance since it is in an area that may be selected for venipuncture. Because arteries are deeper than veins these events... 
		







The Use Of Alcohol Swabs 
		

How many times should an alcohol swab be used? An alcohol swab should only be used once. Though alcohol is a disinfectant once the swab has been removed from it's package it is no longer sterile. It is important to use care while handling the swab and make sure only to use it on... 
		







IV Dwell Times and Phlebitis Development 
		

This topic has been revisited several times by several outlets. Should IVs be left alone and not changed unless there is cause or reason to change them? Well a recent study attempted to link IV dwell times with Phlebitis development and found...

"The results of this study show that catheters can be used for longer... 
		







Use of Blood Pressure Cuff in Place of a Tourniquet 
		

We've heard that BP cuffs are occasionally used in lieu of a tourniquet a when starting an IV. Inflating and releasing to about 30-40mm Hg tends to provide sufficient distention without increased discomfort to the patient. When using a blood pressure cuff instead of a tourniquet, care must be exercised not to start the... 
		







Independent Study Finds 45% Fewer Escalations with AccuVein 
		

UF Health Shands Hospital, a U.S. News & World Report top-ranked children’s hospital, recently completed a study which took place in six nursing units, evaluating the impact of AccuVein vein visualization on the number of times it was necessary to escalate a PIV start to central resource staff.

Study results showed a 45% reduction in... 
		







Doctor's Tip For Cannulating A Difficult Bariatric Patient 
		

Cannulating a bariatric patient can be very difficult due to excess adipose tissue. It is important to do a full assessment to locate a suitable vein. AccuVein vein visualization technology can help with locating and assessing suitable veins in all patients, including those that are heavy-set or obese. But sometimes there are those cases where the veins are... 
		







Is it less painful to look away during venipuncture ? 
		

Almost three quarters of patients spontaneously look away during venipuncture. Does this help to minimize the pain? It turns out that pain ratings of these patients are almost twice that of the quarter of patients who look.

It is unclear why this may be, but previous experimental studies indicate that observing the body when a... 
		







Sepsis 
		

Sepsis is a consequence of infection that can be difficult to identify and treat. According to the CDC, "patients who develop sepsis have an increased risk of complications and death and face higher healthcare costs and longer treatment".

Sepsis "stems from another medical condition such as an infection in the lungs, urinary tract, skin, abdomen... 
		







Inserting IVs In The Elderly 
		

Elderly patients can be even more difficult to cannulate and are more likely to bruise than younger patients. Aging causes reduced circulation and deterioration of the vein walls.

These tips are suggested to increase effectiveness of cannulation attempts and reduce the possibility of bruising.

	Be gentle
	Use the smallest catheter possible
	Go in shallow
	Anchor the vein to stabilize... 
		







In Honor of Nurses Week 
		

In honor of Nurses Week we wanted to share this article which we think captures the caring and devotion of the nursing profession.

Thanks to all the nurses out there for all you do!

The article care be found here. 
		







Avoiding Nerves During Venipuncture 
		

It is important to avoid nerves while performing venipuncture. Knowing where they are located and how they differ from the vasculature can assist a clinician in identifying and avoiding nerves while performing venipuncture. Two nerves that are located in common areas for venipuncture are the radial and median nerves. "The radial nerve passes along... 
		







Intravenous Solution Shortage 
		

You wouldn't expect that the national crisis with “drug shortages” would include  large volume (1000mL) IV solutions commonly administered to patients, but there actually is such a shortage.   IV saline solution in particular is on the list of national drug shortages and the shortage is not expected to resolve until May or June... 
		







Vein Visualization Recommended to Improve Safety Practices 
		

Recently the Infusion Nurses Society convened a task force of infusion therapy experts to develop recommendations to improve health care practitioner and patient safety.

The findings of this task force includes their recommendation to, "Incorporate vein visualization technology as a routine strategy for patients with poor or difficult venous access."  They go on to state... 
		







Rare Bacteria Outbreak at Outpatient Oncology Facility 
		

Infection control today reported that a recent outbreak of a rare bacteria was tied to a lapse in infection control procedures. There was an outbreak of Tsukamurella blood stream infections, which is caused by Gram-positive bacteria and rarely effects humans. The outbreak was linked to the improper handling of saline at a West Virginia... 
		







Fear of Needles is a Common Phobia 
		

When researching fear of needles we find that not only do approximately 20 percent of the general population have some degree of fear associated with needles and injections, but that it's such a widespread fear that we've come across these six medical terms that are related to this fear:

·   Aichmophobia: an intense or morbid fear... 
		







Blood Exposure 
		

Many jobs have occupational hazards but being a nurse is one occupation that carries the possibility of blood exposure or exposure to other bodily fluids.  One of the many reasons that nursing is not for the faint of heart.  With roughly 385,000 annual needle stick sharps injuries in the United States it is possible... 
		







Re-siting PIVs - based on time or indications? 
		

Many facilities have policies requiring clinicians to remove and re-site a Peripheral IV within a given period of time.  As a clinician, have you ever wondered if this is actually helps the patient avoid complications?

The CDC's Guidelines for the Prevention of Intravascular Catheter related Infections indicates that:
1. There is no need to replace peripheral... 
		







Should Infusion Teams be part of Acute Care Hospitals? 
		

Infusion therapy is invasive and touches virtually all patients entering the hospital.  Given its importance, the current rates of infusion therapy complications, as well as the costs and the waste associated with it, a thorough assessment should be made of a facility’s’ outcomes related to infusion services.  This is the opinion expressed in an... 
		







Apply Dry Or Wet Heat To Increase Palpability? 
		

When you have a patient whose veins are not particularly palpable, sometimes it is a good idea to apply heat to the area which will increase blood flow and make the veins juicier.  So would you typically reach for a warm wet rag or a dry heat source?

There is a study that shows "dry...

Products[edit]
AccuVein's first product was the AV300 a hand held device that is shined on the body of a patient to enhance the visual contrast of the veins. Because venipuncture is a procedure that requires both hands to be free, AccuVein also offers hands-free stands to allow the user to position the device over the patient's body. This device works by shining an infrared light on the area, observing it with a camera, and projecting the image onto the patient's skin.[2] AccuVein's second generation product the AV400 also displays the veins on the surface of the skin. This second generation vein illuminator allows the user to hold the device in any direction, sees deeper and can be held at a wider range of distance from the skin, though it is still small and hand held.[3]
Certifications[edit]
AccuVein has an ISO 13485:2003 Quality System registered by BSI, certificate FM 546323

Products[edit]
AccuVein's first product was the AV300 a hand held device that is shined on the body of a patient to enhance the visual contrast of the veins. Because venipuncture is a procedure that requires both hands to be free, AccuVein also offers hands-free stands to allow the user to position the device over the patient's body. This device works by shining an infrared light on the area, observing it with a camera, and projecting the image onto the patient's skin.[2] AccuVein's second generation product the AV400 also displays the veins on the surface of the skin. This second generation vein illuminator allows the user to hold the device in any direction, sees deeper and can be held at a wider range of distance from the skin, though it is still small and hand held.[3]
Certifications[edit]
AccuVein has an ISO 13485:2003 Quality System registered by BSI, certificate FM 546323
