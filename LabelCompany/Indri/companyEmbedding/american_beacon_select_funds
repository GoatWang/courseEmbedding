American Beacon Flexible Bond Fund
Portfolio information as of March 31, 2017



Summary
Performance
Overview


 





Investment Objective
The Fund seeks to provide a positive total return regardless of market conditions over a full market cycle.
 


CAPITALIZING ON FLEXIBILITY
The Fund is sub-advised by three
                complementary fixed-income  managers:


Brandywine Global: Invests long  in markets
with the highest real yields, short  in markets
with the lowest real yields.


Payden & Rygel: Implements a “best ideas” portfolio reflecting the most promising
risk-adjusted opportunities around the globe.


PIMCO: Seeks an  absolute-return strategy
                      without the constraints of a  benchmark or
                      significant sector or instrument.


A WIDE-RANGING APPROACH
                  
                TO FIXED INCOME
The Fund allocates investments  across a wide
                  range of global investment  opportunities. This
                flexibility includes:


Investing in  a number of geographic regions or
                      countries, including emerging  markets.



Allocating to fixed-income instruments without restrictions 
                    on their credit quality, although high yield bonds are limited 
                    to no more than 40% of the net exposure.



Using  foreign currencies or currency derivative
                      instruments and other derivative instruments.

Investing in derivative instruments involves liquidity, credit, interest rate and market risks.
Investments in high yield securities are subject to greater levels of credit, interest rate, market
and liquidity risks than investment-grade securities. Although the Fund has a flexible approach to
investing, diversification does not ensure against loss. Investing in foreign and emerging market
securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations and economic and political
risks. Please see the prospectus for a complete discussion of the Fund’s risks. There can be no
assurances that the investment objectives of this Fund will be met.
For a prospectus containing more information, including expenses, click here. Read it carefully before you invest or send money. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS,                                                            

Enclosed please find the Annual Report for the American Beacon Select Funds for 
the year ended December 31, 2006. During this time, the Select Funds            
outperformed their respective peer groups.                                      

  After 17 consecutive 25-basis point (0.25%) rate hikes, the Federal Open
Market Committee ("FOMC") held interest rates steady at 5.25% at their August   
8th meeting. The Federal Reserve Board (the "Fed") will continue to weigh the   
risks of accelerating inflation and decelerating economic growth. At the final  
FOMC meeting in December 2006, the Fed acknowledged the cooling housing market, 
but remained primarily concerned about inflation. The FOMC should hold rates    
steady at least through the first half of 2007. The market is focused on slowing
housing and auto data and pricing in an ease for the next move by the Fed       
(albeit in the late part of 2007). Fed officials continue to discuss that       
additional firming may be needed because inflation remains on the higher-end of 
their comfort range.                                                            

Despite rising interest rates earlier in the year, the American Beacon
Money Market Select Fund one-year return of 5.08% outperformed the Lipper       
Institutional Money Market Average return by 36 basis points (0.36%). The       
American Beacon U.S. Government Money Market Select Fund also outperformed the  
Lipper Institutional U.S. Government Money Market Average with a one-year return
of 5.04% versus 4.69%.

ECONOMIC OVERVIEW                                                               
DECEMBER 31, 2006 (UNAUDITED)                                                   

The initial estimate of the U.S. gross domestic product ("GDP") growth rate rose
3.5% in the fourth quarter, after rising a modest 2.0% in the third quarter of  
2006. Consumer spending was the primary driver, up 4.4%. Consumers used credit  
cards to make up for diminished mortgage borrowing power. Business fixed        
investment fell 0.4%, the first decline since the first quarter of 2003.        
Inventories were up only $35.3 billion, trimming 0.7% from GDP growth. Growth   
rose solidly above the Fed's target after two quarters of coming in below,      
leaving room for debate on the implications of growth. In addition to the up    
tick in growth, the labor market remains healthy as payroll gains averaged      
136,000 per month during the fourth quarter and the unemployment rate remained  
low at 4.5% in December.                                                        

The Federal Open Market Committee ("FOMC") ended a streak of seventeen
consecutive 25 basis point (0.25%) rate hikes at their August 8th meeting,      
leaving rates unchanged at 5.25% through the rest of 2006. Fed officials        
continue to weigh the risks of a slowing economy against the risks of higher    
inflation in determining the future direction of interest rates. At the December
meeting, the Fed acknowledged the cooling housing market and its impact on      
economic growth, but inflation remained their chief concern. "...participants   
expressed concern that a failure of inflation to moderate as expected could     
entail significant costs if an upward drift in inflation expectations ensued,"  
the minutes said. As a result, the Fed retained a tightening bias in its        
December statement maintaining the phrase that "the extent and timing of any    
additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the 
evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth."               

The latest readings of consumer and producer prices indicate that the 
easing of inflationary pressures may be slow. The core consumer price index     
("CPI") rose 0.2% in December after remaining flat in November, and the core    
producers price index ("PPI"), which also rose 0.2% during the month, came in   
above economists' expectations. In addition, despite a decline to an annual rate
of 2.2% in November which was unchanged in December, the core personal          
consumption expenditures ("PCE") price index remains above the Fed's comfort    
range of 1-2%.                                                                  

    U.S. Treasury yields rose during the fourth quarter as the likelihood of a
Fed ease during the first quarter of 2007 began to dissipate. Though the yield  
curve remained inverted, Treasury yields reached five month highs in January    
2007 on signals that the housing market is bottoming, inflation remains         
stubborn, and employment is strengthening.                                      

   The FOMC should remain on hold at least through the first part of 2007 as
Fed officials wait for signs that inflation is indeed moderating. If inflation  
remains above the Fed's comfort level for an extended period of time, an        
additional Fed tightening is possible. Despite the Fed's stated tightening bias,
the market continues to expect an ease during the second half of 2007.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW                                                            
AMERICAN BEACON SELECT FUNDS                                                    
DECEMBER 31, 2006 (UNAUDITED)                                                   

     As the economy continued to show signs of strength during the year, the Fed
continued tightening monetary policy through June 2006. Since then the Fed has  
been on hold with a tightening bias, resulting in a 5.25% fed funds target by   
year end. This was a move of 25 basis points (0.25%) for each of the first four 
FOMC meetings after starting the year at 4.25%. In response, the American Beacon
Money Market Fund's weighted-average maturity ("WAM") was maintained below 45   
days throughout the year. The primary strategy of the Fund was to buy variable  
rate securities, short-dated commercial paper and overnight investments. Due to 
maintaining a short WAM in a rising to stable interest rate environment, the    
Fund outperformed its Lipper peer group. This strategy will stay in place until 
economic data suggest the Fed is about to enter into an easing cycle.           

    For the year ended December 31, 2006, the total return of the Money Market
Select Fund was 5.08%. The Fund outperformed the Lipper Institutional Money     
Market Average return of 4.72% by 36 basis points (0.36%). Lipper Inc. ranked   
the Fund 6th among 357, 4th among 291, and 4th among 233 Institutional Money    
Market Funds for the one-year, three-year and five-year periods ended December
31, 2006, respectively.                                                         

For the year ended December 31, 2006, the total return of the U.S.    
Government Money Market Select Fund was 5.04%. The Fund outperformed the Lipper 
Institutional U.S. Government Money Market Average return of 4.69% by 35 basis  
points (0.35%). Lipper Inc. ranked the Fund 3rd among 147, 2nd among 126 and 2nd
among 106 Institutional U.S. Government Money Market Funds for the one-year,    
three-year and five-year periods ended December 31, 2006, respectively.         

    The Lipper Institutional Money Market Average and the Lipper Institutional
U.S. Government Money Market Average are calculated by taking an arithmetic     
average of the returns of the mutual funds in the Lipper Institutional Money    
Market Funds and the Lipper Institutional U.S. Government Money Market Funds    
categories, respectively. Lipper is an independent mutual fund research and     
ranking service that ranks mutual funds in various categories by making         
comparative calculations using total returns.

(1)    Performance shown is historical and may not be indicative of future      
   returns. Investment returns will vary, and share may be worth more or
      less at redemption than at original purchase. An investment in this Fund
is neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation or any other government agency. Although the Fund seeks to
      preserve the value of an investment at $1.00 per share it is possible to
      lose money by investing in the Fund. Fund performance in the table above
does not reflect the deduction of taxes a shareholder would pay on
distributions or the redemption of shares.                        

(2)    The Fund's performance is derived from a combination of the Fund's       
      performance and that of another fund (the "Companion Fund") not included
    in this report. The Companion Fund has been managed by American Beacon
   Advisors since its inception on September 1, 1987. Like the Fund, the
    Companion Fund invests all of its investable assets in a corresponding
    Portfolio of the American Beacon Master Trust. The performance results
       from inception through December 31, 1999 are those of the Companion Fund.
      The Fund began offering its shares on January 1, 2000. Thus, performance
      results shown from that date through December 31, 2006 are for the Fund.
       Because the Companion Fund had higher expenses, its performance was worse
    than the Fund would have realized in the same period. A portion of the
fees charged to the Money Market Fund was waived through 2001.    
     Performance prior to waiving fees was lower than the actual returns for
periods prior to 2001.                                            

(3)    The Fund's performance is derived from a combination of the Fund's       
      performance and that of another fund (the "Companion Fund") not included
    in this report. The Companion Fund has been managed by American Beacon
      Advisors since its inception March 2, 1992. Like the Fund, the Companion
       Fund invests all of its investable assets in a corresponding Portfolio of
      the American Beacon Master Trust. The performance results from inception
       through November 30, 2001 are those of the Companion Fund. The Fund began
     offering its shares on December 1, 2001. Thus, performance results from
that date through December 31, 2006 are for the Fund. Because the 
  Companion Fund had moderately higher expenses, their performance was
    slightly worse than the Fund would have realized in the same period. A
      portion of the fees charged to the U.S. Government Fund has been waived.
 Performance prior to waiving fees was lower than the actual returns
shown.

FUND EXPENSE EXAMPLE                                                            

     As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction
costs and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees, administrative service  
fees, and other Fund expenses. The examples below are intended to help you      
understand the ongoing cost (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare
these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds. The      
examples are based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the  
period and held for the entire period from July 1, 2006 through December 31,
2006.                                                                           

ACTUAL EXPENSES                                                                 

  The "Actual" line of the table provides information about actual account
values and actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together  
with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the   
period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600      
account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number  
in the "Actual" line under the heading "Expenses Paid During Period" to estimate
the expenses you paid on your account during this period.                       

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES                                    

The "Hypothetical" lines of the table provide information about       
hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual
expense ratio and an assumed 5% per year rate of return before expenses (not the
Fund's actual return). You may compare the ongoing costs of investing in the    
Fund with other funds by contrasting

DECEMBER 31, 2006 (UNAUDITED)                                                   

this 5% hypothetical example and the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the
shareholder reports of the other funds. The hypothetical account values and     
expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or       
expenses you paid for the period.                                               

 You should also be aware that the expenses shown in the table highlight
only your ongoing costs and do not reflect any transaction costs charged by the 
Fund. Similarly, the expense examples for other funds do not reflect any        
transaction costs charged by those funds, such as sales charges (loads),        
redemption fees or exchange fees. Therefore, the "Hypothetical" lines of the    
table are useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you determine
the relative total costs of owning different funds. If you were subject to any  
transaction costs during the period, your costs would have been higher.

       month period of 0.12% and 0.12% for the Money Market Select Fund and U.S.
 Government Money Market Select Fund respectively, multiplied by the
     average account value over the period, multiplied by the number derived
      by dividing the number of days in the most recent fiscal half-year (184)

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM                         

The Board of Trustees and Shareholders of                                       
American Beacon Select Funds                                                    

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of        
American Beacon Select Funds, comprised of the American Beacon Money Market     
Select Fund and the American Beacon U.S. Government Money Market Select Fund    
(collectively, the "Funds") as of December 31, 2006, and the related statements 
of operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets  
for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights
for each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements 
and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Funds' management. Our   
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and       
financial highlights based on our audits.                                       

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company  
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were  
not engaged to perform an audit of the Funds' internal control over financial   
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial 
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the          
effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.          
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial    
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used   
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall        
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a          
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to   
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of       
American Beacon Select Funds at December 31, 2006, the results of their         
operations for the year then ended, the changes in their net assets for each of 
the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of
the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally      
accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
DECEMBER 31, 2006 
1.  ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                            

    American Beacon Select Funds (the "Trust") is organized as a Massachusetts
business trust and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the  
"Act"), as amended, as a diversified, no load, open-end management investment   
company with separate series. The following series are included in this report: 
American Beacon Money Market Select Fund and American Beacon U.S. Government    
Money Market Select Fund (each a "Fund" and collectively, the "Funds").         

Each Fund invests all of its investable assets in the corresponding   
portfolio of the American Beacon Master Trust, an open-end diversified          
management investment company, as follows: the American Beacon Money Market     
Select Fund invests assets in the American Beacon Master Money Market Portfolio 
and the American Beacon U.S. Government Money Market Select Fund ("U.S.         
Government Fund") invests assets in the American Beacon Master U.S. Government  
Money Market Portfolio. Each Fund has the same investment objectives as its     
corresponding American Beacon Master Trust Portfolio. The value of such         
investments reflects each Fund's proportionate interest in the net assets of the
corresponding portfolio (66.70% and 95.25% at December 31, 2006, of the American
Beacon Master Money Market and U.S. Government Money Market Portfolios,         
respectively) (each a "Portfolio" and collectively the "Portfolios"). The       
financial statements of the Portfolios are included elsewhere in this report and
should be read in conjunction with the Funds' financial statements.             

American Beacon Advisors, Inc. (the "Manager"), is a wholly owned     
subsidiary of AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, Inc.    
("American"), and was organized in 1986 to provide business management,         
advisory, administrative and asset management consulting services to the Trust  
and other investors.                                                            

    The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies followed
by the Funds.                                                                   

Valuation of Investments                                                        

The Funds record their investment in the Portfolios at fair value.    
Valuation of securities by the Portfolios is discussed in Note 1 of the         
Portfolios' Notes to Financial Statements which are included elsewhere in this  
report.                                                                         

Investment Income                                                               

  Each Fund records its share of net investment income (loss) and realized
gain (loss) in the Portfolio each day. All net investment income (loss) and     
realized gain (loss) of each Portfolio are allocated pro rata among the         
corresponding Fund and other investors in each Portfolio at the time of such    
determination.                                                                  

Dividends                                                                       

    The Funds generally declare dividends daily from net investment income and
net short-term gain, if any, payable monthly. Dividends to shareholders are     
determined in accordance with federal income tax principles that may treat      
certain transactions differently than U.S. generally accepted accounting        
principles.                                                                     

Expenses                                                                        

Expenses directly attributable to a Fund are charged to that Fund's   
operations. Expenses incurred by the Trust with respect to both Funds are       
allocated in proportion to the net assets of each Fund, except where allocations
of direct expenses to each Fund can otherwise be made fairly. Each share of each
Fund bears equally those expenses that are allocated to the Fund as a whole.

AMERICAN BEACON SELECT FUNDS                                                    
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
DECEMBER 31, 2006 

Valuation of Shares                                                             

   The price per share is calculated on each day on which shares are offered
for sale. Net asset value per share is computed by dividing the value of each   
Fund's total assets (which includes the value of the Fund's investment in the   
Portfolio), less liabilities, by the number of Fund shares outstanding.         

Use of Estimates                                                                

   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and        
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and    
accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimated.             

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements                                       

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")   
released FASB Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes"
("FIN 48"). FIN 48 provides guidance on how uncertain tax positions should be   
recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN  
48 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the
course of preparing each Fund's tax returns to determine whether the tax        
positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax   
authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold  
would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. FIN 48 is    
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be       
applied to all open tax years as of the effective date. At this time, the       
Manager is evaluating the implications of FIN 48 and its potential impact on the
financial statements. The Fund's net asset value per share will reflect FIN 48  
adjustments no later than June 29, 2007, and any adjustments will be reflected  
in the Fund's Semi-Annual report to shareholders.                               

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement on Financial Accounting  
Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"). This standard         
clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting, establishes a   
framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the
use of fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements   
issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods   
within those fiscal years. The Manager is evaluating the impact of FAS 157;     
however, it is not expected to have a material impact on the Funds' net assets  
or results of operations.                                                       

Other                                                                           

    Under the Trust's organizational documents, its officers and directors are
indemnified against certain liability arising out of the performance of their   
duties to the Trust. In the normal course of business, the Trust enters into    
contracts that provide indemnification to the other party or parties against    
potential costs or liabilities. The Trust's maximum exposure under these        
arrangements is dependent on claims that may be made in the future and,         
therefore, cannot be estimated. The Trust has had no prior claims or losses     
pursuant to any such agreement.

    The Manager contractually agreed to reimburse the U.S. Government Fund for
other expenses through February 28, 2007 to the extent that total annual Fund   
operating expenses exceed 0.12%. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, 
the Manager reimbursed expenses totaling $23,524 to the U.S. Government Fund.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
DECEMBER 31, 2006 

Expense Reimbursement Plan                                                      

  The Funds have adopted an Expense Reimbursement Plan whereby the Manager
may seek recoupment of expenses reimbursed for a period of up to three years.   
However, recoupment will occur only if a Fund's average net assets have grown or
expenses have declined sufficiently to allow recoupment without causing its     
expense ratio to exceed the previously agreed upon contractual expense limit.   

   Reimbursed expenses subject to potential recovery for the U.S. Government
Fund totaling $2,418, $25,649 and $23,524, will expire in 2007, 2008 and 2009   
respectively. The U.S. Government Fund has not recorded a liability for this    
potential reimbursement due to the current assessment that a reimbursement is   
unlikely. Fees waived during 2003 totaling $11,073 expired in 2006 and will not 
be reimbursed to the Manager.                                                   

     During the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, due to asset growth and a
reduction of expenses, the Manager recouped $49,000 from the Money Market Select
Fund for expenses waived during 2003 and 2004 totaling $2,724 and $46,276,      
respectively. Fees waived during 2003 totaling $5,278 expired in 2006 and will  
not be reimbursed to the Manager.                                               

3.  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES                                                        

  It is the policy of each of the Funds to comply with the requirements of
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code and to distribute substantially all   
net investment income as well as any net realized capital gains on the sale of  
investments. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.            

Net investment income and net realized gains (losses) may differ for  
financial statement and tax purposes because of temporary or permanent book-to- 
tax differences. To the extent these differences are permanent;                 
reclassifications are made to the appropriate equity accounts in the period that
the differences arise. Temporary differences are not reflected in the financial 
records.                                                                        

     Dividends are categorized in accordance with federal income tax regulations
which may treat certain transactions differently than U.S. generally accepted   
accounting principles. Accordingly, the character of distributions and          
composition of net assets for tax purposes may differ from those reflected in   
the accompanying financial statements.                                          

 The tax character of distributions paid for the year ended December 31,
2006 and the year ended December 31, 2005 were as follows (in thousands):

Distributions paid from Ordinary

*      For tax purposes short-term capital gains distributions are considered   
ordinary income distributions.                                    

    As of December 31, 2006, the components of distributable earnings on a tax
basis were the same as book. The cost basis of investments for federal income   
tax purposes was also the same as the book basis.                               

   The Funds do not have capital loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2006.

AMERICAN BEACON MASTER TRUST                                                    
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM                         

The Board of Trustees and Shareholders of                                       
American Beacon Master Trust                                                    

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, of American Beacon Master Trust, comprised of the  
American Beacon Money Market Portfolio and the American Beacon U.S. Government  
Money Market Portfolio (collectively, the "Portfolios") as of December 31, 2006,
and the related statements of operations for the year then ended, the statements
of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and
the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended.   
These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of   
the Portfolios' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.              

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company  
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were  
not engaged to perform an audit of the Portfolios' internal control over        
financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over 
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are          
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an      
opinion on the effectiveness of the Portfolios' internal control over financial 
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes      
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting     
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation  
of securities owned as of December 31, 2006, by correspondence with the         
custodian and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies 
from brokers were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable 
basis for our opinion.                                                          

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to   
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of       
American Beacon Master Trust at December 31, 2006, the results of their         
operations for the year then ended, the changes in their net assets for each of 
the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of
the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally      
accepted accounting principles.

AMERICAN BEACON MASTER TRUST                                                    
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
DECEMBER 31, 2006 
1.  ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                            

American Beacon Master Trust (the "Trust") is registered under the    
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a no load, open-end management   
investment company that was organized as a trust under the laws of the          
Commonwealth of Massachusetts pursuant to a Declaration of Trust dated as of    
November 1, 2004. Beneficial interests in the Trust are divided into separate   
series, each having distinct investment objectives and policies. These financial
statements relate to the American Beacon Master Money Market Portfolio and the  
American Beacon Master U.S. Government Money Market Portfolio (each a           
"Portfolio" and collectively the "Portfolios"). The objective of each Portfolio 
is current income, liquidity and the maintenance of a stable price of $1.00 per 
share. The assets of each Portfolio belong only to that Portfolio, and the      
liabilities of each Portfolio are borne solely by that Portfolio and no other.  

American Beacon Advisors, Inc. (the "Manager"), is a wholly-owned     
subsidiary of AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, Inc.    
("American"), and was organized in 1986 to provide business management,         
advisory, administrative and asset management consulting services.              

    The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies followed
by the Portfolios.                                                              

Security Valuation                                                              

Securities of the Portfolios are valued at amortized cost, which      
approximates fair value. In the event that a deviation of 1/2 of 1% or more     
exists between the $1.00 per share price of the Portfolios, calculated at       
amortized cost, and the price per share calculated by reference to market       
quotations, or if there is any other deviation that the Trust's Board of        
Trustees (the "Board") believes would result in a material dilution to          
shareholders or purchasers, the Board will promptly consider the appropriate    
action that should be initiated.                                                

Security Transactions and Investment Income                                     

Security transactions are recorded on the trade date of the security  
purchase or sale. Interest income is earned from settlement date, recorded on   
the accrual basis, and adjusted, if necessary, for amortization of premiums or  
accretion of discounts on investment grade short-term securities and zero coupon
instruments. For financial and tax reporting purposes, realized gains and losses
are determined on the basis of specific lot identification.                     

Federal Income Taxes                                                            

The Portfolios will be treated as partnerships for federal income tax 
purposes. As such, each investor in a Portfolio will be taxed on its share of   
the Portfolio's ordinary income and capital gains. It is intended that each     
Portfolio's assets will be managed in such a way that an investor in the        
Portfolio will be able to satisfy the requirements of subchapter M of the       
Internal Revenue Code.                                                          

Repurchase Agreements                                                           

 Under the terms of a repurchase agreement, securities are acquired by a
Portfolio from a securities dealer or a bank that are subject to resale at a    
later date. Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury or  
U.S. Government agency securities and are valued at cost, which approximates    
market value. All collateral is held at the custodian bank. The collateral is   
monitored daily by the Manager so that the collateral's market value exceeds the
carrying value of the repurchase agreement plus accrued interest.

AMERICAN BEACON MASTER TRUST                                                    
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
DECEMBER 31, 2006 

Use of Estimates                                                                

   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and        
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and    
accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimated.             

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements                                       

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")   
released FASB Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes"
("FIN 48"). FIN 48 provides guidance on how uncertain tax positions should be   
recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN  
48 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the
course of preparing each Fund's tax returns to determine whether the tax        
positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax   
authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold  
would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. FIN 48 is    
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be       
applied to all open tax years as of the effective date. At this time, the       
Manager is evaluating the implications of FIN 48 and its potential impact on the
financial statements. The Fund's net asset value per share will reflect FIN 48  
adjustments no later than June 29, 2007, and any adjustments will be reflected  
in the Fund's Semi-Annual report to shareholders.                               

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement on Financial Accounting  
Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"). This standard         
clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting, establishes a   
framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the
use of fair value measurements. FAS 157 is effective for financial statements   
issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods   
within those fiscal years. The Manager is evaluating the impact of FAS 157;     
however, it is not expected to have a material impact on the Funds' net assets  
or results of operations.                                                       

Other                                                                           

    Under the Trust's organizational documents, its officers and directors are
indemnified against certain liability arising out of the performance of their   
duties to the Trust. In the normal course of business, the Trust enters into    
contracts that provide indemnification to the other party or parties against    
potential costs or liabilities. The Trust's maximum exposure under these        
arrangements is dependent on claims that may be made in the future and,         
therefore, cannot be estimated. The Trust has had no prior claims or losses     
pursuant to any such agreement.                                                 

2.  TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES                                                

Management Agreement                                                            

The Trust and the Manager are parties to a Management Agreement that  
obligates the Manager to provide or oversee the provision of all administrative,
investment advisory and portfolio management services. The Manager serves as the
sole investment advisor to each of the Portfolios. As compensation for          
performing the duties required under the Management Agreement, the Manager      
receives from the Portfolios 0.10% of the average daily net assets of each of   
the Portfolios.                                                                 

Interfund Lending Program                                                       

   Pursuant to an exemptive order by the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the Portfolios, along with other registered investment companies having         
management contracts with the Manager, may participate in an interfund lending  
program. This program provides an alternative credit facility allowing the Money
Market Portfolio to lend money to other participating series managed by the     
Manager. For the twelve months ended

     annually audit and provide their opinion on the Trusts' financial
      statements, and, in connection therewith, reviewing and evaluating
      matters potentially affecting the independence and capabilities of
the auditors;                                               
     - to approve, prior to appointment, the engagement of the auditors to

engagement relates directly to the operations and financial 
reporting of the Trusts;                                    
  - to consider whether the non-audit services provided by a Trust's
  auditor to an investment adviser or any adviser affiliate that
       provides ongoing services to a series of the Trusts, which services
were not pre-approved by the Committee, are compatible with 
maintaining the auditor's independence;                     
  - to review the arrangements for and scope of the annual audit and
any special audits; and

including the authority to grant pre-approvals of audit and permitted           
non-audit services, to a subcommittee of one or more members.  Any decisions    
of the subcommittee to grant pre-approvals shall be presented to the full       
committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

Overview


Investment approach
The team seeks to deliver long-term, risk-adjusted capital appreciation and current income by investing in large capitalization equity securities with a history of growing their dividends at an above-average rate. In addition, the team seeks to outperform value peer strategies and rank solidly in the top quartile over a full market cycle. The investment process focuses on companies that have the potential to generate strong and sustainable free cash flow from operations with management teams willing to reward shareholders through increased dividend payments over time.


Distinguishing Features

Seasoned, stable investment team with extensive experience managing dividend value strategies
Focus on strong and sustainable free cash flow from operations as a sign of strong business fundamentals that potentially lead to higher share price and growing dividend income over time
Low-beta approach helps reduce portfolio volatility





Investment Process


Define and evaluate investable universe

Universe is the Russell 1000 Index, S&P 500 Index and large ADRs on NYSE
Prioritize candidates for further research by focusing on the top two quintiles of free cash flow
Rank candidates using proprietary factor analysis identifying valuation, capital discipline and total yield to shareholders
Incorporate analysis, including fundamental and valuation analysis, Columbia Threadneedle Investments central research and company meetings



Conduct research and valuation analysis

Identify approximately 125 companies that have the potential to generate strong and sustainable free cash flow from operations that create strong dividend opportunities
Focus on free cash flow yield (FCF/P) vs. traditional value metrics such as P/E, P/B
Reliability of cash accounting vs. accrual accounting
Cash flow analytics used to appraise businesses and forecast dividend actions





Construct portfolio and manage risk

Target 70 to 100 stocks to be included in the portfolio
Determine risk budget and allocate risk to maximize alpha
Seek to construct a portfolio with low relative volatility and leverage, low-earnings volatility, dividend yield exposure
Eliminate unintended bets and ensure style integrity

Disclosures
There is no guarantee the objective will be achieved or that any return expectations will be met. 
The Russell 1000 Index tracks the performance of 1,000 of the largest U.S. companies, based on market capitalization. The Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index is an unmanaged index that tracks the performance of 500 widely held, large-capitalization U.S. stocks. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Investment risks — Market risk may affect a single issuer, sector of the economy, industry or the market as a whole. Value securities may be unprofitable if the market fails to recognize their intrinsic worth or the portfolio manager misgauged that worth. Foreign investments subject the strategy to risks, including political, economic, market, social and others within a particular country, as well as to currency instabilities and less stringent financial and accounting standards generally applicable to U.S. issuers. Dividend payments are not guaranteed and the amount, if any, can vary over time. These risks may be heightened for longer maturity and duration securities. The strategy may invest significantly in issuers within a particular sector, which may be negatively affected by market, economic or other conditions, making the strategy more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in the sector.
Advisory services provided by Columbia Management Capital Advisers, an operating division of Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC (“CMIA”) an SEC-registered investment adviser that offers investment management and related services to clients participating in various types of wrap programs.
Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC and its affiliates do not offer tax advice. Investors should consult with their tax advisor regarding their specific situation.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
