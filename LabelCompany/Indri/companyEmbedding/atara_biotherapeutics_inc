Homepage Header Slider - Slide 1PIONEERING IMMUNOTHERAPIES FOR LIFE THREATENING AND DEBILITATING DISEASES






Overview
Atara Biotherapeutics’ mission is to develop therapies that have the potential to transform the lives of patients with life threatening and debilitating conditions.

We are applying our technology to harness, and augment, targeted healthy T-cell immunity to develop immunotherapies for the treatment of certain cancers, autoimmune diseases, and severe infections.

Atara’s allogeneic, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunotherapy platform is based on the precision of our CTLs in specifically targeting and recognizing antigens expressed by diseased or cancerous cells. This enables the CTLs to eliminate diseased cells without affecting normal, healthy ones. We are developing libraries of off-the-shelf, ready-to-utilize, therapeutic CTL lines that allow us to match an appropriate therapeutic CTL line from our inventory to each patient’s unique immune profile.

Company



About Atara 
Atara Biotherapeutics is a leading cell therapy company developing products for patients with cancer and multiple sclerosis (MS). The company was founded in 2012 and named after Atara Ciechanover who suffered from cancer before passing away.
Originating from over a decade of groundbreaking clinical experience at Memorial Sloan Kettering and QIMR Berghofer, Atara’s T-cell immunotherapies are precisely designed to recognize and eliminate cancerous or diseased cells without affecting normal, healthy cells. Our “Off-the-Shelf”, or allogeneic, T-cells are engineered from donors with healthy immune function and allow for rapid delivery from inventory to patients without a requirement for pretreatment.
Atara’s most advanced T-cell immunotherapy in development, ATA129, is a treatment for cancer patients with rituximab refractory Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disease (EBV-PTLD) as well as other EBV positive hematologic and solid tumors including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Phase 3 studies of ATA129 in EBV-PTLD are expected to start in 2017 and a Phase 1/2 study in NPC is planned for 2018. In addition, Atara expects to submit ATA129 for conditional marketing authorization in the EU in 2018.
The company’s next generation T-cell immunotherapy for autoimmune disease, or ATA188, selectively targets specific antigens of EBV believed to be important for the potential treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). The Atara clinical pipeline also includes allogeneic T-cell immunotherapies targeting Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1), or ATA520, and Cytomegalovirus (CMV), or ATA230.

Pipeline



Overview 
Atara Biotherapeutics is pioneering immunotherapies for life threatening and debilitating diseases. Our allogeneic cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunotherapy platform is built on ground breaking research and complimentary technologies that precisely target and activate CTLs to treat a variety of diseases.
We have a late-stage development pipeline with clinical and pre clinical product candidates. Along with our partners, we have generated clinical data supporting the therapeutic potential of our CTL product candidates in certain hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, autoimmune diseases and severe viral infections.






Our lead program, ATA129 is poised to enter Phase 3 trials for two indications and has been granted:

Orphan and breakthrough designation from FDA,
Orphan and advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP) designation from EMA, and
Access to priority medicines regulatory support (PRIME) for the lead indication from EMA.










The benefits of our allogeneic cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunotherapy platform are exhibited in our product candidates:

Off-the-shelf, ready to utilize therapies
Efficient management of therapeutic inventory
Precision targeting

Our core technology creates CTLs broadly targeted to recognize EBV and CMV viral antigens, and certain tumor associated antigens such as WT1
Our next generation CTL technology uses selective antigen targeting to create CTLs targeted for specific EBV, CMV, HPV, and BK viral antigens. This selective antigen targeting is being applied to development programs where we believe it may provide therapeutic advantages.
Prompt treatment – from the identification of need, we can deliver a therapeutic T-cell line for a patient in ~3-5 days.
Compelling safety profile

No lymphodepletion required before treatment
For ATA129, in 126 patients treated there were:

Nine possibly related serious adverse events, or SAEs
No infusion related toxicities
No evidence of cytokine release syndrome
One case of treatment-related grade 1 graft versus host disease, or GvHD, which resolved with topical treatment

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month.

Short Interest (07/14/17)    Shares Sold Short 4.45 M     Change from Last  -2.28%      Percent of Float 24.39%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Anti Age Skin 8 grams by GUNA Biotherapeutics 


                        Anti Age Skin 8 grams The skin is often one of the first organs that begins to show signs of stress and aging. Free radicals that are caused by excessive or prolonged periods of stress can damage skin cells and skin tissue and this can result in the signs we associate with age, like wrinkles and                        
                             blemishes. Exposure to environmental factors like wind and sun can also take a toll on the skin. The Anti Age Skin 8 grams by GUNA Biotherapeutics is a homeopathic preparation that includes alpha tocopherol 4C for its excellent antioxidant properties. The preparation also includes three varieties of Brown algae to promote drainage and detoxification and it contains capillary tissue 4C to promote healthy blood flow. Directions: Hold tube upside down and rotate the cap twice to release 1-3 pellets into cap. Remove cap and place pellets directly into mouth. Do not touch pellets with fingers or hand.

Homepage Header Slider - Slide 1PIONEERING IMMUNOTHERAPIES FOR LIFE THREATENING AND DEBILITATING DISEASES






Overview
Atara Biotherapeutics’ mission is to develop therapies that have the potential to transform the lives of patients with life threatening and debilitating conditions.

We are applying our technology to harness, and augment, targeted healthy T-cell immunity to develop immunotherapies for the treatment of certain cancers, autoimmune diseases, and severe infections.

Atara’s allogeneic, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunotherapy platform is based on the precision of our CTLs in specifically targeting and recognizing antigens expressed by diseased or cancerous cells. This enables the CTLs to eliminate diseased cells without affecting normal, healthy ones. We are developing libraries of off-the-shelf, ready-to-utilize, therapeutic CTL lines that allow us to match an appropriate therapeutic CTL line from our inventory to each patient’s unique immune profile.
