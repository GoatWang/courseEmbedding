ACE Online Seminar (OLS) Extension Policy







Effective for OLS purchases on or after 11/01/2010

Any student who purchases an online seminar (whether in a package or on a standalone basis) may receive free access to the same online seminar for the subsequent sitting, if they fail.
ACE will ask for verification of both failure (transcript) and original purchase (invoice from vendor).  If at all possible, please put these documents in PDF format.  Please note that a welcome email from ACE does not constitute an “invoice”.
A third sitting is not free. Please email acestudyguide@yahoo.com if you have failed twice and want access to the OLS for your third sitting.
If there is a major overhaul to the syllabus, ACE reserves the right to charge full price for students on their second sitting.
If you are planning on taking a sitting off, you should clear this with ACE in advance.  We generally will try to work with people with “non-traditional” routes (e.g. taking one or more sittings off, taking a 2 hour exam after failing a 6 hour exam, etc).  However, we greatly prefer clearing this in advance in order to avoid scams.
If you feel you have an extenuating circumstance, please email acestudyguide@yahoo.com and ACE would be happy to try to work with you.

If you have any feedback on the OLS, this extension policy, or any other product, please let us know.
Ben and Jacob

Testimonials (more)










																	The enormity of the material on either the Life Pricing or Financial Reporting exam is daunting and, at times, downright scary. The ACE Seminar helped to calm my nerves by showing that the material could be adequately reviewed in a short period of time. I found their practice problems to be particularly useful – Ben and Jacob clearly showed the path from problem to solution on a wealth of questions that were either constructed by them or taken from prior exams. I feel that the seminars were critical to my study progress, and with their help I was able to all of my FSA exams on my first try!																	
Rich, Bloomington, IL


																	I used the ACE online seminar for the ERM exam.  The seminar was excellent in explaining the concepts.   It was very clear and easy to understand. There were sections of the reading that I could not understand on my own that were made very clear from the ACE seminar.  I truly believe that the ACE seminar was a big reason why I passed the exam.																	
Joanne


																	The ACE seminar prepared me for the exam through the range of practice problems and easy to understand explanations. Additionally, Ben and Jake were very willing to stay after the formal lecture to answer any student questions and provide background information when needed. They also shared valuable test taking advice – which can be crucial for first timers on the written answer exams. Lastly the depth and scope of the seminar balanced the big picture concepts with the more detailed ones. I highly recommend this seminar for those planning to write the Life Pricing exam.

Live Seminar
ACE has been offering live seminars since 2007, but for the Fall 2017 sitting, there will be no LP live seminar. Please check back in the future for more information on timing and locations for the Spring 2018 live seminars.


Study Guide, Flash Cards, and Audio
Check Actuarial bookstore or Actex website for the most up to date release dates. The study guide is usually available around two weeks after the syllabus is released. The flash cards and audio are usually available around four weeks after the syllabus is released.


Online Seminars for LFV, LP, LRM, and ERM are ready!
These online seminars can be purchased at anytime. New videos are usually updated around 4-6 weeks after the final syllabus is released.
To experience the best quality and speed for OL seminar videos, please download the latest version of your browser.
























Welcome To ACE Manuals
AceManuals.com was created to complement our live seminars with a more on-demand environment that would allow students to study at their own pace and on their own schedule.
Please see the “Product Information” page for ACE product descriptions and samples. You can also find a link to where you can buy ACE products.
Over the years, we have received a lot of positive and constructive feedback from students. Keep it coming! We want to continually make the ACE products better via student feedback. We take all of the feedback seriously and are excited about incorporating feedback into the study guide, cards, CDs, and seminar.
Please contact us at customerservice@acemanuals.com with any questions
