I have spent the last 24 years working for Autodesk and currently run Global Human Resources and Corporate Real Estate, Travel, Safety and Security (CREFTS). Prior to joining Autodesk, I worked at Sun Microsystems where I created and developed Sun University.  Prior to that, I worked at Activision and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) – where I gained five years of international experience working in Switzerland and in the United Kingdom. While in Switzerland, I worked on European Executive Compensation and then Employee Relations and HR Management in the UK. I began my career at Hewlett-Packard in HR Information Systems. During the past 15 years in my current role, I have managed a successful CEO transition, helped land Autodesk on many Great Places to Work lists, and amplified the voice of our employees with 95% participation across the globe on our Employee Survey.  I have overseen the transformation of a number of HR programs – including the move to a more innovative performance management approach that focuses on regular performance feedback without written formal reviews or ratings. I have stayed at Autodesk for a good part of my career because our Company vision of helping people imagine, design, and create a better world is so inspiring. Within the HR organization we marry that vision with our HR vision which is to create an environment that inspires Autodesk employees to do their best. ExperienceChief Human Resources Officer & Corporate Real EstateAutodeskSeptember 1992  –  Present (24 years 11 months)San Francisco Bay AreaAs part of a large, global technology company, I have an extraordinary opportunity help define and drive the company culture in support of our business success. At Autodesk, HR plays a significant role and influence in setting the strategic priorities and goals of the company, from a people and culture perspective.  This past year, we have begun working to evolve our culture to drive simplicity, accountability and speed of decision-making. Creating a strong plan for Diversity & Inclusion, is also a major focus this year, given how important that is to having a healthy company culture.In my current role, I oversee all of the major aspects of HR, including HR Business Partnership, Talent Acquisition, Total Rewards, Leadership and Organizational Development, Employee Communications as well as Corporate Real Estate, Facilities, Travel and Security.  Additionally, I am on the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Autodesk Board of Directors, which is accountable for Executive Compensation and Succession Planning.  Beyond running all of HR, I serve on the Board of Directors for the Autodesk Foundation, something I’m extremely passionate about.

How to Qualify for the CPA Exam




To qualify for the CPA Exam, you need to meet educational and other requirements specific to the state or jurisdiction in which you intend to be licensed to practice.




Most states require that you have a bachelor’s degree before you sit for the exam. However, some states require that you have 150 hours of coursework (the equivalent of a Master’s degree) before you qualify to sit.

How to Apply for the CPA Exam




To apply for the CPA Exam, you must submit forms and transcripts, along with fees (ranging from $900 to $1,000), to the state board or its designee.




You may apply to any state or jurisdiction, but may only register to take the exam in one jurisdiction at a time.




Applications can be submitted at any time during the year, and the process usually takes from four to six weeks for first-time candidates.

Get Ready to Pass the CPA Exam
Once you’ve applied for the CPA Exam, it’s time to start preparing.








To give you the best chance of passing, Becker’s CPA Exam Review mirrors the CPA Exam in every way — so you’ll find no surprises on exam day.

Schedule

Schedule Your Exam
Once your application has been processed by the state board, you’ll receive a Notice to Schedule (NTS) which is required for you to schedule your CPA Exam at a Prometric Test Center. Generally, you’ll need to sit for your first exam within six months of receiving the NTS, although this can vary by jurisdiction.
The CPA Exam is offered two out of every three months of each quarter. The months when testing is available are called "testing windows."
You may schedule the exam parts in any order, and one at a time, if you prefer.
Testing is Available

January and February
April and May
July and August
October and November

Prepare for Success on the CPA Exam

Once you pass the first part of the exam, you’ll have 18-months to apply, prepare, schedule and pass the other three parts. Becker has laid out a program that can help you successfully complete the entire CPA Exam process within six to eight months.
