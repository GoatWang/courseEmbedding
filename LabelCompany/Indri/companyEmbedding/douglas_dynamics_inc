Douglas Dynamics says its new SnowEx V-Maxx G2 hopper spreaders offer greater performance and operating efficiency for contractors and municipalities on large ice-control applications. These hopper spreaders come equipped not only with updated controls and enhanced material-spreading features, but also:
A polyethylene-constructed, multi-angled material hopper that helps provide a continuous flow of material to a heavy-duty auger drive.
An attached vibrator that shakes the patented inverted V baffle to reduce material clumping for continuous material flow, whether spreading salt, sand or both.
A self-diagnosing, digital, compact dual variable-speed control with independent adjustment of spinner and auger speeds; easy control of the standard vibrator and optional accessories with convenient buttons; an auto-reverse function to easily clear auger jams; and control only requiring a single four-pin wire to enter the cab.
Selection from eight different V-box models, ranging in capacity from 1.5 to 6.0 cubic yards.
Optimized material placement and control due to a spinner that starts at the desired speed setting on the dial, rather than blasting upon startup.
A wider operating range for slower speeds to provide more efficient use of materials, while high speeds are still available for servicing larger properties.
A spread width variable up to 40 feet.
Suitability for use with full-size pickups, flatbed trucks or dump-bed trucks.
Electric power, which means no engines, pulleys, sprockets, belts or chains to maintain.
An efficient direct-drive auger transmission.
The FLEET FLEX electrical system for a consistent electrical platform and complete fleet interchangeability between all V-Maxx G2 spreaders.
Availability of liquid tank systems for pre-wetting material.
A top screen, fitted tarp and an auxiliary LED brake light.
A two-year parts and labor warranty.
Optional accessories, such as lights, strobes and pre-wet systems, which easily plug into the control module and operate with simple on/off buttons on the control.

Douglas Dynamics Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 3.14% Yield (PLOW)

The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
