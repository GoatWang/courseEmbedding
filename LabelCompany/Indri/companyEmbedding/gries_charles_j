New DOL Overtime Rule | CJG Partners LLP










































































 




1101 Perimeter Drive | Schaumburg, Illinois 60173 | T: 847-517-8222 | E: info@cjgpartners.com











										Latest News and Information					
						







New DOL Overtime Rule
Date: 06.21.2016
|
Startegic Planning 

On May 18th, 2016 the DOL released a final rule that radically increases the thresholds for overtime rules, expanding the number of employees eligible for overtime pay. Under the FLSA, employees who work more than 40 hours in a week are entitled to overtime pay, unless they meet the requirements of certain wage and duties tests. The new rule doubles the minimum salary threshold from $455 per week to $913 per week (which amounts to $23,660 annually to $47,476 annually) and raises the exemption level for those considered to be “highly compensated employees” from $100,000 to $134,004 annual salary. CJG Partners LLP understands that the DOL rule may impact major business decisions like hiring, expansion, offering new benefits or more flexible work arrangements for employees, and possibly even require reductions at your company. We can help you in assessing the effects of the new overtime-pay rule. Companies will have until December 1, 2016, to make determinations on which employees to reclassify as nonexempt and implement the changes. CJG Partners LLP has the expertise to guide you through this change and help you plan for the future.  More information on the new rule can found at the DOL’s website.

Explanation of Responses:

1. Represents acquisition of equivalent shares of the Issuer's common stock through the Issuer's Stock Deferred Compensation Plan.

2. Represents approximate equivalent number of shares of the Issuer's common stock held in the reporting person's account under the Issuer's Stock Deferred Compensation Plan, based on the most recent plan account statement. The approximate equivalent number of shares is equal to the dollar value of the reporting person's plan account divided by the closing price of the Issuer's common stock. As a result, the equivalent number of shares will fluctuate with changes in the market price of the Issuer's common stock.

3. Received in the Merger in exchange for director stock units (representing deferred director fees) ('DSUs") for 6,055 shares of FOBB common stock.

4. Amount reflects additional Director Stock Units credited to the Reporting Person based on the cash dividend paid to all stockholders of the Issuer subsequent to the last Form 4 filed by the Reporting Person.

Experience the BeenVerified Difference
See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."

The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.
