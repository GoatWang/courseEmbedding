 Small Company Fund, Investor Class Receives Lipper Fund Award 2016
Small Company Fund, Investor Class receives 2016 Thomson Reuters Lipper Fund Award 
Brown Capital Management is proud to announce that the Small Company Fund, Investor Class received the 2016 Thomson Reuters Lipper Fund Award1 for United States Small-Cap Growth Funds in the 10-year performance period, ranking 121 out of 303 funds ending 11/30/2015.
Launched in 1992, the Small Company Fund, Investor Class (BCSIX) is managed by Keith Lee, Robert Hall, Kempton Ingersol, Damien Davis and Andrew Fones. The team employs a unique and patient strategy, buying companies that earn $250 million or less in revenue (at the time of initial investment) and that save lives, time, money or headaches.  The portfolio is comprised of organizations that have the potential to grow revenues and earnings significantly over a three-to-five-year evaluation time horizon and beyond.  In 2015, the top 10 contributors to performance were names that have been in the portfolio for an average of nine years.
“We are honored to receive this important recognition – it is especially meaningful as the Small Company Service approaches its 25th anniversary later this year,” says Eddie Brown, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Founder.

About Thomson Reuters Lipper Fund Awards
For more than three decades, the Lipper Fund Awards program honors funds that have excelled in delivering consistently strong risk-adjusted performance, relative to peers. The Lipper Fund Awards take place in more than 20 countries in Asia, Europe, Middle East and North Africa region (MENA) and the Americas. The award winners are formally announced between January and April. Ceremonies take place in select countries.
1Lipper designates award-winning funds in most individual classifications for the three-, five- and 10-year periods.   The Small Company Fund, Investor Class (BCSIX) ranked 121 out of 303 funds in the 2016 United States Ten-year Small-Cap Growth category.
Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company, is a leading global provider of mutual fund information and analysis to fund companies, financial intermediaries, and media organizations. Any reference to a ranking, a rating or an award provides no guarantee for future performance results and is not constant over time. For a detailed explanation of the process, please review the Lipper Fund Awards methodology document at http://excellence.thomsonreuters.com
Lipper Fund Awards are granted annually to the funds in each Lipper classification that achieve the highest score using the Lipper Leader for Consistent Return methodology, a measure of a fund’s historical risk-adjusted returns excluding sales charges, relative to peers. Ratings for Consistent Return are computed for all Lipper classifications with five or more distinct portfolios. The ratings are subject to change every month and are calculated for the following periods: 3-year, 5-year, 10-year, and overall. The highest 20% of funds in each classification are named Lipper Leaders for Consistent Return. The highest Lipper Leader for Consistent Return within each eligible classification determines the fund classification winner over 3, 5, or 10 years. Lipper, a wholly owned subsidiary of Thomson Reuters, is a leading global provider of mutual fund information and analysis to fund companies, financial intermediaries, and media organizations. © 2016 Lipper, a subsidiary of Thomson Reuters.
Lipper rankings reflect a fund’s historical total return performance, excluding sales charges as applicable, relative to peers as of the above date. The ratings are subject to change every month and are based on equal-rated average of percentile ranks for the total return metrics over the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, if applicable. Lipper does not guarantee the accuracy of this information. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Fee waivers were in place for all or some of the periods.

~ Keith A. Lee

“In a boutique investment firm like ours, you get to know a little bit more about everything, as opposed to doing a specific process over and over every day. And by doing a variety of things, there's more teamwork and communication between departments, and more cooperation.”

Final capital gains distributions will occur on December 13, 2016, and ordinary income distributions on December 28, 2016.  Additional details will appear when updated information is made available.
On the day that a fund distributes a dividend a distribution or capital gains to shareholders, the fund’s net asset value per share (for each class of shares) drops by the amount of the dividend or distribution per share, to reflect that the distribution has been paid out. The drop in the net asset value does not reflect a loss in the shareholder’s overall investment value, but instead indicates that a portion of that value has been given to the shareholder as a capital gain or income divided. Keep in mind that there may also be appreciation or depreciation in the fund value from the market activity on that day that will also be reflected in the NAV.
Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund: As with all mutual funds, an investment in the Fund is subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of the principal amount invested.  There can be no assurances that the Fund will be successful in meeting its objectives.  Investment in the Fund is also subject to market risk, investment style risk, investment advisor risk, market sector risk, equity securities risk, portfolio turnover risk, small companies’ risk, and other risks as set forth in the Fund’s Prospectus.  Fund’s that emphasize investments in smaller companies generally experience greater price volatility.

 Small Company Fund, Investor Class Receives Lipper Fund Award 2016
Small Company Fund, Investor Class receives 2016 Thomson Reuters Lipper Fund Award 
Brown Capital Management is proud to announce that the Small Company Fund, Investor Class received the 2016 Thomson Reuters Lipper Fund Award1 for United States Small-Cap Growth Funds in the 10-year performance period, ranking 121 out of 303 funds ending 11/30/2015.
Launched in 1992, the Small Company Fund, Investor Class (BCSIX) is managed by Keith Lee, Robert Hall, Kempton Ingersol, Damien Davis and Andrew Fones. The team employs a unique and patient strategy, buying companies that earn $250 million or less in revenue (at the time of initial investment) and that save lives, time, money or headaches.  The portfolio is comprised of organizations that have the potential to grow revenues and earnings significantly over a three-to-five-year evaluation time horizon and beyond.  In 2015, the top 10 contributors to performance were names that have been in the portfolio for an average of nine years.
“We are honored to receive this important recognition – it is especially meaningful as the Small Company Service approaches its 25th anniversary later this year,” says Eddie Brown, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Founder.

About Thomson Reuters Lipper Fund Awards
For more than three decades, the Lipper Fund Awards program honors funds that have excelled in delivering consistently strong risk-adjusted performance, relative to peers. The Lipper Fund Awards take place in more than 20 countries in Asia, Europe, Middle East and North Africa region (MENA) and the Americas. The award winners are formally announced between January and April. Ceremonies take place in select countries.
1Lipper designates award-winning funds in most individual classifications for the three-, five- and 10-year periods.   The Small Company Fund, Investor Class (BCSIX) ranked 121 out of 303 funds in the 2016 United States Ten-year Small-Cap Growth category.
Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company, is a leading global provider of mutual fund information and analysis to fund companies, financial intermediaries, and media organizations. Any reference to a ranking, a rating or an award provides no guarantee for future performance results and is not constant over time. For a detailed explanation of the process, please review the Lipper Fund Awards methodology document at http://excellence.thomsonreuters.com
Lipper Fund Awards are granted annually to the funds in each Lipper classification that achieve the highest score using the Lipper Leader for Consistent Return methodology, a measure of a fund’s historical risk-adjusted returns excluding sales charges, relative to peers. Ratings for Consistent Return are computed for all Lipper classifications with five or more distinct portfolios. The ratings are subject to change every month and are calculated for the following periods: 3-year, 5-year, 10-year, and overall. The highest 20% of funds in each classification are named Lipper Leaders for Consistent Return. The highest Lipper Leader for Consistent Return within each eligible classification determines the fund classification winner over 3, 5, or 10 years. Lipper, a wholly owned subsidiary of Thomson Reuters, is a leading global provider of mutual fund information and analysis to fund companies, financial intermediaries, and media organizations. © 2016 Lipper, a subsidiary of Thomson Reuters.
Lipper rankings reflect a fund’s historical total return performance, excluding sales charges as applicable, relative to peers as of the above date. The ratings are subject to change every month and are based on equal-rated average of percentile ranks for the total return metrics over the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, if applicable. Lipper does not guarantee the accuracy of this information. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Fee waivers were in place for all or some of the periods.

Morningstar Ratings metrics. Morningstar Ratings are based solely on a proprietary mathematical formula based on measures of risk and performance that it recalculates each month. The ratings formula measures the amount of variation in a fund's or ETF’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees) emphasizing downward variations and rewarding consistency. Ratings are subject to change every month. The top 10% of funds and ETFs in the category receive 5 stars; the next 22.5%, 4 stars; the next 35%, 3 stars; the next 22.5%, 2 stars; and the bottom 10%, 1 star. As of November 1, 2016, Morningstar will no longer provide ratings for load-adjusted share classes.
Ratings are based on specific class performance of each fund. Ratings are based on specific class performance of each fund. Current fund performance may be higher or lower, which may change a fund’s star rating. Despite high ratings, funds may have experienced negative performance during the period. Performance may reflect a waiver of part of a fund’s fees for certain periods since inception, without which returns would have been lower.
Ratings (with load) reflect class-specific sales charges, if any. A class share ratings no longer reflect sales charges. As of November 1, 2016, Morningstar will no longer provide ratings for load-adjusted share classes.
