He was an editor on the Ryersonian newspaper and SAC president. In 1972 he received a Bachelor of Applied Arts from Ryerson Polytechnical Institute. He studied environmental science and urban geography at University of Toronto. He authored the official Ryerson history in 1975 and served on board committees, presidential and journalism search committees, and task forces revising the Ryerson University Act and photography courses. He served on advisory journalism committees at Ryerson and Humber College, and lectured.
Journalism[edit]
He was editor of the Whitehorse Star in 1957, and reporter and editor on the Toronto Telegram from 1958 to 1971. He was a "Day Oner"[1][2] of the Toronto Sun first as a daily columnist and then as the Editor from 1985 to 1997.

John Henry Downing, Junior, was born June 10, 1936 in Toronto, Ontario, to J. H.

He was an editor on the Ryersonian newspaper and SAC president. In 1972 he received a Bachelor of Applied Arts from Ryerson Polytechnical Institute. He studied environmental science and urban geography at University of Toronto. He authored the official Ryerson history in 1975 and served on board committees, presidential and journalism search committees, and task forces revising the Ryerson University Act and photography courses. He served on advisory journalism committees at Ryerson and Humber College, and lectured.
Journalism[edit]
He was editor of the Whitehorse Star in 1957, and reporter and editor on the Toronto Telegram from 1958 to 1971. He was a "Day Oner"[1][2] of the Toronto Sun first as a daily columnist and then as the Editor from 1985 to 1997.
