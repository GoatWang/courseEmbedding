EntreMetrix Announces New Product Launch | Business Wire


























































EntreMetrix Announces New Product Launch






February 12, 2007 12:49 PM Eastern Standard Time



IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--EntreMetrix, Inc. (OTCBB:ERMX) today announced the formal launch of a 
      new bridge financing tool for small business called Payroll Bridge.
    

      Scott W. Absher, EntreMetrix’s CEO, stated, “Payroll 
      Bridge offers a unique interim or short term financing option for small 
      businesses. In our experience working with small business clients we 
      have seen that often their greatest cash flow crisis comes just before 
      payday. Payroll Bridge will allow our clients to avert a payday cash 
      crunch by EntreMetrix carrying or floating their payroll burden to the 
      other side of their cash flow challenge.”


      Payroll Bridge is also designed to meet the specialized need of small 
      public companies where the expense burdens for being a public company 
      and pursuing growth opportunities often lead to using toxic financing 
      options to keep the business running. Payroll Bridge is a superior, non 
      toxic alternative to small public company bridge financing.
    

      About EntreMetrix: Based in Irvine, California, EntreMetrix is a 
      Business Development Company, regulated under the Investment Company Act 
      of 1940, providing essential structural and financial support to develop 
      eligible portfolio investments in small businesses throughout the United 
      States. The Company’s plan includes equity 
      distribution of each portfolio company to EntreMetrix shareholders of 
      record at the time of a public market entry of the Company’s 
      portfolio investments. For more information on EntreMetrix, Inc., visit 
      the company's Web site at www.entremetrix.com 
      or contact Scott W. Absher (888) 798-9100. The Company’s 
      corporate offices are located in Southern California at 18101 Von Karman 
      Avenue, 3rd Floor, Irvine, California 92612.

      statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation 
      Reform Act of 1995 (the "ACT"). Statements in this release that relate 
      to the Company's plans and strategies, as well as management's

      existing products and services are forward-looking statements. In 
      particular, when used in the preceding discussion, the words

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
