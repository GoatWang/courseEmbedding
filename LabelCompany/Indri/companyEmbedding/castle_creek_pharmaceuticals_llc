What is
Epidermolysis Bullosa?What is
Vertigo?What is
Epidermolysis Bullosa?


What is Epidermolysis Bullosa?
Epidermolysis Bullosa or EB, is a rare, genetic skin disease. There are many different variants of the disease, with different symptom severities and root causes. These variants all manifest as painful, blisters on the skin and internal organs as a result of friction and trauma.

Three types of EB, with some variation, all caused by a different genetic mutation, have been characterized:  EB simplex (EBS), Junctional EB (JEB) and Dystrophic EB (DEB).  EBS is the most common form of EB and often the mildest, although some types of EBS (especially generalized EBS) can be quite debilitating.  JEB and DEB are relatively less common and generally affect the patient more severely.




What are the symptoms of EB?
EB is characterized by mild to severe blistering on the skin, usually beginning in infancy and continuing into adulthood.  Blisters or sores on the mouth, throat and respiratory tract also characterize severe EB.  Thickened skin on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet and thickening or absence of fingernails/toenails may also be present.  Sometimes scarring may also lead to fusing of toes and fingers that can limit functional use of the hands and feet.  Anemia is sometimes common in severely affected individuals, which may also lead to growth retardation.
How many people are affected by this disease?
Based on a large epidemiology study that was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), EB is estimated to affect approximately 1 out of every 20,000 live births in the United States for the years 1986-1990.
It is estimated that there are about 15,000 to 25,000 people living with the disease in the US, although estimates vary considerably.
How did I inherit this disease?
The genes, that is the blueprints for making everything in the body and that are responsible for causing EB, are inherited by way of the X and Y chromosomes from parents.  Some forms of the disease have only one set of malfunctioning genes present in one chromosome, either the X or the Y (autosomal recessive disease), while other forms require that both chromosomes contain these abnormal genes (autosomal dominant disease).  These genes are normally responsible for making building blocks called proteins that “glue” the different layers of the skin together.  Patients with EB make abnormal proteins and sometimes do not even make these proteins at all based on faulty genetic information.
Is there a cure or any medical treatments for EB?
There are individuals with mild EB that may require little or no treatment and who never seek medical care.  Patients with moderate or severe forms of EB require family supportive care and often their quality of life is poor.  Apart from protecting their skin from trauma, patients with moderate or severe forms of EB may require the services of multiple healthcare providers, including physicians and nurses, as well as nutritionists and counselors who can provide psychological support for patients and their family members.
Currently, there is no cure for EB but only supportive care that may include wound care, use of bandages as well as pain management.  Blisters or blistering areas are wrapped in bandages that have to be changed frequently.  Preventing infection in affected areas is also a difficult task.
Intense research is on-going currently, both at the medicinal and genetic level by industry, government and academic groups.  Academic research in skin cell functional protein replacement is also active.
Where can I get more information and support?
The DELIVERS study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of CCP-020 (diacerein 1% ointment) for the treatment of EBS. For more information, visit http://deliversebs.com/ or see the study listing at ClinicalTrials.gov.

What is
Vertigo?
What is Vertigo?
Vertigo, which is derived from the Latin word vertere, that is ‘to turn’, is the illusion of rotation and the feeling that the environment is moving or spinning. Vertigo is a sensation caused by an imbalance in signals from the body’s sensory balance organs, including the eyes and inner ears, or abnormality in the way the brain interprets such signals.
Dizziness and vertigo are among the most common symptoms causing patients to visit a physician or the Emergency Department (ED); between 5-10% of people report symptoms of dizziness, vertigo, and imbalance at some time, and it may be as high as 40% in patients older than 40 years. It is estimated that about 4 million patients visit the ED for dizziness and vertigo[1]. Significant dizziness has been reported by 17% to 30% of adult community populations[2]. Falling can be a direct consequence of dizziness, and the risk is even greater in elderly people with other neurologic deficits and chronic medical problems.
Vertigo Causes
Causes of vertigo fall into two main categories. The first is central vertigo, which caused by a problem in the central nervous system, and may include a growth on cranial nerves called vestibular schwannoma, commonly referred to as an “acoustic neuroma”. The second is peripheral vertigo, probably caused by problems in the inner ear or middle ear. Differentiating the causes of vertigo can be helpful for providers to determine what possible treatments exist for each type.
Symptoms patients often experience with peripheral vertigo include the spinning, hearing loss, nausea, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears). In contrast, central vertigo often appears with migraines.  A condition called vestibular migraine is one of the most common causes of central vertigo.
The most common types of peripheral vertigo include Ménière’s disease, vestibular neuronitis, and Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) .
Ménière’s disease is an inner ear disorder that is characterized by unpredictable, recurrent events and it is associated with vertigo that lasts for hours, decreased hearing or hearing loss for some period, and ringing in the ears (tinnitus). Cold sweats, nausea, and vomiting with a sense of weakness are also symptoms associated with Meniere’s disease. Patients with Ménière’s disease live in constant fear of attacks of disabling vertigo and may require family support and counseling. Many patients can manage their symptoms with diet and lifestyle modifications as well as pharmacological treatment prescribed by their physician.
Vestibular neuronitis is due to infections, causing vertigo attacks that may last for days. Patients suffering from this condition usually do not experience hearing loss. However, there are manifestations in which a bacterial infection that affects the inner ear may destroy both equilibrium and hearing functions of the affected ear, a condition known as labyrinthitis.
Chronic migraine sufferers may also experience vertigo attacks with symptoms like Ménière’s disease. This condition is called vestibular migraine and headaches may or may not manifest during a vertigo crisis.
Patients with BPPV often describe a feeling of intense spinning sensation (positional) that lasts only a few minutes (benign) and often comes and goes without any specific reason or cause (paroxysmal). A complex system of semicircular canals filled with fluid, called the labyrinth, is responsible for maintaining body balance. In patients with BPPV, the formation or dislocation of small crystals in the fluid stimulates the nerves associated with these canals and creates the sensation of spinning and nausea. Patient also have involuntary eye movements, called nystagmus, which can help doctors diagnose this condition. Treatment mainly consists of physical maneuvers by specialists with the aim of re-positioning the crystals. In a small proportion of patients with persistent vertigo after the re-positioning maneuvers, pharmacological treatment with sedatives or anti-vertiginous drugs may be necessary.
For any type of vertigo, we recommend seeking the advice of a medical professional. The accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of vertigo can be very challenging and this is an area of continuous research.

Castle Creek Pharma has assembled a robust and well diversified portfolio of innovative and high potential late stage drug candidates in development for the treatment of a number of important diseases. Castle Creek Pharma’s products are advancing rapidly through development and have the potential to enter the market within 2-3 years.
 Specialty Dermatology and ENT
Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex

Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is the most common form of epidermolysis bullosa, a rare dermatologic condition where patients (many of them children) have a genetic defect that compromises the structural integrity of their skin, making it particularly fragile and prone to blistering throughout their bodies. The disease can be severely debilitating and there are no treatment options currently available.
CCP-020 (diacerein 1% ointment) is a new drug in development for the treatment of EBS. It is a potentially disease modifying therapy that blocks an important inflammatory signaling pathway in EBS.
The DELIVERS study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of CCP-020 (diacerein 1% ointment) for the treatment of EBS. For more information, visit http://deliversebs.com/ or see the study listing at ClinicalTrials.gov.

Vertigo

Vertigo is a sensation caused by an imbalance in the signals from the body’s sensory balance organs, including the eyes and inner ears, or by the way such signals are interpreted by the brain. It is commonly perceived as instability, a feeling of rotation or the sensation of dizziness, and it is often associated with lack of balance, nausea and vomiting. Vertigo is a common condition, can be highly debilitating and may lead to significant injury from falls and other accidents.
CCP-030 (Arlevert®) is a fixed-dose oral combination tablet containing 20 mg cinnarizine and 40 mg dimenhydrinate. It is approved in multiple European Union countries for the treatment of vertigo of various origins. The active ingredients work together both peripherally and centrally to reduce the symptoms of vertigo.

Premalignant Oral Lesions

Oral cancer accounts for approximately 3% of all malignancies in the United States, and approximately 25,000-30,000 cases of oral cancer are diagnosed each year. In addition, oral cancer is one of the most common malignancies in Southeast Asia, accounting for up to 30-40% of all malignancies in India. Despite recent medical advances, the 5-year survival rate for oral cancer is only 50-60%. Many oral squamous cell carcinomas develop from premalignant oral lesions, which include leukoplakia, erythroplakia, and oral lichen planus. The rate of progression to malignancy has been reported to be as high as 17.5%.
CCP-042 is in development for the treatment of premalignant oral lesions.


Other Areas of High Medical Need
GM2 Gangliosidosis

Lysosomal storage disease refers to a group of rare genetic disorders in which critical enzymes involved in a cell’s metabolism are defective or deficient, leading to the accumulation of toxic substances in a part of the cell called the lysosome. Lysosomal storage disease manifests itself in different ways, often affecting multiple organ systems, and varying levels of morbidity and mortality.
CCP-010 is a molecular chaperone that is being developed as the first treatment option for patients with GM2 Gangliosidosis (Tay Sachs and Sandhoff disease), a lysosomal storage disorder associated with significant neurologic morbidity and mortality, and for which there are no treatment options available.

 Urea Cycle Disorders

Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are a group of rare genetic metabolic disorders in which patients cannot properly metabolize waste nitrogen from nitrogen containing substances, and as a result experience elevated ammonia levels that rapidly rise to toxic levels.
CCP-110 is a novel mechanism drug in development for the treatment of hyperammonemia in UCDs that acts by “trapping” ammonia ions in the gut and rapidly excreting them from the body.

About Us








			About Us

			2016-10-01T16:51:19+00:00		

Castle Creek Pharma employs a unique strategy in selective asset identification and capital efficient development that is driving the company to become one of the industry’s most prolific developers of innovative and high potential late stage assets for the treatment of conditions with the greatest medical need. Our particular therapeutic focus is in dermatology and ENT.
Who We Are
Castle Creek Pharma is a fully integrated pharmaceutical company founded by an experienced team of pharmaceutical entrepreneurs.  We have rapidly assembled a robust and diversified late stage pipeline of innovative and high potential products in the specialty dermatology and ENT space and in other areas of high medical need.  We pride ourselves on the strong relationships that we have forged with our key partners in industry, academia and patient based organizations, which have been instrumental in helping us to advance our products rapidly in development.
What We Do
The mission of Castle Creek Pharma is to develop and commercialize high potential specialty drugs to make a life-changing impact on patients with the greatest medical need.  Often these are orphan opportunities that are neglected by other companies in the industry.  We are creative thinkers who pride ourselves on creating opportunity from the risks and challenges inherent in drug development and in the complexity of the pharmaceutical markets.
All of the diseases that Castle Creek Pharma’s products target are serious, debilitating and often life threatening, and the products that Castle Creek Pharma is developing are on track to be the first or among the first drugs ever approved for the conditions they target.  Castle Creek Pharma has a core development business of drug candidates in the high potential specialty dermatology and ENT markets, and an ancillary business of drug candidates in other areas of high unmet need.
Greatest Medical Need

At Castle Creek Pharma we focus on developing and commercializing new treatment options for patients with the highest unmet medical need. Many of the drugs that we are developing will be the first and only approved treatments for the diseases and conditions that they target. We work closely with patients, their families, physicians and payers to understand these conditions and the struggles these patients face on a daily basis. We look to clinical experience and scientific data to inform our drug development strategies and we aggressively pursue development of those treatment options that can make the most difference in patients’ lives.

Creative Opportunity

We pride ourselves on creating opportunities where other companies do not, whether the markets may be too small or non-existent today, whether the patents may be too weak or non-existent, or manufacturing, marketing and distribution may be too complex or expensive. We recognize these challenges and embrace them, and make it our mission to find creative ways to overcome them.

Late Stage, Strong Science

We focus on late stage product opportunities that have a strong scientific rationale and show great promise as potential life changing drugs for patients in the near term.  We invest aggressively to advance these products through development and get them to market rapidly so we can make them available to the patients who need them.

TWi Biotechnology Inc. Announces Development and Commercialization Agreement and Collaboration with Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals, LLC

		  To Advance its Drug Candidate AC-203 For Epidermolysis Bullosa
		

Dec 17, 2015, 05:37 ET
		  		  					
						 from   TWi Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


TAIPEI, Taiwan, Dec. 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- TWi Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (4180.TT) today announced that its subsidiary, TWi Biotechnology, Inc. (TWiB), and Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals, LLC (CCP), a spin off entity from Marathon Pharmaceuticals, LLC, have entered into a development and commercialization agreement for its lead drug candidate AC-203, which is currently in development for the treatment of epidermolysis bullosa (EB). Under the terms of the agreement, TWiB grants to CCP an exclusive license of AC-203, covering a worldwide territory with the exception of Asia but including Australia and New Zealand, to develop, register and commercialize AC-203. TWiB is eligible to receive an upfront payment and milestone payments based on achievement of predefined clinical and regulatory events and will receive double-digit royalties after product launch. TWiB and CCP will collaborate globally for AC-203 product development in any other future indications.
"We are very pleased to enter into the collaboration with CCP for AC-203. With their expertise and capabilities in orphan drug development, CCP is the ideal partner to rapidly advance these promising candidates to the clinic and, ultimately, bring new treatments to EB patients," said Dr. Calvin C. Chen, President and CEO of TWiB. "Epidermolysis Bullosa, or EB, is a very rare genetic connective tissue disorder that affects 1 child out of every 50,000 births. It is estimated that there are approximately 30,000 patients in the US, and close to a hundred children in Taiwan that are suffering from the debilitating disease. Patients with EB are also known as "Butterfly Children" in the United States and "Bubble Dragon Children" in Taiwan due to their extremely fragile skin that blisters and tears from friction or trauma. We hope this collaboration can quickly bring forth a new treatment for EB patients. Current treatments for EB are focused on the relief of symptoms such as itching and pain and wound care to prevent infection, which are expensive and may require frequent visits to hospitals. In contrast, AC-203 is being developed to prevent or reduce the blisters and so, if successful, may alleviate the suffering of the patients and their families from this debilitating disease."
Mr. Michael Derby, CEO of CCP added: "We are excited to begin work on a promising new therapy for the treatment of EB, and to expand on the progress already made by TWiB. EB patients are in dire need of new therapies and AC-203 represents a potential breakthrough in the treatment of this devastating disease."  
About AC-203
AC-203 is a proprietary topical formulation of a first-in-class, small molecule which has shown the ability to inhibit the production and activity of caspase-1 and the cytokine Interleukin-1Beta (IL-1Beta) through the inhibition of the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome associated signaling pathway and IL-1Beta has been demonstrated to be effective in treating a variety of diseases including arthritis, gout, and diabetes mellitus (DM). The active ingredient of AC-203 has been approved for treating patients with chronic rheumatic diseases in France and subsequently in other EU and Middle Eastern countries such as Spain and Italy since the mid-1990s.
TWi Biotechnology holds US and Taiwan orphan drug designations for AC-203 for Epidermolysis Bullosa treatment as well as two US INDs for the oral dosage form of the molecule for type 2 diabetes and gout treatment.
About Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB)
EB is caused by mutations in the DNA code that make up genes. Genes are responsible for making and expressing proteins. EB can result from a mutation in any one of the 18 genes that have been found to cause the disorder. These mutations, or errors in the genetic code, may not allow the affected gene to produce a specific protein, or it may result in the incorrect formation of that protein. Either way, the mutation does not enable the affected protein to work correctly thus resulting in extremely fragile skin, and other manifestations of EB including: anemia, cardiomyopathy, syndactyly (fusion of the fingers and toes), renal insufficiency, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), malnourishment, cancer, constipation, osteoporosis, muscular dystrophy and pyloric atresia.
About TWi Biotechnology, Inc.
TWi Biotechnology, Inc., a subsidiary of TWi Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is a leading clinical stage biopharmaceutical company based in Taipei, Taiwan, specializing in the development of innovative new drugs for unmet medical needs, especially in the diseases associated with innate immunity. The company is building its product pipeline through in-licensing and internal research. TWi Biotechnology's product development pipeline includes two drug candidates for treating type II diabetes, arthritis, and immunodermatology diseases.
About Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals, LCC. 
Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals is a pharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes niche, specialty branded drugs for targeted diseases or conditions with great unmet medical need. Castle Creek was founded in 2015 as a spin off entity from Marathon Pharmaceuticals, with dedicated funding and a team focused on innovative early stage asset creation.

Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals, LLC Key Developments

Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals, LLC Announces Results from A Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial
Mar 6 17
Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals announced that results from a placebo-controlled clinical trial for topical diacerein 1% in the treatment of epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) were presented in a late-breaker session at the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting in Orlando. Results were presented by Professor Johann Bauer, MD, MBA, HCM, head of the University Clinic for Dermatology at the SALK/Paracelsus Medical University and principal investigator in the trial. The multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial included 17 patients with EBS who were treated for four weeks followed by three-month follow-up and subsequent cross-over in year two. Results, which were previously reported, showed a 60% reduction in blistering among patients treated with diacerein 1% versus a 15% reduction in the placebo group at four weeks. At three months, 67% of patients in the placebo group returned to baseline blistering levels, versus 12.5% of patients in the diacerein 1% treatment group. Topical diacerein 1% was well tolerated with no treatment-related adverse events reported. EBS is the most common form of epidermolysis bullosa, a rare dermatologic condition where patients (many of them children) have a genetic defect that compromises the structural integrity of their skin, making it particularly fragile and prone to blistering over their entire bodies. Severe cases of EBS involve widespread blistering that can lead to infections, dehydration, and other medical problems. CCP-020 (diacerein 1% ointment) is an investigational therapy in development at Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of EBS. It is a potentially disease-modifying therapy that blocks an important inflammatory signaling pathway in EBS.


Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals Announces Final Results at EADV of Phase 2 Topical Diacerein 1% Data in Patients with Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex
Oct 3 16
Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals announced the presentation of final results from a Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of topical diacerein 1%, an inhibitor of interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), compared with placebo in patients with Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex (EBS). The data were presented at the 25th Annual Congress of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) in Vienna, Austria1 by Professor Johann Bauer, M.D., MBA HCM; Head of the University Clinic for Dermatology of the SALK/Paracelsus Medical University and the principal investigator in the trial. Data from the completed multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial were presented from 17 patients with EBS that were treated for a four-week period followed by a three-month follow-up phase in two subsequent years, with a crossover after the first year. The patient age range was 4-12 years with approximately equal numbers of males and females. 60% of patients in the topical diacerein 1% treatment group achieved the primary end point (at least a 40% reduction in the number of blisters) at four weeks. Only 15% of placebo patients showed a similar benefit. Continued benefit of topical diacerein 1% was also demonstrated after cessation of treatment through the follow up period of 12 weeks. Topical diacerein 1% was well tolerated by patients with no treatment-related adverse events reported.

Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals Raises $48 Million in Funding from Fidelity Investments | Business Wire
























































Castle Creek Pharmaceuticals Raises $48 Million in Funding from 
      Fidelity Investments




High-growth biopharmaceutical company plans to aggressively complete 
      development of its late-stage clinical pipeline targeting important 
      dermatologic and head and neck conditions






October 04, 2016 08:01 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BEDMINSTER, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Castle 
      Creek Pharmaceuticals, a rapidly growing biopharmaceutical company 
      with a focus on the treatment of patients with rare and debilitating 
      dermatologic and head and neck conditions, today announced it has raised 
      $48 million in funding from Fidelity Management and Research Company. 
      Castle Creek will use the funds to complete development of its 
      late-stage clinical pipeline, including its lead program for the 
      treatment of patients with epidermolysis bullosa simplex, which will be 
      starting a clinical registration trial in the fourth quarter of this 
      year.
    


      Castle Creek was founded by Michael Derby and Jeffrey Aronin, two 
      experienced pharmaceutical entrepreneurs. Derby, who serves as CEO, 
      previously founded Norphan Pharmaceuticals, which was sold to Marathon 
      Pharmaceuticals in 2013. Castle Creek Chairman Aronin is the CEO of 
      Marathon, and he was previously the founder and CEO of Ovation 
      Pharmaceuticals, which was sold to Lundbeck in 2009. Castle Creek has 
      rapidly assembled a robust and diversified late-stage pipeline of 
      innovative and high-potential products in the specialty dermatology and 
      ear, nose and throat (ENT) space, with a particular focus on rare 
      diseases and other areas of high medical need.
    

      “We leverage high-quality scientific data to develop important products 
      that can make a real impact on patients’ lives,” said Derby. “Our 
      products have established clinical proof-of-concept and are entering the 
      final stages of development for serious diseases, where few or no 
      treatment options exist today.”
    

      “Led by a top-tier management team with extensive experience, Castle 
      Creek has created a strong pipeline of high-potential drug candidates 
      that target serious diseases,” said Michael Levy, Managing Partner of 
      Octagon Capital Group. “Castle Creek’s product portfolio has the 
      potential to enter the market within 2-3 years, addressing unmet needs 
      of patients facing a range of debilitating conditions, and enabling the 
      company to establish a strong position in its core sectors.”
    

      Octagon Capital Group serves as the investment banker to Castle Creek 
      and advised Castle Creek in connection with this transaction.
    

      Yesterday, the company announced the presentation of final 
      results from a Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
      topical diacerein 1%, an inhibitor of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), compared 
      with placebo in patients with Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex (EBS).
