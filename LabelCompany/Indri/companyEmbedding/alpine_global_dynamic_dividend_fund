 Fact SheetMar 31, 2017









Rules-Based Laddered Approach
The Fund provides a rules-based, approximately equal-weighted approach to municipal investing with the objective of seeking current income exempt from regular federal income tax. The structure is designed to provide investors with a "smart-beta&quot;,1 core exposure to the municipal market.



"Smart" Beta
Through our "smart-beta" approach, we seek to acquire the most attractively valued slice of the market across the 5- to 15-year maturity range. In addition, we seek to minimize capital gains distributions by managing the Fund for tax efficiency .



Portfolio Fit
For investors concerned about rising interest rates, a rules-based, laddered strategy may provide investors with predictability of income. The Fund can be an investor's core exposure to the municipal market or serve as a complement to a broader municipal  portfolio.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volat ility, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than indicated. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at net asset value (NAV). The market price used to calculate the Market Value return is the midpoint between  the highest bid and the lowest offer on the exchange on which the shares of the Fund are listed for trading as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. If you trade your shares at another time during the day, your return may differ. Returns are his torical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in NAV or market price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested at NAV or closing market price (as applicable) on the payment date of the distribution, and are net of management fee s and other expenses. Performance less than one year is cumulative.The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a separate investment fund (the Portfolio). The returns at NAV for periods before the date the Fund commenced operations  are for a mutual fund that invests in the Portfolio (the Portfolio Investor). The performance during such period does not represent the performance of the Fund. The prior investment performance of the Portfolio Investor (rather than the Portfolio itself)  is shown because it reflects the expenses typically borne by a retail fund investing in the Portfolio. The Portfolio Investor returns are not adjusted to reflect differences between the total net operating expenses of the Fund and the Portfolio Investor  during the periods shown. If such an adjustment were made, the performance presented below would be higher, because the Fund's total net operating expenses are lower than those of the Portfolio Investor. Performance is for a share class of the Portfolio  Investor offered at net asset value.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund and may also invest d irectly. References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


†Intraday Indicative Value (IIV)The IIV is an estimate of the real-time value of the Fund's underlying holdings based on current market prices and should not be viewed as a projection of NAV, which is determined at the end of the day . Because IIVs will generally differ from the end-of-day NAV of the Fund, they cannot be used to calculate with precision the dollar value of a prescribed number of shares to be bought or sold. Investors should understand that share transaction prices ar e based on closing NAVs, and that NAVs may vary significantly from IIVs during periods of intraday market volatility. Neither the Fund, the Trust nor any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of IIVs no r make any warranty as to their accuracy. An inaccuracy in an IIV could result from various factors, including difficulty pricing portfolio instruments on an intraday basis. The IIV is disseminated every 15 minutes during normal trading hours and is as o f the time noted above. An IIV is not available when the market is closed.


‡Bid and AskThe bid and ask prices shown are as of the time noted and may not reflect current quotations. The Fund's NAV normally is determined as of 4:00 p.m. each business day.


About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the municipal market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. There generally is limited public information  about municipal issuers. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Investments in income securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of  principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and interest payments. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in  a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Historical performance of the index illustrates market trends and does not represent the past or future performance of the fund.
3. "Total Net Assets" are the net assets of the Fund. "Total Net Assets of Portfolio" are the net assets of the Portfolio, including the Fund's investment in it and any other investments.
4. Source: Fund prospectus.
5. Net expense ratio reflects a contractual expense reimbursement that continues through 5/31/18. Without the reimbursement, if applicable, performance would have been lower.

9. SEC 30-day yield is a standardized measure based on the estimated yield to maturity of a fund's investments over a 30-day period and is based on the maximum offer price at the date specified. The SEC 30-day yield is not based on the distributions made by  the fund, which may differ. Subsidized yield reflects the effect of fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Distribution Rate at NAV is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV. The Fund's monthly distribution may  be comprised of ordinary income, net realized capital gains and returns of capital.
10. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time. Please consult your tax advisor for further information.

Ratings are based on Moody's, S&P or Fitch, as applicable. If securities are rated differently by the ratings agencies, the higher rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying sec urities and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P's measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by  S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's) are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection  of the issuer's current financial condition and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the nati onal ratings agencies stated above.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund and may also invest d irectly. References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


†Intraday Indicative Value (IIV)The IIV is an estimate of the real-time value of the Fund's underlying holdings based on current market prices and should not be viewed as a projection of NAV, which is determined at the end of the day . Because IIVs will generally differ from the end-of-day NAV of the Fund, they cannot be used to calculate with precision the dollar value of a prescribed number of shares to be bought or sold. Investors should understand that share transaction prices ar e based on closing NAVs, and that NAVs may vary significantly from IIVs during periods of intraday market volatility. Neither the Fund, the Trust nor any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of IIVs no r make any warranty as to their accuracy. An inaccuracy in an IIV could result from various factors, including difficulty pricing portfolio instruments on an intraday basis. The IIV is disseminated every 15 minutes during normal trading hours and is as o f the time noted above. An IIV is not available when the market is closed.


‡Bid and AskThe bid and ask prices shown are as of the time noted and may not reflect current quotations. The Fund's NAV normally is determined as of 4:00 p.m. each business day.


About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the municipal market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. There generally is limited public information  about municipal issuers. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Investments in income securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of  principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and interest payments. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in  a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

                                Overview















                                How do the costs of NextShares compare?
                            

















Fund costs explained.

        NextShares, mutual funds and ETFs are subject to different fund costs that impact investor returns.
    

What are distribution and service (12b-1) fees?
Fund payments to support the distribution of fund shares and the provision of shareholder services under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. A fund’s 12b-1 fees are typically paid to the fund’s distributor and generally pass through to intermediaries that sell fund shares. Permitted 12b-1 fees are limited to one percent of average fund net assets annually. Mutual funds are often subject to 12b-1 fees that vary by share class. NextShares, and most ETFs, do not pay 12b-1 fees. A fund’s 12b-1 fees are disclosed in its prospectus and included in its total expense ratio.
What are transfer agency expenses?
The fees paid by a fund to its transfer agent and other intermediaries to process shareholder transactions and maintain shareholder accounts. Transfer agency costs are normally the largest component of mutual fund expenses other than management fees and 12b-1 fees. NextShares and ETFs typically have minimal transfer agency expenses. Transfer agency fees are characterized as "other expenses" in a fund's prospectus and are included in its total expense ratio.
What are flow-related trading costs? 
The trading costs a fund incurs to purchase and sell investments in connection with shareholder inflows and outflows, including commissions, bid-ask spread (i.e., difference between the best offer price to sell a security and the best bid price to buy the security) and market impact (i.e., the effect of a purchase or sale of a security on its trading price) costs. Flow-related trading costs are not disclosed in a fund's prospectus or reflected in its total expense ratio.

NextShares keep flow-related trading costs low by issuing and redeeming shares primarily in kind (using securities and other noncash payments) and by charging transaction fees to "Authorized Participants" (professional investors who transact directly with the fund). Most mutual funds do not issue or redeem shares in kind or charge transaction fees. 

What is cash drag? 
The impact on fund performance of holding cash. Cash drag hurts fund performance when the returns of the fund's noncash investments exceed cash returns, and helps fund performance when the opposite is true. Cash drag is not disclosed in a fund's prospectus or reflected in its total expense ratio.

NextShares that transact with Authorized Participants primarily in kind may experience less cash drag than mutual funds, which often need to hold cash to meet shareholder redemptions.
What is a fund’s total expense ratio (TER)?
A fund's total annual expenses expressed as a percentage of the fund's average net assets for the year, as stated in its prospectus. Fund TERs include management fees, 12b-1 fees, custody charges, transfer agency fees and other operating expenses of the fund. TERs do not include flow-related trading costs or cash drag. TERs also do not reflect fund sales charges or other costs borne by buyers and sellers of shares. Compared to mutual funds that can be purchased and sold at net asset value, NextShares and ETFs may be more expensive to buy and sell. 






    Compared to a mutual fund with the same strategy and portfolio management, a NextShares fund can offer cost advantages that can translate into improved fund performance.



No distribution and service (12b-1) fees. Unlike many mutual funds, NextShares offer investors a single share class with no embedded distribution and service fees.



Lower fund transfer agency expenses. Because NextShares are exchange-traded, their transfer agency expenses – the costs of administering shareholder accounts – are lower than for most mutual funds.



Lower flow-related trading costs. NextShares can keep the trading costs associated with shareholder
inflows and outflows low.




Less cash drag. NextShares generally don’t need to hold a significant reserve of cash to accommodate shareholder withdrawals. That means more of an investor’s money can be put to work in pursuit of returns.

    Bottom line: NextShares' cost savings offer the potential for improved investor outcomes.

                                How can NextShares potentially reduce fund capital gains distributions?












Mutual fund investors can get hit with big tax bills, whether or not their funds increase in value.
Mutual funds are frequently forced to sell securities they own to meet withdrawals by fund shareholders. Sales of fund positions at a gain can trigger capital gains
distributions – and associated taxes – for the fund's remaining shareholders. In fact, sales to meet investor outflows are often a leading cause of fund capital
gains distributions.1

NextShares work differently. When NextShares investors sell their shares, they don’t normally transact with the fund; instead, they trade through a broker to sell their
shares to someone else. Buyers may include other longterm investors or professional traders acting as market makers in the fund's shares. Because the NextShares fund itself is not involved in these transactions, the fund isn't required to sell securities to raise cash – so no capital gains distributions are triggered for remaining fund shareholders.

When market makers and other large investors accumulate sufficient shares of a NextShares fund, they can redeem their shares from the fund by transacting
through intermediaries called Authorized Participants. Here too, NextShares work differently than mutual funds. Like ETFs, most NextShares funds meet redemptions
through Authorized Participants primarily in kind, 2 meaning that the fund distributes current portfolio
holdings of securities rather than cash. By avoiding the sale of securities to meet redemptions, NextShares can potentially reduce fund capital gains distributions
and associated shareholder taxes. The enhanced tax efficiency that NextShares may provide can be a meaningful source of improved investor outcomes.

    Bottom line: NextShares can reduce fund taxable gains.



A fund’s investment strategy and portfolio turnover rate are other important determinants of the frequency and amount of its capital gains distributions. Fund distributions of net short-term capital gains are generally taxable as ordinary income; distributions of net gains from investments held by the fund for more than one year are generally taxable at long-term capital gains rates. The tax character of fund
distributions is determined and provided to shareholders after the end of each calendar year. In addition to capital gains distributions, fund distributions may include nonqualified ordinary dividends (taxed at ordinary income tax rates), qualified dividends (taxed at rates applicable to long-term capital gains if holding period and other requirements are met), exempt-interest dividends (not subject to regular federal income tax) and nondividend, or return of capital, distributions, which are not subject to current tax.
A NextShares fund’s redemptions may be effected partially or entirely in cash when in-kind delivery is not practicable or deemed not in the
best interests of fund shareholders.
As of March 31, 2016. Based on the mutual funds included in the Lipper large-cap, multicap, midcap and small-cap domestic equity categories and using the highest individual federal income tax rates in effect each year. Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant for shareholders who are not subject to tax or hold fund shares in tax-deferred accounts.
Source: Morningstar, Inc. Includes all domestic, international and global U.S.-registered equity mutual funds tracked by Morningstar.





Tax efficiency can have a meaningful impact on investor returns.

■
According to recent Lipper data, shareholder income and capital gains taxes resulting from fund distributions reduced annual returns of actively managed U.S. equity mutual funds by an average of 1.15% over the past 10 years and 2.23% over the past three years for individual investors in the highest tax bracket.3 That excludes state and local taxes and the taxes paid when shareholders sell their positions.
■
            Average capital gains distributions for equity mutual funds equaled 8.5% of fund net assets in 2015 — more than twice the 3.9% incurred in 2012.4

    There is nothing complicated about investing in NextShares.

    NextShares list and trade on Nasdaq and are priced at the fund’s next end-of-day net asset value (NAV), plus or minus a trading cost determined when the trade executes.1 Trading costs are fully transparent and can be controlled using limit orders.


Transactions in NextShares may be subject to selling commissions and other trading costs. As a new type of fund, NextShares may be offered initially by a limited number of brokers.





    Bottom line: Buying and selling NextShares is straightforward.



Buyers and sellers of share amounts of NextShares will not know the value of their purchases and sales until after the fund’s NAV is determined at the end of the trading day.
Not all broker-dealers offering NextShares may accept dollar-based orders. In share-based orders, you specify the number of fund shares to buy or sell.











Know what you pay to buy and sell

        Investor trading costs are the costs you pay to buy and sell a fund. These include the commissions, sales charges and other fees in connection with the transaction, and the difference between the executed trade price and the corresponding fund value (the amount of premium/discount) when the trade is priced.
    

        Because all NextShares trading prices are directly linked to NAV, buyers and sellers of NextShares always know exactly what they pay in trading costs. By contrast, ETF investors typically cannot measure their trading costs because they don’t have access to a reliable measure of underlying fund value at the time of trade execution.

 Fact SheetMar 31, 2017









The Fund
The Fund leverages the skill, experience and knowledge of Eaton Vance's equity research organization. Charlie Gaffney oversees the investment process – assembling some of the equity analysts best research ideas in one fund.



The Approach
The investment approach is grounded in hands-on fundamental research, which involves finding companies with consistent earnings growth and leading business franchises. We believe these companies may offer more consistency of returns over the long haul. S ector diversification is achieved by allocating assets across sectors represented in the S&P 500 Index.



The Features
Provides investors with a foundation of research-driven investments picked by an experienced research staff. Style-neutral framework including both value and growth investments can help lessen exposure to the value/growth cycle over time. Stock selection  and active industry allocation decisions generally serve as the primary driver of the Fund's comparative performance.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volat ility, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than indicated. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at net asset value (NAV). The market price used to calculate the Market Value return is the midpoint between  the highest bid and the lowest offer on the exchange on which the shares of the Fund are listed for trading as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. If you trade your shares at another time during the day, your return may differ. Returns are his torical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in NAV or market price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested at NAV or closing market price (as applicable) on the payment date of the distribution, and are net of management fee s and other expenses. Performance less than one year is cumulative.The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a separate investment fund (the Portfolio). The returns at NAV for periods before the date the Fund commenced operations  are for a mutual fund that invests in the Portfolio (the Portfolio Investor). The performance during such period does not represent the performance of the Fund. The prior investment performance of the Portfolio Investor (rather than the Portfolio itself)  is shown because it reflects the expenses typically borne by a retail fund investing in the Portfolio. The Portfolio Investor returns are not adjusted to reflect differences between the total net operating expenses of the Fund and the Portfolio Investor  during the periods shown. If such an adjustment were made, the performance presented below would be higher, because the Fund's total net operating expenses are lower than those of the Portfolio Investor. Performance is for a share class of the Portfolio  Investor offered at net asset value.

Charles Gaffney


Managed Fund since inception






Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund. References to investments are  to the Portfolio's holdings.


†Intraday Indicative Value (IIV)The IIV is an estimate of the real-time value of the Fund's underlying holdings based on current market prices and should not be viewed as a projection of NAV, which is determined at the end of the day . Because IIVs will generally differ from the end-of-day NAV of the Fund, they cannot be used to calculate with precision the dollar value of a prescribed number of shares to be bought or sold. Investors should understand that share transaction prices ar e based on closing NAVs, and that NAVs may vary significantly from IIVs during periods of intraday market volatility. Neither the Fund, the Trust nor any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of IIVs no r make any warranty as to their accuracy. An inaccuracy in an IIV could result from various factors, including difficulty pricing portfolio instruments on an intraday basis. The IIV is disseminated every 15 minutes during normal trading hours and is as o f the time noted above. An IIV is not available when the market is closed.


‡Bid and AskThe bid and ask prices shown are as of the time noted and may not reflect current quotations. The Fund's NAV normally is determined as of 4:00 p.m. each business day.


About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other con ditions. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

Neither the Fund, the Trust nor any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of IIVs no r make any warranty as to their accuracy.

1 Dynamic Currency Hedge: Strategy where a currency hedge can be varied (as opposed to targeting a constant level) and change over the course of time.

                                    These Funds are new and have a limited operating history.
                                    

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.WISE (9473), or visit wisdomtree.com to view or download a prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.


                                    There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. The Funds invest in derivatives in seeking to obtain a dynamic currency hedge exposure. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. Derivatives used by the Funds may not perform as intended. A Fund that has exposure to one or more sectors may be more vulnerable to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. The composition of the respective Index underlying each Fund is heavily dependent on quantitative models and data from one or more third parties, and the Index may not perform as intended. The Funds invest in the securities included in, or representative of, their Indexes regardless of their investment merit, and the Funds do not attempt to outperform their Indexes or take defensive positions in declining markets. Please read the Funds’ prospectuses for specific details regarding the Funds’ risk profiles.
                                    

                                    WisdomTree Funds are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC, in the U.S. only.

        WisdomTree has suggested that the baseline allocation for international equities should be considered from a standpoint of being fully currency hedged—that is, a strategic starting point that focuses on assuming just equity market risk without a secondary currency bet or component added to returns. 
There will be times when being fully currency hedged will enhance returns over unhedged alternatives (i.e., when the dollar is strengthening versus foreign currencies) and times when fully currency-hedged strategies will not participate in the currency gains of unhedged strategies (i.e., when the dollar is weakening).  
If an investor wishes to be more tactical and seeks to adjust the level of currency hedging over time, how can this be done without simply taking a discretionary and subjective view on the future performance of each currency against the dollar?  
To help answer the question of how much to hedge and for what currencies, WisdomTree developed a line of currency-hedged Indexes that dynamically determine when it is more attractive and less attractive to adopt a hedged position. This is done with a rules-based, quantitative approach that looks at three signals to determine currency hedge ratio: interest rate differentials, momentum and value.  
Each signal contributes one-third to the overall hedge ratio—the interest rate and momentum signals each will provide a signal either to hedge or not hedge, so will add 33% or 0% to the overall hedge ratio. The value signal will provide a signal either to hedge, half hedge or not hedge, so will add 33%, 17% or 0% to the overall hedge ratio. Thus, the overall hedge ratio for a currency can be 100%, 83%, 67%, 50%, 33%, 17% or 0%. 
Research supported by our partner—Record Currency Management Limited (“Record”)1— on the dynamic signals for these Indexes shows that for broad international benchmarks, each of these factors has added value (or provided higher returns) compared to being fully unhedged or fully hedged.  
What is interesting though is that, for any given currency, the strength of each signal can vary. Below we’ll discuss the merits of each signal and implications for how these dynamically hedged Indexes are positioned today. In short, our research suggests that the current environment supports tactically hedging a majority of currency exposures.

In creating an overall tactical hedging strategy for the broad international markets, the goal was to diversify the time horizon of these signals and have a consistent process across all developed world currencies, so as not to cherry-pick what signals worked for a given currency.  
The analysis below was conducted from December 31, 1988, to December 31, 2015 (“the period”), to illustrate the effectiveness of dynamic hedging that has been seen.2    
•	The interest rate signal: Tended to be the strongest signal for the broad international benchmarks, and worked over the medium term 
•	The momentum signal: Tended to be one of the strongest signals for many individual currencies and second strongest for broad international benchmarks, and worked best over the short term
•	The value signal: Tended to be the weakest signal from a pure value-added standpoint, but it has helped diversify signals and worked over the medium to long term   
For a broad developed international benchmark, the current hedge ratios suggest being approximately 75% hedged in the aggregate (reflecting the weighted average of the respective hedge ratios for each currency in the benchmark). For the euro, the signals suggest being 83% hedged and for the yen being 50% hedged.3     
 
Effectiveness and Current Hedge Ratios of the Signals

It is useful to look at the efficacy of each signal in the context of what the hedge ratios are suggesting should be hedged today.   
 
Interest Rate Signal: Clear Direction and Biggest Impact 
The most powerful signal over the period analyzed (nearly 30 years) has been the interest rate signal, which provided returns that were nearly 2% per year better compared to a fully hedged strategy for a broad developed international benchmark4. For the euro alone, the interest rate signal provided returns that were 2.68% per year better than a fully hedged strategy. 
In the current environment, in which the U.S. Federal Reserve just raised interest rates and the European Central Bank (ECB) took its rates further into negative territory,  this signal argues for being hedged and will likely continue to suggest this for some time. The same can be said for the yen. Taken by itself, the most impactful long-run signal overall would suggest staying hedged in the euro and yen and for many of the other developed international currencies.  
 
Signals Suggesting 50% Hedging the Yen 
Yen Weakness Losing Momentum: The momentum signal was the second most powerful signal for the broad international markets, adding 1.56% per year over a fully hedged strategy over the period, and was the most effective signal for hedging the yen on its own. The yen’s momentum signal did turn at the end of December 2015 and went from suggesting being hedged on the momentum signal to suggesting being unhedged. What caused this? In 2015, there was a lack of a persistent weakness in the yen. The WisdomTree Dynamic Currency Hedged Japan Equity Index thus adjusted the hedge ratio from 83% as of the end of November to 50% as of the end of December.  
Qualitatively speaking, we think the market is waiting to see more action from the Bank of Japan before the yen weakens meaningfully, in which case the momentum signal would follow another initial downward move, likely increasing the hedge ratio. For now we think the case to add meaningful unhedged yen exposure must be balanced by the still strong negative correlations between currency and equity markets. That is to say, if an investor were extra bullish on the yen, this would likely be a negative factor for this export-oriented equity market.  
The momentum signal for the euro continues to signal being hedged.  
 
Value Signals on Euro and Yen Close to 20% Undervalued Band 
WisdomTree’s dynamic hedge on the value signal is fully hedged if a currency is 20% or more overvalued compared to purchasing power parity (PPP), until it reaches PPP; unhedged if 20% or more undervalued until it reaches PPP; and half hedged otherwise. The euro and yen are within 3% to 6% of crossing the 20% undervalued threshold, which would lower the hedge ratio for each of these currencies by 17%. 
Some believe the fact that the euro and yen are already undervalued versus PPP metrics is less of a reason to hedge these currencies. It’s important to note that undervalued currencies can and have in the past weakened further, which is why this signal uses a 20% threshold. Others may note that for the yen, the value signal actually detracted value from a fully hedged strategy. Why then still keep the value signal in the dynamic offering? 
As we said before, the three signals were chosen to diversify efficacy over multiple time horizons and to have a consistent process across all developed world currencies. The value signal can work over longer periods, and it has worked for most of the developed world currencies outside the yen. For those lowering their hedge ratio on the yen—and the euro as well—just because they think it is already undervalued, we’d note that this undervaluation could increase further, and that the interest rates and momentum signals are at least as important, but also have been more impactful, in the long run.

ALPINE TOTAL DYNAMIC DIVIDEND FUND , ALPINE GLOBAL DYNAMIC DIVIDEND FUND and ALPINE GLOBAL PREMIER PROPERTIES FUND DECLARE REGULAR MONTHLY DISTRIBUTIONS FOR AUGUST 2017
BY GlobeNewswire — 4:00 PM ET 07/20/2017

Purchase, N.Y., July  20, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Board of Trustees of Alpine Total Dynamic Dividend Fund , Alpine Global Dynamic Dividend Fund (AGD) and Alpine Global Premier Properties Fund announced their same regular monthly distribution for the month of August 2017 as each had paid in the previous month. 








 Image: 0_int_Alpine.png 









Alpine Total Dynamic Dividend Fund (AOD) $0.0575 per share Alpine Global Dynamic Dividend Fund (AGD)  $0.065 per share Alpine Global Premier Properties Fund (AWP) $0.05 per share Dates related to the distribution declaration for all three Funds are as follows: Ex-Distribution Date                         Record Date                                        Payable Date August 22, 2017                                  August 24, 2017                                  August 31, 2017 The Funds’ monthly distributions may consist of net investment income, net realized capital gains and /or a return of capital. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the Funds will provide a notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources when distributed, which will be posted on the Funds’ website, or can be obtained by calling 1-800-617-7616. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Funds’ investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income”. Final determination of the federal income tax characteristics of distributions paid during calendar year will be provided on U.S. Form 1099-DIV, which will be mailed to shareholders.  Over the past five years, Alpine Global Premier Properties Fund paid a portion of each of the distributions in years 2012 (33.7%), 2013 (32%), 2014 (47%), 2015 (12.4%) and 2016 (47.7%) through a return of capital as determined at the end of each year and reported on the U.S. Form 1099-DIV issued for each year. Alpine Global Dynamic Dividend Fund (AGD) paid a portion of each of the distributions in year 2016 (4.4%) through a return of capital as determined at the end of each year and reported on the U.S. Form 1099-DIV issued for each year. Alpine Total Dynamic Dividend Fund paid a portion of each of the distributions in year 2016 (4.7%) through a return of capital as determined at the end of each year and reported on the U.S. Form 1099-DIV issued for each year. Please consult your tax advisor for further information. Alpine Global Premier Properties Fund (AWP) has previously adopted a level distribution policy under which AWP anticipates making monthly distributions of $0.05 per share and intends to manage its monthly distributions to include amounts that have otherwise been paid through a year-end special distribution. This amount may be adjusted from time to time depending on current market conditions and the projected performance of the Fund.  AWP’s level distribution policy is subject to regular review by the Board of Trustees. There can be no assurance that the amount of AWP’s monthly distributions will be maintained or that this level distribution policy will not be discontinued or substantially modified in the future. An investment in these Funds presents a number of risks and is not suitable for all investors. Investors should carefully review and consider potential risks before investing. An investment in the Funds’ common shares is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest. Your investment in common shares represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the Fund most of which are traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter markets. The value of these securities, like other market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. Your common shares at any point in time may be worth less than your original investment, even after considering the reinvestment of Fund dividends and distributions.    Other risks associated with investing in AOD and AGD include, but are not limited to, risks involved with smaller and medium sized companies, illiquid, foreign and restricted securities, and short-term trading. The Funds’ strategy of investing in dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out favor with investors and underperform the market. In addition, there is the possibility that such companies could reduce or eliminate the payment of dividends in the future. The Funds may hold securities for short periods of time related to the dividend payment periods and may experience loss during those periods.  Risks associated with AWP include, but are not limited to, risks involved with foreign securities which will involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. Because real estate funds concentrate their investments in the real estate industry, the portfolio may experience more volatility and be exposed to greater risk than the portfolios of many other mutual funds. Risks associated with investment in securities of companies in the real estate industry may include: declines in the value of real estate, overbuilding and increased competition; increases in property taxes and operating expenses; changes in zoning laws; casualty or condemnation losses; variations in rental income, neighborhood values, changes in interest rates and changes in economic conditions.

 Fact SheetMar 31, 2017









Rules-Based Laddered Approach
The Fund provides a rules-based, approximately equal-weighted approach to municipal investing with the objective of seeking current income exempt from regular federal income tax. The structure is designed to provide investors with a "smart-beta&quot;,1 core exposure to the municipal market.



"Smart" Beta
Through our "smart-beta" approach, we seek to acquire the most attractively valued slice of the market across the 5- to 15-year maturity range. In addition, we seek to minimize capital gains distributions by managing the Fund for tax efficiency .



Portfolio Fit
For investors concerned about rising interest rates, a rules-based, laddered strategy may provide investors with predictability of income. The Fund can be an investor's core exposure to the municipal market or serve as a complement to a broader municipal  portfolio.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volat ility, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than indicated. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at net asset value (NAV). The market price used to calculate the Market Value return is the midpoint between  the highest bid and the lowest offer on the exchange on which the shares of the Fund are listed for trading as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. If you trade your shares at another time during the day, your return may differ. Returns are his torical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in NAV or market price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested at NAV or closing market price (as applicable) on the payment date of the distribution, and are net of management fee s and other expenses. Performance less than one year is cumulative.The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a separate investment fund (the Portfolio). The returns at NAV for periods before the date the Fund commenced operations  are for a mutual fund that invests in the Portfolio (the Portfolio Investor). The performance during such period does not represent the performance of the Fund. The prior investment performance of the Portfolio Investor (rather than the Portfolio itself)  is shown because it reflects the expenses typically borne by a retail fund investing in the Portfolio. The Portfolio Investor returns are not adjusted to reflect differences between the total net operating expenses of the Fund and the Portfolio Investor  during the periods shown. If such an adjustment were made, the performance presented below would be higher, because the Fund's total net operating expenses are lower than those of the Portfolio Investor. Performance is for a share class of the Portfolio  Investor offered at net asset value.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund and may also invest d irectly. References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


†Intraday Indicative Value (IIV)The IIV is an estimate of the real-time value of the Fund's underlying holdings based on current market prices and should not be viewed as a projection of NAV, which is determined at the end of the day . Because IIVs will generally differ from the end-of-day NAV of the Fund, they cannot be used to calculate with precision the dollar value of a prescribed number of shares to be bought or sold. Investors should understand that share transaction prices ar e based on closing NAVs, and that NAVs may vary significantly from IIVs during periods of intraday market volatility. Neither the Fund, the Trust nor any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of IIVs no r make any warranty as to their accuracy. An inaccuracy in an IIV could result from various factors, including difficulty pricing portfolio instruments on an intraday basis. The IIV is disseminated every 15 minutes during normal trading hours and is as o f the time noted above. An IIV is not available when the market is closed.


‡Bid and AskThe bid and ask prices shown are as of the time noted and may not reflect current quotations. The Fund's NAV normally is determined as of 4:00 p.m. each business day.


About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the municipal market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. There generally is limited public information  about municipal issuers. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Investments in income securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of  principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and interest payments. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in  a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Historical performance of the index illustrates market trends and does not represent the past or future performance of the fund.
3. "Total Net Assets" are the net assets of the Fund. "Total Net Assets of Portfolio" are the net assets of the Portfolio, including the Fund's investment in it and any other investments.

9. SEC 30-day yield is a standardized measure based on the estimated yield to maturity of a fund's investments over a 30-day period and is based on the maximum offer price at the date specified. The SEC 30-day yield is not based on the distributions made by  the fund, which may differ. Subsidized yield reflects the effect of fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Distribution Rate at NAV is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV. The Fund's monthly distribution may  be comprised of ordinary income, net realized capital gains and returns of capital.
10. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time. Please consult your tax advisor for further information.

Ratings are based on Moody's, S&P or Fitch, as applicable. If securities are rated differently by the ratings agencies, the higher rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying sec urities and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P's measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by  S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's) are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection  of the issuer's current financial condition and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the nati onal ratings agencies stated above.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund and may also invest d irectly. References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


†Intraday Indicative Value (IIV)The IIV is an estimate of the real-time value of the Fund's underlying holdings based on current market prices and should not be viewed as a projection of NAV, which is determined at the end of the day . Because IIVs will generally differ from the end-of-day NAV of the Fund, they cannot be used to calculate with precision the dollar value of a prescribed number of shares to be bought or sold. Investors should understand that share transaction prices ar e based on closing NAVs, and that NAVs may vary significantly from IIVs during periods of intraday market volatility. Neither the Fund, the Trust nor any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of IIVs no r make any warranty as to their accuracy. An inaccuracy in an IIV could result from various factors, including difficulty pricing portfolio instruments on an intraday basis. The IIV is disseminated every 15 minutes during normal trading hours and is as o f the time noted above. An IIV is not available when the market is closed.


‡Bid and AskThe bid and ask prices shown are as of the time noted and may not reflect current quotations. The Fund's NAV normally is determined as of 4:00 p.m. each business day.


About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the municipal market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. There generally is limited public information  about municipal issuers. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Investments in income securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of  principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and interest payments. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in  a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

                                Overview















                                How do the costs of NextShares compare?
                            

















Fund costs explained.

        NextShares, mutual funds and ETFs are subject to different fund costs that impact investor returns.
    

What are distribution and service (12b-1) fees?
Fund payments to support the distribution of fund shares and the provision of shareholder services under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. A fund’s 12b-1 fees are typically paid to the fund’s distributor and generally pass through to intermediaries that sell fund shares. Permitted 12b-1 fees are limited to one percent of average fund net assets annually. Mutual funds are often subject to 12b-1 fees that vary by share class. NextShares, and most ETFs, do not pay 12b-1 fees. A fund’s 12b-1 fees are disclosed in its prospectus and included in its total expense ratio.
What are transfer agency expenses?
The fees paid by a fund to its transfer agent and other intermediaries to process shareholder transactions and maintain shareholder accounts. Transfer agency costs are normally the largest component of mutual fund expenses other than management fees and 12b-1 fees. NextShares and ETFs typically have minimal transfer agency expenses. Transfer agency fees are characterized as "other expenses" in a fund's prospectus and are included in its total expense ratio.
What are flow-related trading costs? 
The trading costs a fund incurs to purchase and sell investments in connection with shareholder inflows and outflows, including commissions, bid-ask spread (i.e., difference between the best offer price to sell a security and the best bid price to buy the security) and market impact (i.e., the effect of a purchase or sale of a security on its trading price) costs. Flow-related trading costs are not disclosed in a fund's prospectus or reflected in its total expense ratio.

NextShares keep flow-related trading costs low by issuing and redeeming shares primarily in kind (using securities and other noncash payments) and by charging transaction fees to "Authorized Participants" (professional investors who transact directly with the fund). Most mutual funds do not issue or redeem shares in kind or charge transaction fees. 

What is cash drag? 
The impact on fund performance of holding cash. Cash drag hurts fund performance when the returns of the fund's noncash investments exceed cash returns, and helps fund performance when the opposite is true. Cash drag is not disclosed in a fund's prospectus or reflected in its total expense ratio.

NextShares that transact with Authorized Participants primarily in kind may experience less cash drag than mutual funds, which often need to hold cash to meet shareholder redemptions.
What is a fund’s total expense ratio (TER)?
A fund's total annual expenses expressed as a percentage of the fund's average net assets for the year, as stated in its prospectus. Fund TERs include management fees, 12b-1 fees, custody charges, transfer agency fees and other operating expenses of the fund. TERs do not include flow-related trading costs or cash drag. TERs also do not reflect fund sales charges or other costs borne by buyers and sellers of shares. Compared to mutual funds that can be purchased and sold at net asset value, NextShares and ETFs may be more expensive to buy and sell. 






    Compared to a mutual fund with the same strategy and portfolio management, a NextShares fund can offer cost advantages that can translate into improved fund performance.



No distribution and service (12b-1) fees. Unlike many mutual funds, NextShares offer investors a single share class with no embedded distribution and service fees.



Lower fund transfer agency expenses. Because NextShares are exchange-traded, their transfer agency expenses – the costs of administering shareholder accounts – are lower than for most mutual funds.



Lower flow-related trading costs. NextShares can keep the trading costs associated with shareholder
inflows and outflows low.




Less cash drag. NextShares generally don’t need to hold a significant reserve of cash to accommodate shareholder withdrawals. That means more of an investor’s money can be put to work in pursuit of returns.

    Bottom line: NextShares' cost savings offer the potential for improved investor outcomes.

                                How can NextShares potentially reduce fund capital gains distributions?












Mutual fund investors can get hit with big tax bills, whether or not their funds increase in value.
Mutual funds are frequently forced to sell securities they own to meet withdrawals by fund shareholders. Sales of fund positions at a gain can trigger capital gains
distributions – and associated taxes – for the fund's remaining shareholders. In fact, sales to meet investor outflows are often a leading cause of fund capital
gains distributions.1

NextShares work differently. When NextShares investors sell their shares, they don’t normally transact with the fund; instead, they trade through a broker to sell their
shares to someone else. Buyers may include other longterm investors or professional traders acting as market makers in the fund's shares. Because the NextShares fund itself is not involved in these transactions, the fund isn't required to sell securities to raise cash – so no capital gains distributions are triggered for remaining fund shareholders.

When market makers and other large investors accumulate sufficient shares of a NextShares fund, they can redeem their shares from the fund by transacting
through intermediaries called Authorized Participants. Here too, NextShares work differently than mutual funds. Like ETFs, most NextShares funds meet redemptions
through Authorized Participants primarily in kind, 2 meaning that the fund distributes current portfolio
holdings of securities rather than cash. By avoiding the sale of securities to meet redemptions, NextShares can potentially reduce fund capital gains distributions
and associated shareholder taxes. The enhanced tax efficiency that NextShares may provide can be a meaningful source of improved investor outcomes.

    Bottom line: NextShares can reduce fund taxable gains.



A fund’s investment strategy and portfolio turnover rate are other important determinants of the frequency and amount of its capital gains distributions. Fund distributions of net short-term capital gains are generally taxable as ordinary income; distributions of net gains from investments held by the fund for more than one year are generally taxable at long-term capital gains rates. The tax character of fund
distributions is determined and provided to shareholders after the end of each calendar year. In addition to capital gains distributions, fund distributions may include nonqualified ordinary dividends (taxed at ordinary income tax rates), qualified dividends (taxed at rates applicable to long-term capital gains if holding period and other requirements are met), exempt-interest dividends (not subject to regular federal income tax) and nondividend, or return of capital, distributions, which are not subject to current tax.
A NextShares fund’s redemptions may be effected partially or entirely in cash when in-kind delivery is not practicable or deemed not in the
best interests of fund shareholders.
As of March 31, 2016. Based on the mutual funds included in the Lipper large-cap, multicap, midcap and small-cap domestic equity categories and using the highest individual federal income tax rates in effect each year. Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant for shareholders who are not subject to tax or hold fund shares in tax-deferred accounts.
Source: Morningstar, Inc. Includes all domestic, international and global U.S.-registered equity mutual funds tracked by Morningstar.





Tax efficiency can have a meaningful impact on investor returns.

■
According to recent Lipper data, shareholder income and capital gains taxes resulting from fund distributions reduced annual returns of actively managed U.S. equity mutual funds by an average of 1.15% over the past 10 years and 2.23% over the past three years for individual investors in the highest tax bracket.3 That excludes state and local taxes and the taxes paid when shareholders sell their positions.
■
            Average capital gains distributions for equity mutual funds equaled 8.5% of fund net assets in 2015 — more than twice the 3.9% incurred in 2012.4

    There is nothing complicated about investing in NextShares.

    NextShares list and trade on Nasdaq and are priced at the fund’s next end-of-day net asset value (NAV), plus or minus a trading cost determined when the trade executes.1 Trading costs are fully transparent and can be controlled using limit orders.


Transactions in NextShares may be subject to selling commissions and other trading costs. As a new type of fund, NextShares may be offered initially by a limited number of brokers.





    Bottom line: Buying and selling NextShares is straightforward.



Buyers and sellers of share amounts of NextShares will not know the value of their purchases and sales until after the fund’s NAV is determined at the end of the trading day.
Not all broker-dealers offering NextShares may accept dollar-based orders. In share-based orders, you specify the number of fund shares to buy or sell.











Know what you pay to buy and sell

        Investor trading costs are the costs you pay to buy and sell a fund. These include the commissions, sales charges and other fees in connection with the transaction, and the difference between the executed trade price and the corresponding fund value (the amount of premium/discount) when the trade is priced.
    

        Because all NextShares trading prices are directly linked to NAV, buyers and sellers of NextShares always know exactly what they pay in trading costs. By contrast, ETF investors typically cannot measure their trading costs because they don’t have access to a reliable measure of underlying fund value at the time of trade execution.

 Fact SheetMar 31, 2017









The Fund
The Fund leverages the skill, experience and knowledge of Eaton Vance's equity research organization. Charlie Gaffney oversees the investment process – assembling some of the equity analysts best research ideas in one fund.



The Approach
The investment approach is grounded in hands-on fundamental research, which involves finding companies with consistent earnings growth and leading business franchises. We believe these companies may offer more consistency of returns over the long haul. S ector diversification is achieved by allocating assets across sectors represented in the S&P 500 Index.



The Features
Provides investors with a foundation of research-driven investments picked by an experienced research staff. Style-neutral framework including both value and growth investments can help lessen exposure to the value/growth cycle over time. Stock selection  and active industry allocation decisions generally serve as the primary driver of the Fund's comparative performance.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volat ility, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than indicated. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at net asset value (NAV). The market price used to calculate the Market Value return is the midpoint between  the highest bid and the lowest offer on the exchange on which the shares of the Fund are listed for trading as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated. If you trade your shares at another time during the day, your return may differ. Returns are his torical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in NAV or market price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested at NAV or closing market price (as applicable) on the payment date of the distribution, and are net of management fee s and other expenses. Performance less than one year is cumulative.The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a separate investment fund (the Portfolio). The returns at NAV for periods before the date the Fund commenced operations  are for a mutual fund that invests in the Portfolio (the Portfolio Investor). The performance during such period does not represent the performance of the Fund. The prior investment performance of the Portfolio Investor (rather than the Portfolio itself)  is shown because it reflects the expenses typically borne by a retail fund investing in the Portfolio. The Portfolio Investor returns are not adjusted to reflect differences between the total net operating expenses of the Fund and the Portfolio Investor  during the periods shown. If such an adjustment were made, the performance presented below would be higher, because the Fund's total net operating expenses are lower than those of the Portfolio Investor. Performance is for a share class of the Portfolio  Investor offered at net asset value.

Charles Gaffney


Managed Fund since inception






Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund. References to investments are  to the Portfolio's holdings.


†Intraday Indicative Value (IIV)The IIV is an estimate of the real-time value of the Fund's underlying holdings based on current market prices and should not be viewed as a projection of NAV, which is determined at the end of the day . Because IIVs will generally differ from the end-of-day NAV of the Fund, they cannot be used to calculate with precision the dollar value of a prescribed number of shares to be bought or sold. Investors should understand that share transaction prices ar e based on closing NAVs, and that NAVs may vary significantly from IIVs during periods of intraday market volatility. Neither the Fund, the Trust nor any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of IIVs no r make any warranty as to their accuracy. An inaccuracy in an IIV could result from various factors, including difficulty pricing portfolio instruments on an intraday basis. The IIV is disseminated every 15 minutes during normal trading hours and is as o f the time noted above. An IIV is not available when the market is closed.


‡Bid and AskThe bid and ask prices shown are as of the time noted and may not reflect current quotations. The Fund's NAV normally is determined as of 4:00 p.m. each business day.


About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other con ditions. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund. References to investments are  to the Portfolio's holdings.


†Intraday Indicative Value (IIV)The IIV is an estimate of the real-time value of the Fund's underlying holdings based on current market prices and should not be viewed as a projection of NAV, which is determined at the end of the day . Because IIVs will generally differ from the end-of-day NAV of the Fund, they cannot be used to calculate with precision the dollar value of a prescribed number of shares to be bought or sold. Investors should understand that share transaction prices ar e based on closing NAVs, and that NAVs may vary significantly from IIVs during periods of intraday market volatility. Neither the Fund, the Trust nor any of their affiliates are involved in, or responsible for, the calculation or dissemination of IIVs no r make any warranty as to their accuracy. An inaccuracy in an IIV could result from various factors, including difficulty pricing portfolio instruments on an intraday basis. The IIV is disseminated every 15 minutes during normal trading hours and is as o f the time noted above. An IIV is not available when the market is closed.


‡Bid and AskThe bid and ask prices shown are as of the time noted and may not reflect current quotations. The Fund's NAV normally is determined as of 4:00 p.m. each business day.

1 Dynamic Currency Hedge: Strategy where a currency hedge can be varied (as opposed to targeting a constant level) and change over the course of time.

                                    These Funds are new and have a limited operating history.
                                    

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.WISE (9473), or visit wisdomtree.com to view or download a prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.


                                    There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. The Funds invest in derivatives in seeking to obtain a dynamic currency hedge exposure. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. Derivatives used by the Funds may not perform as intended. A Fund that has exposure to one or more sectors may be more vulnerable to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. The composition of the respective Index underlying each Fund is heavily dependent on quantitative models and data from one or more third parties, and the Index may not perform as intended. The Funds invest in the securities included in, or representative of, their Indexes regardless of their investment merit, and the Funds do not attempt to outperform their Indexes or take defensive positions in declining markets. Please read the Funds’ prospectuses for specific details regarding the Funds’ risk profiles.
                                    

                                    WisdomTree Funds are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC, in the U.S. only.

        WisdomTree has suggested that the baseline allocation for international equities should be considered from a standpoint of being fully currency hedged—that is, a strategic starting point that focuses on assuming just equity market risk without a secondary currency bet or component added to returns. 
There will be times when being fully currency hedged will enhance returns over unhedged alternatives (i.e., when the dollar is strengthening versus foreign currencies) and times when fully currency-hedged strategies will not participate in the currency gains of unhedged strategies (i.e., when the dollar is weakening).  
If an investor wishes to be more tactical and seeks to adjust the level of currency hedging over time, how can this be done without simply taking a discretionary and subjective view on the future performance of each currency against the dollar?  
To help answer the question of how much to hedge and for what currencies, WisdomTree developed a line of currency-hedged Indexes that dynamically determine when it is more attractive and less attractive to adopt a hedged position. This is done with a rules-based, quantitative approach that looks at three signals to determine currency hedge ratio: interest rate differentials, momentum and value.  
Each signal contributes one-third to the overall hedge ratio—the interest rate and momentum signals each will provide a signal either to hedge or not hedge, so will add 33% or 0% to the overall hedge ratio. The value signal will provide a signal either to hedge, half hedge or not hedge, so will add 33%, 17% or 0% to the overall hedge ratio. Thus, the overall hedge ratio for a currency can be 100%, 83%, 67%, 50%, 33%, 17% or 0%. 
Research supported by our partner—Record Currency Management Limited (“Record”)1— on the dynamic signals for these Indexes shows that for broad international benchmarks, each of these factors has added value (or provided higher returns) compared to being fully unhedged or fully hedged.  
What is interesting though is that, for any given currency, the strength of each signal can vary. Below we’ll discuss the merits of each signal and implications for how these dynamically hedged Indexes are positioned today. In short, our research suggests that the current environment supports tactically hedging a majority of currency exposures.   
 
Diversifying Signals and Time Horizon 
In creating an overall tactical hedging strategy for the broad international markets, the goal was to diversify the time horizon of these signals and have a consistent process across all developed world currencies, so as not to cherry-pick what signals worked for a given currency.  
The analysis below was conducted from December 31, 1988, to December 31, 2015 (“the period”), to illustrate the effectiveness of dynamic hedging that has been seen.2    
•	The interest rate signal: Tended to be the strongest signal for the broad international benchmarks, and worked over the medium term 
•	The momentum signal: Tended to be one of the strongest signals for many individual currencies and second strongest for broad international benchmarks, and worked best over the short term
•	The value signal: Tended to be the weakest signal from a pure value-added standpoint, but it has helped diversify signals and worked over the medium to long term   
For a broad developed international benchmark, the current hedge ratios suggest being approximately 75% hedged in the aggregate (reflecting the weighted average of the respective hedge ratios for each currency in the benchmark). For the euro, the signals suggest being 83% hedged and for the yen being 50% hedged.3     
 
Effectiveness and Current Hedge Ratios of the Signals

It is useful to look at the efficacy of each signal in the context of what the hedge ratios are suggesting should be hedged today.   
 
Interest Rate Signal: Clear Direction and Biggest Impact 
The most powerful signal over the period analyzed (nearly 30 years) has been the interest rate signal, which provided returns that were nearly 2% per year better compared to a fully hedged strategy for a broad developed international benchmark4. For the euro alone, the interest rate signal provided returns that were 2.68% per year better than a fully hedged strategy. 
In the current environment, in which the U.S. Federal Reserve just raised interest rates and the European Central Bank (ECB) took its rates further into negative territory,  this signal argues for being hedged and will likely continue to suggest this for some time. The same can be said for the yen. Taken by itself, the most impactful long-run signal overall would suggest staying hedged in the euro and yen and for many of the other developed international currencies.  
 
Signals Suggesting 50% Hedging the Yen 
Yen Weakness Losing Momentum: The momentum signal was the second most powerful signal for the broad international markets, adding 1.56% per year over a fully hedged strategy over the period, and was the most effective signal for hedging the yen on its own. The yen’s momentum signal did turn at the end of December 2015 and went from suggesting being hedged on the momentum signal to suggesting being unhedged. What caused this? In 2015, there was a lack of a persistent weakness in the yen. The WisdomTree Dynamic Currency Hedged Japan Equity Index thus adjusted the hedge ratio from 83% as of the end of November to 50% as of the end of December.  
Qualitatively speaking, we think the market is waiting to see more action from the Bank of Japan before the yen weakens meaningfully, in which case the momentum signal would follow another initial downward move, likely increasing the hedge ratio. For now we think the case to add meaningful unhedged yen exposure must be balanced by the still strong negative correlations between currency and equity markets. That is to say, if an investor were extra bullish on the yen, this would likely be a negative factor for this export-oriented equity market.  
The momentum signal for the euro continues to signal being hedged.  
 
Value Signals on Euro and Yen Close to 20% Undervalued Band 
WisdomTree’s dynamic hedge on the value signal is fully hedged if a currency is 20% or more overvalued compared to purchasing power parity (PPP), until it reaches PPP; unhedged if 20% or more undervalued until it reaches PPP; and half hedged otherwise. The euro and yen are within 3% to 6% of crossing the 20% undervalued threshold, which would lower the hedge ratio for each of these currencies by 17%. 
Some believe the fact that the euro and yen are already undervalued versus PPP metrics is less of a reason to hedge these currencies. It’s important to note that undervalued currencies can and have in the past weakened further, which is why this signal uses a 20% threshold. Others may note that for the yen, the value signal actually detracted value from a fully hedged strategy. Why then still keep the value signal in the dynamic offering? 
As we said before, the three signals were chosen to diversify efficacy over multiple time horizons and to have a consistent process across all developed world currencies. The value signal can work over longer periods, and it has worked for most of the developed world currencies outside the yen. For those lowering their hedge ratio on the yen—and the euro as well—just because they think it is already undervalued, we’d note that this undervaluation could increase further, and that the interest rates and momentum signals are at least as important, but also have been more impactful, in the long run.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
