Mr. Dattilo also is a director of Haworth, Inc. (since 2010) and is past Chairman of the Rubber Manufacturers Association and past Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation.



Qualifications Statement:    Mr. Dattilo's prior service as a senior executive of large, publicly traded companies, including as a former Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cooper Tire & Rubber Company and as an executive of a manufacturing company, provides him with extensive knowledge of complex operational, management, financial, strategic and governance issues faced by a large global public company. This experience brings our Board important knowledge and expertise related to global supply chain and distribution, mergers and acquisitions, lean manufacturing and related initiatives, international operations, human resources and talent management, accounting and internal controls, and investor relations. His more recent experience as an advisor to private investment firms also provides him with additional experience and knowledge related to strategic planning, capital raising, mergers and acquisitions, and economic analysis. Based on his senior executive experience and his service on other public company boards, Mr. Dattilo brings to our Board a strong understanding of public company governance and executive compensation.
