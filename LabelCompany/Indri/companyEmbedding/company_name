Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Squadhelp thanks for the excellent service! Now up for a logo contest! gr, Haydar haydar        The process was extremely easy, and I was able to receive an excellent name for my non-profit and ministry. Thanks! dawniegreene        WOW. We got a ton of suggestions. Did we set a record or something? :) This service was critical for the naming process. We just couldn't step away from our current brand and be creative with a new name. Funny though, I don't think we will use the winners exact name but it will be very close. I highly reccomend Squadhelp. Feel free to use my quote (or a cleaned up version) anywhere.  Baird            So much input from so many minds can only be a good thing! Touqi        Wish I thought of this idea peterc_83        SquadHelp is easy to launch, easy to use, and the value provided is well worth the money. I received over 350 domain name candidates in just a few days, most of them on the first day. The creative people who participate in these contests are very clever and they seem to really enjoy the work. I'm very pleased with the results. In fact, I will be paying the 'bonus' to register some additional names that turned up during the contest.  disambiguator            This was a fantastic help in naming my business!! there were so many great options that it did not matter if something was already taken as a web domain because the writers came up with so many new options almost minute by minute. I love this process and will refer others to this site. The entries were creative and much better than slinging names around with friends! Plus it went so quickly that the immediate gratification was fun. Love it love it love it!!! otesia        Squadhelp was a great solution to help me find the perfect name for my private practice!  lindseywittenhagen        People shared their ideas very quickly and creatively lism            What an excellent platform!

General questions




Why should I use Squadhelp?
You always have an option of hiring a consultant or coming up with the name yourself. However, Squadhelp can help you tap into the collective wisdom of thousands of experts across the globe. Typically, you would spend far less money with Squadhelp (our contests start at $199) than hiring an agency. Also, you will receive immediate results. Most contests begin receiving submissions within few hours after starting. Most importantly, Squadhelp provides you with choice: you get to see actual submissions from dozens (in some cases, hundreds) of contestants before you select a winner.


How much does it cost?
Our naming competitions start at $199, and our logo design competitions start at $299. You can also select a higher pricing package to attract even more participation and take advantage of additional features. See our  Pricing Page for details.


What kind of work can I crowdsource?
You can host competitions for Naming, Taglines, Logos, SEO Audit, Usability Testing and many other marketing related projects.


What if I want to keep my business idea private?
You can select a Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA) option at the time of launching a competition. This will ensure that only those contestants who agree to the NDA will be able to read your project brief and participate in the contest. The contest details will be kept private from other users as well as search engines. 


What if I don't like anyone's work?
Our creatives work extremely hard to ensure a successful outcome for all projects. If you do not like any of the submissions, we can add more days to your contest at no extra cost. In addition, our Gold Packages come with a partial refund option. If you do not like the quality of submissions, you can request a refund for the contest award fees (if you keep your gold package contest as "Not Guaranteed"). We also offer complimentary branding consultation to ensure you get the best outcome from your contest. Read more about our Refund policy.


Can I see any examples?
Our creatives have submitted over 4 Million names and thousands of logos on our platform. Here are some examples of Names, Tag lines and Logos that were submitted in recent contests. 

 - Name Examples
 - Tagline Examples
 - Logo Examples



Where can I read about feedback from other customers?

"I had no idea if I wanted a made up name, something hip, or to use my own name in some way. Needless to say I got a great combination of ideas for all 3 categories. Being able to message the entire creative team each day and say "i'd like to see more of _____" was amazing!! I truly loved this process and it gave me the peace of mind I needed to move forward in the right direction with my company name. Would recommend this to anyone "

Whether you’re naming your baby, your boat, or your brand, the process can breed nearly endless deliberation. Keep these principles in mind as you scout the perfect name.
By Matt Gordon and Nick Foley3 minute ReadEven at the best of times, naming is a contentious and emotional business. Whether you’re naming your baby, your boat, or your brand, the process can breed nearly endless deliberation. Keep these principles in mind as you scout the perfect name.advertisementMAKE IT MEMORABLE The search engine has changed everything. Instead of worrying about your spot in the phone book, you need a name that’s relevant and truly compelling. The key to any name–simple or complex, abstract or descriptive–is grabbing attention and staying memorable.Example: Yummy Tummy KoalasIntriguing, irreverent, distinctly Australian: Yummy Tummy Koalas instantly conveys the fun factor of this brand. FILL IT WITH MEANINGChoose a name that tells your brand’s story. Over time, you can expand the meaning of your name and add layers of depth to make it even more powerful–a visual identity, a color, a sound. The more significance your name carries, the more work it will do for you.advertisementExample: VisaFrom a word that initially meant only a stamp on a passport, Visa has surrounded its name with a host of associations–travel, access, opportunities, identity, official status–that allow it to tell the right story at the right time.SAY IT OUT LOUD The best names are the ones that people can’t wait to tell their friends about. Names that roll off the tongue invite customers to become your viral marketing agency. Say, shout, and even sing names you’re considering to see which one will echo for years to come.Example: SchweppesHappy coincidence? In 1783, Johann Jacob Schweppe opted to name his bubbly, effervescent soft drinks after himself. More than 200 years later, consumers still love calling out his name.advertisementDON’T WAIT TO FALL IN LOVEEven the best name may not seem terrific the first time you hear it. As your name evolves into a brand, it will acquire more and richer associations. Give the names you’re considering a chance to grow on you–and try to imagine what they might stand for five or 10 years down the road.Example: GoogleOriginally a variant of googol, the numeral one followed by 100 zeros, Google has come to represent a playful and innovative culture that delivers everything from email to operating systems.LISTEN TO YOUR FEAR Great names grab your attention by breaking the rules–but a name that defies your expectations may also appear scary. Look past the fear and you’ll find  energy and possibility. That buzz of surprise could be telling you that you’ve found a name that stands out.advertisementExample: BlackBerryProMail, an early name candidate for what we know today as the BlackBerry, probably would have been an easier sell in RIM’s executive suite. But once users got their hands on the perfectly sized device, it became obvious which name was the perfect fit.STAND OUT IN A CROWD If you are different, you want to sound different. Use your name to focus on what makes your brand special. Look at your category and where it’s headed. What do customers expect? How can your name signal something new?Example: W HotelsIn a market dominated by the prosaic names of people and places–Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt, and Radisson–W had the nerve to sound young, energetic, and stylish. Today, it’s the premier destination for business travelers who want to balance style with substance.advertisementTOO MUCH IS NEVER ENOUGHThe first hundred names you think of are likely to be the same ones your competitors tossed around. Use naming specialists to develop thousands of alternatives. To arrive at a name that meets all your objectives, you need a list that’s both broad and deep. Example: AccentureThousands of names were created, hundreds were screened, and scores were considered. One name rose to the top, and now countless conversations center around this brand’s “Accent on the future.”EXPECT ITS STORY TO EVOLVEThere are always reasons to dislike a name, but you can’t make the right decision if you never make any decision at all. Remember that names are just one part of your brand, and they’re elastic–you can stretch them to mean what you want. advertisementExample: VirginAs a word, “virgin” brings to mind anything from wool and olive oil to Mary and The Material Girl. But as a brand name, Virgin has come to stand for a provocative attitude that can sell everything from prepaid mobile phones to vacations in orbit. advertisementRelated StoriesLeadershipFound: Comfortable Sandals That Are Appropriate To Wear To WorkLeadershipThis Site Hopes To Be The First Troll-Free Sex Ed Oasis On The InternetLeadership“We Had The Wrong Goal Initially”: Pinterest’s Diversity Chief Adjusts CourseadvertisementVideoIdeasIdeasWhy This Van In Fresno Is Releasing A Million Bacteria-Infected Mosquitoes Every WeekIdeasNot Everyone Has A Garage, But What If The Streetlights Were Electric Car Charging Stations?IdeasThese Projects Are Using Art To Fight The Prison Industrial ComplexEntertainmentEntertainmentBigger Than Booger: Curtis Armstrong On Thriving Through Four Decades In HollywoodEntertainmentThis Ad Starkly Depicts Black Parents Having “The Talk” With Their KidsEntertainmentSee What America Hates Most, State By StateCo.DesignProductGo Inside The ISS, The Most Expensive Structure Ever BuiltProductThis Rotary Phone Is A Delightfully Analog Way To Read The WebProductSomeday You Could Swallow This Wireless Robot Like A PillFast CompanyLeadershipFound: Comfortable Sandals That Are Appropriate To Wear To WorkEntertainmentBigger Than Booger: Curtis Armstrong On Thriving Through Four Decades In HollywoodLeadershipThis Site Hopes To Be The First Troll-Free Sex Ed Oasis On The Internet

Growth Marketing
How to Name a Product – Do This, Avoid That  
The name you give your product, service or company today is going to stick with it.
Much the same the way that “Joanna Banana” and “Dweeb Wiebe” have stuck with me.
(Yes, I realize putting “Dweeb Wiebe” out there may not be helping the cause to wipe it from the face of the earth.)
We all know that names stick around.
Bad or good.
And, in most cases for most startups, we immediately think of longevity as soon as we consider naming our businesses and our products.
Will the name stick? Will people like the sound of it in 2 years? Will it continue to describe what we do and offer? Will it be outdated like MySpace tomorrow?
Longevity. Stickiness.
Those are good qualities for names. Great qualities! Fan-freakin’-tastic qualities!!!
But what about all the OTHER things you should be thinking about when naming?
The list of what to do – and what to avoid doing – when it comes to naming isn’t uber-long… but it’s definitely worth reading as you:

Name a product or company
Rebrand
Optimize your product names

But before we get into ye olde list, first things first! We’ve got to think about the entity we’re naming, so…:
Ask Yourself These Questions Before You Tattoo “ZeebleDoDo.com” on Your Arm
What follows here is a list of REAL questions from a REAL brief a REAL creative agency would send to you before they started working on naming your product.
Let me repeat because I know you like the sound of my nagging voice: This is not just a checklist on a blog post – so be a good copy hacker and read this then act on your answers to these Qs.

Am I naming a product or a company?
Products can be discontinued or sunsetted down the road. And digital products – which don’t normally have packaging – can have their names switched with ease. But company names are the foundation of both your brand and your future earnings.

~

Should the name be long or short? What’s the character limit?
If this product is going to be listed in a catalog online, you will likely have a character limit. Few names on software catalogs wrap. And consider the digital side of your product marketing! If you’re writing about the product in a subject line, you don’t want it to be 25 characters in length – ‘cos your subject line should be 50 characters or fewer. (Yes, that rule still applies.) Know your limit; name within it.

~

What is the purpose of the product I’m naming? What is its value?
If you’ve got a brand new offering with no competitors, as with inventions, you may want to opt for a more descriptive name. If you’re entering a space with lots of competitors, you may want to keep your USP front-of-mind when naming; think FreshBooks vs. QuickBooks.

~

Who is my target audience? Who is most likely to see the name and buy?
What’s more important when naming than the audience that’s looking to buy your solution? Don’t ask them what to name it. But DO ask them other questions in surveys, like Ruben Gamez did. (He went from the names “Basic” and “Premium” for his products… to the names “Freelance”, “Studio” and “Agency” – all based on what his users told him in a survey!)

~

How does my target audience talk? What is their education and reading level? What are the names of products they buy and love?
I’m thinking “OMGfacts” here. Need I say more?

~

Would my audience be more receptive to a real word or a brand spankin’ new word that I make up?
Graduate students may expect a name that’s more X, and tweens may expect a name that’s more Y, and tweens who are planning to go to grad school may expect a name that’s more Z.

~


Should the name evoke some sort of emotion?–is emotion important to converting people?
Huggies comes to mind. It’s a freakin’ diaper… but the name doesn’t sound like that’s all it’s about.

~

Should the name consider gender?
This could be important if you’re introducing a product that is well-known as serving one gender to the other gender. Like undereye cream for men.

~

In what channels will it be used? Only on my site… or in print materials, in packaging, on T-shirts, on TV commercials, on the radio?
When designers create logos, they think about how it will look when stitched on a hat and when displayed online. You, as a copy hacker, need to think about the words – particularly the sound of the words. The pronunciation. Is it easy to pronounce? Easy to repeat? Or is it a tongue-twister waiting to happen?

~

Will people outside my country see it?
Globalization, folks! If it can be found and bought online, chances are good people from Egypt, Korea, Scotland and the Ukraine will see it. They could be customers (in some cases, like digital products). So, what might your product name mean in their language and unique cultural context? I was once naming a product for banks in India, and I recommended “MoMo”… which I quickly learned is some kind of dumpling. The banks did not want to be associated with a dumpling. So that was the end of that.

~

If there’s a larger family of product names, what common thread runs through those? Am I willing to change all the names, or should the name instead fit the family?
Once Apple named the iPod, the rest of the family that followed it had to lead with the “i”. Including the iPad (of course). Interesting fact: before the iPad was launched, naming guru Hayes Roth of Landor noted that there was concern it sounded too much like a feminine hygiene product. Once the product launched, it never came up again. Read more about this on The Atlantic

~

Are there competitors in this category with names I should be considering, whether I’m planning on steering clear of those names or copying ’em?
If you’re naming a car, you might not want to start it with an “F” unless you’re naming a card for Ford — Fusion, F-150 and Focus. On the other hand, if you’re naming a car and you want it to be considered in the league of BMW, you may want to number the car and the others in the family.

~

Does traffic generation matter a lot to me?
An often-overlooked way to arrive at a name is by doing some keyword research. After all, when your product’s name appears on your site – and it normally appears in numerous places – that’s an organic keyword. Consider keywords – like “Free Invoicing” and “Universal Phone Charger” – when taking a more literal spin with your naming.

May seem like a lot of questions.
But I’d put money on the likelihood of most people – including you – actually thinking about this stuff when it comes time to name something in business. You just don’t write the questions down as I have above.
Assess Your Shortlist of Product Names
Once you’ve brainstormed using the above list, name ideas may start popping into your head. Write them all down. This could mean writing down 100s.
Trust me: agencies go through HUNDREDS of names in this process.
Your startup should do the same.
When you’ve whittled down your list, assess the shortlist against these questions:

Is it easy to remember?
Is it easy to understand?
Is it easy to pronounce?
Is it accessible to my target audience? (That is, do they need to have special knowledge they don’t have to ‘translate’ it and understand. Think Google, Nike and Kijiji.)
Is it trademarked or copyrighted?
Is the domain name available?
Are there any negative connotations or associations with it?

Choosing Your Name: What to Do… and What to Avoid
WHAT TO DO

Be more memorable with alliteration, like PayPal and Lincoln Logs
Keep it short
Make sure it’s easy to pronounce
Make sure that, when you pronounce it, it doesn’t sound like something else
Make sure that, when it’s written in a domain name as 1 word, it doesn’t look like something else
Test the name in context – like on your website “Plans & Pricing” page
Consider how a tagline might fit with it (and remember that abstract names often require descriptive tags)

 
WHAT TO AVOID

Generic, soulless names
Proving how clever you are – “clear” is still a great copy strategy in naming!
Knocking off the competition / Playing the copycat
Asking people explicitly for feedback on your name – especially whether they “like it” or not
Using literal or highly descriptive phrases/words your competitors can imitate
Words that are commonly misspelled (e.g., “public” often loses its “l” – I’m not kidding… I’ve seen this 2x in publications recently)

As a final thought today, consider this: over 260,000 trademark applications were filed in the United States in 2003 and over 98 percent of the dictionary is registered as a “dot com.”
Moral of the story: naming is hard!
But when you put in the time upfront – without losing your passion, vision and creativity – you can land on a cool name… which you can then test with customers by scoring memorability, suitability and neg/pos associations. Fun!

Great article Joanna






Justin March



What a fantastic article Joanna, well done.
I somewhat agree with Jim “if you don’t make any huge mistakes, your reputation for providing value is far more important.” A real revelation for me was when I read Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind by Al Reis.
My feeling is that your brand is the foundation on which your marketing plan sits, your name is secondary to your brand but they are still obviously connected. 
I don’t believe that anyone gets it 100% right and there are other constraints as well, which domains are available, whats your budget.
Sorting out a name is therefore a tough thing to do, naming is hard, I think that the secret lies in positioning, if you position your brand correctly often you are treading new ground and are more likely to avoid trademark issues and domain name scarcity.






Jim Gray



Great analysis of a tricky and often stressful topic.
Domain names & Google-ability add a twist. Say I register “fooapp.com” for a single-product business. Are people going to call me “foo” or “fooapp” in conversation? If I use a business name distinct from the product name (foo by bar @ fooapp.com) will people recognize “bar” or just “foo” if the business expands in the future? If people search for “foo” or “bar” by name, will it automatically rank fooapp.com first on Google, or will there be collisions with other names?
But I think the biggest rule of naming is, “if you don’t make any huge mistakes, your reputation for providing value is far more important.” What’s a Ford or a Disney or a Xerox anyway? These names are already good by Joanna’s criteria, but we know them because their owners built things and brought them to market. If you’re pre-product, don’t obsess over naming for too long. Maybe even put it off by picking a provisional name, then come back once you have a firmer grasp on the personality of your brand and a better understanding of your market.






Joanna Wiebe



I can’t agree more with you on the “don’t obsess over naming” part. Although a name can help shape a brand’s personality and even the direction of the product… that might be a bad thing in your earliest stages. It’s like allowing a baby to name itself (if babies could talk): you don’t even know who you are yet or what you stand for! So start with something, but be flexible enough that you’re okay with changing it, even just a little, when you get a stronger sense of your brand values and your position.

Everything is very open with a very clear description of the challenges.
It was really informative. Your website is extremely
helpful. Thanks for sharing!

Product naming is the discipline of deciding what a product will be called, and is very similar in concept and approach to the process of deciding on a name for a company or organization. Product naming is considered a critical part of the branding process, which includes all of the marketing activities that affect the brand image, such as positioning and the design of logo, packaging and the product itself. The process involved in product naming can take months or years to complete. Some key steps include specifying the objectives of the branding, developing the product name itself, evaluating names through target market testing and focus groups, choosing a final product name, and finally identifying it as a trademark for protection.[1]

Principles[edit]
A key ingredient in launching a successful company is the selection of its name.[2] Product names that are considered generally sound have several qualities in common.

They strategically distinguish the product from its competitors by conveying its unique positioning
They hold appeal for the product’s target audience
They imply or evoke a salient brand attribute, quality or benefit.
They are available for legal protection and "trademark".
They allow companies to bond with their customers to create loyalty.
They have a symbolic association that fortifies the image of a company or a product to the consumers.
They help motivate customers to buy the product.
They can be legally acquired and developed.

Types of names[edit]
Brand names typically fall into several different categories.[3]
Acronyms and Abbreviations[edit]
AFLAC, IBM, M&M (for Forrest Mars and Bruce Murrie).
Amalgam[edit]
Names created by taking parts of words and putting them together: Nabisco (National Biscuit Company).
Alliteration and Rhyme[edit]
Fun to say, and particularly memorable: FAT BAT, YouTube, Piggly Wiggly.
Appropriation[edit]
Use the idea for one thing and apply it to another: Caterpillar, Reebok.
Descriptive[edit]
Descriptive names ascribe to the product a characteristic: Toys R Us, General Motors.
Clever Statement[edit]
Names don't have to be just a word or two: Seven for All Mankind, I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!, The Boring Company.
Evocative[edit]
Invoke a vivid image that alludes to a brand benefit: London Fog, Amazon.
Founders' Names (Eponyms)[edit]
Use the name of a founder or founder family member: Barneys, Hewlett-Packard, and Wendy's.
Geography[edit]
Chose a name associated with company/product location: eBay for Echo Bay (a fictional place as well as the shortened form of "Echo Bay Technology Group," the name of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar's consulting company, according to the List of company name etymologies), Fuji for the tallest mountain in Japan, Cisco for San Francisco.
HomeNON[edit]
For a name with personality: Yahoo!, Cracker Jack. However, Yahoo is the pronunciation of the Chinese name of one of its founders, Jerry Yang.[citation needed]
Ingredients[edit]
Base the name on ingredients: Clorox for chlorine plus sodium hydroxide, Pepsi for the digestive enzyme pepsin.
Merged[edit]
When two companies merge into one, sometimes both names are kept: ExxonMobil, Cadbury Schweppes.
Mimetics[edit]
Use alternative spellings for common sounds: 2(x)ist, Krispy Kreme.
Nickname[edit]
Use a founder's nickname: Adidas aka Adolf Dassler, Haribo Hans Riegel Bonn, Kinkos.
Neologism[edit]
A completely new made-up word: Kodak, Verizon, Mimex.
Onomatopoeia[edit]
Use a sound associated with a product function or other brand idea: Twitter, Meow Mix.
Personification[edit]
Create a character or adopt an existing personage: Green Giant, Midas Mufflers.
Portmanteau[edit]
Name is a combination of two (or more) words or morphemes, and their definitions, into one new word: Travelocity, Pinterest.
Product naming techniques[edit]
Linguistically, names are developed by combining morphemes, phonemes and syntax to create a desired representation of a product.
Morphemes differ from words in that many morphemes may not be able to stand alone. The Sprint name is composed of a single word and a single morpheme. Conversely, a brand like Acuvue is composed of two morphemes, each with a distinct meaning. While "vue" may be able to stand as its own word, "acu" is seen as a prefix or a bound morpheme that must connect to a free morpheme like "vue."[4]
Phonemes are minimal units of sound. Depending on the speaker’s accent, the English language has about 44 phonemes.[5] In product naming, names that are phonetically easy to pronounce and that are well balanced with vowels and consonants have an advantage over those that are not. Likewise, names that begin with or stress plosive consonant sounds B, hard C, D, G, K, P or T are often used because of their attention-getting quality.[6] Some phoneme sounds in English, for example L, V, F and W are thought of as feminine, while others such as X, M and Z are viewed as masculine.[7]
Syntax, or word order, is key to consumers’ perceptions of a product name. Banana Republic would not carry the same meaning were it changed to "Republic Banana." Syntax also has significant implications for the naming of global products, because syntax has been argued to cross the barrier from one language to another.[8] (See the pioneering work on Universal Grammar by Noam Chomsky)

Owning a Name: Trademarks, URLs and beyond[edit]
A consideration companies find important in developing a product name is its "trademarkability". Product name trademarks may be established in a number of ways:

In many countries, including the United States, names can be used as trademarks without formal registration through first use or common law—simply to protect an established product’s name and reputation.
Product names can be formally registered within a state, with protection limited to that state’s borders.
In the United States, a federal trademark registration is filed with the USPTO and offered protection for as long as the mark is in use.
The preeminent system for registering international trademarks in multiple jurisdictions is the Madrid system.

In addition, protecting a trademark is just as important as the initial process of registration. Trademark rights are maintained through actual use of the trademark, and will diminish over time if a trademark is not actively used.
Companies need to consider whether they can own a name in the digital realm. Securing a domain name, particularly with the globally recognized dot-com extension, is critical for some companies. It has also become increasingly important for firms to interact with their audience through social media websites. Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram all have procedures for acquiring a name on their sites. In modern communication, the trademark is just the start of owning a name.
International considerations[edit]
Because English is widely viewed as a global language, with over 380 million native speakers, many international trademarks are created in English. Still, language differences present difficulties when using a trademark internationally.
Product naming faux pas[edit]
Many companies have stumbled across the importance of considering language differences in marketing new products.

Audi named their hybrid models e-tron, étron meaning "excrement" in French.[9]

Product naming is the discipline of deciding what a product will be called, and is very similar in concept and approach to the process of deciding on a name for a company or organization. Product naming is considered a critical part of the branding process, which includes all of the marketing activities that affect the brand image, such as positioning and the design of logo, packaging and the product itself. The process involved in product naming can take months or years to complete. Some key steps include specifying the objectives of the branding, developing the product name itself, evaluating names through target market testing and focus groups, choosing a final product name, and finally identifying it as a trademark for protection.[1]

Principles[edit]
A key ingredient in launching a successful company is the selection of its name.[2] Product names that are considered generally sound have several qualities in common.

They strategically distinguish the product from its competitors by conveying its unique positioning
They hold appeal for the product’s target audience
They imply or evoke a salient brand attribute, quality or benefit.
They are available for legal protection and "trademark".
They allow companies to bond with their customers to create loyalty.
They have a symbolic association that fortifies the image of a company or a product to the consumers.
They help motivate customers to buy the product.
They can be legally acquired and developed.

Types of names[edit]
Brand names typically fall into several different categories.[3]
Acronyms and Abbreviations[edit]
AFLAC, IBM, M&M (for Forrest Mars and Bruce Murrie).
Amalgam[edit]
Names created by taking parts of words and putting them together: Nabisco (National Biscuit Company).
Alliteration and Rhyme[edit]
Fun to say, and particularly memorable: FAT BAT, YouTube, Piggly Wiggly.
Appropriation[edit]
Use the idea for one thing and apply it to another: Caterpillar, Reebok.
Descriptive[edit]
Descriptive names ascribe to the product a characteristic: Toys R Us, General Motors.
Clever Statement[edit]
Names don't have to be just a word or two: Seven for All Mankind, I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!, The Boring Company.
Evocative[edit]
Invoke a vivid image that alludes to a brand benefit: London Fog, Amazon.
Founders' Names (Eponyms)[edit]
Use the name of a founder or founder family member: Barneys, Hewlett-Packard, and Wendy's.
Geography[edit]
Chose a name associated with company/product location: eBay for Echo Bay (a fictional place as well as the shortened form of "Echo Bay Technology Group," the name of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar's consulting company, according to the List of company name etymologies), Fuji for the tallest mountain in Japan, Cisco for San Francisco.
HomeNON[edit]
For a name with personality: Yahoo!, Cracker Jack. However, Yahoo is the pronunciation of the Chinese name of one of its founders, Jerry Yang.[citation needed]
Ingredients[edit]
Base the name on ingredients: Clorox for chlorine plus sodium hydroxide, Pepsi for the digestive enzyme pepsin.
Merged[edit]
When two companies merge into one, sometimes both names are kept: ExxonMobil, Cadbury Schweppes.
Mimetics[edit]
Use alternative spellings for common sounds: 2(x)ist, Krispy Kreme.
Nickname[edit]
Use a founder's nickname: Adidas aka Adolf Dassler, Haribo Hans Riegel Bonn, Kinkos.
Neologism[edit]
A completely new made-up word: Kodak, Verizon, Mimex.
Onomatopoeia[edit]
Use a sound associated with a product function or other brand idea: Twitter, Meow Mix.
Personification[edit]
Create a character or adopt an existing personage: Green Giant, Midas Mufflers.
Portmanteau[edit]
Name is a combination of two (or more) words or morphemes, and their definitions, into one new word: Travelocity, Pinterest.
Product naming techniques[edit]
Linguistically, names are developed by combining morphemes, phonemes and syntax to create a desired representation of a product.
Morphemes differ from words in that many morphemes may not be able to stand alone. The Sprint name is composed of a single word and a single morpheme. Conversely, a brand like Acuvue is composed of two morphemes, each with a distinct meaning. While "vue" may be able to stand as its own word, "acu" is seen as a prefix or a bound morpheme that must connect to a free morpheme like "vue."[4]
Phonemes are minimal units of sound. Depending on the speaker’s accent, the English language has about 44 phonemes.[5] In product naming, names that are phonetically easy to pronounce and that are well balanced with vowels and consonants have an advantage over those that are not. Likewise, names that begin with or stress plosive consonant sounds B, hard C, D, G, K, P or T are often used because of their attention-getting quality.[6] Some phoneme sounds in English, for example L, V, F and W are thought of as feminine, while others such as X, M and Z are viewed as masculine.[7]
Syntax, or word order, is key to consumers’ perceptions of a product name. Banana Republic would not carry the same meaning were it changed to "Republic Banana." Syntax also has significant implications for the naming of global products, because syntax has been argued to cross the barrier from one language to another.[8] (See the pioneering work on Universal Grammar by Noam Chomsky)

Owning a Name: Trademarks, URLs and beyond[edit]
A consideration companies find important in developing a product name is its "trademarkability". Product name trademarks may be established in a number of ways:

In many countries, including the United States, names can be used as trademarks without formal registration through first use or common law—simply to protect an established product’s name and reputation.
Product names can be formally registered within a state, with protection limited to that state’s borders.
In the United States, a federal trademark registration is filed with the USPTO and offered protection for as long as the mark is in use.
The preeminent system for registering international trademarks in multiple jurisdictions is the Madrid system.

In addition, protecting a trademark is just as important as the initial process of registration. Trademark rights are maintained through actual use of the trademark, and will diminish over time if a trademark is not actively used.
Companies need to consider whether they can own a name in the digital realm. Securing a domain name, particularly with the globally recognized dot-com extension, is critical for some companies. It has also become increasingly important for firms to interact with their audience through social media websites. Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram all have procedures for acquiring a name on their sites. In modern communication, the trademark is just the start of owning a name.
International considerations[edit]
Because English is widely viewed as a global language, with over 380 million native speakers, many international trademarks are created in English. Still, language differences present difficulties when using a trademark internationally.
Product naming faux pas[edit]
Many companies have stumbled across the importance of considering language differences in marketing new products.

Audi named their hybrid models e-tron, étron meaning "excrement" in French.[9]
The Mitsubishi Pajero SUV is called Montero in Spanish-speaking countries as pajero is a commonly used as a pejorative to mean "wanker".
Reebok named a women’s sneaker Incubus.[10] In medieval folklore, an incubus was a demon who ravished women in their sleep.
The Honda Fitta was, according to a popular urban legend, renamed Jazz after discovering that fitta is Norwegian and Swedish slang for the female genitals.[11]
A drink in Japan called Calpis, when pronounced, sounds like cow piss. The product is marketed in North America under the Calpico brand.[12]
Bimbo is a Mexican baking conglomerate;[13] in English the term describes a woman who is physically attractive but is perceived to have a low intelligence or poor education.

Product naming is the discipline of deciding what a product will be called, and is very similar in concept and approach to the process of deciding on a name for a company or organization. Product naming is considered a critical part of the branding process, which includes all of the marketing activities that affect the brand image, such as positioning and the design of logo, packaging and the product itself. The process involved in product naming can take months or years to complete. Some key steps include specifying the objectives of the branding, developing the product name itself, evaluating names through target market testing and focus groups, choosing a final product name, and finally identifying it as a trademark for protection.[1]

Principles[edit]
A key ingredient in launching a successful company is the selection of its name.[2] Product names that are considered generally sound have several qualities in common.

They strategically distinguish the product from its competitors by conveying its unique positioning
They hold appeal for the product’s target audience
They imply or evoke a salient brand attribute, quality or benefit.
They are available for legal protection and "trademark".
They allow companies to bond with their customers to create loyalty.
They have a symbolic association that fortifies the image of a company or a product to the consumers.
They help motivate customers to buy the product.
They can be legally acquired and developed.

Types of names[edit]
Brand names typically fall into several different categories.[3]
Acronyms and Abbreviations[edit]
AFLAC, IBM, M&M (for Forrest Mars and Bruce Murrie).
Amalgam[edit]
Names created by taking parts of words and putting them together: Nabisco (National Biscuit Company).
Alliteration and Rhyme[edit]
Fun to say, and particularly memorable: FAT BAT, YouTube, Piggly Wiggly.
Appropriation[edit]
Use the idea for one thing and apply it to another: Caterpillar, Reebok.
Descriptive[edit]
Descriptive names ascribe to the product a characteristic: Toys R Us, General Motors.
Clever Statement[edit]
Names don't have to be just a word or two: Seven for All Mankind, I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!, The Boring Company.
Evocative[edit]
Invoke a vivid image that alludes to a brand benefit: London Fog, Amazon.
Founders' Names (Eponyms)[edit]
Use the name of a founder or founder family member: Barneys, Hewlett-Packard, and Wendy's.
Geography[edit]
Chose a name associated with company/product location: eBay for Echo Bay (a fictional place as well as the shortened form of "Echo Bay Technology Group," the name of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar's consulting company, according to the List of company name etymologies), Fuji for the tallest mountain in Japan, Cisco for San Francisco.
HomeNON[edit]
For a name with personality: Yahoo!, Cracker Jack. However, Yahoo is the pronunciation of the Chinese name of one of its founders, Jerry Yang.[citation needed]
Ingredients[edit]
Base the name on ingredients: Clorox for chlorine plus sodium hydroxide, Pepsi for the digestive enzyme pepsin.
Merged[edit]
When two companies merge into one, sometimes both names are kept: ExxonMobil, Cadbury Schweppes.
Mimetics[edit]
Use alternative spellings for common sounds: 2(x)ist, Krispy Kreme.
Nickname[edit]
Use a founder's nickname: Adidas aka Adolf Dassler, Haribo Hans Riegel Bonn, Kinkos.
Neologism[edit]
A completely new made-up word: Kodak, Verizon, Mimex.
Onomatopoeia[edit]
Use a sound associated with a product function or other brand idea: Twitter, Meow Mix.
Personification[edit]
Create a character or adopt an existing personage: Green Giant, Midas Mufflers.
Portmanteau[edit]
Name is a combination of two (or more) words or morphemes, and their definitions, into one new word: Travelocity, Pinterest.
Product naming techniques[edit]
Linguistically, names are developed by combining morphemes, phonemes and syntax to create a desired representation of a product.
Morphemes differ from words in that many morphemes may not be able to stand alone. The Sprint name is composed of a single word and a single morpheme. Conversely, a brand like Acuvue is composed of two morphemes, each with a distinct meaning. While "vue" may be able to stand as its own word, "acu" is seen as a prefix or a bound morpheme that must connect to a free morpheme like "vue."[4]
Phonemes are minimal units of sound. Depending on the speaker’s accent, the English language has about 44 phonemes.[5] In product naming, names that are phonetically easy to pronounce and that are well balanced with vowels and consonants have an advantage over those that are not. Likewise, names that begin with or stress plosive consonant sounds B, hard C, D, G, K, P or T are often used because of their attention-getting quality.[6] Some phoneme sounds in English, for example L, V, F and W are thought of as feminine, while others such as X, M and Z are viewed as masculine.[7]
Syntax, or word order, is key to consumers’ perceptions of a product name. Banana Republic would not carry the same meaning were it changed to "Republic Banana." Syntax also has significant implications for the naming of global products, because syntax has been argued to cross the barrier from one language to another.[8] (See the pioneering work on Universal Grammar by Noam Chomsky)

Owning a Name: Trademarks, URLs and beyond[edit]
A consideration companies find important in developing a product name is its "trademarkability". Product name trademarks may be established in a number of ways:

In many countries, including the United States, names can be used as trademarks without formal registration through first use or common law—simply to protect an established product’s name and reputation.
Product names can be formally registered within a state, with protection limited to that state’s borders.
In the United States, a federal trademark registration is filed with the USPTO and offered protection for as long as the mark is in use.
The preeminent system for registering international trademarks in multiple jurisdictions is the Madrid system.

In addition, protecting a trademark is just as important as the initial process of registration. Trademark rights are maintained through actual use of the trademark, and will diminish over time if a trademark is not actively used.
Companies need to consider whether they can own a name in the digital realm. Securing a domain name, particularly with the globally recognized dot-com extension, is critical for some companies. It has also become increasingly important for firms to interact with their audience through social media websites. Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram all have procedures for acquiring a name on their sites. In modern communication, the trademark is just the start of owning a name.
International considerations[edit]
Because English is widely viewed as a global language, with over 380 million native speakers, many international trademarks are created in English. Still, language differences present difficulties when using a trademark internationally.
Product naming faux pas[edit]
Many companies have stumbled across the importance of considering language differences in marketing new products.

Audi named their hybrid models e-tron, étron meaning "excrement" in French.[9]
The Mitsubishi Pajero SUV is called Montero in Spanish-speaking countries as pajero is a commonly used as a pejorative to mean "wanker".
Reebok named a women’s sneaker Incubus.[10] In medieval folklore, an incubus was a demon who ravished women in their sleep.
The Honda Fitta was, according to a popular urban legend, renamed Jazz after discovering that fitta is Norwegian and Swedish slang for the female genitals.[11]
A drink in Japan called Calpis, when pronounced, sounds like cow piss. The product is marketed in North America under the Calpico brand.[12]
Bimbo is a Mexican baking conglomerate;[13] in English the term describes a woman who is physically attractive but is perceived to have a low intelligence or poor education.

Competitive Analysis – 
Our process begins with a thorough competitive analysis, in which 
we quantify the tone and strength of competitive company names or product 
names. Creating such a document helps your naming team decide where 
they need to go with the positioning, branding and naming of your company 
or product.




Positioning – 
The next step is to help you refine and define your brand positioning. 
The more specific and nuanced your positioning is, the more effective 
the name will be. All great product and company names work in concert 
with the positioning of the businesses they speak for.




Name/brand Development – 
Product or company name development begins by applying the positioning 
strategy to figure out what you want your new name to do for your marketing, 
branding and advertising efforts.




Trademark – 
We prescreen names under development through our trademark attorney to determine 
the likelihood that your company will be able to procure the names. 
We do this in order to feel confident that the names your attorney submits 
for final trademark screening and application have been deemed by an 
attorney as likely to pass muster for registration. If not, valuable 
time is lost.

Name your business in 10 seconds or less


Did you get beaten to the punch?
It happens all the time: you come up with a whole list of creative
business name ideas, then hit the web to buy the domains you want.
And they’re all taken!
Catchy company names – good ones – go quickly because they’re in
high demand worldwide. Happily, you have a lot of play room in choosing
a business name. It’s good to get creative, as long as you clearly
communicate what your company offers.
Whether you’re stuck for ideas or someone else beat you to the punch
on your perfect website name, we can help.
Stick in your customers’ minds
Humans are creatures of habit. We develop a way of thinking and
most of us stick to it. Unique business names come from all kinds
of ideas, though, and often not the first ones that roll through
our heads – because those can be the same ones rolling through
competitors’ heads, too. Easy differentiation is key when choosing
a business name.
That’s where domain and brand name generators like this one come
into play: machines might be purely logical, but they excel at
helping us think outside our human boxes.
Get unique brand name ideas (100% available)
Using a domain name generator to inspire you isn’t lazy. It’s smart.
You’ll be surprised how many good ideas your competitors haven’t
thought of yet (and that maybe didn’t occur to you, either).
To get thousands of company and domain name suggestions instantly,
simply plug your company’s core concept into the field above.
Shopify will identify all related domains that are currently available.
Give it a spin – it’s totally free.

SIMILAR


Generate highly relevant name suggestions which are closely related to the primary keywords searched for. Some of the methods used for the task are as follows

a continuous sequence in a text or speech (also known as n-grams)
With 6 million word relations database
Real World Intelligence which takes into account nearby places, languages, similar products etc. Check these examples - (california, mclaren, mac)

Sometimes you might want to limit these alternative suggestions to one of the keywords or have keywords follow some characteristics based on
length or starting and ending sequences. In these cases, you can use some special characters with your keywords :-

To make sure the your keyword is never replaced or removed in the generated company name, you can use the '*' character with keyword.
For example, : generating names for the keywords 'cool* company' will make sure that the word 'cool' is not substituted, whereas
the keyword 'company' will be replaced with other similarly related words like business, firm, enterprise, brand etc
For inspiration, you can use '?', which matches any character. For example : For dictionary words comprising of 4 letters you can use
'????' as the keyword in the input box. If you specify partial characters like 'a???', this will generate dictionary words of length four and starting with letter
'a'.

These options can be used multiple times within the same query.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

              setting up your corporation.

We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Unique Promotional Items



















About Adco Marketing ® - A Family Owned Promotional Products and Tradeshow Giveaway CompanyAdco Marketing ® has been in the promotional product and treadshow giveaway business for over 30-years and was one of the first promotional product distributors to go online!  While our competitors have attempted to lower the cost per order by hiring inexpereienced overseas sales staff or inexperienced call center personell, we have taken the approach of building long term relationships and offering unique and creative promotional products and rush promotional items at highly competitive costs.  Our sales people average over 8-years experience in the custom imprinted promotional product industry and we know our promotional items and tradeshow giveaways!
Tradeshow Gieveaways & Conference Promotional ItemsSince the begining, Adco Marketing ® has specialized in Tradeshow Giveaways.  While a promotional pen may be okay for some trade shows, we like to come up with the creative and fun.  Give us a call and let us know about your company, the type of trade show or conference you are attending and we can come up with fun and unique tradeshow giveaways.
Rush Promotional Items & Rush Promotional Products
While Adco Marketing ® serves a wide array of customers, one of our most popular offerings are our rush promotional items and rush promotional products.  Typically, these are used as last minute tradeshow giveaways and conference gifts.  We literally have thousands of rush promotional items that we can produce in as little as one working day (tote bags, padfolios, promotional pens, custom water bottles, promotional lanyards, etc.) - and typically with no rush charges!  We believe that fast and accurate production of our result in long term customers - and we want to earn and keep your business!
Custom Tote Bags, Promotional Backpacks & Custom Bags
Of our wide array of offerings, our custom tote bags, promotional tote bags and promotional backpacks have been some of our best selling items!  The promotional tote bag has recently changed drastically with the introduction of custom polypropylene grocery bags or non-woven tradeshow tote bag. This material is eco-friendly, typically contains a portion of recycled material and is recyclable!  Popular in grocery stores and retail operations, we offer a wide variety of these custom imprinted shopping totes and bags as well as mini totes, large canvas bags and more.  In addition, this material is being used in a variety of other custom bags including promotional cooler bags and drawstring backpacks.  We also carry the traditional heavyweight cotton and canvas tote bags all with you custom logo!  And if you do not see the bag you are looking for, we can make it.  Email us at sales@adcomarkting.com to discuss our custom made tote bags.
The Latest Trend in Unique Promotional Products and Trade Show Giveaways
While we take pride in our traditional promotional items, we also like to offer the latest trends.  For 2009 and 2010, we have seen a high interest in BPA free custom water bottles, aluminum bottles, custom travel mugs, and promotional or personalized hand sanitizers and of course our highly popular mobile promotional items.  Due to the economy, we have also seen an interest in budget promotional items and trade show giveaways like custom mints and mint tins, promotional sticky note pads, and custom drawstring backpacks.  We feel that as the economy improves and tradeshows and conferences revive, we will see the higher end items like conference pads, promotional padfolios and iPhone and Android promotional items!
Custom Conference Gifts
We serve as a one stop shop for all conference promotional items and conference tote bags.  Our conference note pads and promotional pens are very useful in preparing for your conference as well as our custom promotional lanyards and conference badge holders.  In addition speaker gifts, banners, volunteer gifts, conference shirts, dress shirts and more are also available.  Corporate apparel is important to give your conference a professional look.  Whether you need conference t-shirts, embroidered polo shirts or logo dress shirts, come to Adco Marketing ® for all your conference items!Custom Business Promotional Products by Adco Marketing ®
Adco Marketing ® knows custom business promotional products and promotional merchandise like nobody else.  While our online promotional product site may show some of our favorite promotional marketing items, we also carry thousands upon thousands of additional promotional corporate gifts not shown.  If you are in a certain industry, you may have an upcoming conference where trade show giveaways are needed.  We can come up with some unique promotional items and promotional merchandise custom imprinted with your logo that will not end up in a drawer and never be seen like our custom tote bags and travel mugs.  We like to provide corporate gifts that will be used again and again.  Sometimes, this is a simple everyday cheap promotional product like a sticky note pad or a logo pen.  At other times, it could be a more unique promotional item like a custom shaped stress reliever or a LED flashlight that shines your custom logo!  At Adco Marketing ®, we also provide experience.  Our sales people average over 7-years experience in the custom imprinted promotional product industry and we know our products!  To get a custom proposal of potential marketing items, trade show, or business promotional products, please call us anytime at 888-332-ADCO or email us at sales@adcomarketing.com

Naming your company properly is one of the things about starting a business that is the most misunderstood. Read on to find out how you can avoid a business naming disaster…

COMPANY NAME SUGGESTIONS






 


If you're starting a business, naming that business is probably the last thing you want to be thinking about. You are worried about cash flow, vendors, and that not-so-tiny concern of sales.
 
However...
 
Coming up with the perfect name is the SINGLE most important step to starting any business effort off on the right foot.
 
As your name gets out there and your company grows, so much of your sales and future growth come from having a truly kick-ass name. A good name (and matching domain) lets anyone who hears it know a TON about your business.
 

Your name tells people about your values
The quality of your product or service
Whether or not you are a big established company
(Hint: It's almost always better to sound more established)

 
A bad name on the other hand, tells customers that you are new, inexperienced, and it also doesn't give them any idea what your business is all about. This means you end up spending a ton more on advertising then you should have to because it takes so much work to get your name out there.
 
That’s why thousands of business owners make the choice to use Branditory's Business Naming Service to get a brand name that sells itself.
 
 
If Having a Bad Name is So Bad, Why in The Heck Are There So Many Crummy Names Out There?
 
It's because naming a company or product or service is hard, like REALLY hard…people are exposed to so much advertising each day it practically takes a miracle to stand out. Now because of the internet, there is the very important fact that search engines like Google, Yahoo and Bing can make or break a business.
 
Google, Yahoo and Bing values your URL (www.my-business-name.com) as the single most important factor in determining where you appear in their search results. If your prospects can't find you immediately online they will most likely choose your competitor and leave you and your business sitting by the phone, waiting…
 
 
So, Why Do You Need a Good Business Name?
 
You need to have a name that is catchy, tells people who you are and also fits well into a www.yourname.com so people can find you right away.
 
But how the heck do you do it?
 
Well, you can try guessing…that's what most people do.
 
They'll go into godaddy.com or some other domain registrar and guess at names based on the URL's available. Some of them get lucky... but most of them fail.
 
Thats why you see so many long domains like... reallyreallylongdomain-name.com. YUCK!
 
Is There a Way to Find Good Names That are Catchy, Good For Search Engines and Easily Marketable?
 
There absolutely is! A fast-growing company called Branditory has created some serious buzz in the online entrepreneur society. What sets them apart from the rest is that they utilize the powerful combination of experienced branding experts and proprietary technology to scour the internet for the best business names and matching domains out there.
 
They are extremely affordable considering the invaluable service and dedication they offer your business. You can get your name and domain figured out for under 100 bucks, and they'll even design you a beautiful logo for goodness sakes!
 
Big time companies pay HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of dollars for the kinds of business names Branditory has created, but all you have to pay is a tiny fraction of that. In a little less than two years they have created over 4,000 superstar company names in every niche you can possibly think of.
 
You name it, they've named it.
 
These names would cost thousands to buy from a domain auction and they wouldn't even come with a slogan (yes they even create slogans) stunning logo, or Branditory's patent pending competitor analysis report.
 
The best part is... for the unbelievably low price of $97 you get UNLIMITED REVISIONS, meaning they won't stop working with you until you are 110% happy.
 
Does it get any better than that?
 
I didn't think so, and that's why they're The #1 Trusted Business Naming Service in America »
 
To get started on your business name TODAY simply CLICK THIS LINK »
 
It only takes about 6 minutes to complete the order process and to fill out their branding questionnaire.
 
Also for a limited time only they are offering 1-Day Business Delivery ($49.99 value) yours FREE.
 
It really is a no brainer! Don't start your business off on the wrong foot.

"These guys are crazy good!"
They missed the mark on the first try but the second round of names were spot-on perfect. Branditory is quick and efficient and the whole process took about a week. I also go the logo design with them as well, very highly recommended.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
