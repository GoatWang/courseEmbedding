Since its founding, the university has welcomed all students of character and ability who value the university’s strong Christian environment and exceptional learning environment.  Required daily chapel and required Bible courses contribute to the open acknowledgment of Christian faith as an important aspect of the lives of most ACU students.  All faculty, staff, administrators and members of the Board of Trustees are Christians.

Our Students and Faculty

About 4,600 students, including 800 graduate students, come to ACU from nearly every state and 43 nations.  We have a diverse and global environment, which we believe enriches student learning. Our students are served by more than 245 full-time faculty members who focus on high-quality teaching, scholarship and service. More than 97 percent of tenure-track faculty hold terminal degrees. The student/faculty ratio is 15:1. The faculty and administrators are actively involved as leaders and presenters in many national professional associations, and ACU is an active member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities.

The university includes the colleges of Arts and Sciences, Biblical Studies, Business Administration, Education and Human Services; the Graduate School; the Graduate School of Theology; the School of Information Technology and Computing; the School of Social Work; and a School of Nursing. High-tech classrooms, computer labs in the residence halls, full wireless Internet across campus, and ACU’s innovative mobile-learning initiative guarantee our students are prepared for the fast-paced technological world of today.

The university offers generous merit scholarships to incoming students with exceptional academic records and demonstrated leadership skills, and ACU attracts some of the nation's brightest students who want to study in a Christian environment. Students have found that the small classes taught by talented, caring faculty members provide them an advantage when they search for jobs after graduation or apply to graduate schools. Because ACU's professors know their students so well and often serve as mentors, they are able to provide excellent references to medical schools, law schools, graduate programs and future employers.

Exceptional Academics

At ACU, students experience some rare opportunities to prepare for their future careers. In the physics program, undergraduate students regularly participate with faculty members at national nuclear physics laboratories and make national and international presentations. Most universities only allow graduate students to participate in this high-level work. In the journalism program, students produce a twice-weekly newspaper that has received All-American honors every year since 1975.

Communication majors regularly win national debate competitions against large, prestigious universities. English students win highly competitive writing competitions. Business majors travel to Colorado for a unique leadership institute. The College of Business Administration is accredited by the prestigious Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.

The university includes the colleges of Arts and Sciences, Biblical Studies, Business Administration, Education and Human Services, the Graduate School, the Graduate School of Theology, the School of Information Technology and Computing, the School of Social Work, and the Patty Hanks Shelton School of Nursing.  High-tech classrooms, computer labs in the residence halls, fast Internet connections, email access as an incoming student and much more guarantee our students are prepared for the fast-paced technological world of today.

Abilene Christian University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award associate, baccalaureate, master’s and doctoral degrees. Contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Ga. 30033-4097 or call 404-679-4500 for questions about the accreditation of ACU. 

Academic Resources

Margaret and Herman Brown Library is at the heart of ACU's academic program. It includes the innovative Learning Commons, the Adams Center for Teaching and Learning, the Writing Center, the Speaking Center, and the AT&T Learning Studio. The university's Learning Studio and Learning Commons provide innovative spaces for students to collaborate and acquire skills to use the latest technology. ACU's award-winning mobile-earning initiative helps ensure cutting-edge technology is an integral part of each student's education.

Brown Library holds more than 1.5 million volumes and 1 million microforms held by ACU and other members of the Abilene Library Consortium. Students also can access more than 20,000 journals.

ACU is a depository library for U.S. Government Documents. The library's Special Collections department includes rare books and Bibles, manuscripts, and archival materials. The Center for Restoration Studies, headquartered in the library, is a magnet for church history scholars.

Distinctive Academic Environment

ACU places great value on the dynamic relationship that should exist between professors and their students. U.S. News & World Report honors ACU for "an unusual commitment to undergraduate teaching" and ranks it as the No. 1 “Up and Coming” university in the West Region.

Many institutions rely extensively on graduate assistants. Not ACU. All our courses are taught by qualified faculty members. And when professors work on research projects, you can usually find undergraduates by their side, a rarity elsewhere.

How do we know this philosophy works? Because each year, some of the nation's top businesses come to our campus to interview because they know ACU students have the education and preparation needed to succeed.

Outstanding faculty. Great facilities. Good jobs and graduate school. They're all the result of ACU's uncommon commitment to teaching and learning. ACU prepares its graduates for Christian service and leadership throughout the world.

Student Life

As a residential campus, ACU is alive with activities from concerts and comedians to weeknight devotionals and poetry readings. Many students participate in intramural sports, men's and women's social clubs, Spring Break mission campaigns, and the annual Sing Song performance event.  Almost 100 campus organizations give students many venues for involvement and leadership. ACU also provides opportunities to study abroad in several different countries. The university is located in Abilene, Texas, an All-America City of 117,000 people with a variety of social, religious, athletic and cultural activities. Abilene is a safe, fun place to live – all the amenities without the hassles of a mega-city.

Health, Wellness and Recreation

The $21 million Royce and Pam Money Student Recreation and Wellness Center is a focal point on campus. Designed to encourage wellness of the whole individual - body, mind and spirit - it includes the ACU Medical and Counseling Center and is the home of a dynamic intramural program with championship and recreational leagues for students of all interests and abilities

Athletics

As a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA Division II) and the Lone Star Conference, ACU competes in football, men’s and women’s basketball, baseball, men’s golf, men’s and women’s cross country, men’s and women’s track and field, women’s volleyball, men’s and women’s tennis, women's soccer and women’s softball. During the past decade, ACU has consistently been ranked by the Learfield Director's Cup competition as having one of the best NCAA Division II athletics programs in the nation.

Successful Alumni

Graduates of ACU have become best-selling Christian authors, ministers, members of Congress, state judges, big-city mayors, researchers, Hollywood movie producers, teachers and superintendents, top Nashville musicians and music producers, distinguished university professors, business owners, nationally renowned physicians, Pulitzer Prize winners, and winners of Emmy, Telly, Dove, Grammy, Inventor of the Year and Teacher of the Year awards.  We believe our 86,000 alumni make a real difference in the world in positive ways every day.

Review: Travel Agency Service
2 years ago



We use Lynn Coleman. She is our travel agent. She arranged a trip out of the country.
There is no cost at this point, there is no out of pocket cost, I am sure she may get it from the agencies she works through. She is thorough, friendly, and competent, and knowledgeable.

Travel Agency reviews in Prairie Village

        Real People ~ Real Reviews ~ Real Results      




This was a trip of a lifetime and Provider name locked. listened to and made sure that the tour agency followed through with honoring most of my requests, including plenty of down time to explore each location I went to, meal restrictions, and hotel preferences.
There was a minor snag at the end of the tour through no fault of Provider name locked. 's, but when I brought it to his attention he made sure the situation was resolved quickly.
I will definitely use Encore Travel for future vacations!
 

            - Tisha T.          




Provider name locked. took a $599 deposit for a trip to NYC scheduled for April 2014.  He canceled the trip and never returned any of my $599 deposit.  He promised to refund the money several times during phone calls but never did. He also sent a letter stating that he would return the money but I haven't received any amount.  
 

            - Judy W.          




Zipporah
 arranged a very last minute booking, and went above and beyond doing so. Loaded the house with wine, fruit, cheese, fresh flowers, and way more than we would ever have expected. We would have saved almost a full cooler of items we brought had we known...but what a nice bonus. The house was detailed in cleanliness, and decor was perfect for a wine tasting birthday girls week-end. I believe the service is really about the owners involvement, and if it is lacking than the experience is as well. Ours was great Hood River Provider name locked. .

Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							I Don’t See My Coleman Model Number						



							If you’re lucky enough to still have the box or even the manual for your Coleman product, you’ll be able to grab the model number directly off of it. If not, it may be a little more difficult to find.

Most of the time, Coleman will stamp or etch the product’s model number directly into the paint/plastic/metal. Just scan your Coleman for these numbers. For example, on a Coleman lantern, you can find the model number etched into the paint right below the globe.

The format of their model numbers ranges from just letters to a combination of letters and numbers. So a good way to check if you’ve found the right information is to enter in any numbers you find into the search box above. If it brings up results, you’ve found the right number. 						
 





							Coleman Repair? Need Help?						

							Camping equipment is durable and Coleman camping products are extremely durable. But over the years any product will see some wear and tear, and you’ll need a repair source to keep your equipment working properly. 

Luckily for you, you’ve found all the help you’ll ever need here at eReplacementParts.com. Not only can we supply you with replacement mantles for your lantern, tanks for your stove, and lids for your coolers, we also give you all of the help you need to install them. And if you ever want a place to discuss your passions, your knowledge, or your warnings about products, our forum is one of the more comprehensive places to do it.

So don’t take our word for it, check it out for yourself and see everything eReplacementParts.com has to offer.

						What Our Loyal Customers Have To Say					

						Just a short note to say thanks for the information and parts you provide. I have been able to resurrect and maintain a wide variety of tools thanks to the schematics and amazing array of parts you can supply.					

						Chris D.					

						Maryland, USA					


					Roughin’ It				

					Some might ask, “why innovate products for camping?” The balance of technology use during camping is a debate many of families have had over the generations. Some would argue that the point of camping is to “get away from it all.” Others would say that you can experience the outdoors while being comfortable (with technolgy). No matter what side you lie on, you surely have your preference in the brands of gear you bring to the wilderness with you.

Coleman has been revolutionizing the camping industry since 1905 when the company’s founder invented a wildly popular gas lamp. They now make everything you’ll ever need for camping, including camp stoves, coolers, tents, and even portable sinks. So whether you want to live lavishly in the outdoors or “rough it” with only a sleeping bag and a tent, Coleman has the products you’ll need.
