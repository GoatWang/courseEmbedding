OUR FUNDS 




 ABRY brings significant investment capital to support the growth of the companies it invests in. We currently manage over $4.3 billion of capital in our active funds: ABRY PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS We are currently investing ABRY Partners VIII, a $1.9 billion private equity fund. Investments in portfolio companies range from $25 million to $150 million. We typically take controlling positions in portfolio companies and are an active partner with management throughout the life of an investment.    ABRY SENIOR EQUITY FUNDS We are currently investing ABRY Senior Equity IV, a $950 million fund providing senior equity capital. Our senior equity fund invests from $20 million to $90 million in companies that are either owned by others, or sponsored by ABRY's private equity fund. Investments are typically non-cash or partial-cash paying preferred securities offering highly flexible financing structures as well as certainty of execution.   ABRY SENIOR DEBT FUNDS We are currently investing ABRY Advanced Securities Fund III ("ASF III"), 
a $1.5 billion fund providing senior debt capital to media, communications, business, and information services companies. These investments are typically first and second lien bank debt securities purchased in the primary or secondary market. Often ASF III makes investments in the senior debt offerings of ABRY's portfolio companies and in all instances provides ABRY's private equity and senior equity portfolio companies with real-time financing market insight enabling better capital markets execution for these companies.
