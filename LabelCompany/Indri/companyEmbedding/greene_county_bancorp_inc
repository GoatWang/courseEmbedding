(NASDAQ:GCBC) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.0975 per share on the Company's common stock.

GCBC Ex-Dividend Reminder - 2/11/15
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 2/11/15, Greene County Bancorp Inc will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.18, payable on 2/27/15. As a percentage of GCBC's recent stock price of $29.50, this dividend works out to approximately 0.61%, so look for shares of Greene County Bancorp Inc to trade 0.61% lower — all else being equal — when GCBC shares open for trading on 2/11/15.

HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING:

                End-users of the NetDania software that make use of the trading integration features as direct clients of integrated brokers, should be aware of the level of risk carried by trading in financial markets. Trading foreign exchange and or other financial instruments on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.
