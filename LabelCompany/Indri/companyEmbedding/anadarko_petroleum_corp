History[edit]
Anadarko was formed in 1959 as a subsidiary of Panhandle Eastern Corporation Pipe Line Company after the discovery of large amounts of natural gas in the Anadarko Basin, which underlies the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma Panhandle, and southwest Kansas.
In 1986, Panhandle Eastern Corporation distributed its interests in Anadarko to its shareholders via a corporate spin-off in 1986.[5]
In 1999, the company announced that it would purchase a 7.5-acre (30,000 m2) tract in The Woodlands, Montgomery County, Texas from the Woodlands Land Company and build an 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m2), 32-story headquarters building, on the site.[6] In 2012, the company announced that it would construct another office tower adjacent to its headquarters.[7] The company announced that it will name its two office towers after former CEOs.[8]
In 2003, the company announced that Robert J. Allison, Jr. was resigning as chief executive officer and would be replaced by James T. Hackett, previously the chief operating officer of Devon Energy.[9] In 2012, the company announced a major natural gas find offshore Mozambique.[10]
Acquisitions and sales[edit]

In 2000, the company acquired Union Pacific Resources in a $4.4 billion transaction.[11][12]


In 2001, the company acquired Berkeley Petroleum Corporation for C$1.2 billion plus the assumption of C$400 million in debt.[13]


In 2006, the company completed the acquisition of Kerr-McGee for $16 billion in cash.[14][15]


In 2006, the company purchased Western Gas Resources in a $5.3 billion cash transaction.[16]


In 2007, the company sold assets in Oklahoma and Texas for $860 million.[17]


In 2015, the company made an offer to acquire Apache Corporation, but the offer was rejected.[18]


In 2016, the company sold its interest in the Springfield oil and gas gathering system, near the Eagle Ford shale, for $750 million to Western Gas Partners.[19] In March 2016, the company announced layoffs affecting 1,000 employees, or 17% of its staff. The layoffs were the result of weak commodity prices.[20]

Environmental record[edit]
Deepwater Horizon Oil spill involvement[edit]
Main article: Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion
Anadarko owned a 25% non-operating minority interest in the Macondo Prospect, which was owned 65% by and operated by BP and was affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[21]
Settlement with BP[edit]
In early 2010, BP billed Anadarko more than $272 million as a partial payment for its share of cleanup and response costs in the Gulf, according to a bill that was sent by BP and obtained by Talking Points Memo. Anadarko publicly suggested that it will not pay for costs associated with the oil disaster, claiming in a statement that BP was guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Under the joint operating agreement, Anadarko was required to pay its 25% share of costs related to any incident—unless that incident was caused by its partner's gross negligence or willful misconduct.[22]
In May 2011, MOEX Offshore, a subsidiary of Mitsui and owner of a 10% non-operating ownership interest in the Macondo Prospect, settled claims with BP for $1.07 billion.[23]
In October 2011, Anadarko settled all claims with BP for $4 billion. Anadarko also transferred its 25% stake in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (Macondo Prospect) to BP and was indemnified by BP for all costs related to the oil spill, including those arising under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.[24][25]
Fine under the Clean Water Act[edit]
In December 2015, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier ordered Anadarko to pay a civil fine under the Clean Water Act of $159.5 million, or $50 per barrel of oil spilled as a result of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion.[21] The judge stated Anadarko was not at fault for the spill, but the company's 25% ownership stake made it responsible. Barbier wrote that the $159.5 million fine "strikes the appropriate balance between Anadarko's lack of culpability and the extreme seriousness of this spill."[21] The fine came after BP and Anadarko had unsuccessfully appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to reject Judge Carl Barbier's finding of negligence in the Deepwater Horizon accident.[26]
Tronox litigation and settlements[edit]
In April 2014, Anadarko settled with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency to pay $5.15 billion to clean up environmental waste sites around the country. It was the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history.[27]
The environmental contamination sites were inherited by Anadarko after it purchased Kerr-McGee in 2005. As background, Kerr-McGee had spun off its Tronox subsidiary to offload 70 years of environmental dumping of toxic waste across 22 states beginning in the 1920s. The environmental damages included polluting Lake Mead in Nevada with rocket fuel, leaving behind radioactive waste piles throughout the territory of the Navajo Nation and dumping carcinogenic creosote in communities throughout the East, Midwest and South at its wood-treating facilities.[4] According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets."[4] Anadarko then purchased the "clean" portion of Kerr-McGee free of its legacy of environmental dumping.
Lawsuit from Tronox shareholders[edit]
In 2009, shareholders of Tronox sued Anadarko, as successor to Kerr-McGee, for having misled investors about the large environmental and other debts Tronox would inherit from Kerr-McGee.[28][29]
Lawsuit from the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Justice[edit]
The U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, sued Anadarko for $25 billion.[30]
In April 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, reached a $5.15 billion settlement with Anadarko in the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history.[27][4]

Allison Tower, the headquarters of Anadarko Petroleum Company.


Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum and natural gas exploration and production company headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas.[2] The company is headquartered in two skyscrapers in The Woodlands, Texas: the Allison Tower and the Hackett Tower, both named after former CEOs of the company. The buildings were completed in 2014.[3]
The company has been the subject of multiple environmental cases, including the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history - the 2014 settlement related to the former Tronox subsidiary of Kerr McGee, a company purchased by Anadarko in 2006.[4][4]

History[edit]
Anadarko was formed in 1959 as a subsidiary of Panhandle Eastern Corporation Pipe Line Company after the discovery of large amounts of natural gas in the Anadarko Basin, which underlies the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma Panhandle, and southwest Kansas.
In 1986, Panhandle Eastern Corporation distributed its interests in Anadarko to its shareholders via a corporate spin-off in 1986.[5]
In 1999, the company announced that it would purchase a 7.5-acre (30,000 m2) tract in The Woodlands, Montgomery County, Texas from the Woodlands Land Company and build an 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m2), 32-story headquarters building, on the site.[6] In 2012, the company announced that it would construct another office tower adjacent to its headquarters.[7] The company announced that it will name its two office towers after former CEOs.[8]
In 2003, the company announced that Robert J. Allison, Jr. was resigning as chief executive officer and would be replaced by James T. Hackett, previously the chief operating officer of Devon Energy.[9] In 2012, the company announced a major natural gas find offshore Mozambique.[10]
Acquisitions and sales[edit]

In 2000, the company acquired Union Pacific Resources in a $4.4 billion transaction.[11][12]


In 2001, the company acquired Berkeley Petroleum Corporation for C$1.2 billion plus the assumption of C$400 million in debt.[13]


In 2006, the company completed the acquisition of Kerr-McGee for $16 billion in cash.[14][15]


In 2006, the company purchased Western Gas Resources in a $5.3 billion cash transaction.[16]


In 2007, the company sold assets in Oklahoma and Texas for $860 million.[17]


In 2015, the company made an offer to acquire Apache Corporation, but the offer was rejected.[18]


In 2016, the company sold its interest in the Springfield oil and gas gathering system, near the Eagle Ford shale, for $750 million to Western Gas Partners.[19] In March 2016, the company announced layoffs affecting 1,000 employees, or 17% of its staff. The layoffs were the result of weak commodity prices.[20]

Environmental record[edit]
Deepwater Horizon Oil spill involvement[edit]
Main article: Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion
Anadarko owned a 25% non-operating minority interest in the Macondo Prospect, which was owned 65% by and operated by BP and was affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[21]
Settlement with BP[edit]
In early 2010, BP billed Anadarko more than $272 million as a partial payment for its share of cleanup and response costs in the Gulf, according to a bill that was sent by BP and obtained by Talking Points Memo. Anadarko publicly suggested that it will not pay for costs associated with the oil disaster, claiming in a statement that BP was guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Under the joint operating agreement, Anadarko was required to pay its 25% share of costs related to any incident—unless that incident was caused by its partner's gross negligence or willful misconduct.[22]
In May 2011, MOEX Offshore, a subsidiary of Mitsui and owner of a 10% non-operating ownership interest in the Macondo Prospect, settled claims with BP for $1.07 billion.[23]
In October 2011, Anadarko settled all claims with BP for $4 billion. Anadarko also transferred its 25% stake in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (Macondo Prospect) to BP and was indemnified by BP for all costs related to the oil spill, including those arising under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.[24][25]
Fine under the Clean Water Act[edit]
In December 2015, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier ordered Anadarko to pay a civil fine under the Clean Water Act of $159.5 million, or $50 per barrel of oil spilled as a result of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion.[21] The judge stated Anadarko was not at fault for the spill, but the company's 25% ownership stake made it responsible. Barbier wrote that the $159.5 million fine "strikes the appropriate balance between Anadarko's lack of culpability and the extreme seriousness of this spill."[21] The fine came after BP and Anadarko had unsuccessfully appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to reject Judge Carl Barbier's finding of negligence in the Deepwater Horizon accident.[26]
Tronox litigation and settlements[edit]
In April 2014, Anadarko settled with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency to pay $5.15 billion to clean up environmental waste sites around the country. It was the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history.[27]
The environmental contamination sites were inherited by Anadarko after it purchased Kerr-McGee in 2005. As background, Kerr-McGee had spun off its Tronox subsidiary to offload 70 years of environmental dumping of toxic waste across 22 states beginning in the 1920s. The environmental damages included polluting Lake Mead in Nevada with rocket fuel, leaving behind radioactive waste piles throughout the territory of the Navajo Nation and dumping carcinogenic creosote in communities throughout the East, Midwest and South at its wood-treating facilities.[4] According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets."[4] Anadarko then purchased the "clean" portion of Kerr-McGee free of its legacy of environmental dumping.
Lawsuit from Tronox shareholders[edit]
In 2009, shareholders of Tronox sued Anadarko, as successor to Kerr-McGee, for having misled investors about the large environmental and other debts Tronox would inherit from Kerr-McGee.[28][29]
Lawsuit from the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Justice[edit]
The U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, sued Anadarko for $25 billion.[30]
In April 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, reached a $5.15 billion settlement with Anadarko in the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history.[27][4]

Allison Tower, the headquarters of Anadarko Petroleum Company.


Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum and natural gas exploration and production company headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas.[2] The company is headquartered in two skyscrapers in The Woodlands, Texas: the Allison Tower and the Hackett Tower, both named after former CEOs of the company. The buildings were completed in 2014.[3]
The company has been the subject of multiple environmental cases, including the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history - the 2014 settlement related to the former Tronox subsidiary of Kerr McGee, a company purchased by Anadarko in 2006.[4][4]

History[edit]
Anadarko was formed in 1959 as a subsidiary of Panhandle Eastern Corporation Pipe Line Company after the discovery of large amounts of natural gas in the Anadarko Basin, which underlies the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma Panhandle, and southwest Kansas.
In 1986, Panhandle Eastern Corporation distributed its interests in Anadarko to its shareholders via a corporate spin-off in 1986.[5]
In 1999, the company announced that it would purchase a 7.5-acre (30,000 m2) tract in The Woodlands, Montgomery County, Texas from the Woodlands Land Company and build an 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m2), 32-story headquarters building, on the site.[6] In 2012, the company announced that it would construct another office tower adjacent to its headquarters.[7] The company announced that it will name its two office towers after former CEOs.[8]
In 2003, the company announced that Robert J. Allison, Jr. was resigning as chief executive officer and would be replaced by James T. Hackett, previously the chief operating officer of Devon Energy.[9] In 2012, the company announced a major natural gas find offshore Mozambique.[10]
Acquisitions and sales[edit]

In 2000, the company acquired Union Pacific Resources in a $4.4 billion transaction.[11][12]


In 2001, the company acquired Berkeley Petroleum Corporation for C$1.2 billion plus the assumption of C$400 million in debt.[13]


In 2006, the company completed the acquisition of Kerr-McGee for $16 billion in cash.[14][15]


In 2006, the company purchased Western Gas Resources in a $5.3 billion cash transaction.[16]


In 2007, the company sold assets in Oklahoma and Texas for $860 million.[17]


In 2015, the company made an offer to acquire Apache Corporation, but the offer was rejected.[18]


In 2016, the company sold its interest in the Springfield oil and gas gathering system, near the Eagle Ford shale, for $750 million to Western Gas Partners.[19] In March 2016, the company announced layoffs affecting 1,000 employees, or 17% of its staff. The layoffs were the result of weak commodity prices.[20]

Environmental record[edit]
Deepwater Horizon Oil spill involvement[edit]
Main article: Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion
Anadarko owned a 25% non-operating minority interest in the Macondo Prospect, which was owned 65% by and operated by BP and was affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[21]
Settlement with BP[edit]
In early 2010, BP billed Anadarko more than $272 million as a partial payment for its share of cleanup and response costs in the Gulf, according to a bill that was sent by BP and obtained by Talking Points Memo. Anadarko publicly suggested that it will not pay for costs associated with the oil disaster, claiming in a statement that BP was guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Under the joint operating agreement, Anadarko was required to pay its 25% share of costs related to any incident—unless that incident was caused by its partner's gross negligence or willful misconduct.[22]
In May 2011, MOEX Offshore, a subsidiary of Mitsui and owner of a 10% non-operating ownership interest in the Macondo Prospect, settled claims with BP for $1.07 billion.[23]
In October 2011, Anadarko settled all claims with BP for $4 billion. Anadarko also transferred its 25% stake in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (Macondo Prospect) to BP and was indemnified by BP for all costs related to the oil spill, including those arising under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.[24][25]
Fine under the Clean Water Act[edit]
In December 2015, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier ordered Anadarko to pay a civil fine under the Clean Water Act of $159.5 million, or $50 per barrel of oil spilled as a result of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion.[21] The judge stated Anadarko was not at fault for the spill, but the company's 25% ownership stake made it responsible. Barbier wrote that the $159.5 million fine "strikes the appropriate balance between Anadarko's lack of culpability and the extreme seriousness of this spill."[21] The fine came after BP and Anadarko had unsuccessfully appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to reject Judge Carl Barbier's finding of negligence in the Deepwater Horizon accident.[26]
Tronox litigation and settlements[edit]
In April 2014, Anadarko settled with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency to pay $5.15 billion to clean up environmental waste sites around the country. It was the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history.[27]
The environmental contamination sites were inherited by Anadarko after it purchased Kerr-McGee in 2005. As background, Kerr-McGee had spun off its Tronox subsidiary to offload 70 years of environmental dumping of toxic waste across 22 states beginning in the 1920s. The environmental damages included polluting Lake Mead in Nevada with rocket fuel, leaving behind radioactive waste piles throughout the territory of the Navajo Nation and dumping carcinogenic creosote in communities throughout the East, Midwest and South at its wood-treating facilities.[4] According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets."[4] Anadarko then purchased the "clean" portion of Kerr-McGee free of its legacy of environmental dumping.
Lawsuit from Tronox shareholders[edit]
In 2009, shareholders of Tronox sued Anadarko, as successor to Kerr-McGee, for having misled investors about the large environmental and other debts Tronox would inherit from Kerr-McGee.[28][29]
Lawsuit from the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Justice[edit]
The U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, sued Anadarko for $25 billion.[30]
In April 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, reached a $5.15 billion settlement with Anadarko in the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history.[27][4]

Allison Tower, the headquarters of Anadarko Petroleum Company.


Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum and natural gas exploration and production company headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas.[2] The company is headquartered in two skyscrapers in The Woodlands, Texas: the Allison Tower and the Hackett Tower, both named after former CEOs of the company. The buildings were completed in 2014.[3]
The company has been the subject of multiple environmental cases, including the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history - the 2014 settlement related to the former Tronox subsidiary of Kerr McGee, a company purchased by Anadarko in 2006.[4][4]

History[edit]
Anadarko was formed in 1959 as a subsidiary of Panhandle Eastern Corporation Pipe Line Company after the discovery of large amounts of natural gas in the Anadarko Basin, which underlies the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma Panhandle, and southwest Kansas.
In 1986, Panhandle Eastern Corporation distributed its interests in Anadarko to its shareholders via a corporate spin-off in 1986.[5]
In 1999, the company announced that it would purchase a 7.5-acre (30,000 m2) tract in The Woodlands, Montgomery County, Texas from the Woodlands Land Company and build an 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m2), 32-story headquarters building, on the site.[6] In 2012, the company announced that it would construct another office tower adjacent to its headquarters.[7] The company announced that it will name its two office towers after former CEOs.[8]
In 2003, the company announced that Robert J. Allison, Jr. was resigning as chief executive officer and would be replaced by James T. Hackett, previously the chief operating officer of Devon Energy.[9] In 2012, the company announced a major natural gas find offshore Mozambique.[10]
Acquisitions and sales[edit]

In 2000, the company acquired Union Pacific Resources in a $4.4 billion transaction.[11][12]


In 2001, the company acquired Berkeley Petroleum Corporation for C$1.2 billion plus the assumption of C$400 million in debt.[13]


In 2006, the company completed the acquisition of Kerr-McGee for $16 billion in cash.[14][15]


In 2006, the company purchased Western Gas Resources in a $5.3 billion cash transaction.[16]


In 2007, the company sold assets in Oklahoma and Texas for $860 million.[17]


In 2015, the company made an offer to acquire Apache Corporation, but the offer was rejected.[18]


In 2016, the company sold its interest in the Springfield oil and gas gathering system, near the Eagle Ford shale, for $750 million to Western Gas Partners.[19] In March 2016, the company announced layoffs affecting 1,000 employees, or 17% of its staff. The layoffs were the result of weak commodity prices.[20]

Environmental record[edit]
Deepwater Horizon Oil spill involvement[edit]
Main article: Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion
Anadarko owned a 25% non-operating minority interest in the Macondo Prospect, which was owned 65% by and operated by BP and was affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[21]
Settlement with BP[edit]
In early 2010, BP billed Anadarko more than $272 million as a partial payment for its share of cleanup and response costs in the Gulf, according to a bill that was sent by BP and obtained by Talking Points Memo. Anadarko publicly suggested that it will not pay for costs associated with the oil disaster, claiming in a statement that BP was guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Under the joint operating agreement, Anadarko was required to pay its 25% share of costs related to any incident—unless that incident was caused by its partner's gross negligence or willful misconduct.[22]
In May 2011, MOEX Offshore, a subsidiary of Mitsui and owner of a 10% non-operating ownership interest in the Macondo Prospect, settled claims with BP for $1.07 billion.[23]
In October 2011, Anadarko settled all claims with BP for $4 billion. Anadarko also transferred its 25% stake in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (Macondo Prospect) to BP and was indemnified by BP for all costs related to the oil spill, including those arising under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.[24][25]
Fine under the Clean Water Act[edit]
In December 2015, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier ordered Anadarko to pay a civil fine under the Clean Water Act of $159.5 million, or $50 per barrel of oil spilled as a result of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion.[21] The judge stated Anadarko was not at fault for the spill, but the company's 25% ownership stake made it responsible. Barbier wrote that the $159.5 million fine "strikes the appropriate balance between Anadarko's lack of culpability and the extreme seriousness of this spill."[21] The fine came after BP and Anadarko had unsuccessfully appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to reject Judge Carl Barbier's finding of negligence in the Deepwater Horizon accident.[26]
Tronox litigation and settlements[edit]
In April 2014, Anadarko settled with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency to pay $5.15 billion to clean up environmental waste sites around the country. It was the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history.[27]
The environmental contamination sites were inherited by Anadarko after it purchased Kerr-McGee in 2005. As background, Kerr-McGee had spun off its Tronox subsidiary to offload 70 years of environmental dumping of toxic waste across 22 states beginning in the 1920s. The environmental damages included polluting Lake Mead in Nevada with rocket fuel, leaving behind radioactive waste piles throughout the territory of the Navajo Nation and dumping carcinogenic creosote in communities throughout the East, Midwest and South at its wood-treating facilities.[4] According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets."[4] Anadarko then purchased the "clean" portion of Kerr-McGee free of its legacy of environmental dumping.
Lawsuit from Tronox shareholders[edit]
In 2009, shareholders of Tronox sued Anadarko, as successor to Kerr-McGee, for having misled investors about the large environmental and other debts Tronox would inherit from Kerr-McGee.[28][29]
Lawsuit from the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Justice[edit]
The U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, sued Anadarko for $25 billion.[30]
In April 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, reached a $5.15 billion settlement with Anadarko in the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history.[27][4]

Anadarko boosts Wattenberg production








10/16/2014









































Anadarko Petroleum Corp. stepped up production in Wattenberg field in Colorado during the second quarter. The rise was attributed to the success of its horizontal drilling program and the start-up of a gas processing plant.
"The growth in the Wattenberg field has been nothing short of exceptional," Al Walker, chief executive officer of Anadarko, said during a presentation of second-quarter results.
Net sales volumes from both horizontal and vertical wells in Wattenberg field increased 59% from the year-earlier period to 169,000 boe/d, comprising 76,000 b/d of oil, 36,000 b/d of NGL, and 339 MMcfd of gas (see p. 4 figure). Higher-margin liquids volumes were enabled, in part, by the start of the Lancaster gas processing plant and lower line pressures in the field.
Field-wide recovery of NGL increased as production was diverted from less-efficient refrigeration plants to the Lancaster plant for cryogenic processing. Lancaster was processing 290 MMcfd in July and recovering 42,000 b/d of NGL.
System pressures were kept low by the addition of 140 MMcfd of field compression during the first half of the year. The company plans to add a further 80 MMcfd of compression capacity before the end of the year to maintain system pressures and keep pace with expected production increases.
Also credited for the production growth was Anadarko's horizontal drilling program, which utilized 14 rigs and drilled 103 operated wells in the field. The program produced 121,000 boe/d during the second quarter, a 134% improvement from the year-earlier period.
Anadarko also continued to improve the efficiency of its operations. The amount of time needed to drill and complete a short-lateral well has fallen by 6 days since the first quarter of 2012 to 8.7 days.
Wattenberg is one of the most prolific oil fields in Colorado. The legacy field was discovered in 1970. Production has been boosted in recent years by the utilization of new drilling and completion techniques to unlock previously underexploited zones, notably the Cretaceous Niobrara shale and Codell sandstone.
Anadarko is the largest producer in Wattenberg field, which generates the strongest rates of return in the company's US onshore portfolio. The company allocated $579 million to Wattenberg during the second quarter, and it accounted for 24% of company-wide spending.

                                        Ushering in the age of the digital enterprise              
				








The impetus for becoming a digital enterprise is not about who has the coolest technology - but who can best achieve advantage without disruption. The case for adopting innovation is often made as companies plateau in mastering perennial challenges such as efficiency and time to market. Discrete and process industries at all levels of maturity, and companies of all sizes are forging a path to digitalization using Siemens ingenuity:

 Integrating islands of data to gain systemic visibility and enhance production control.
 Enhancing design and engineering through software that enables virtual design and rapid prototyping.
 Performing remote diagnostics and running simulations to predict and plan for maintenance.

The future of manufacturing is digital. Are you ready?

					  America's express pass to mobility
				





City light rail and metros together with inter-city passenger rail is giving a boost to regional economies, making it easier for people to move around, expand access to opportunity and improve quality of life. Rail and road solutions are also helping to reduce traffic congestion on roads and highways.












					
                    Siemens is working with cities and people to help move America forward
				








To modernize and revitalize cities, we make transportation more efficient, intelligent, and safe - while lowering environmental impact and creating a better traveler experience. We deliver cloud-based traffic management systems, locomotives, light rail and metros, rail signaling and electrification solutions. One in every 3 light rail cars operating in the U.S. was built by Siemens. Along with our rail electrification and rail signaling systems in the U.S., we bring advanced technologies that improve operator performance and passenger quality of life. For example:
 

 Communications-Based Train Control systems for New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority
 Light rail vehicles for the Twin Cities that reduce gas emissions by more than 70% vs. cars
 Traffic management systems that shorten commute times by 20% along routes in San Antonio, Texas

 
We live and work in the communities where we create Ingenuity for life, with 2,000 employees across North America and full-scale transportation manufacturing facilities in five U.S. locations.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Allison Tower, the headquarters of Anadarko Petroleum Company.


Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum and natural gas exploration and production company headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas.[2] The company is headquartered in two skyscrapers in The Woodlands, Texas: the Allison Tower and the Hackett Tower, both named after former CEOs of the company. The buildings were completed in 2014.[3]
The company has been the subject of multiple environmental cases, including the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history - the 2014 settlement related to the former Tronox subsidiary of Kerr McGee, a company purchased by Anadarko in 2006.[4][4]

History[edit]
Anadarko was formed in 1959 as a subsidiary of Panhandle Eastern Corporation Pipe Line Company after the discovery of large amounts of natural gas in the Anadarko Basin, which underlies the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma Panhandle, and southwest Kansas.
In 1986, Panhandle Eastern Corporation distributed its interests in Anadarko to its shareholders via a corporate spin-off in 1986.[5]
In 1999, the company announced that it would purchase a 7.5-acre (30,000 m2) tract in The Woodlands, Montgomery County, Texas from the Woodlands Land Company and build an 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m2), 32-story headquarters building, on the site.[6] In 2012, the company announced that it would construct another office tower adjacent to its headquarters.[7] The company announced that it will name its two office towers after former CEOs.[8]
In 2003, the company announced that Robert J. Allison, Jr. was resigning as chief executive officer and would be replaced by James T. Hackett, previously the chief operating officer of Devon Energy.[9] In 2012, the company announced a major natural gas find offshore Mozambique.[10]
Acquisitions and sales[edit]

In 2000, the company acquired Union Pacific Resources in a $4.4 billion transaction.[11][12]


In 2001, the company acquired Berkeley Petroleum Corporation for C$1.2 billion plus the assumption of C$400 million in debt.[13]


In 2006, the company completed the acquisition of Kerr-McGee for $16 billion in cash.[14][15]


In 2006, the company purchased Western Gas Resources in a $5.3 billion cash transaction.[16]


In 2007, the company sold assets in Oklahoma and Texas for $860 million.[17]


In 2015, the company made an offer to acquire Apache Corporation, but the offer was rejected.[18]


In 2016, the company sold its interest in the Springfield oil and gas gathering system, near the Eagle Ford shale, for $750 million to Western Gas Partners.[19] In March 2016, the company announced layoffs affecting 1,000 employees, or 17% of its staff. The layoffs were the result of weak commodity prices.[20]

Environmental record[edit]
Deepwater Horizon Oil spill involvement[edit]
Main article: Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion
Anadarko owned a 25% non-operating minority interest in the Macondo Prospect, which was owned 65% by and operated by BP and was affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[21]
Settlement with BP[edit]
In early 2010, BP billed Anadarko more than $272 million as a partial payment for its share of cleanup and response costs in the Gulf, according to a bill that was sent by BP and obtained by Talking Points Memo. Anadarko publicly suggested that it will not pay for costs associated with the oil disaster, claiming in a statement that BP was guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Under the joint operating agreement, Anadarko was required to pay its 25% share of costs related to any incident—unless that incident was caused by its partner's gross negligence or willful misconduct.[22]
In May 2011, MOEX Offshore, a subsidiary of Mitsui and owner of a 10% non-operating ownership interest in the Macondo Prospect, settled claims with BP for $1.07 billion.[23]
In October 2011, Anadarko settled all claims with BP for $4 billion. Anadarko also transferred its 25% stake in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (Macondo Prospect) to BP and was indemnified by BP for all costs related to the oil spill, including those arising under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.[24][25]
Fine under the Clean Water Act[edit]
In December 2015, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier ordered Anadarko to pay a civil fine under the Clean Water Act of $159.5 million, or $50 per barrel of oil spilled as a result of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion.[21] The judge stated Anadarko was not at fault for the spill, but the company's 25% ownership stake made it responsible. Barbier wrote that the $159.5 million fine "strikes the appropriate balance between Anadarko's lack of culpability and the extreme seriousness of this spill."[21] The fine came after BP and Anadarko had unsuccessfully appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to reject Judge Carl Barbier's finding of negligence in the Deepwater Horizon accident.[26]
Tronox litigation and settlements[edit]
In April 2014, Anadarko settled with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency to pay $5.15 billion to clean up environmental waste sites around the country. It was the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history.[27]
The environmental contamination sites were inherited by Anadarko after it purchased Kerr-McGee in 2005. As background, Kerr-McGee had spun off its Tronox subsidiary to offload 70 years of environmental dumping of toxic waste across 22 states beginning in the 1920s. The environmental damages included polluting Lake Mead in Nevada with rocket fuel, leaving behind radioactive waste piles throughout the territory of the Navajo Nation and dumping carcinogenic creosote in communities throughout the East, Midwest and South at its wood-treating facilities.[4] According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets."[4] Anadarko then purchased the "clean" portion of Kerr-McGee free of its legacy of environmental dumping.
Lawsuit from Tronox shareholders[edit]
In 2009, shareholders of Tronox sued Anadarko, as successor to Kerr-McGee, for having misled investors about the large environmental and other debts Tronox would inherit from Kerr-McGee.[28][29]
Lawsuit from the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Justice[edit]
The U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, sued Anadarko for $25 billion.[30]
In April 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, reached a $5.15 billion settlement with Anadarko in the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history.[27][4]

Allison Tower, the headquarters of Anadarko Petroleum Company.


Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum and natural gas exploration and production company headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas.[2] The company is headquartered in two skyscrapers in The Woodlands, Texas: the Allison Tower and the Hackett Tower, both named after former CEOs of the company. The buildings were completed in 2014.[3]
The company has been the subject of multiple environmental cases, including the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history - the 2014 settlement related to the former Tronox subsidiary of Kerr McGee, a company purchased by Anadarko in 2006.[4][4]

History[edit]
Anadarko was formed in 1959 as a subsidiary of Panhandle Eastern Corporation Pipe Line Company after the discovery of large amounts of natural gas in the Anadarko Basin, which underlies the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma Panhandle, and southwest Kansas.
In 1986, Panhandle Eastern Corporation distributed its interests in Anadarko to its shareholders via a corporate spin-off in 1986.[5]
In 1999, the company announced that it would purchase a 7.5-acre (30,000 m2) tract in The Woodlands, Montgomery County, Texas from the Woodlands Land Company and build an 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m2), 32-story headquarters building, on the site.[6] In 2012, the company announced that it would construct another office tower adjacent to its headquarters.[7] The company announced that it will name its two office towers after former CEOs.[8]
In 2003, the company announced that Robert J. Allison, Jr. was resigning as chief executive officer and would be replaced by James T. Hackett, previously the chief operating officer of Devon Energy.[9] In 2012, the company announced a major natural gas find offshore Mozambique.[10]
Acquisitions and sales[edit]

In 2000, the company acquired Union Pacific Resources in a $4.4 billion transaction.[11][12]


In 2001, the company acquired Berkeley Petroleum Corporation for C$1.2 billion plus the assumption of C$400 million in debt.[13]


In 2006, the company completed the acquisition of Kerr-McGee for $16 billion in cash.[14][15]


In 2006, the company purchased Western Gas Resources in a $5.3 billion cash transaction.[16]


In 2007, the company sold assets in Oklahoma and Texas for $860 million.[17]


In 2015, the company made an offer to acquire Apache Corporation, but the offer was rejected.[18]


In 2016, the company sold its interest in the Springfield oil and gas gathering system, near the Eagle Ford shale, for $750 million to Western Gas Partners.[19] In March 2016, the company announced layoffs affecting 1,000 employees, or 17% of its staff. The layoffs were the result of weak commodity prices.[20]

Environmental record[edit]
Deepwater Horizon Oil spill involvement[edit]
Main article: Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion
Anadarko owned a 25% non-operating minority interest in the Macondo Prospect, which was owned 65% by and operated by BP and was affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[21]
Settlement with BP[edit]
In early 2010, BP billed Anadarko more than $272 million as a partial payment for its share of cleanup and response costs in the Gulf, according to a bill that was sent by BP and obtained by Talking Points Memo. Anadarko publicly suggested that it will not pay for costs associated with the oil disaster, claiming in a statement that BP was guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Under the joint operating agreement, Anadarko was required to pay its 25% share of costs related to any incident—unless that incident was caused by its partner's gross negligence or willful misconduct.[22]
In May 2011, MOEX Offshore, a subsidiary of Mitsui and owner of a 10% non-operating ownership interest in the Macondo Prospect, settled claims with BP for $1.07 billion.[23]
In October 2011, Anadarko settled all claims with BP for $4 billion. Anadarko also transferred its 25% stake in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (Macondo Prospect) to BP and was indemnified by BP for all costs related to the oil spill, including those arising under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.[24][25]
Fine under the Clean Water Act[edit]
In December 2015, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier ordered Anadarko to pay a civil fine under the Clean Water Act of $159.5 million, or $50 per barrel of oil spilled as a result of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion.[21] The judge stated Anadarko was not at fault for the spill, but the company's 25% ownership stake made it responsible. Barbier wrote that the $159.5 million fine "strikes the appropriate balance between Anadarko's lack of culpability and the extreme seriousness of this spill."[21] The fine came after BP and Anadarko had unsuccessfully appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to reject Judge Carl Barbier's finding of negligence in the Deepwater Horizon accident.[26]
Tronox litigation and settlements[edit]
In April 2014, Anadarko settled with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency to pay $5.15 billion to clean up environmental waste sites around the country. It was the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history.[27]
The environmental contamination sites were inherited by Anadarko after it purchased Kerr-McGee in 2005. As background, Kerr-McGee had spun off its Tronox subsidiary to offload 70 years of environmental dumping of toxic waste across 22 states beginning in the 1920s. The environmental damages included polluting Lake Mead in Nevada with rocket fuel, leaving behind radioactive waste piles throughout the territory of the Navajo Nation and dumping carcinogenic creosote in communities throughout the East, Midwest and South at its wood-treating facilities.[4] According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets."[4] Anadarko then purchased the "clean" portion of Kerr-McGee free of its legacy of environmental dumping.
Lawsuit from Tronox shareholders[edit]
In 2009, shareholders of Tronox sued Anadarko, as successor to Kerr-McGee, for having misled investors about the large environmental and other debts Tronox would inherit from Kerr-McGee.[28][29]
Lawsuit from the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Justice[edit]
The U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, sued Anadarko for $25 billion.[30]
In April 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, reached a $5.15 billion settlement with Anadarko in the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history.[27][4]

Allison Tower, the headquarters of Anadarko Petroleum Company.


Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum and natural gas exploration and production company headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas.[2] The company is headquartered in two skyscrapers in The Woodlands, Texas: the Allison Tower and the Hackett Tower, both named after former CEOs of the company. The buildings were completed in 2014.[3]
The company has been the subject of multiple environmental cases, including the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history - the 2014 settlement related to the former Tronox subsidiary of Kerr McGee, a company purchased by Anadarko in 2006.[4][4]

History[edit]
Anadarko was formed in 1959 as a subsidiary of Panhandle Eastern Corporation Pipe Line Company after the discovery of large amounts of natural gas in the Anadarko Basin, which underlies the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma Panhandle, and southwest Kansas.
In 1986, Panhandle Eastern Corporation distributed its interests in Anadarko to its shareholders via a corporate spin-off in 1986.[5]
In 1999, the company announced that it would purchase a 7.5-acre (30,000 m2) tract in The Woodlands, Montgomery County, Texas from the Woodlands Land Company and build an 800,000-square-foot (74,000 m2), 32-story headquarters building, on the site.[6] In 2012, the company announced that it would construct another office tower adjacent to its headquarters.[7] The company announced that it will name its two office towers after former CEOs.[8]
In 2003, the company announced that Robert J. Allison, Jr. was resigning as chief executive officer and would be replaced by James T. Hackett, previously the chief operating officer of Devon Energy.[9] In 2012, the company announced a major natural gas find offshore Mozambique.[10]
Acquisitions and sales[edit]

In 2000, the company acquired Union Pacific Resources in a $4.4 billion transaction.[11][12]


In 2001, the company acquired Berkeley Petroleum Corporation for C$1.2 billion plus the assumption of C$400 million in debt.[13]


In 2006, the company completed the acquisition of Kerr-McGee for $16 billion in cash.[14][15]


In 2006, the company purchased Western Gas Resources in a $5.3 billion cash transaction.[16]


In 2007, the company sold assets in Oklahoma and Texas for $860 million.[17]


In 2015, the company made an offer to acquire Apache Corporation, but the offer was rejected.[18]


In 2016, the company sold its interest in the Springfield oil and gas gathering system, near the Eagle Ford shale, for $750 million to Western Gas Partners.[19] In March 2016, the company announced layoffs affecting 1,000 employees, or 17% of its staff. The layoffs were the result of weak commodity prices.[20]

Environmental record[edit]
Deepwater Horizon Oil spill involvement[edit]
Main article: Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion
Anadarko owned a 25% non-operating minority interest in the Macondo Prospect, which was owned 65% by and operated by BP and was affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[21]
Settlement with BP[edit]
In early 2010, BP billed Anadarko more than $272 million as a partial payment for its share of cleanup and response costs in the Gulf, according to a bill that was sent by BP and obtained by Talking Points Memo. Anadarko publicly suggested that it will not pay for costs associated with the oil disaster, claiming in a statement that BP was guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Under the joint operating agreement, Anadarko was required to pay its 25% share of costs related to any incident—unless that incident was caused by its partner's gross negligence or willful misconduct.[22]
In May 2011, MOEX Offshore, a subsidiary of Mitsui and owner of a 10% non-operating ownership interest in the Macondo Prospect, settled claims with BP for $1.07 billion.[23]
In October 2011, Anadarko settled all claims with BP for $4 billion. Anadarko also transferred its 25% stake in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (Macondo Prospect) to BP and was indemnified by BP for all costs related to the oil spill, including those arising under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.[24][25]
Fine under the Clean Water Act[edit]
In December 2015, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier ordered Anadarko to pay a civil fine under the Clean Water Act of $159.5 million, or $50 per barrel of oil spilled as a result of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion.[21] The judge stated Anadarko was not at fault for the spill, but the company's 25% ownership stake made it responsible. Barbier wrote that the $159.5 million fine "strikes the appropriate balance between Anadarko's lack of culpability and the extreme seriousness of this spill."[21] The fine came after BP and Anadarko had unsuccessfully appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to reject Judge Carl Barbier's finding of negligence in the Deepwater Horizon accident.[26]
Tronox litigation and settlements[edit]
In April 2014, Anadarko settled with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency to pay $5.15 billion to clean up environmental waste sites around the country. It was the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history.[27]
The environmental contamination sites were inherited by Anadarko after it purchased Kerr-McGee in 2005. As background, Kerr-McGee had spun off its Tronox subsidiary to offload 70 years of environmental dumping of toxic waste across 22 states beginning in the 1920s. The environmental damages included polluting Lake Mead in Nevada with rocket fuel, leaving behind radioactive waste piles throughout the territory of the Navajo Nation and dumping carcinogenic creosote in communities throughout the East, Midwest and South at its wood-treating facilities.[4] According to one report, "Kerr-McGee, rather than pay for the environmental mess it created, decided to shift the liabilities between 2002 and 2006 into Tronox. Kerr-McGee, meanwhile, kept its valuable oil and gas assets."[4] Anadarko then purchased the "clean" portion of Kerr-McGee free of its legacy of environmental dumping.
Lawsuit from Tronox shareholders[edit]
In 2009, shareholders of Tronox sued Anadarko, as successor to Kerr-McGee, for having misled investors about the large environmental and other debts Tronox would inherit from Kerr-McGee.[28][29]
Lawsuit from the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Justice[edit]
The U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, sued Anadarko for $25 billion.[30]
In April 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency, reached a $5.15 billion settlement with Anadarko in the largest environmental contamination settlement in American history.[27][4]

<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
