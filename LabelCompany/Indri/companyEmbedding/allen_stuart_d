The Trial Attorneys of Allen Stewart, P.C. are Passionate About Helping People Harmed By Others.
The Occupational Cancer Advocates at Allen Stewart, PC have devoted their careers to representing people who have been harmed by the negligent or malicious acts of others. Having handled for many years cases involving people who have developed cancer due to toxic exposures, we have seen many cases of those harmed by the misbehavior of big corporations. We have expanded our practice areas specifically for this reason. We are tired of watching large corporations take advantage of people and harm them. That’s why we are taking a stand for our clients!
Our practice areas include:
Benzene Exposure, Lemon Law, Personal Injury, Sinonasal Cancer, Mesothelioma and Eminent Domain.
