						Effective August 1, 2016, Prime Reserve Fund, changed to a government mandate and was 
renamed Government Money Fund. The performance for the periods prior to August 1, 2016 
reflects the performance of the fund when it operated as a prime money market fund and 
invested in certain types of securities that it is no longer permitted to hold. 
Performance prior to this conversion may have been different if the current investment 
limitations had been in effect.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, 
which cannot guarantee future results. Return and yield will vary.

 
    
You could lose money by investing in the Fund. 
Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee 
it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's 
sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and 
you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the 
Fund at any time.
    
    





^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
	

1Average annual total return figures include reinvested dividends and capital gain distributions.

				A method of calculating a money fund's yield by annualizing the 
fund's net investment income for the last seven days of each period 
divided by the fund's net asset value at the end of the period. 
				
3
									
					
					In an effort to maintain a zero or positive net yield for the fund, T. Rowe Price has voluntarily waived all or a portion of the management fee it is entitled to receive from the fund. A fee waiver has the effect of increasing the fund's net yield. The 7-day yield without waiver represents what the yield would have been if we were not waiving our management fee. This voluntary waiver is in addition to any contractual expense ratio limitation in effect for the fund and may be amended or terminated at any time without prior notice. Please see the prospectus for more details. 
					
				
				Year-to-date figures are not annualized and represent total return, 
which includes reinvested distributions (income and capital gains) 
and any change in share price for the given period. The yield quotation 
more closely reflects the current earnings of the money market fund than the total return quotation.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

403(b) Retirement Plans










A 403(b) is a tax-favored retirement plan similar to a 401(k) plan, but designed for employees of school systems, nonprofit hospitals, religious organizations and other tax-exempt employers, known as 501(c)(3) organizations.

Here are the basics of 403(b) plans, although plan rules may vary:


Participants may be able to make pretax or Roth contributions. Some organizations match these contributions.
Participant contributions are 100% immediately vested, but matching contributions may be subjected to a vesting schedule.








Collapse All



  Eligible Organizations  








Public education organizations, including primary and secondary schools, state colleges and universities and junior colleges
Nonprofit organizations, including hospitals, religious organizations, charitable institutions and social welfare agencies








  Eligible Employees  







After the first employee is permitted to participate, the employer must extend the offer to participate to all employees of the organization. The employer may exclude certain employees from the plan:

Employees who will contribute $200 or less annually
Nonresident aliens
Employees who work less than 20 hours per week
Employees who participate in a 401(k) or 457(b) plan or in another 403(b) plan
Students performing services described in Code 3121(b)(10) 







  Participant Contributions  







Each employee participating in the plan determines how much money is to be automatically contributed from each paycheck. Generally, participants can invest an annual maximum of $18,000 in 2017, or $24,000 for those 50 or older.

Traditional contributions (that is, not Roth contributions) are made before taxes are deducted, which means that income taxes are not paid at the time of investment. Instead, taxes are paid when the money is withdrawn, including on any earnings. 
Plans may allow Roth contributions, which are made with money that has been taxed. Money that’s been taxed won’t be taxed again. Additionally, earnings are tax- and penalty-free for qualified distributions.*

* Withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax- and penalty-free if the account was established at least 5 years before, and if the participant is at least 59½ years old, disabled or deceased. For nonqualified distributions, earnings are taxable and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty.







  Investment Options  










The investments available in the plan — the most common options are mutual funds — are generally determined by the employer or the plan provisions, but participants can decide which of the options to use.
American Funds offers a wide range of investments.











American Funds Portfolio Series℠



Objective-focused — Funds of funds that are based on investment objectives like preservation, balance and growth.











Individual Mutual Funds



Customized — Investors can build an investment portfolio of American Funds (excluding tax-exempt funds) to meet their specific preferences and needs.








  Employer Contributions  







As an added incentive for their employees to invest, some employers make “matching” contributions to participant accounts. Some employers match employee contributions dollar for dollar, while others contribute a percentage of what employees contribute. Employers may also make discretionary (profit-sharing) contributions into participant accounts.






  Vesting  







Participants always own 100% of their contributions. With employer contributions, participants often become vested over time.






  Distributions  







Distributions from 403(b) plans are generally allowed at age 59½ or in the case of disability. However, there may be ways to access money early. 






  Options When Employment Ends  







There are a number of options an employee can take when leaving the job:

Roll over to an IRA — Rolling 403(b) assets to an IRA can allow participants to keep the same tax benefits, avoid penalties, choose from a wider range of investment options and, with a Roth IRA, avoid having to take distributions before they’re needed.
Stay in the old plan — If the account balance is large enough, participants may be able to remain in the plan and keep the same benefits, although fees may increase and they won’t be able to make contributions.
Move to a new plan — If the participant’s new employer allows rollovers, participants can keep the tax benefits while consolidating their retirement plan money.
Cash out — Participants will owe applicable taxes and, if not yet age 59½, possible penalties.

401(k) Retirement Plans










American Funds offers a variety of 401(k) plan solutions and investment options to help employers and investors meet their needs. To find out which options are best for you, talk to your company’s financial professional.
Any employer, except government entities, can offer a 401(k) plan. Here are the basics of 401(k) plans, although plan rules may vary:








Collapse All



  Participant Contributions  







Each employee participating in the plan determines how much money is to be automatically contributed from each paycheck. Generally, participants can invest an annual maximum of $18,000 in 2017, or $24,000 for those 50 or older.


Traditional contributions (that is, not Roth contributions) are made before taxes are deducted, which means that income taxes are not paid at the time of investment. Instead, taxes are paid when the money is withdrawn, including on any earnings.
Plans may allow Roth contributions, which are made with money that has been taxed. Money that’s been taxed won’t be taxed again. Additionally, earnings are tax- and penalty-free for qualified distributions.*


* Withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax- and penalty-free if the account was established at least 5 years before, and if the participant is at least 59½ years old, disabled or deceased. For nonqualified distributions, earnings are taxable and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty.







  Investment Options  







The investments available in the plan — the most common options are mutual funds — are determined by the employer, who may get help from the plan's financial professional or a third-party fiduciary. Participants can decide which of the options to use. 







American Funds Portfolio SeriesSM



Objective-focused — Funds of funds that are based on investment objectives like preservation, balance and growth. 











Individual Mutual Funds



Customized — Investors can build an investment portfolio of American Funds (excluding tax-exempt funds) to meet their specific preferences and needs.








  Employer Contributions  







As an added incentive for their employees to invest, some employers make “matching” contributions to participant accounts. Some employers match employee contributions dollar for dollar, while others contribute a percentage of what employees contribute. Employers may also make discretionary contributions into participant accounts.







  Vesting  







Participants always own 100% of their salary-deferral contributions. With employer contributions, participants often become vested over time.







  Distributions  







Distributions from 401(k) plans are generally allowed at age 59½ or in the case of disability. However, plans may allow ways to access 401(k) money early. 







  Options When Employment Ends  







There are a number of options an employee can take when leaving the job:


Roll over to an IRA — Rolling 401(k) assets to an IRA can allow participants to keep the same tax benefits, avoid penalties, choose from a wider range of investment options and, with a Roth IRA, avoid having to take distributions before they’re needed.
Stay in the old plan — If the account balance is large enough, participants may be able to remain in the plan and keep the same benefits, although fees may increase and they won’t be able to make contributions.
Move to a new plan — If the participant’s new employer allows rollovers, participants can keep the tax benefits while consolidating their retirement plan money.
Cash out — Participants will owe applicable taxes and, if not yet age 59½, possible penalties. 

To learn more about your options, contact your financial professional.

Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.

IRA Comparison Table
Use this table to see a side-by-side comparison of traditional and Roth IRA features and benefits.
This table will help you compare the key features of benefits of traditional and Roth IRAs.















 






 Traditional IRAs 






 Roth IRAs 





















Eligibility1











Any person with earned income who is under 70½.

A nonworking spouse under age 70½ who files a joint return that includes earned income.












Your ability to contribute to a Roth IRA depends on your income level:
For 2016:

 Single filer with modified adjusted gross income (MAGI)2 of:

$117,001–$131,999 — partial contribution
$132,000 or more — not eligible

Joint filers with MAGI of:

$184,000 or less — full contribution 
$184,001–$193,999 — partial contribution 
$194,000 or more — not eligible 

Married, filing separately with MAGI of:

$0–$9,999 — partial contribution 
$10,000 or more — not eligible 

For 2017:

 Single filer with MAGI of:

$118,000 or less — full contribution
$118,001–$132,999 — partial contribution

$186,001–$195,999 — partial contribution
$196,000 or more — not eligible

$0–$9,999 — partial contribution
$10,000 or more — not eligible


















Maximum Annual Contribution3











The total contribution you can make to all of your IRAs for 2016 and 2017 is $5,500 or 100% of your compensation, whichever is less.
If you’re age 50 or older, you can make an additional contribution of $1,000, for a total of $6,500.











Same as traditional IRA, subject to phase-out range depending on MAGI as explained in Eligibility.

















Deductible Contributions











For 2016:

 Single filer, covered by a retirement plan at work, with MAGI of:

$61,000 or less — fully deductible 
$61,001–$70,999 — partially deductible 
$71,000 or more — nondeductible 

Single filer, not covered by a plan at work:

fully deductible 

Joint filer, covered by a plan at work, with MAGI of:

$98,000 or less — fully deductible 
$98,001–$117,999 — partially deductible 
$118,000 or more — nondeductible 

Joint filer, only a spouse is covered by a plan at work, with MAGI of:

184,000 or less — fully deductible 
$184,001–$193,999 — partially deductible 
$194,000 or more — nondeductible 

Married, filing separately with MAGI of:

$0–$9,999 — partial contribution 
$10,000 or more — not eligible 

For 2017:

$62,000 or less — fully deductible
$62,001–$71,999 — partially deductible
$72,000 or more — nondeductible

Single filer, not covered by a plan at work:

fully deductible

Joint filer, covered by a plan at work, with MAGI of:

$99,000 or less — fully deductible
$99,001–$118,999 — partially deductible
$119,000 or more — nondeductible

Joint filer, only a spouse is covered by a plan at work, with MAGI of:

$186,000 or less — fully deductible
$186,001–$195,999 — partially deductible
$196,000 or more — nondeductible

Married, filing separately with MAGI of:

$0–$9,999 — partial contribution 
$10,000 or more — not eligible












Roth contributions are not tax-deductible.

















Tax Credit for Contributions











You can claim a nonrefundable tax credit for contributions if you are eligible.
The maximum credit allowed is 50% of the annual contribution amount up to $2,000, so long as your household income doesn’t exceed certain limits.
Joint filers with a MAGI of $62,000 or less in 2017 (or $61,500 in 2016) and single filers with a MAGI of $31,000 or less in 2017 (or $30,750 in 2016) qualify for the credit.











Same as traditional IRA.

















Federal Income-Tax Treatment on Contributions











Taxes are deferred until distributions are made; taxable distributions are treated as ordinary income.
Withdrawals of nondeductible contributions are not taxed.











Contributions are made with after-tax money; therefore, withdrawals from the contribution amount (basis amount) are tax-free.

















Federal Income-Tax Treatment on Earnings











Earnings grow tax-deferred until distributions begin. Distributions are taxed as ordinary income.












Qualified distributions are tax-free.
Nonqualified distributions: earnings are taxed as ordinary income and may be subject to a penalty.
Conversions: earnings are tax-free after the conversion amount satisfies the five-year investment period.

















Conversions











Conversion to a Roth IRA4: allowed, regardless of MAGI or tax filing status. The taxable portion of the converted amount will be treated as taxable income.












Recharacterizations: a Roth conversion can be undone (recharacterized) for any reason. You have until your tax filing deadline (including extensions) of the year you converted to a Roth IRA to undo your conversion.

















Rollovers











To employer-sponsored plans: pretax contributions can be rolled over to a 401(k) or to another qualified plan, as well as to 403(b) and 457(b) plans. However, the receiving plan must accept IRA rollovers.


From employer-sponsored plans: eligible pretax and after-tax distributions from qualified plans, as well as from 403(b) and 457(b) plans, can be rolled over.












From/to another Roth IRA: allowed.
From employer-sponsored plans: eligible Roth contributions and earnings in 401(k) and 403(b) plans can be rolled over. In addition, non-Roth balances can be rolled over. (See Conversions for more information.)

















Distributions5











Distributions from contributions and earnings can be taken after age 59½ without federal tax penalty.
 Mandatory withdrawals must begin no later than April 1 following the year you reach age 70½.
 Distributions before age 59½ are subject to a 10% penalty tax unless you qualify for one of the following exceptions under section 72(t) of the Internal Revenue Code:

you’re disabled 
you’re taking substantially equal periodic payments 
the distribution is for certain medical bills 
the distribution is used for health insurance premiums during unemployment lasting at least 12 weeks 
the distribution is for post-secondary education expenses 
the distribution is used to purchase a first home (up to $10,000 lifetime maximum)

Distributions to your beneficiaries are also exempt from the 10% penalty.















Distributions from contributions can be made any time without taxes or federal tax penalty.
Distributions from earnings are tax-free if your initial contribution to the account was made at least five years ago and you meet one of the following conditions:

you’re age 59½
you’re disabled
you’re purchasing a first home (up to $10,000 lifetime maximum)

Payments made to your beneficiaries after the five-year period are also tax and penalty free. Payments made before the end of the five-year period are penalty free.
Distributions from earnings are not subject to the 10% penalty as long as you qualify for an exception — same as exceptions for traditional IRAs.
Distributions from a conversion amount must satisfy a five-year investment period to avoid the 10% penalty. This pertains only to the conversion amount that was treated as income for tax purposes.

















Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)











You must begin taking RMDs no later than April 1 of the year following the year you turn 70½.

All of your IRA balances are aggregated for the purposes of calculating RMDs. Withdrawals may be taken from one or more IRAs.












No RMDs apply during your lifetime.













1 If you are eligible, you can contribute to both a traditional and Roth IRA as long as the combined amount does not exceed the applicable contribution limits shown in the table.
2 Your MAGI is calculated by subtracting certain expenses and allowable adjustments from your gross income. To determine your MAGI, contact your tax advisor or financial professional.
3 Future contribution limits may be adjusted for cost-of-living increases. Contributions for the current tax year must be made by April 15 of the following year, unless that date falls on a Saturday or Sunday.
4 Converting to a Roth IRA is a taxable event, and the rules and tax calculations can be complicated. State income-tax rules for conversions may differ from federal rules. We encourage you to discuss conversion options with your tax advisor or financial professional.
5 For beneficiaries, distribution rules vary depending on your age at death and the beneficiary‘s relationship to you. For help with distributions and tax-related issues, we encourageyou to talk to your personal tax advisor or legal professional.















You can learn more about traditional and Roth IRAs in IRS Publication 590-A, Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs), and IRS Publication 590-B, Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs). We also encourage you to discuss your financial goals, eligibility and individual tax situation with your tax advisor or financial professional.

American Funds represents 17 equity-focused funds, in aggregate: AMCAP Fund, American Balanced Fund, American Funds Global Balanced Fund, American Mutual Fund, Capital Income Builder, Capital World Growth and Income Fund, EuroPacific Growth Fund, Fundamental Investors, The Growth Fund of America, The Income Fund of America, International Growth and Income Fund, The Investment Company of America, The New Economy Fund, New Perspective Fund, New World Fund, SMALLCAP World Fund and Washington Mutual Investors Fund. For each fund’s comparable index/index blend, see Methodology. Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.
2Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data. Based on monthly returns from January 1996 to December 2015. U.S. funds are those in the Morningstar Large Value, Large Blend and Large Growth categories. U.S. index is S&P 500. International funds are those in the Morningstar Foreign Large Value, Foreign Large Blend and Foreign Large Growth categories. International index is MSCI ACWI ex USA. The indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. Unless otherwise indicated, all distributions were reinvested.

Creating a Financial Plan










The Value of a Financial Professional
Take advantage of your financial advisor’s experience and guidance.
Services Provided by Financial Professionals
Financial professionals provide many valuable services. They can help you:

Develop a long-term financial plan consistent with your time horizon, goals, financial situation and risk tolerance.
Analyze the risks and potential rewards of various investments.
Understand the value of a long-term investment perspective and a diversified asset mix spread among different asset classes, sectors and countries.
Build a portfolio that fits your needs, and monitor and change it over time.
Take advantage of investment manager services.

In addition, financial professionals will provide support and guidance during difficult times, such as:

Market downturns
Political turmoil
Wide interest rate or currency fluctuations
Personal financial stress

Working With a Financial Professional Could Help Improve Your Investment Outcome
If you think you can make good decisions on when to buy and sell on your own, consider that the statistics on the “do it yourself” approach are not encouraging.
Findings by Morningstar, a leading mutual fund research firm, compared mutual fund returns with the gains investors actually received. The study found that investor returns typically lagged fund returns.1 The reason: Investors tended to move cash in and out as markets would rise and fall, often buying high and selling low.
The study covered 10 years through the end of 2012, and found that funds posted an average annualized return of 7.05%, compared with a 6.1% average return realized by investors. (The returns factor in all stock and bond funds that Morningstar tracks. Investor returns are weighted based on asset flows into and out of all share classes of open-end mutual funds tracked by Morningstar.)
Although a gap of a single percentage point may not seem like a big difference, it can make a significant impact over the long term, thanks to compounding. In fact, a hypothetical $10,000 investment returning an average of 7.05% annually would produce a total of $19,856 over 10 years compared with $18,078 for an average annual return of 6.1% over the same period. Over 30 years, the gap becomes even wider: $78,286 for the 7.05% return vs. $59,082 for the 6.1% return.2







 Returns Based on a Hypothetical $10,000 Initial Investment 
















What is the reason for the gap between fund returns and investor returns? Financial researchers say the difference is largely attributable to investors buying funds when times are good and then selling when troubles arise. Once out of the market, investors often don’t get back in the market in time to capture much of the later upturn in stock prices.
Stock market volatility makes the problem worse. Fear can drive investors out of the market or cause them to make emotional decisions that could have long-term consequences for their portfolios. A financial advisor can help provide guidance during difficult times and help investors stay the course on their investment strategies.   
1 Russel Kinnel, “Mind the Gap: Why Investors Lag Funds,” Morningstar, February 4, 2013.

For additional details, please refer to the Daily Rates Blastfax. 1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 0.26% for Agency, 0.18% for Capital, 0.30% for Direct, 1.00% for E, 0.70% for Eagle, 0.21% for I Shares, 0.51% for Investor, 0.59% for Morgan, 0.45% for Premier, 0.70% for Reserve and 1.05% for Service of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 6/30/2018 for Agency, 6/30/2018 for Capital, 6/30/2018 for Direct, 6/30/2018 for E, 6/30/2018 for Eagle, 6/30/2018 for I Shares, 6/30/2018 for Investor, 6/30/2018 for Morgan, 6/30/2018 for Premier, 6/30/2018 for Reserve and 6/30/2018 for Service, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. The Net Assets, Weighted Average Maturity (WAM (days)) and Weighted Average Life (WAL (days)) are based on calculations as of 3pm EST. Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%.

Investments in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates rise, the value of these investments generally drops.

PRINCIPLE #1: PLAN ON LIVING A LONG TIME

DON’T LET YOUR CLIENTS' MONEY RUN OUT

Your clients are living longer, and many of them haven't saved enough. Use our Principles for Successful Long-Term Investing to talk to them about this reality, and to help them be prepared.
ACCESS ALL 7 PRINCIPLES







 














We are living longer

Thanks to advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles, people who are 65 today have a very good chance of reaching ages 80 or 90. A 65-year-old couple might be surprised to learn that at least one of them has a 48% probability of living another 25 years and needing investments to last until age 90.

	 

Many of us have not saved enough

Studies reveal that individuals do not feel adequately prepared for retirement. Investors should start early by saving more, investing with discipline and having a plan for their future.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.

TARGET DATE FUNDS. Target date funds are funds with the target date being the approximate date when investors plan to start withdrawing their money. Generally, the asset allocation of each fund will change on an annual basis with the asset allocation becoming more conservative as the fund nears the target retirement date. The principal value of the fund(s) is not guaranteed at any time, including at the target date.

	*TDFs may suffer investment losses, including near and following retirement. There is no guarantee that a TDF will provide adequate retirement income.

Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
YTD (year-to-date return): the net change in the value of the fund's shares (in percentage terms) from January 1, 2017, to the current date shown above.

Terms and Definitions


Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.

USTREAS T-Bill Auction Ave 3 Mon: USTREAS T-Bill Auction Ave 3 Mon is an index that measures the performance of the average investment rate of U.S. Treasury bills (T-Bills) with a three-month maturity. Three-month T-Bills are short-term securities issued by the U.S. government that are generally considered to be risk-free. In calculating index results, Morningstar, the index provider, determines the arithmetic mean of the investment rates on all three-month T-Bills issued during a given month as reported by the U.S. Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt. The investment rate is then converted into a price and a monthly return, assuming that the T-Bill is held to maturity.

Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
You could lose money by investing in American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. The fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will do so at any time.
  
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness.
The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds. American Funds Strategic Bond Fund may engage in frequent and active trading of its portfolio securities, which may involve correspondingly greater transaction costs, adversely affecting the fund's results.
Fund shares of U.S. Government Securities Fund are not guaranteed by the U.S. government.
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. Diversification does not eliminate the risks of investing; losses are possible in diversified portfolios. Small-company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. The value of fixed income securities may be affected by changing interest rates and changes in credit ratings of the securities. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Investments in mortgage-related securities involve additional risks, such as prepayment risk, as more fully described in the prospectus. While not directly correlated to changes in interest rates, the values of inflation-linked bonds generally fluctuate in response to changes in real interest rates and may experience greater losses than other debt securities with similar durations.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund or underlying fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus. Investment allocations for funds of funds may not achieve fund objectives. There are expenses associated with the underlying funds in addition to fund-of-funds expenses. The funds' risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds, as described herein. Each target date fund is composed of a mix of the American Funds and is subject to the risks and returns of the underlying funds. Underlying funds may be added or removed during the year. Although the target date funds are managed for investors on a projected retirement date time frame, the funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' retirement goals will be met. The target date is the year in which an investor is assumed to retire and begin taking withdrawals. American Funds investment professionals manage the target date fund's portfolio, moving it from a more growth-oriented strategy to a more income-oriented focus as the fund gets closer to its target date. Investment professionals continue to manage each fund for 30 years after it reaches its target date. The target allocations are as of January 1, 2017, and are subject to the Portfolio Oversight Committee's discretion. The funds’ investment adviser anticipates that the funds will invest their assets within a range that deviates no more than 10% above or below these allocations. Investment professionals gradually adjust the portfolio over time so that it becomes more preservation-oriented. The funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' education savings goals will be met. The target date is the year in which the beneficiary is expected to begin taking withdrawals. Investors and their advisors should periodically evaluate their investment to determine whether it continues to meet their needs. The Retirement Income Portfolio Series' investment allocations may not achieve fund objectives, and adequate income through retirement is not guaranteed. There are expenses associated with the underlying funds in addition to fund-of-funds expenses. The funds’ risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds. Payments consisting of return of capital will result in a decrease in an investor’s fund share balance. Higher rates of withdrawal and withdrawals during declining markets may result in a more rapid decrease in an investor’s fund share balance. Persistent returns of capital could ultimately result in a zero account balance.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes . Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
Visit the SEC website for the American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund’s most recent filings.
American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund Class A is the only share class in the American Funds offering check-writing privileges. It is also the only share class that can be exchanged into certain other share classes of other American Funds.

You could lose money by investing in American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. The fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will do so at any time.
  
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
Although American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund has 12b-1 plans for some share classes, the fund is currently suspending certain 12b-1 payments in this low interest rate environment. Should payments commence, the fund’s investment results will be lower and expenses will be higher.
The value of fixed income securities may be affected by changing interest rates and changes in credit ratings of the securities.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus.
Visit the SEC website for the American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund’s most recent filings.

The investment adviser is currently reimbursing a portion of the fees and expenses for American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund.

Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
YTD (year-to-date return): the net change in the value of the fund's shares (in percentage terms) from January 1, 2017, to the current date shown above.

Terms and Definitions


USTREAS T-Bill Auction Ave 3 Mon: USTREAS T-Bill Auction Ave 3 Mon is an index that measures the performance of the average investment rate of U.S. Treasury bills (T-Bills) with a three-month maturity. Three-month T-Bills are short-term securities issued by the U.S. government that are generally considered to be risk-free. In calculating index results, Morningstar, the index provider, determines the arithmetic mean of the investment rates on all three-month T-Bills issued during a given month as reported by the U.S. Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt. The investment rate is then converted into a price and a monthly return, assuming that the T-Bill is held to maturity.

Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
You could lose money by investing in American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. The fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will do so at any time.
  
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness.
The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds. American Funds Strategic Bond Fund may engage in frequent and active trading of its portfolio securities, which may involve correspondingly greater transaction costs, adversely affecting the fund's results.
Fund shares of U.S. Government Securities Fund are not guaranteed by the U.S. government.
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. Diversification does not eliminate the risks of investing; losses are possible in diversified portfolios. Small-company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. The value of fixed income securities may be affected by changing interest rates and changes in credit ratings of the securities. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Investments in mortgage-related securities involve additional risks, such as prepayment risk, as more fully described in the prospectus. While not directly correlated to changes in interest rates, the values of inflation-linked bonds generally fluctuate in response to changes in real interest rates and may experience greater losses than other debt securities with similar durations.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund or underlying fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus. Investment allocations for funds of funds may not achieve fund objectives. There are expenses associated with the underlying funds in addition to fund-of-funds expenses. The funds' risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds, as described herein. Each target date fund is composed of a mix of the American Funds and is subject to the risks and returns of the underlying funds. Underlying funds may be added or removed during the year. Although the target date funds are managed for investors on a projected retirement date time frame, the funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' retirement goals will be met. The target date is the year in which an investor is assumed to retire and begin taking withdrawals. American Funds investment professionals manage the target date fund's portfolio, moving it from a more growth-oriented strategy to a more income-oriented focus as the fund gets closer to its target date. Investment professionals continue to manage each fund for 30 years after it reaches its target date. The target allocations are as of January 1, 2017, and are subject to the Portfolio Oversight Committee's discretion. The funds’ investment adviser anticipates that the funds will invest their assets within a range that deviates no more than 10% above or below these allocations. Investment professionals gradually adjust the portfolio over time so that it becomes more preservation-oriented. The funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' education savings goals will be met. The target date is the year in which the beneficiary is expected to begin taking withdrawals. Investors and their advisors should periodically evaluate their investment to determine whether it continues to meet their needs. The Retirement Income Portfolio Series' investment allocations may not achieve fund objectives, and adequate income through retirement is not guaranteed. There are expenses associated with the underlying funds in addition to fund-of-funds expenses. The funds’ risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds. Payments consisting of return of capital will result in a decrease in an investor’s fund share balance. Higher rates of withdrawal and withdrawals during declining markets may result in a more rapid decrease in an investor’s fund share balance. Persistent returns of capital could ultimately result in a zero account balance.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes . Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.

Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.
The investment adviser is currently reimbursing a portion of the fees and expenses for American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund.

Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
YTD (year-to-date return): the net change in the value of the fund's shares (in percentage terms) from January 1, 2017, to the current date shown above.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

Terms and Definitions


Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.

USTREAS T-Bill Auction Ave 3 Mon: USTREAS T-Bill Auction Ave 3 Mon is an index that measures the performance of the average investment rate of U.S. Treasury bills (T-Bills) with a three-month maturity. Three-month T-Bills are short-term securities issued by the U.S. government that are generally considered to be risk-free. In calculating index results, Morningstar, the index provider, determines the arithmetic mean of the investment rates on all three-month T-Bills issued during a given month as reported by the U.S. Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt. The investment rate is then converted into a price and a monthly return, assuming that the T-Bill is held to maturity.

Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
You could lose money by investing in American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. The fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will do so at any time.
  
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness.
The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds. American Funds Strategic Bond Fund may engage in frequent and active trading of its portfolio securities, which may involve correspondingly greater transaction costs, adversely affecting the fund's results.
Fund shares of U.S. Government Securities Fund are not guaranteed by the U.S. government.
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. Diversification does not eliminate the risks of investing; losses are possible in diversified portfolios. Small-company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. The value of fixed income securities may be affected by changing interest rates and changes in credit ratings of the securities. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Investments in mortgage-related securities involve additional risks, such as prepayment risk, as more fully described in the prospectus. While not directly correlated to changes in interest rates, the values of inflation-linked bonds generally fluctuate in response to changes in real interest rates and may experience greater losses than other debt securities with similar durations.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund or underlying fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus. Investment allocations for funds of funds may not achieve fund objectives. There are expenses associated with the underlying funds in addition to fund-of-funds expenses. The funds' risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds, as described herein. Each target date fund is composed of a mix of the American Funds and is subject to the risks and returns of the underlying funds. Underlying funds may be added or removed during the year. Although the target date funds are managed for investors on a projected retirement date time frame, the funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' retirement goals will be met. The target date is the year in which an investor is assumed to retire and begin taking withdrawals. American Funds investment professionals manage the target date fund's portfolio, moving it from a more growth-oriented strategy to a more income-oriented focus as the fund gets closer to its target date. Investment professionals continue to manage each fund for 30 years after it reaches its target date. The target allocations are as of January 1, 2017, and are subject to the Portfolio Oversight Committee's discretion. The funds’ investment adviser anticipates that the funds will invest their assets within a range that deviates no more than 10% above or below these allocations. Investment professionals gradually adjust the portfolio over time so that it becomes more preservation-oriented. The funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' education savings goals will be met. The target date is the year in which the beneficiary is expected to begin taking withdrawals. Investors and their advisors should periodically evaluate their investment to determine whether it continues to meet their needs. The Retirement Income Portfolio Series' investment allocations may not achieve fund objectives, and adequate income through retirement is not guaranteed. There are expenses associated with the underlying funds in addition to fund-of-funds expenses. The funds’ risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds. Payments consisting of return of capital will result in a decrease in an investor’s fund share balance. Higher rates of withdrawal and withdrawals during declining markets may result in a more rapid decrease in an investor’s fund share balance. Persistent returns of capital could ultimately result in a zero account balance.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes . Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
Visit the SEC website for the American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund’s most recent filings.
American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund Class A is the only share class in the American Funds offering check-writing privileges. It is also the only share class that can be exchanged into certain other share classes of other American Funds.

Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
You could lose money by investing in American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. The fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will do so at any time.
  
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness.
The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional cash securities, such as stocks and bonds. American Funds Strategic Bond Fund may engage in frequent and active trading of its portfolio securities, which may involve correspondingly greater transaction costs, adversely affecting the fund's results.
Fund shares of U.S. Government Securities Fund are not guaranteed by the U.S. government.
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. Diversification does not eliminate the risks of investing; losses are possible in diversified portfolios. Small-company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. The value of fixed income securities may be affected by changing interest rates and changes in credit ratings of the securities. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Investments in mortgage-related securities involve additional risks, such as prepayment risk, as more fully described in the prospectus. While not directly correlated to changes in interest rates, the values of inflation-linked bonds generally fluctuate in response to changes in real interest rates and may experience greater losses than other debt securities with similar durations.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund or underlying fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus. Investment allocations for funds of funds may not achieve fund objectives. There are expenses associated with the underlying funds in addition to fund-of-funds expenses. The funds' risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds, as described herein. Each target date fund is composed of a mix of the American Funds and is subject to the risks and returns of the underlying funds. Underlying funds may be added or removed during the year. Although the target date funds are managed for investors on a projected retirement date time frame, the funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' retirement goals will be met. The target date is the year in which an investor is assumed to retire and begin taking withdrawals. American Funds investment professionals actively manage the target date fund's portfolio, moving it from a more growth-oriented strategy to a more income-oriented focus as the fund gets closer to its target date. Investment professionals continue to manage each fund for 30 years after it reaches its target date. The target allocations are as of January 1, 2017, and are subject to the Portfolio Oversight Committee's discretion. The funds’ investment adviser anticipates that the funds will invest their assets within a range that deviates no more than 10% above or below these allocations. Investment professionals gradually adjust the portfolio over time so that it becomes more preservation-oriented. The funds' allocation strategy does not guarantee that investors' education savings goals will be met. The target date is the year in which the beneficiary is expected to begin taking withdrawals. Investors and their advisors should periodically evaluate their investment to determine whether it continues to meet their needs. The Retirement Income Portfolio Series' investment allocations may not achieve fund objectives, and adequate income through retirement is not guaranteed. There are expenses associated with the underlying funds in addition to fund-of-funds expenses. The funds’ risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds. Payments consisting of return of capital will result in a decrease in an investor’s fund share balance. Higher rates of withdrawal and withdrawals during declining markets may result in a more rapid decrease in an investor’s fund share balance. Persistent returns of capital could ultimately result in a zero account balance.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes . Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
Visit the SEC website for the American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund’s most recent filings.
American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund Class A is the only share class in the American Funds offering check-writing privileges. It is also the only share class that can be exchanged into certain other share classes of other American Funds.

Portfolio information as of March 31, 2017



Summary
Performance
Overview


 





Investment Objective
A Fund seeking current income, liquidity and the maintenance of a stable $1.00 net asset value per share. 
 


Key Points


                        American Beacon Advisors uses a top-down approach, analyzing macroeconomic data to anticipate economic momentum shifts, inflationary trends, the shape of the yield curve and Federal Reserve policy. American Beacon Advisors strives to increase returns by actively managing the duration and quality of the portfolio, consistent with historical relationships among economic growth, inflation and the direction of interest rates.

                        The Fund invests in high-quality, U.S. dollar-denominated, short-term obligations with minimal credit risk, as determined by American Beacon. The Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies, or instrumentalities, as well as in repurchase agreements collateralized by such obligations and other investment companies that limit their investments to the foregoing. The dollar-weighted average maturity of the Fund will not exceed 60 days.

*Annualized. Yield is a more accurate reflection of the Fund's current earnings than total return.
The seven-day yields refer to the income generated by an investment in the Fund over a seven-day period. This income is then annualized. The seven-day effective yield is calculated similarly, but the income earned is assumed to have been reinvested. The effective yield will be slightly higher than the current yield because of the compounding effect of this assumed reinvestment. 
Standard & Poor’s (S&P) Rating: The fund is not sponsored,
  endorsed, sold or promoted by S&P, and S&P makes no
  representation regarding the advisability of investing in the
  fund. The credit rating is a forward-looking opinion about a
  fund's potential capacity to maintain stable principal or stable
  net asset value. The rating is an opinion of the date
  expressed and not a statement of fact or recommendation to
  purchase, hold or sell any security. Standard & Poor's rates
  the creditworthiness of money market funds from AAAm
  (highest) to Dm (lowest). For more information on S&P’s
  rating methodology, please visit
  www.standardandpoors.com and select “Understanding
  Ratings” under Ratings Resources on the home page.

                AFAXX: Overview of American Funds Money Market Fund            


    By David Dierking | Updated August 15, 2016 — 5:55 PM EDT    






Share















































The American Funds U.S. Government Money Market Fund ("AFAXX") is American Funds' lone money market fund offering. Launched on May 1, 2009, the fund was known as the American Funds Money Market Fund prior to April 1, 2016. In response to changes to Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) rules governing money market funds, the fund reorganized itself to meet the requirements of a U.S. government money market fund, and adopted the current name.
Money market mutual funds are generally considered one of the safest investment products available to investors. While they don't hold the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) protection that bank products do, most money market funds put their assets in short-term, safe investments to maintain a steady $1 per share price. AFAXX had total assets of $17.7 billion, as of August, 2016.
Zero Yield
Money market funds are designed to provide investors with a dividend yield in exchange for their investments. However, the low interest rate environment has made delivering enticing yields a challenge for fund providers. The U.S. Government Money Market Fund paid no yield, as of April 22, 2016.
Fund providers charge management fees to operate the fund, and these expenses get deducted from the yields of the portfolios' holdings. Many money market funds have operated at a loss during several years of zero-interest rate policy. Despite the 25 basis-point rate hike in December 2015, many funds have chosen to not increase their yields to begin recouping some of their lost revenues.
The U.S. Government Money Market Fund's zero yield is a result of the fund's expenses outweighing its returns. As the Federal Reserve adjusts the target Fed Funds rate upward, issuers will likely begin raising the interest rates offered on their own notes. As this occurs, yields on money market funds will tend to rise, as well.
Portfolio Composition
Money market securities are rated by the major ratings agencies, such as Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's. The highest-rated securities are given a first-tier rating. Given the U.S. Government Money Market Fund's focus on high-grade government securities, the fund had 100% of its assets invested in first-tier securities, as of March 31, 2016. It has a weighted average maturity of 49 days.
AFAXX has its entire portfolio invested in a combination of U.S. treasury bills, government agency securities and cash. As of March 31, 2016, the fund had 69% of its assets in government agency notes from issuers such as Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (FHLMC), 29% of its assets dedicated to short-term Treasuries and the remaining 2% of assets invested in cash.
Fees and Minimums
As of April 12, 2016, AFAXX paid a dividend yield of 0%. Part of the reason for the fund's non-existent yield is its 0.08% expense ratio, which is far more expensive than the Lipper U.S. Government Money Market Funds Average of 0.11%. The fund requires a minimum initial investment of $1000 for most account types.
Is the Fund Worth It?
Individuals looking for a money market fund that focuses on government securities can likely find options with a much lower cost structure. The traditional money market fund that invests in a combination of both government securities and corporate issues may also make more sense. The corporate notes inside of money market funds may not carry the backing of the full faith and credit of the government, but these funds also invest primarily in first-tier securities, making the chances of losing money on a money market fund investment very low.
Given the plethora of money market fund options available that charge less in fees and offer higher yields, AFAXX is a less-than-ideal choice for most investors.

					In an effort to maintain a zero or positive net yield for the fund, T. Rowe Price has voluntarily waived all or a portion of the management fee it is entitled to receive from the fund. A fee waiver has the effect of increasing the fund's net yield. The 7-day yield without waiver represents what the yield would have been if we were not waiving our management fee. This voluntary waiver is in addition to any contractual expense ratio limitation in effect for the fund and may be amended or terminated at any time without prior notice. Please see the prospectus for more details. 
					
				
				Year-to-date figures are not annualized and represent total return, 
which includes reinvested distributions (income and capital gains) 
and any change in share price for the given period. The yield quotation 
more closely reflects the current earnings of the money market fund than the total return quotation.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

403(b) Retirement Plans










A 403(b) is a tax-favored retirement plan similar to a 401(k) plan, but designed for employees of school systems, nonprofit hospitals, religious organizations and other tax-exempt employers, known as 501(c)(3) organizations.

Here are the basics of 403(b) plans, although plan rules may vary:


Participants may be able to make pretax or Roth contributions. Some organizations match these contributions.
Participant contributions are 100% immediately vested, but matching contributions may be subjected to a vesting schedule.








Collapse All



  Eligible Organizations  








Public education organizations, including primary and secondary schools, state colleges and universities and junior colleges
Nonprofit organizations, including hospitals, religious organizations, charitable institutions and social welfare agencies








  Eligible Employees  







After the first employee is permitted to participate, the employer must extend the offer to participate to all employees of the organization. The employer may exclude certain employees from the plan:

Employees who will contribute $200 or less annually
Nonresident aliens
Employees who work less than 20 hours per week
Employees who participate in a 401(k) or 457(b) plan or in another 403(b) plan
Students performing services described in Code 3121(b)(10) 







  Participant Contributions  







Each employee participating in the plan determines how much money is to be automatically contributed from each paycheck. Generally, participants can invest an annual maximum of $18,000 in 2017, or $24,000 for those 50 or older.

Traditional contributions (that is, not Roth contributions) are made before taxes are deducted, which means that income taxes are not paid at the time of investment. Instead, taxes are paid when the money is withdrawn, including on any earnings. 
Plans may allow Roth contributions, which are made with money that has been taxed. Money that’s been taxed won’t be taxed again. Additionally, earnings are tax- and penalty-free for qualified distributions.*

* Withdrawals from Roth accounts are tax- and penalty-free if the account was established at least 5 years before, and if the participant is at least 59½ years old, disabled or deceased. For nonqualified distributions, earnings are taxable and may be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty.







  Investment Options  










The investments available in the plan — the most common options are mutual funds — are generally determined by the employer or the plan provisions, but participants can decide which of the options to use.
American Funds offers a wide range of investments.











American Funds Portfolio Series℠



Objective-focused — Funds of funds that are based on investment objectives like preservation, balance and growth.











Individual Mutual Funds



Customized — Investors can build an investment portfolio of American Funds (excluding tax-exempt funds) to meet their specific preferences and needs.








  Employer Contributions  







As an added incentive for their employees to invest, some employers make “matching” contributions to participant accounts. Some employers match employee contributions dollar for dollar, while others contribute a percentage of what employees contribute. Employers may also make discretionary (profit-sharing) contributions into participant accounts.






  Vesting  







Participants always own 100% of their contributions. With employer contributions, participants often become vested over time.






  Distributions  







Distributions from 403(b) plans are generally allowed at age 59½ or in the case of disability. However, there may be ways to access money early. 






  Options When Employment Ends  







There are a number of options an employee can take when leaving the job:

Roll over to an IRA — Rolling 403(b) assets to an IRA can allow participants to keep the same tax benefits, avoid penalties, choose from a wider range of investment options and, with a Roth IRA, avoid having to take distributions before they’re needed.
Stay in the old plan — If the account balance is large enough, participants may be able to remain in the plan and keep the same benefits, although fees may increase and they won’t be able to make contributions.
Move to a new plan — If the participant’s new employer allows rollovers, participants can keep the tax benefits while consolidating their retirement plan money.
Cash out — Participants will owe applicable taxes and, if not yet age 59½, possible penalties.

Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.

American Funds offers a variety of 401(k) plan solutions and investment options to help employers and investors meet their needs. To find out which options are best for you, talk to your company’s financial professional.

The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 0.26% for Agency, 0.18% for Capital, 0.30% for Direct, 1.00% for E, 0.70% for Eagle, 0.21% for I Shares, 0.51% for Investor, 0.59% for Morgan, 0.45% for Premier, 0.70% for Reserve and 1.05% for Service of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 6/30/2018 for Agency, 6/30/2018 for Capital, 6/30/2018 for Direct, 6/30/2018 for E, 6/30/2018 for Eagle, 6/30/2018 for I Shares, 6/30/2018 for Investor, 6/30/2018 for Morgan, 6/30/2018 for Premier, 6/30/2018 for Reserve and 6/30/2018 for Service, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. The Net Assets, Weighted Average Maturity (WAM (days)) and Weighted Average Life (WAL (days)) are based on calculations as of 3pm EST. Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.
The price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to "stock market risk" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time.
International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Also, some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile.
Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower.
Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.
There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions.

We are living longer

Thanks to advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles, people who are 65 today have a very good chance of reaching ages 80 or 90. A 65-year-old couple might be surprised to learn that at least one of them has a 48% probability of living another 25 years and needing investments to last until age 90.

	 

Many of us have not saved enough

How to get Grants 



If you are in need of financial support,  government grants are the best financing option as they offer money with no return policies or interest. It is important to know the difference between this free funding and additional federal financial support, such as loans or scholarships.
Grants are non-repayable funds that relate to a specific purpose and require reporting against the desired outcome. Receivers of government grants do not pay back the basic sum or additional interest because they are pursuing a common state/government goal or executing a common need.
The Process of Receiving Grants
Currently, three phases are in the process of getting a government grant. Each phase has specific actions that must be taken to get to the next phase:

Pre-Award Phase (Finding opportunities for grants and getting your application reviewed)
Award Phase (Decisions and notifications about the award)
Post-Award Phase (Implementing, reporting and closing the award)

Finding Grant Opportunities
The United States government awards billions of dollars in federal grants every year. Grants are awarded to researchers, universities, cities, states, counties, law enforcement and non-profit organizations. Furthermore, the government offers four types of grants and loans to individuals, organizations, programs and projects:

Government grants and loans for individuals
Federal student financial aid
Government grants and loans for states and organizations
Help with home repairs and modifications

Although most granting opportunities are intended for organizations, citizens who need to use specific financial help can benefit from resources and tools intended for special purposes:

Emergency Communication Grants
Fish and Wildlife Service Grants
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) Grants
Loans and Grants Search Tool business
Home Repair and Modification Grants

Additionally, veterans, people with disabilities, senior citizens, Native Americans and rural residents can benefit from grants that are designated to manage issues specifically related to their demographic.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
