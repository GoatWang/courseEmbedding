NEW YORK, Sept. 18, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Recyclebank, the company that inspires and rewards smarter, everyday choices for a more sustainable future, today announced that Katherine Butkevich has been appointed Chief Financial Officer, effective immediately. Butkevich is responsible for leading operational and financial management including strategic planning, forecasting, partner analysis and negotiations.  In this role, Butkevich reports directly to Recyclebank Chief Executive Officer Javier Flaim.
"Katherine's background in financial management and wealth of in-depth financial knowledge combined with her proven abilities as a strategic business leader has already made her a tremendous asset to the executive leadership team at Recyclebank," said Flaim. "With Recyclebank's mission in mind, I am confident Katherine will bring tremendous value to our strategic initiatives, our customers and our partners."
Butkevich's hire follows the celebration of Recyclebank's ten-year anniversary as well as contract renewals in successful Recyclebank communities and commitments from new cities. This includes the renewal of Recyclebank's first municipal partner, Philadelphia. Currently, Recyclebank has more than 4 million members in 300 communities across the United States.  As an essential member of Recyclebank's executive leadership team, Butkevich will drive the company's short-term and long-term strategic, financial objectives while ensuring Recyclebank's commitment to its partners and the communities it serves. 
"I was instantly drawn to Recyclebank after meeting the leadership team. The entire company is fiercely intelligent and driven by a true passion for encouraging and rewarding sustainable actions," said Butkevich. "I look forward to bringing value to Recyclebank and to all of its various partners - individuals, businesses and communities. With key objectives in place, I look forward to helping move Recyclebank forward in a manner that keeps with its mission and will continue to show leadership for years to come."
Butkevich comes to Recyclebank with three decades of experience working with both large international organizations, as well as a number of lower middle market consumer product companies.  Most recently, Butkevich served as CFO of the National Association of Professional Women (NAPW).  In this role, Butkevich was instrumental in the development and execution of the company's strategic growth plan, positioning it for its recent sale to the Professional Diversity Network.  Before her time at the NAPW, Butkevich held leadership positions at the private equity firm Emigrant Capital and certain of its portfolio companies, GE Capital, North Fork Bancorp and KPMG.
About Recyclebank Recyclebank inspires and rewards smarter, everyday choices for a more sustainable future. It brings together people, businesses and communities to achieve real world impact. By participating in household recycling and learning how to live more sustainable lifestyles, more than 4 million members are part of the Recyclebank community.

 CHICAGO, April 04, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Professional Diversity Network, Inc. ("PDN" or "the Company") (NASDAQ:IPDN), a developer and operator of online networks that provide access to employment opportunities for diverse professionals in the United States, announced the following.  Company Announcements:  Ms. Katherine Butkevich, who has been leading the Company's National Association of Professional Women ("NAPW") since January 4, 2016, has been appointed Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective March 30, 2016. The Company's Chief Executive Officer, Jim Kirsch, has transitioned to Executive Chairman with direct management responsibility for PDN's recruitment assets, effective March 30, 2016; Mr. Jorge Perez, SVP of Professional Diversity Network and prior manager of PDN's recruitment assets left the Company as of March 31, 2016. The Company has entered into a new $5 million credit facility with White Winston Select Asset Funds, LLC, a private equity fund, to provide additional working capital if needed.  "Networking is proven beneficial to business and career advancement as well as personal growth," said Ms. Butkevich.  "It provides an opportunity to build and nurture relationships with new contacts, opens doors to new business and career opportunities, raises a woman's professional profile in the community and helps them stay abreast of the latest trends in their field.  I am proud to lead an organization whose primary focus is to provide women a place where they can build lasting relationships with like-minded professionals to advance their careers." Returning to NAPW and looking ahead for the Company as a whole, Ms. Butkevich noted, "I am thrilled to return to NAPW and the opportunity to lead the execution of the Company's growth and cash flow optimization strategy. Thanks to the capital to be provided by our new business partner, White Winston, we will have the resources needed to implement those strategies and drive shareholder value."
