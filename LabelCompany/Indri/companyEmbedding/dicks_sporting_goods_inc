Expert Advice

The Right Golf Apparel Makes a Difference 
Your golf apparel should help you look and play your best. At DICK’S Sporting Goods, you can find both traditional golf style and new, sport-inspired looks. Remember, golf clothing should always be stretchable, breathable and lightweight. 
Technical fabric that wicks away sweat will keep you cool and comfortable through the back nine. Choose from a variety of golf pants, polos, jackets, skirts and shorts for the right look for the clubhouse. 
Golf Equipment:
The right set of golf clubs is often the difference between a fun day on the course and a frustrating afternoon outing. 
You can find both individual golf clubs and full sets designed for your specific handicap and playing characteristics. The latest clubs offer a host of innovative features and materials, not to mention adjustability settings that let you dial in your equipment for your game. 
Launch it off the tee with a breakthrough driver or get the directional control you need with a fairway wood. From hybrids to irons to putters for your short game, shop all golf clubs at DICK’S Sporting Goods to prep for your season. 
Golf Accessories:
Pack up with a new golf bag or hone in on your shot with rangefinders and other golf technology. Pick up accessories like golf gloves, hats towels—and so much more. 
Most golfers fit into three categories based on their ability level: low handicap, mid handicap and high handicap. Your handicap is your performance against the par on a course, usually in relation to a par 72 course. 

Low-Handicap Golfers should opt for a driver and at least one fairway wood, most likely the 3-wood. These players can benefit from lower irons in their bag.
Mid-Handicap Golfer might try a driver, a three-wood and a 5-wood for better control and consistency than harder-to-hit long irons. For irons, try a pitching wedge and irons 3 through 9.
High-Handicap Golfers may opt to play without the driver in their bag. Instead, try a 3-wood.

Expert club fitting is the difference-maker all golfers need on the links. Learn more about club fittings and adjustments at DICK’S Sporting Goods.

The new school year will be here before you know it — get a jump on your school shopping with DICK’S Back-to-School Sales 2017. Make sure your kids are ready with the latest trends from top brands and save big with back-to-school deals on backpacks, sports gear, school clothes and more. 
From the minute you step into the gym, your athletic footwear should work as hard as you do.
Athletic shoes provide athletes with the traction, cushion, stability and foot protection they need. Sport-specific footwear is designed for the unique mechanics of your game or activity—from the gridiron to the marathon course and everywhere in between. Think about the different gait and movement patterns required of long-distance runners and basketball players: Running shoes and basketball shoes are each optimized to support these specific types of movement.
Shop top collections of shoes from DICK'S Sporting Goods:

Cleats
Men's Athletic Shoes
Women's Athletic Shoes
Kids' Shoes

Find footwear you can count on at DICK'S from top brands, including Nike® footwear, asics®, adidas® shoes, New Balance® shoes and more. 

Expert Advice

Shop men's athletic shoes, women's athletic shoes, boys' athletic shoes and girls' athletic shoes.

 Most athletes should shop by sport when selecting their athletic footwear. This ensures correct levels of traction, feel and protection for your game. 
You can take on every mile in performance running shoes, crafted for a natural feel and flex in your gait. You can choose from neutral running shoes, motion control shoes, trail running shoes and much more. 
Cross-training shoes are more versatile than running shoes, though they're not as well suited for distance running. 
From the gridiron to the greens and the pitch, cleats provide traction and lockdown support on a variety of field surfaces. 
Don't forget about your post-game footwear needs. Slip into a pair of slide sandals for instant comfort in the locker room.
Toddler and kids' footwear is designed for budding athletes, providing the comfort and stability they need to learn and play.

For more, browse snow boots for winter and hiking boots and shoes from DICK'S Sporting Goods.

Bring Your Game Home: Hunting Equipment & Apparel 
You need the right gear to be deadly on the hunt. 
Turn to the hunting equipment and hunting apparel that experienced hunters trust. From guns and hunting knives to breakthrough hunting optics and hunting apparel, pack up right for the field. 
Stake out prey with treestands or blinds-be ready in any terrain with ladder stands, hang-on stands and hunting blinds that help cover you from all types of game. Step out in hunting boots that deliver sure-footed traction and warmth. 
Rule the course with paintball guns and airsoft guns. Keep your vehicle clean and new with camo seat covers. Field dress your game with hunting knives and multi-tools. From big game to varmint, find what you need from brands like Nikon®, Bear Archery® & Field & Stream®. 

Expert Advice

Find the Right Hunting Gear for You
Stalk down your prey with industry-leading archery equipment and shooting equipment. Skilled and novice archers get the right blend of strength and pin-point accuracy with precision-engineered compound bows and crossbows. Look for a light stock and a low-profile feel. 
Gain the advantage with rifle scopes, binoculars and rangefinders that deliver on any terrain. And find the hunting knife that's right for the job. Shop knives crafted for field dressing, machetes for slicing through vegetation and axes and saws that help you cut through any situation. 
Check out a high-quality assortment of guns, ammo, rifles and shotguns at your local DICK'S Sporting Goods store. Use the DICK'S store locator to find a location near you. 
Scent-blocking technology gives hunters the upper hand. This apparel technology prevents the growth of odor-causing microbes-so your game never knows you're coming. 
Hunting jackets, vests and thermal baselayers let you customize your level of warmth in the field. Always ensure your hunting gear is built with fabric that moves quietly as you're stalking game or positioning form the shot. Soft fabrics minimize sound and deliver all-day comfort and mobility. 
All-over camo prints keep you concealed, while blaze-orange keeps you visible to your fellow hunters. Breathable bibs and overalls provide protection-choose a pair with plenty of pockets for stashing away tools and essentials. 
Discover apparel for hunters of all stripes, including women's hunting apparel for her and kids' hunting clothes for youngsters. Shop all hunting equipment like realistic turkey decoys.

History
In 1948, at the age of 18, Dick Stack worked at an Army/Navy store in his hometown of Binghamton, New York, after World War II. At the owner’s request, "Dick" explored the idea of expanding the product line to include fishing and camping supplies, but the owner rejected Dick's suggestions, stating that Dick “would never make a good merchant.”
When Dick recounted his story later that day, his grandmother advised, “Dick, always follow your dreams,” and gave him $300 from her savings. He rented a storefront and opened the first Dick's as a small "bait & tackle" fishing supply store, on Court Street near Howard Avenue.[12]
In the mid-1950s, the store expanded into the market of general sports merchandise and by the early 1960s, he was able to build and open a new store on the corner of Oliver and Court St., naming it "Dick's Sporting Goods". The store prospered, and Dick eventually opened a second store in Vestal, New York. In the 1970s, the Binghamton store moved next door to an even larger facility. Dick Stack headed the organization until his retirement in 1984.
Dick Stack's son, Edward "Eddie" Stack, succeeded him in the leadership of the company, expanding the two-store business rapidly. Edward W. Stack has served as chairman and chief executive officer of Dick's Sporting Goods since 1984, having started with the company full-time in 1977, and gradually working his way up in a variety of positions, including store clerk, merchandise manager, store manager and president.
In the early 1990s, Dick's began chain operations, opening additional stores across Upstate New York.[13] In 1994, Dick's moved its headquarters from Binghamton, New York to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[14]
In January 2016, Dick's launched Team Sports HQ, a platform of services for youth sport leagues. Services offered include software for online registration and team/league websites; custom uniforms and FanWear; and access to donations and sponsorships.[15]
Corporate
The company used the e-tailing Web site dickssportinggoods.com, operated by GSI Commerce under license and e-commerce agreements. Because the e-commerce site was operated under a company separate from Dick's Sporting Goods, the site often carried a wider selection than what is available in the stores with prices occasionally varying.[16] Starting in 2013, the company began using a ship-from-store platform for online orders. This means that the company has a detailed inventory for every store, and pulls new and used inventory from a local store to fulfill online orders to reduce shipping costs. As of March 2009, customers may return items purchased from the Web site.[17]
Sponsorship
The company sponsors a number of sporting events, including:

Sponsor of the USA Team at 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro
Basketball — Dick's Sporting Goods High School National Tournament
Football — Dick's Sporting Goods ESPN Kickoff Week
Soccer — Dick's Sporting Goods Park
Golf — Dick's Sporting Goods Open
Running — Dick's Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon

Professional sports teams sponsored by Dick's include the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins and Colorado Avalanche, and the Colorado Rapids of the MLS.
Dick's has also sponsored SportsMatter.com, a crowdfunding site to help support underfunded youth sports leagues.[18]
Lawsuits and legal proceedings

In July 1971, Dick's was told of infringing a patent owned by Furnace Brook, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Northern District of Illinois.[19]
On March 31, 2005, the company restated the first three fiscal quarters of 2004 as well as full-year figures due to adjustments to its accounting for leases and tenant or construction allowances.[20]
In August 2006, Dick's was accused of infringing two patents owned by Cushion Technologies, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of Texas.[21] In April 2007, Dick's settled with the plaintiff and the lawsuit was dismissed.
In June 2009, Dick's was accused of infringing a patent owned by The Donkey Company, Inc., in a lawsuit filed in District Court for the District of New Jersey.[22]
In 2014, Dick's began a lawsuit against Modell's Sporting Goods CEO, Mitchell Modell (who featured on an episode of Undercover Boss in 2012), for going undercover into their stores to gain access to their retail secrets.[23][24]

Acquisitions and expansion




Map of Dick's store locations as of 2015.


Dick's Sporting Goods opened in Florida and California in 1997. Seven years later, the chain acquired the entirety of Galyan's, an Indiana-based sporting chain. They also acquired Golf Galaxy and Chick's in 2007.
Plans were announced in 2010 to open its first store in Washington state (Puyallup) "with six more locations [in Oregon] 'coming soon.'"[25] Oklahoma (Broken Arrow)[26] and Idaho (Pocatello) followed in 2011,[27] then New Mexico (Albuquerque) in 2012.[28]
On August 16, 2013, Dick's Sporting Goods opened its first Field & Stream Shop in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania at the site of the former Dick's location in Cranberry (Dick's had moved to a newer location nearby in 2012), operating as a competitor to Cabela's.[29] Willie Robertson of the reality television series Duck Dynasty made a speaking appearance at a wedding at the store, with both participants dressed in camouflage,[30] as well as retired WWE wrestler Shawn Michaels (currently hosting MacMillan River Adventures on the Outdoor Channel) appearing at the store to sign autographs for the grand opening.[31] Later in the month, the store began selling AR-15 semi-automatic rifles,[32] ending the chain's 2012 self-imposed suspension of sales of certain semi-automatic firearms following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[33] Dick's has plans to open at least two more Field & Stream Shop locations in Erie, Pennsylvania (on the site of a proposed Cabela's store that Dick's had purchased before Cabela's had a chance to buy it) and Crescent Springs, Kentucky.[29] Dick's had bought the retail-related intellectual property rights to the Field & Stream name from the magazine's owner Bonnier Corporation in 2012 after having licensed the name for several years before. Bonnier remains owner of the magazine.[29]
On June 30, 2016, Dick's Sporting Goods purchased the intellectual property of now-defunct Sports Authority in an auction. The sale was approved on July 21, 2016.
In August 2016, Dick's purchased San Diego-based Affinity Sports, a sports management technology company. Affinity will expand the scope of the Team Sports HQ platform by offering management technology for large-scale sports organizations and national governing bodies.[15]

History
In 1948, at the age of 18, Dick Stack worked at an Army/Navy store in his hometown of Binghamton, New York, after World War II. At the owner’s request, "Dick" explored the idea of expanding the product line to include fishing and camping supplies, but the owner rejected Dick's suggestions, stating that Dick “would never make a good merchant.”
When Dick recounted his story later that day, his grandmother advised, “Dick, always follow your dreams,” and gave him $300 from her savings. He rented a storefront and opened the first Dick's as a small "bait & tackle" fishing supply store, on Court Street near Howard Avenue.[12]
In the mid-1950s, the store expanded into the market of general sports merchandise and by the early 1960s, he was able to build and open a new store on the corner of Oliver and Court St., naming it "Dick's Sporting Goods". The store prospered, and Dick eventually opened a second store in Vestal, New York. In the 1970s, the Binghamton store moved next door to an even larger facility. Dick Stack headed the organization until his retirement in 1984.
Dick Stack's son, Edward "Eddie" Stack, succeeded him in the leadership of the company, expanding the two-store business rapidly. Edward W. Stack has served as chairman and chief executive officer of Dick's Sporting Goods since 1984, having started with the company full-time in 1977, and gradually working his way up in a variety of positions, including store clerk, merchandise manager, store manager and president.
In the early 1990s, Dick's began chain operations, opening additional stores across Upstate New York.[13] In 1994, Dick's moved its headquarters from Binghamton, New York to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[14]
In January 2016, Dick's launched Team Sports HQ, a platform of services for youth sport leagues. Services offered include software for online registration and team/league websites; custom uniforms and FanWear; and access to donations and sponsorships.[15]
Corporate
The company used the e-tailing Web site dickssportinggoods.com, operated by GSI Commerce under license and e-commerce agreements. Because the e-commerce site was operated under a company separate from Dick's Sporting Goods, the site often carried a wider selection than what is available in the stores with prices occasionally varying.[16] Starting in 2013, the company began using a ship-from-store platform for online orders. This means that the company has a detailed inventory for every store, and pulls new and used inventory from a local store to fulfill online orders to reduce shipping costs. As of March 2009, customers may return items purchased from the Web site.[17]
Sponsorship
The company sponsors a number of sporting events, including:

Sponsor of the USA Team at 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro
Basketball — Dick's Sporting Goods High School National Tournament
Football — Dick's Sporting Goods ESPN Kickoff Week
Soccer — Dick's Sporting Goods Park
Golf — Dick's Sporting Goods Open
Running — Dick's Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon

Professional sports teams sponsored by Dick's include the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins and Colorado Avalanche, and the Colorado Rapids of the MLS.
Dick's has also sponsored SportsMatter.com, a crowdfunding site to help support underfunded youth sports leagues.[18]
Lawsuits and legal proceedings

In July 1971, Dick's was told of infringing a patent owned by Furnace Brook, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Northern District of Illinois.[19]
On March 31, 2005, the company restated the first three fiscal quarters of 2004 as well as full-year figures due to adjustments to its accounting for leases and tenant or construction allowances.[20]
In August 2006, Dick's was accused of infringing two patents owned by Cushion Technologies, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of Texas.[21] In April 2007, Dick's settled with the plaintiff and the lawsuit was dismissed.
In June 2009, Dick's was accused of infringing a patent owned by The Donkey Company, Inc., in a lawsuit filed in District Court for the District of New Jersey.[22]
In 2014, Dick's began a lawsuit against Modell's Sporting Goods CEO, Mitchell Modell (who featured on an episode of Undercover Boss in 2012), for going undercover into their stores to gain access to their retail secrets.[23][24]

Acquisitions and expansion




Map of Dick's store locations as of 2015.


Dick's Sporting Goods opened in Florida and California in 1997. Seven years later, the chain acquired the entirety of Galyan's, an Indiana-based sporting chain. They also acquired Golf Galaxy and Chick's in 2007.
Plans were announced in 2010 to open its first store in Washington state (Puyallup) "with six more locations [in Oregon] 'coming soon.'"[25] Oklahoma (Broken Arrow)[26] and Idaho (Pocatello) followed in 2011,[27] then New Mexico (Albuquerque) in 2012.[28]
On August 16, 2013, Dick's Sporting Goods opened its first Field & Stream Shop in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania at the site of the former Dick's location in Cranberry (Dick's had moved to a newer location nearby in 2012), operating as a competitor to Cabela's.[29] Willie Robertson of the reality television series Duck Dynasty made a speaking appearance at a wedding at the store, with both participants dressed in camouflage,[30] as well as retired WWE wrestler Shawn Michaels (currently hosting MacMillan River Adventures on the Outdoor Channel) appearing at the store to sign autographs for the grand opening.[31] Later in the month, the store began selling AR-15 semi-automatic rifles,[32] ending the chain's 2012 self-imposed suspension of sales of certain semi-automatic firearms following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[33] Dick's has plans to open at least two more Field & Stream Shop locations in Erie, Pennsylvania (on the site of a proposed Cabela's store that Dick's had purchased before Cabela's had a chance to buy it) and Crescent Springs, Kentucky.[29] Dick's had bought the retail-related intellectual property rights to the Field & Stream name from the magazine's owner Bonnier Corporation in 2012 after having licensed the name for several years before. Bonnier remains owner of the magazine.[29]
On June 30, 2016, Dick's Sporting Goods purchased the intellectual property of now-defunct Sports Authority in an auction. The sale was approved on July 21, 2016.
In August 2016, Dick's purchased San Diego-based Affinity Sports, a sports management technology company. Affinity will expand the scope of the Team Sports HQ platform by offering management technology for large-scale sports organizations and national governing bodies.[15]

History
In 1948, at the age of 18, Dick Stack worked at an Army/Navy store in his hometown of Binghamton, New York, after World War II. At the owner’s request, "Dick" explored the idea of expanding the product line to include fishing and camping supplies, but the owner rejected Dick's suggestions, stating that Dick “would never make a good merchant.”
When Dick recounted his story later that day, his grandmother advised, “Dick, always follow your dreams,” and gave him $300 from her savings. He rented a storefront and opened the first Dick's as a small "bait & tackle" fishing supply store, on Court Street near Howard Avenue.[12]
In the mid-1950s, the store expanded into the market of general sports merchandise and by the early 1960s, he was able to build and open a new store on the corner of Oliver and Court St., naming it "Dick's Sporting Goods". The store prospered, and Dick eventually opened a second store in Vestal, New York. In the 1970s, the Binghamton store moved next door to an even larger facility. Dick Stack headed the organization until his retirement in 1984.
Dick Stack's son, Edward "Eddie" Stack, succeeded him in the leadership of the company, expanding the two-store business rapidly. Edward W. Stack has served as chairman and chief executive officer of Dick's Sporting Goods since 1984, having started with the company full-time in 1977, and gradually working his way up in a variety of positions, including store clerk, merchandise manager, store manager and president.
In the early 1990s, Dick's began chain operations, opening additional stores across Upstate New York.[13] In 1994, Dick's moved its headquarters from Binghamton, New York to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[14]
In January 2016, Dick's launched Team Sports HQ, a platform of services for youth sport leagues. Services offered include software for online registration and team/league websites; custom uniforms and FanWear; and access to donations and sponsorships.[15]
Corporate
The company used the e-tailing Web site dickssportinggoods.com, operated by GSI Commerce under license and e-commerce agreements. Because the e-commerce site was operated under a company separate from Dick's Sporting Goods, the site often carried a wider selection than what is available in the stores with prices occasionally varying.[16] Starting in 2013, the company began using a ship-from-store platform for online orders. This means that the company has a detailed inventory for every store, and pulls new and used inventory from a local store to fulfill online orders to reduce shipping costs. As of March 2009, customers may return items purchased from the Web site.[17]
Sponsorship
The company sponsors a number of sporting events, including:

Sponsor of the USA Team at 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro
Basketball — Dick's Sporting Goods High School National Tournament
Football — Dick's Sporting Goods ESPN Kickoff Week
Soccer — Dick's Sporting Goods Park
Golf — Dick's Sporting Goods Open
Running — Dick's Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon

Professional sports teams sponsored by Dick's include the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins and Colorado Avalanche, and the Colorado Rapids of the MLS.
Dick's has also sponsored SportsMatter.com, a crowdfunding site to help support underfunded youth sports leagues.[18]
Lawsuits and legal proceedings

In July 1971, Dick's was told of infringing a patent owned by Furnace Brook, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Northern District of Illinois.[19]
On March 31, 2005, the company restated the first three fiscal quarters of 2004 as well as full-year figures due to adjustments to its accounting for leases and tenant or construction allowances.[20]
In August 2006, Dick's was accused of infringing two patents owned by Cushion Technologies, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of Texas.[21] In April 2007, Dick's settled with the plaintiff and the lawsuit was dismissed.
In June 2009, Dick's was accused of infringing a patent owned by The Donkey Company, Inc., in a lawsuit filed in District Court for the District of New Jersey.[22]
In 2014, Dick's began a lawsuit against Modell's Sporting Goods CEO, Mitchell Modell (who featured on an episode of Undercover Boss in 2012), for going undercover into their stores to gain access to their retail secrets.[23][24]

Acquisitions and expansion




Map of Dick's store locations as of 2015.


Dick's Sporting Goods opened in Florida and California in 1997. Seven years later, the chain acquired the entirety of Galyan's, an Indiana-based sporting chain. They also acquired Golf Galaxy and Chick's in 2007.
Plans were announced in 2010 to open its first store in Washington state (Puyallup) "with six more locations [in Oregon] 'coming soon.'"[25] Oklahoma (Broken Arrow)[26] and Idaho (Pocatello) followed in 2011,[27] then New Mexico (Albuquerque) in 2012.[28]
On August 16, 2013, Dick's Sporting Goods opened its first Field & Stream Shop in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania at the site of the former Dick's location in Cranberry (Dick's had moved to a newer location nearby in 2012), operating as a competitor to Cabela's.[29] Willie Robertson of the reality television series Duck Dynasty made a speaking appearance at a wedding at the store, with both participants dressed in camouflage,[30] as well as retired WWE wrestler Shawn Michaels (currently hosting MacMillan River Adventures on the Outdoor Channel) appearing at the store to sign autographs for the grand opening.[31] Later in the month, the store began selling AR-15 semi-automatic rifles,[32] ending the chain's 2012 self-imposed suspension of sales of certain semi-automatic firearms following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[33] Dick's has plans to open at least two more Field & Stream Shop locations in Erie, Pennsylvania (on the site of a proposed Cabela's store that Dick's had purchased before Cabela's had a chance to buy it) and Crescent Springs, Kentucky.[29] Dick's had bought the retail-related intellectual property rights to the Field & Stream name from the magazine's owner Bonnier Corporation in 2012 after having licensed the name for several years before. Bonnier remains owner of the magazine.[29]
On June 30, 2016, Dick's Sporting Goods purchased the intellectual property of now-defunct Sports Authority in an auction. The sale was approved on July 21, 2016.
In August 2016, Dick's purchased San Diego-based Affinity Sports, a sports management technology company. Affinity will expand the scope of the Team Sports HQ platform by offering management technology for large-scale sports organizations and national governing bodies.[15]

History
In 1948, at the age of 18, Dick Stack worked at an Army/Navy store in his hometown of Binghamton, New York, after World War II. At the owner’s request, "Dick" explored the idea of expanding the product line to include fishing and camping supplies, but the owner rejected Dick's suggestions, stating that Dick “would never make a good merchant.”
When Dick recounted his story later that day, his grandmother advised, “Dick, always follow your dreams,” and gave him $300 from her savings. He rented a storefront and opened the first Dick's as a small "bait & tackle" fishing supply store, on Court Street near Howard Avenue.[12]
In the mid-1950s, the store expanded into the market of general sports merchandise and by the early 1960s, he was able to build and open a new store on the corner of Oliver and Court St., naming it "Dick's Sporting Goods". The store prospered, and Dick eventually opened a second store in Vestal, New York. In the 1970s, the Binghamton store moved next door to an even larger facility. Dick Stack headed the organization until his retirement in 1984.
Dick Stack's son, Edward "Eddie" Stack, succeeded him in the leadership of the company, expanding the two-store business rapidly. Edward W. Stack has served as chairman and chief executive officer of Dick's Sporting Goods since 1984, having started with the company full-time in 1977, and gradually working his way up in a variety of positions, including store clerk, merchandise manager, store manager and president.
In the early 1990s, Dick's began chain operations, opening additional stores across Upstate New York.[13] In 1994, Dick's moved its headquarters from Binghamton, New York to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[14]
In January 2016, Dick's launched Team Sports HQ, a platform of services for youth sport leagues. Services offered include software for online registration and team/league websites; custom uniforms and FanWear; and access to donations and sponsorships.[15]
Corporate
The company used the e-tailing Web site dickssportinggoods.com, operated by GSI Commerce under license and e-commerce agreements. Because the e-commerce site was operated under a company separate from Dick's Sporting Goods, the site often carried a wider selection than what is available in the stores with prices occasionally varying.[16] Starting in 2013, the company began using a ship-from-store platform for online orders. This means that the company has a detailed inventory for every store, and pulls new and used inventory from a local store to fulfill online orders to reduce shipping costs. As of March 2009, customers may return items purchased from the Web site.[17]
Sponsorship
The company sponsors a number of sporting events, including:

Sponsor of the USA Team at 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro
Basketball — Dick's Sporting Goods High School National Tournament
Football — Dick's Sporting Goods ESPN Kickoff Week
Soccer — Dick's Sporting Goods Park
Golf — Dick's Sporting Goods Open
Running — Dick's Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon

Professional sports teams sponsored by Dick's include the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins and Colorado Avalanche, and the Colorado Rapids of the MLS.
Dick's has also sponsored SportsMatter.com, a crowdfunding site to help support underfunded youth sports leagues.[18]
Lawsuits and legal proceedings

In July 1971, Dick's was told of infringing a patent owned by Furnace Brook, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Northern District of Illinois.[19]
On March 31, 2005, the company restated the first three fiscal quarters of 2004 as well as full-year figures due to adjustments to its accounting for leases and tenant or construction allowances.[20]
In August 2006, Dick's was accused of infringing two patents owned by Cushion Technologies, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of Texas.[21] In April 2007, Dick's settled with the plaintiff and the lawsuit was dismissed.
In June 2009, Dick's was accused of infringing a patent owned by The Donkey Company, Inc., in a lawsuit filed in District Court for the District of New Jersey.[22]
In 2014, Dick's began a lawsuit against Modell's Sporting Goods CEO, Mitchell Modell (who featured on an episode of Undercover Boss in 2012), for going undercover into their stores to gain access to their retail secrets.[23][24]

Acquisitions and expansion




Map of Dick's store locations as of 2015.


Dick's Sporting Goods opened in Florida and California in 1997. Seven years later, the chain acquired the entirety of Galyan's, an Indiana-based sporting chain. They also acquired Golf Galaxy and Chick's in 2007.
Plans were announced in 2010 to open its first store in Washington state (Puyallup) "with six more locations [in Oregon] 'coming soon.'"[25] Oklahoma (Broken Arrow)[26] and Idaho (Pocatello) followed in 2011,[27] then New Mexico (Albuquerque) in 2012.[28]
On August 16, 2013, Dick's Sporting Goods opened its first Field & Stream Shop in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania at the site of the former Dick's location in Cranberry (Dick's had moved to a newer location nearby in 2012), operating as a competitor to Cabela's.[29] Willie Robertson of the reality television series Duck Dynasty made a speaking appearance at a wedding at the store, with both participants dressed in camouflage,[30] as well as retired WWE wrestler Shawn Michaels (currently hosting MacMillan River Adventures on the Outdoor Channel) appearing at the store to sign autographs for the grand opening.[31] Later in the month, the store began selling AR-15 semi-automatic rifles,[32] ending the chain's 2012 self-imposed suspension of sales of certain semi-automatic firearms following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[33] Dick's has plans to open at least two more Field & Stream Shop locations in Erie, Pennsylvania (on the site of a proposed Cabela's store that Dick's had purchased before Cabela's had a chance to buy it) and Crescent Springs, Kentucky.[29] Dick's had bought the retail-related intellectual property rights to the Field & Stream name from the magazine's owner Bonnier Corporation in 2012 after having licensed the name for several years before. Bonnier remains owner of the magazine.[29]
On June 30, 2016, Dick's Sporting Goods purchased the intellectual property of now-defunct Sports Authority in an auction. The sale was approved on July 21, 2016.
In August 2016, Dick's purchased San Diego-based Affinity Sports, a sports management technology company. Affinity will expand the scope of the Team Sports HQ platform by offering management technology for large-scale sports organizations and national governing bodies.[15]

History
In 1948, at the age of 18, Dick Stack worked at an Army/Navy store in his hometown of Binghamton, New York, after World War II. At the owner’s request, "Dick" explored the idea of expanding the product line to include fishing and camping supplies, but the owner rejected Dick's suggestions, stating that Dick “would never make a good merchant.”
When Dick recounted his story later that day, his grandmother advised, “Dick, always follow your dreams,” and gave him $300 from her savings. He rented a storefront and opened the first Dick's as a small "bait & tackle" fishing supply store, on Court Street near Howard Avenue.[12]
In the mid-1950s, the store expanded into the market of general sports merchandise and by the early 1960s, he was able to build and open a new store on the corner of Oliver and Court St., naming it "Dick's Sporting Goods". The store prospered, and Dick eventually opened a second store in Vestal, New York. In the 1970s, the Binghamton store moved next door to an even larger facility. Dick Stack headed the organization until his retirement in 1984.
Dick Stack's son, Edward "Eddie" Stack, succeeded him in the leadership of the company, expanding the two-store business rapidly. Edward W. Stack has served as chairman and chief executive officer of Dick's Sporting Goods since 1984, having started with the company full-time in 1977, and gradually working his way up in a variety of positions, including store clerk, merchandise manager, store manager and president.
In the early 1990s, Dick's began chain operations, opening additional stores across Upstate New York.[13] In 1994, Dick's moved its headquarters from Binghamton, New York to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[14]
In January 2016, Dick's launched Team Sports HQ, a platform of services for youth sport leagues. Services offered include software for online registration and team/league websites; custom uniforms and FanWear; and access to donations and sponsorships.[15]
Corporate
The company used the e-tailing Web site dickssportinggoods.com, operated by GSI Commerce under license and e-commerce agreements. Because the e-commerce site was operated under a company separate from Dick's Sporting Goods, the site often carried a wider selection than what is available in the stores with prices occasionally varying.[16] Starting in 2013, the company began using a ship-from-store platform for online orders. This means that the company has a detailed inventory for every store, and pulls new and used inventory from a local store to fulfill online orders to reduce shipping costs. As of March 2009, customers may return items purchased from the Web site.[17]
Sponsorship
The company sponsors a number of sporting events, including:

Sponsor of the USA Team at 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro
Basketball — Dick's Sporting Goods High School National Tournament
Football — Dick's Sporting Goods ESPN Kickoff Week
Soccer — Dick's Sporting Goods Park
Golf — Dick's Sporting Goods Open
Running — Dick's Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon

Professional sports teams sponsored by Dick's include the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins and Colorado Avalanche, and the Colorado Rapids of the MLS.
Dick's has also sponsored SportsMatter.com, a crowdfunding site to help support underfunded youth sports leagues.[18]
Lawsuits and legal proceedings

In July 1971, Dick's was told of infringing a patent owned by Furnace Brook, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Northern District of Illinois.[19]
On March 31, 2005, the company restated the first three fiscal quarters of 2004 as well as full-year figures due to adjustments to its accounting for leases and tenant or construction allowances.[20]
In August 2006, Dick's was accused of infringing two patents owned by Cushion Technologies, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of Texas.[21] In April 2007, Dick's settled with the plaintiff and the lawsuit was dismissed.
In June 2009, Dick's was accused of infringing a patent owned by The Donkey Company, Inc., in a lawsuit filed in District Court for the District of New Jersey.[22]
In 2014, Dick's began a lawsuit against Modell's Sporting Goods CEO, Mitchell Modell (who featured on an episode of Undercover Boss in 2012), for going undercover into their stores to gain access to their retail secrets.[23][24]

Acquisitions and expansion




Map of Dick's store locations as of 2015.


Dick's Sporting Goods opened in Florida and California in 1997. Seven years later, the chain acquired the entirety of Galyan's, an Indiana-based sporting chain. They also acquired Golf Galaxy and Chick's in 2007.
Plans were announced in 2010 to open its first store in Washington state (Puyallup) "with six more locations [in Oregon] 'coming soon.'"[25] Oklahoma (Broken Arrow)[26] and Idaho (Pocatello) followed in 2011,[27] then New Mexico (Albuquerque) in 2012.[28]
On August 16, 2013, Dick's Sporting Goods opened its first Field & Stream Shop in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania at the site of the former Dick's location in Cranberry (Dick's had moved to a newer location nearby in 2012), operating as a competitor to Cabela's.[29] Willie Robertson of the reality television series Duck Dynasty made a speaking appearance at a wedding at the store, with both participants dressed in camouflage,[30] as well as retired WWE wrestler Shawn Michaels (currently hosting MacMillan River Adventures on the Outdoor Channel) appearing at the store to sign autographs for the grand opening.[31] Later in the month, the store began selling AR-15 semi-automatic rifles,[32] ending the chain's 2012 self-imposed suspension of sales of certain semi-automatic firearms following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[33] Dick's has plans to open at least two more Field & Stream Shop locations in Erie, Pennsylvania (on the site of a proposed Cabela's store that Dick's had purchased before Cabela's had a chance to buy it) and Crescent Springs, Kentucky.[29] Dick's had bought the retail-related intellectual property rights to the Field & Stream name from the magazine's owner Bonnier Corporation in 2012 after having licensed the name for several years before. Bonnier remains owner of the magazine.[29]
On June 30, 2016, Dick's Sporting Goods purchased the intellectual property of now-defunct Sports Authority in an auction. The sale was approved on July 21, 2016.
In August 2016, Dick's purchased San Diego-based Affinity Sports, a sports management technology company. Affinity will expand the scope of the Team Sports HQ platform by offering management technology for large-scale sports organizations and national governing bodies.[15]

History
In 1948, at the age of 18, Dick Stack worked at an Army/Navy store in his hometown of Binghamton, New York, after World War II. At the owner’s request, "Dick" explored the idea of expanding the product line to include fishing and camping supplies, but the owner rejected Dick's suggestions, stating that Dick “would never make a good merchant.”
When Dick recounted his story later that day, his grandmother advised, “Dick, always follow your dreams,” and gave him $300 from her savings. He rented a storefront and opened the first Dick's as a small "bait & tackle" fishing supply store, on Court Street near Howard Avenue.[12]
In the mid-1950s, the store expanded into the market of general sports merchandise and by the early 1960s, he was able to build and open a new store on the corner of Oliver and Court St., naming it "Dick's Sporting Goods". The store prospered, and Dick eventually opened a second store in Vestal, New York. In the 1970s, the Binghamton store moved next door to an even larger facility. Dick Stack headed the organization until his retirement in 1984.
Dick Stack's son, Edward "Eddie" Stack, succeeded him in the leadership of the company, expanding the two-store business rapidly. Edward W. Stack has served as chairman and chief executive officer of Dick's Sporting Goods since 1984, having started with the company full-time in 1977, and gradually working his way up in a variety of positions, including store clerk, merchandise manager, store manager and president.
In the early 1990s, Dick's began chain operations, opening additional stores across Upstate New York.[13] In 1994, Dick's moved its headquarters from Binghamton, New York to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[14]
In January 2016, Dick's launched Team Sports HQ, a platform of services for youth sport leagues. Services offered include software for online registration and team/league websites; custom uniforms and FanWear; and access to donations and sponsorships.[15]
Corporate
The company used the e-tailing Web site dickssportinggoods.com, operated by GSI Commerce under license and e-commerce agreements. Because the e-commerce site was operated under a company separate from Dick's Sporting Goods, the site often carried a wider selection than what is available in the stores with prices occasionally varying.[16] Starting in 2013, the company began using a ship-from-store platform for online orders. This means that the company has a detailed inventory for every store, and pulls new and used inventory from a local store to fulfill online orders to reduce shipping costs. As of March 2009, customers may return items purchased from the Web site.[17]
Sponsorship
The company sponsors a number of sporting events, including:

Sponsor of the USA Team at 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro
Basketball — Dick's Sporting Goods High School National Tournament
Football — Dick's Sporting Goods ESPN Kickoff Week
Soccer — Dick's Sporting Goods Park
Golf — Dick's Sporting Goods Open
Running — Dick's Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon

Professional sports teams sponsored by Dick's include the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins and Colorado Avalanche, and the Colorado Rapids of the MLS.
Dick's has also sponsored SportsMatter.com, a crowdfunding site to help support underfunded youth sports leagues.[18]
Lawsuits and legal proceedings

In July 1971, Dick's was told of infringing a patent owned by Furnace Brook, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Northern District of Illinois.[19]
On March 31, 2005, the company restated the first three fiscal quarters of 2004 as well as full-year figures due to adjustments to its accounting for leases and tenant or construction allowances.[20]
In August 2006, Dick's was accused of infringing two patents owned by Cushion Technologies, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of Texas.[21] In April 2007, Dick's settled with the plaintiff and the lawsuit was dismissed.
In June 2009, Dick's was accused of infringing a patent owned by The Donkey Company, Inc., in a lawsuit filed in District Court for the District of New Jersey.[22]
In 2014, Dick's began a lawsuit against Modell's Sporting Goods CEO, Mitchell Modell (who featured on an episode of Undercover Boss in 2012), for going undercover into their stores to gain access to their retail secrets.[23][24]

Acquisitions and expansion




Map of Dick's store locations as of 2015.


Dick's Sporting Goods opened in Florida and California in 1997. Seven years later, the chain acquired the entirety of Galyan's, an Indiana-based sporting chain. They also acquired Golf Galaxy and Chick's in 2007.
Plans were announced in 2010 to open its first store in Washington state (Puyallup) "with six more locations [in Oregon] 'coming soon.'"[25] Oklahoma (Broken Arrow)[26] and Idaho (Pocatello) followed in 2011,[27] then New Mexico (Albuquerque) in 2012.[28]
On August 16, 2013, Dick's Sporting Goods opened its first Field & Stream Shop in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania at the site of the former Dick's location in Cranberry (Dick's had moved to a newer location nearby in 2012), operating as a competitor to Cabela's.[29] Willie Robertson of the reality television series Duck Dynasty made a speaking appearance at a wedding at the store, with both participants dressed in camouflage,[30] as well as retired WWE wrestler Shawn Michaels (currently hosting MacMillan River Adventures on the Outdoor Channel) appearing at the store to sign autographs for the grand opening.[31] Later in the month, the store began selling AR-15 semi-automatic rifles,[32] ending the chain's 2012 self-imposed suspension of sales of certain semi-automatic firearms following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[33] Dick's has plans to open at least two more Field & Stream Shop locations in Erie, Pennsylvania (on the site of a proposed Cabela's store that Dick's had purchased before Cabela's had a chance to buy it) and Crescent Springs, Kentucky.[29] Dick's had bought the retail-related intellectual property rights to the Field & Stream name from the magazine's owner Bonnier Corporation in 2012 after having licensed the name for several years before. Bonnier remains owner of the magazine.[29]
On June 30, 2016, Dick's Sporting Goods purchased the intellectual property of now-defunct Sports Authority in an auction. The sale was approved on July 21, 2016.
In August 2016, Dick's purchased San Diego-based Affinity Sports, a sports management technology company. Affinity will expand the scope of the Team Sports HQ platform by offering management technology for large-scale sports organizations and national governing bodies.[15]

About Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc.

   See Dick's shoppers run, putt, dunk, dribble -- and buy. Dick's Sporting Goods operates more than 740 stores in 45-plus US states. The stores usually contain five smaller shops ("stores within a store") that feature sporting goods, apparel, and footwear for leisure pursuits ranging from football, golf, and cycling to hunting and camping. In addition to brands including NIKE and adidas, Dick's carries Ativa, Walter Hagen, Top-Flite, and others exclusive to the firm. The company also operates about 75 Golf Galaxy stores in 30 states as well as 20 Field & Stream stores in 10 states, as well as True Runner and Chelsea Collective specialty stores.
   Operations

   The company operates 741 stores which include 644 Dick's Sporting Goods and 97 Specialty Stores.
  

   Its products include hard lines -- 45% (which includes sporting goods equipment, fitness equipment, golf equipment and hunting and fishing gear), apparel, 35%; footwear 19%; and other 1% (which includes non-merchandise sales categories, including in-store services and shipping revenues).
  
Geographic Reach

   Dick's has a presence in more than 45 US states and maintains distribution centers in Georgia, Indiana, Arizona, and Pennsylvania.
  

   The company's top five states in terms of stores are California, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, which together accounted for about 30% of the total stores in fiscal year 2016.
  
Sales and Marketing

   Dick's sells its products through retail stores -- its primary sales channel -- and e-commerce sites.
  

   The company markets its products through traditional channels, such as newspaper and direct mail pieces. It has developed brand-building marketing campaigns focused on building customer relationship to the Dick's Sporting Goods brand and shifted its advertising mix to include more digital marketing. It continues to optimize its media mix by shifting to marketing channels and by leveraging its expanding customer relationship marketing database from its ScoreCard loyalty program.
  

   The retailer spent $276 million on advertising in fiscal 2016, up from $249 million and $224 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
  

   In fiscal 2016 Nike and Under Armour, its largest vendors, accounted for 20% and 12% of merchandise sales, respectively.
  
Financial Performance

   The company's has seen strong revenue growth over the last five years.
  

   In fiscal 2016 (ended January), net revenues increased by 7% due to a rise in non-comparable sales as a result of new stores sales, partially offset by a decrease in consolidated same store sales. A 19% increase in eCommerce sales also contributed to the growth.
  

   Dick's' net income decreased by 4% due to increased selling, general, and administrative expense and pre-opening expenses. SG&A Expenses rose by 7% mainly due to charges (such as litigation settlement charge asset impairment and severance charges related to the company's golf restructuring), and pre-opening expenses related to self-developed store sites.
  

   Operating cash flows increased by 6% due to higher cash provided by deferred construction allowances primarily as a result of the timing and increase in the number of self-developed stores where tenant allowances are provided by landlords.
  
Strategy

   Believing that the sporting goods retailing market can bear at least 1,100 Dick's locations nationwide, the company has been focused on expanding its retail footprint east of the Mississippi River in Atlanta, Chicago, and the corridor between New York and Washington, DC.
  

   The company is focusing on increasing its omni-channel service so that its customers are able to shop online or in-store easily. Its omni-channel strategy includes the planned transition to an internal eCommerce platform, and the www.DICKS.com eCommerce business is planned to be launched on the internal eCommerce platform in 2017.
  

   Opening stores in new and existing markets is a part of its business strategy. In fiscal 2016, Dick's opened nine new Field & Stream stores, a specialized outdoor concept. In fiscal 2017, the company plans to open nine additional Field & Stream locations. It then expects to open 36 new Dick's Sporting Goods stores and relocate nine Dick's Sporting Goods stores in 2016. It also plans to open nine new Field & Stream stores and two new Golf Galaxy stores in 2016, largely adjacent to new or relocated Dick's Sporting Goods stores.
  

   The company also grows its exclusive private brand offerings through a combination of brands that it owns and brands that it licenses from third parties. The company invests in its development and procurement resources and marketing efforts relating to these private brand offerings and new retail concepts. In 2015, Dick's Sporting Goods and Ralph Lauren launched Polo Sport, a modern men's active wear line.
  
Company Background

   Dick's was founded in 1948 when Dick Stack, father of company chairman and CEO Edward Stack, opened a bait and tackle shop.

Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc., sometimes shortened to Dick's, is a Fortune 500 American sporting goods retailing corporation headquartered in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania in Greater Pittsburgh. [8][9]
Dick's has 610 stores in 47 states (no stores in Alaska, Hawaii, and Montana as of mid-March 2016[update]),[1] primarily in the Eastern United States. The company also owns Golf Galaxy, Inc., a golf specialty retailer, with 82 stores in 30 states. The company also operates specialty chains True Runner and Field & Stream.[10][11]
Founded in 1948 by Richard "Dick" Stack, the chain has expanded to become one of the largest sporting goods retailers in the world.

History
In 1948, at the age of 18, Dick Stack worked at an Army/Navy store in his hometown of Binghamton, New York, after World War II. At the owner’s request, "Dick" explored the idea of expanding the product line to include fishing and camping supplies, but the owner rejected Dick's suggestions, stating that Dick “would never make a good merchant.”
When Dick recounted his story later that day, his grandmother advised, “Dick, always follow your dreams,” and gave him $300 from her savings. He rented a storefront and opened the first Dick's as a small "bait & tackle" fishing supply store, on Court Street near Howard Avenue.[12]
In the mid-1950s, the store expanded into the market of general sports merchandise and by the early 1960s, he was able to build and open a new store on the corner of Oliver and Court St., naming it "Dick's Sporting Goods". The store prospered, and Dick eventually opened a second store in Vestal, New York. In the 1970s, the Binghamton store moved next door to an even larger facility. Dick Stack headed the organization until his retirement in 1984.
Dick Stack's son, Edward "Eddie" Stack, succeeded him in the leadership of the company, expanding the two-store business rapidly. Edward W. Stack has served as chairman and chief executive officer of Dick's Sporting Goods since 1984, having started with the company full-time in 1977, and gradually working his way up in a variety of positions, including store clerk, merchandise manager, store manager and president.
In the early 1990s, Dick's began chain operations, opening additional stores across Upstate New York.[13] In 1994, Dick's moved its headquarters from Binghamton, New York to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[14]
In January 2016, Dick's launched Team Sports HQ, a platform of services for youth sport leagues. Services offered include software for online registration and team/league websites; custom uniforms and FanWear; and access to donations and sponsorships.[15]
Corporate
The company used the e-tailing Web site dickssportinggoods.com, operated by GSI Commerce under license and e-commerce agreements. Because the e-commerce site was operated under a company separate from Dick's Sporting Goods, the site often carried a wider selection than what is available in the stores with prices occasionally varying.[16] Starting in 2013, the company began using a ship-from-store platform for online orders. This means that the company has a detailed inventory for every store, and pulls new and used inventory from a local store to fulfill online orders to reduce shipping costs. As of March 2009, customers may return items purchased from the Web site.[17]
Sponsorship
The company sponsors a number of sporting events, including:

Sponsor of the USA Team at 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro
Basketball — Dick's Sporting Goods High School National Tournament
Football — Dick's Sporting Goods ESPN Kickoff Week
Soccer — Dick's Sporting Goods Park
Golf — Dick's Sporting Goods Open
Running — Dick's Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon

Professional sports teams sponsored by Dick's include the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins and Colorado Avalanche, and the Colorado Rapids of the MLS.
Dick's has also sponsored SportsMatter.com, a crowdfunding site to help support underfunded youth sports leagues.[18]
Lawsuits and legal proceedings

In July 1971, Dick's was told of infringing a patent owned by Furnace Brook, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Northern District of Illinois.[19]
On March 31, 2005, the company restated the first three fiscal quarters of 2004 as well as full-year figures due to adjustments to its accounting for leases and tenant or construction allowances.[20]
In August 2006, Dick's was accused of infringing two patents owned by Cushion Technologies, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of Texas.[21] In April 2007, Dick's settled with the plaintiff and the lawsuit was dismissed.
In June 2009, Dick's was accused of infringing a patent owned by The Donkey Company, Inc., in a lawsuit filed in District Court for the District of New Jersey.[22]
In 2014, Dick's began a lawsuit against Modell's Sporting Goods CEO, Mitchell Modell (who featured on an episode of Undercover Boss in 2012), for going undercover into their stores to gain access to their retail secrets.[23][24]

Acquisitions and expansion




Map of Dick's store locations as of 2015.


Dick's Sporting Goods opened in Florida and California in 1997. Seven years later, the chain acquired the entirety of Galyan's, an Indiana-based sporting chain. They also acquired Golf Galaxy and Chick's in 2007.
Plans were announced in 2010 to open its first store in Washington state (Puyallup) "with six more locations [in Oregon] 'coming soon.'"[25] Oklahoma (Broken Arrow)[26] and Idaho (Pocatello) followed in 2011,[27] then New Mexico (Albuquerque) in 2012.[28]
On August 16, 2013, Dick's Sporting Goods opened its first Field & Stream Shop in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania at the site of the former Dick's location in Cranberry (Dick's had moved to a newer location nearby in 2012), operating as a competitor to Cabela's.[29] Willie Robertson of the reality television series Duck Dynasty made a speaking appearance at a wedding at the store, with both participants dressed in camouflage,[30] as well as retired WWE wrestler Shawn Michaels (currently hosting MacMillan River Adventures on the Outdoor Channel) appearing at the store to sign autographs for the grand opening.[31] Later in the month, the store began selling AR-15 semi-automatic rifles,[32] ending the chain's 2012 self-imposed suspension of sales of certain semi-automatic firearms following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[33] Dick's has plans to open at least two more Field & Stream Shop locations in Erie, Pennsylvania (on the site of a proposed Cabela's store that Dick's had purchased before Cabela's had a chance to buy it) and Crescent Springs, Kentucky.[29] Dick's had bought the retail-related intellectual property rights to the Field & Stream name from the magazine's owner Bonnier Corporation in 2012 after having licensed the name for several years before. Bonnier remains owner of the magazine.[29]
On June 30, 2016, Dick's Sporting Goods purchased the intellectual property of now-defunct Sports Authority in an auction. The sale was approved on July 21, 2016.
In August 2016, Dick's purchased San Diego-based Affinity Sports, a sports management technology company. Affinity will expand the scope of the Team Sports HQ platform by offering management technology for large-scale sports organizations and national governing bodies.[15]

Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc., sometimes shortened to Dick's, is a Fortune 500 American sporting goods retailing corporation headquartered in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania in Greater Pittsburgh. [8][9]
Dick's has 610 stores in 47 states (no stores in Alaska, Hawaii, and Montana as of mid-March 2016[update]),[1] primarily in the Eastern United States. The company also owns Golf Galaxy, Inc., a golf specialty retailer, with 82 stores in 30 states. The company also operates specialty chains True Runner and Field & Stream.[10][11]
Founded in 1948 by Richard "Dick" Stack, the chain has expanded to become one of the largest sporting goods retailers in the world.

History
In 1948, at the age of 18, Dick Stack worked at an Army/Navy store in his hometown of Binghamton, New York, after World War II. At the owner’s request, "Dick" explored the idea of expanding the product line to include fishing and camping supplies, but the owner rejected Dick's suggestions, stating that Dick “would never make a good merchant.”
When Dick recounted his story later that day, his grandmother advised, “Dick, always follow your dreams,” and gave him $300 from her savings. He rented a storefront and opened the first Dick's as a small "bait & tackle" fishing supply store, on Court Street near Howard Avenue.[12]
In the mid-1950s, the store expanded into the market of general sports merchandise and by the early 1960s, he was able to build and open a new store on the corner of Oliver and Court St., naming it "Dick's Sporting Goods". The store prospered, and Dick eventually opened a second store in Vestal, New York. In the 1970s, the Binghamton store moved next door to an even larger facility. Dick Stack headed the organization until his retirement in 1984.
Dick Stack's son, Edward "Eddie" Stack, succeeded him in the leadership of the company, expanding the two-store business rapidly. Edward W. Stack has served as chairman and chief executive officer of Dick's Sporting Goods since 1984, having started with the company full-time in 1977, and gradually working his way up in a variety of positions, including store clerk, merchandise manager, store manager and president.
In the early 1990s, Dick's began chain operations, opening additional stores across Upstate New York.[13] In 1994, Dick's moved its headquarters from Binghamton, New York to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[14]
In January 2016, Dick's launched Team Sports HQ, a platform of services for youth sport leagues. Services offered include software for online registration and team/league websites; custom uniforms and FanWear; and access to donations and sponsorships.[15]
Corporate
The company used the e-tailing Web site dickssportinggoods.com, operated by GSI Commerce under license and e-commerce agreements. Because the e-commerce site was operated under a company separate from Dick's Sporting Goods, the site often carried a wider selection than what is available in the stores with prices occasionally varying.[16] Starting in 2013, the company began using a ship-from-store platform for online orders. This means that the company has a detailed inventory for every store, and pulls new and used inventory from a local store to fulfill online orders to reduce shipping costs. As of March 2009, customers may return items purchased from the Web site.[17]
Sponsorship
The company sponsors a number of sporting events, including:

Sponsor of the USA Team at 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro
Basketball — Dick's Sporting Goods High School National Tournament
Football — Dick's Sporting Goods ESPN Kickoff Week
Soccer — Dick's Sporting Goods Park
Golf — Dick's Sporting Goods Open
Running — Dick's Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon

Professional sports teams sponsored by Dick's include the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins and Colorado Avalanche, and the Colorado Rapids of the MLS.
Dick's has also sponsored SportsMatter.com, a crowdfunding site to help support underfunded youth sports leagues.[18]
Lawsuits and legal proceedings

In July 1971, Dick's was told of infringing a patent owned by Furnace Brook, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Northern District of Illinois.[19]
On March 31, 2005, the company restated the first three fiscal quarters of 2004 as well as full-year figures due to adjustments to its accounting for leases and tenant or construction allowances.[20]
In August 2006, Dick's was accused of infringing two patents owned by Cushion Technologies, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of Texas.[21] In April 2007, Dick's settled with the plaintiff and the lawsuit was dismissed.
In June 2009, Dick's was accused of infringing a patent owned by The Donkey Company, Inc., in a lawsuit filed in District Court for the District of New Jersey.[22]
In 2014, Dick's began a lawsuit against Modell's Sporting Goods CEO, Mitchell Modell (who featured on an episode of Undercover Boss in 2012), for going undercover into their stores to gain access to their retail secrets.[23][24]

Acquisitions and expansion




Map of Dick's store locations as of 2015.


Dick's Sporting Goods opened in Florida and California in 1997. Seven years later, the chain acquired the entirety of Galyan's, an Indiana-based sporting chain. They also acquired Golf Galaxy and Chick's in 2007.
Plans were announced in 2010 to open its first store in Washington state (Puyallup) "with six more locations [in Oregon] 'coming soon.'"[25] Oklahoma (Broken Arrow)[26] and Idaho (Pocatello) followed in 2011,[27] then New Mexico (Albuquerque) in 2012.[28]
On August 16, 2013, Dick's Sporting Goods opened its first Field & Stream Shop in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania at the site of the former Dick's location in Cranberry (Dick's had moved to a newer location nearby in 2012), operating as a competitor to Cabela's.[29] Willie Robertson of the reality television series Duck Dynasty made a speaking appearance at a wedding at the store, with both participants dressed in camouflage,[30] as well as retired WWE wrestler Shawn Michaels (currently hosting MacMillan River Adventures on the Outdoor Channel) appearing at the store to sign autographs for the grand opening.[31] Later in the month, the store began selling AR-15 semi-automatic rifles,[32] ending the chain's 2012 self-imposed suspension of sales of certain semi-automatic firearms following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[33] Dick's has plans to open at least two more Field & Stream Shop locations in Erie, Pennsylvania (on the site of a proposed Cabela's store that Dick's had purchased before Cabela's had a chance to buy it) and Crescent Springs, Kentucky.[29] Dick's had bought the retail-related intellectual property rights to the Field & Stream name from the magazine's owner Bonnier Corporation in 2012 after having licensed the name for several years before. Bonnier remains owner of the magazine.[29]
On June 30, 2016, Dick's Sporting Goods purchased the intellectual property of now-defunct Sports Authority in an auction. The sale was approved on July 21, 2016.
In August 2016, Dick's purchased San Diego-based Affinity Sports, a sports management technology company. Affinity will expand the scope of the Team Sports HQ platform by offering management technology for large-scale sports organizations and national governing bodies.[15]

About Dick's Sporting GoodsDick’s Sporting Goods has long been a haven for athletes and fans of all stripes. With Dick's Sporting Goods coupons, everything from lacrosse helmets and hockey sticks to basketballs from brand names like Spaulding and Wilson come with a generous discount. Beyond items for team sports, the franchise helps patrons stay active with gear such as skateboards, treadmills, and running shoes. Dick's likewise outfits fans with jerseys and tailgating equipment, which—thanks to a Dick's Sporting Goods coupon from below—help spectators spotlight their dedication at a reduced rate.Though Dick's Sporting Goods is now a massive success, its origins begin with a moment of defeat. In 1948, while working at an Army surplus store, Dick Stack was asked to create a list of products the store would need to compete in the fishing-tackle business. A dedicated fisherman, 18-year-old Stack spent days crafting the list, only to have his boss scoff at it. Discouraged, he recounted the rejection to his grandmother, who immediately gave him $300 of her savings to start his own bait-and-tackle shop.A decade later, Dick began expanding his outfit into the sporting-goods emporium it is today. Today, thanks to Ed Stack (Dick's son and the company's current CEO) Dick's Sporting Goods now boasts more than 500 stores. Fishing gear is still a fixture, but now it shares shelf space with items such as football cleats, baseball mitts, and camping equipment. Thanks to a recent acquisition of Golf Galaxy, Dick's also accommodates a massive section dedicated to clubs, balls, and bags.Already dreaming of your next dunk, your next homerun, or the next cracker you'll hand-feed an especially obedient caddy? Then jot down a Dick's Sporting Goods promo code to make cheap purchases on whatever gear you need to up your game.Read moreShare these coupons    Related StoresAmerican Eagle Express Forever 21 Charlotte Russe Abercrombie & Fitch ASOS Brooks Brothers Columbia Sportswear Lids Ralph Lauren REI J.Crew Orvis Lord & Taylor Levi's Dillard's Johnston & Murphy Barneys New York Buckle American Apparel Yes StyleFrancescas Collection's Gap Patagonia Charles Tyrwhitt Last Call by Neiman Marcus Hanna Andersson Tommy Bahama Gander Mountain Banana Republic Peruvian Connection Calvin Klein A'GACI Carhartt AllSaints Capezio Rue21 Reebok Dooney & Bourke Smartwool - Show less+ Show moreFeatured StoresTarget Nordstrom Macy's Kohl's Aeropostale Walgreens PetSmart Finish Line eBay Payless Shoes Victoria's Secret 6pm.com Best Buy CheapOair.com AT&T Wireless Neiman Marcus Priceline GoDaddy.com FTD Ann Taylor Namecheap Staples Merrell Restaurant.comBionaire JCPenney Cheryl's Biltmore Puritans Pride Home Decorators Collection Backcountry.com Swarovski Lands' End Lane Bryant Footaction Disney Store BH Cosmetics Bellacor Acronis Bodybuilding.com drugstore.com NJOY Adorama Hawaiian Airlines - Show less+ Show moreDick's Sporting Goods Coupons & Promo Codes$20offSale 228 used today$20 Off Your OrderFor a limited time shop online at Dick's Sporting Goods and save!

History
In 1948, at the age of 18, Dick Stack worked at an Army/Navy store in his hometown of Binghamton, New York, after World War II. At the owner’s request, "Dick" explored the idea of expanding the product line to include fishing and camping supplies, but the owner rejected Dick's suggestions, stating that Dick “would never make a good merchant.”
When Dick recounted his story later that day, his grandmother advised, “Dick, always follow your dreams,” and gave him $300 from her savings. He rented a storefront and opened the first Dick's as a small "bait & tackle" fishing supply store, on Court Street near Howard Avenue.[12]
In the mid-1950s, the store expanded into the market of general sports merchandise and by the early 1960s, he was able to build and open a new store on the corner of Oliver and Court St., naming it "Dick's Sporting Goods". The store prospered, and Dick eventually opened a second store in Vestal, New York. In the 1970s, the Binghamton store moved next door to an even larger facility. Dick Stack headed the organization until his retirement in 1984.
Dick Stack's son, Edward "Eddie" Stack, succeeded him in the leadership of the company, expanding the two-store business rapidly. Edward W. Stack has served as chairman and chief executive officer of Dick's Sporting Goods since 1984, having started with the company full-time in 1977, and gradually working his way up in a variety of positions, including store clerk, merchandise manager, store manager and president.
In the early 1990s, Dick's began chain operations, opening additional stores across Upstate New York.[13] In 1994, Dick's moved its headquarters from Binghamton, New York to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[14]
In January 2016, Dick's launched Team Sports HQ, a platform of services for youth sport leagues. Services offered include software for online registration and team/league websites; custom uniforms and FanWear; and access to donations and sponsorships.[15]
Corporate
The company used the e-tailing Web site dickssportinggoods.com, operated by GSI Commerce under license and e-commerce agreements. Because the e-commerce site was operated under a company separate from Dick's Sporting Goods, the site often carried a wider selection than what is available in the stores with prices occasionally varying.[16] Starting in 2013, the company began using a ship-from-store platform for online orders. This means that the company has a detailed inventory for every store, and pulls new and used inventory from a local store to fulfill online orders to reduce shipping costs. As of March 2009, customers may return items purchased from the Web site.[17]
Sponsorship
The company sponsors a number of sporting events, including:

Sponsor of the USA Team at 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro
Basketball — Dick's Sporting Goods High School National Tournament
Football — Dick's Sporting Goods ESPN Kickoff Week
Soccer — Dick's Sporting Goods Park
Golf — Dick's Sporting Goods Open
Running — Dick's Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon

Professional sports teams sponsored by Dick's include the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins and Colorado Avalanche, and the Colorado Rapids of the MLS.
Dick's has also sponsored SportsMatter.com, a crowdfunding site to help support underfunded youth sports leagues.[18]
Lawsuits and legal proceedings

In July 1971, Dick's was told of infringing a patent owned by Furnace Brook, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Northern District of Illinois.[19]
On March 31, 2005, the company restated the first three fiscal quarters of 2004 as well as full-year figures due to adjustments to its accounting for leases and tenant or construction allowances.[20]
In August 2006, Dick's was accused of infringing two patents owned by Cushion Technologies, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of Texas.[21] In April 2007, Dick's settled with the plaintiff and the lawsuit was dismissed.
In June 2009, Dick's was accused of infringing a patent owned by The Donkey Company, Inc., in a lawsuit filed in District Court for the District of New Jersey.[22]
In 2014, Dick's began a lawsuit against Modell's Sporting Goods CEO, Mitchell Modell (who featured on an episode of Undercover Boss in 2012), for going undercover into their stores to gain access to their retail secrets.[23][24]

Acquisitions and expansion




Map of Dick's store locations as of 2015.


Dick's Sporting Goods opened in Florida and California in 1997. Seven years later, the chain acquired the entirety of Galyan's, an Indiana-based sporting chain. They also acquired Golf Galaxy and Chick's in 2007.
Plans were announced in 2010 to open its first store in Washington state (Puyallup) "with six more locations [in Oregon] 'coming soon.'"[25] Oklahoma (Broken Arrow)[26] and Idaho (Pocatello) followed in 2011,[27] then New Mexico (Albuquerque) in 2012.[28]
On August 16, 2013, Dick's Sporting Goods opened its first Field & Stream Shop in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania at the site of the former Dick's location in Cranberry (Dick's had moved to a newer location nearby in 2012), operating as a competitor to Cabela's.[29] Willie Robertson of the reality television series Duck Dynasty made a speaking appearance at a wedding at the store, with both participants dressed in camouflage,[30] as well as retired WWE wrestler Shawn Michaels (currently hosting MacMillan River Adventures on the Outdoor Channel) appearing at the store to sign autographs for the grand opening.[31] Later in the month, the store began selling AR-15 semi-automatic rifles,[32] ending the chain's 2012 self-imposed suspension of sales of certain semi-automatic firearms following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[33] Dick's has plans to open at least two more Field & Stream Shop locations in Erie, Pennsylvania (on the site of a proposed Cabela's store that Dick's had purchased before Cabela's had a chance to buy it) and Crescent Springs, Kentucky.[29] Dick's had bought the retail-related intellectual property rights to the Field & Stream name from the magazine's owner Bonnier Corporation in 2012 after having licensed the name for several years before. Bonnier remains owner of the magazine.[29]
On June 30, 2016, Dick's Sporting Goods purchased the intellectual property of now-defunct Sports Authority in an auction. The sale was approved on July 21, 2016.
In August 2016, Dick's purchased San Diego-based Affinity Sports, a sports management technology company. Affinity will expand the scope of the Team Sports HQ platform by offering management technology for large-scale sports organizations and national governing bodies.[15]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
