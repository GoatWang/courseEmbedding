Research

	Intensive in-house fundamental research is the centerpiece of Cardinal’s investment process. The four portfolio managers and four research analysts each perform detailed company research. Each existing or prospective holding is covered by a primary analyst but investment decisions are made by consensus among the portfolio managers.

	Investment ideas come from diverse areas, with the largest source being generated internally. All four portfolio managers have backgrounds that are rooted in free cash flow, the cornerstone of Cardinal’s investment philosophy. Since the inception of our value strategy we have created over 600 financial models on companies we have owned (of which over 175 models are actively updated), and we continue to build about 35 new models each year. This repository serves as a significant source of potential investments.

	We gather information to aid us in determining if a business is stable and predictable and generates substantial free cash flow. Further, we seek information to assess management’s motivations and their track record in redeploying the company’s capital. In researching these issues, we spend considerable time with company management on the phone and in person after reading the publicly available financial information on file with the SEC as well as reviewing transcripts of previous industry presentations and conference calls. As a result of our preparation and the credibility we have built with many management teams over the years, we are able to have much more insightful discussions with them about the longer-term value drivers of the business

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.
