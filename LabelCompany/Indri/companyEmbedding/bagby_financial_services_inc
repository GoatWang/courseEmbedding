Mike Bagby, who also owns Bagby Wealth Management, an independent Registered Investment Advisory (RIA) firm, has been in the financial services industry since 1982.  He and his team formed Bagby Financial Services, Inc., a broker/dealer, in 2015 and are expanding that concept in Southeast Missouri and beyond.  They offer a simplified and focused approach to investing: use a limited number of inexpensive funds that will save money for their clients. We are actively recruiting Registered Representatives and other industry professionals to join our team.If you are an investor please go to our investor page. If you are an industry partner please read on.The Department of Labor has issued a rule implementing the fiduciary standard for 401(k) and other retirement accounts for retail mutual funds and variable annuities. 12b-1 fees and retail mutual funds appear to be in jeopardy and many broker/dealers are advising their registered representatives to move commissioned retirement (IRA) brokerage accounts to the investment advisory business model. We view these as major changes in the industry. Scary changes if you are a broker paid on commission.At Bagby we saw this industry trend years ago and have prepared for it; now the DOL fiduciary rule has greatly sped up the process. We are ahead of the curve and you can benefit from our excellent position.At Bagby Financial Services, Inc., with our flexibility, you can either continue as a registered representative to earn commissions or transition your business to our affiliated investment advisory company, or both. We have in house legal counsel and an in house compliance officer, up to date on the latest changes, to guide you through these turbulent times.Still not convinced to have a confidential conversation with us? Here are a few more compelling reasons to consider switching to Bagby Financial Services:50% commission payoutsOne-on-one mentoring by a million dollar producer that will train YOU to be a million dollar producerNo upfront costs to youAll business and training expenses paid (You must have Series 6 or 7 license)Furnished office space in your market (no need to relocate)Paid marketing program to onboard new and existing clientsA positive, supportive business environment that is professional but doesn't feel "corporate"Two ways we will consider for you to join our team:You can earn commission at 50% payout of our products you sell, orIf you have a book of business you have the option of selling your book and continuing to work for us on a commissioned basis. Buyout terms and payouts are flexible for how you want to arrange your payout.Now that we have your attention, we invite you to reach out for a confidential conversation about joining the Bagby team. Contact us to see if we might be a good fit for you. Times are changing, and with Bagby you can make it work for you.  Send email inquiries to thomasbischof@bagbyfs.com or call 573-614-4656.

The Fee Based Advantage














































(573) 624-4771






















The Fee Based Advantage








"It's not how much money you make, but how much money you keep, how hard it works for you, and how many generations you keep it for."



Unlike some advisors who earn commissions on sales of investment products, we almost exclusively offer fee-based investment and wealth management services*. As a fee-based wealth management firm, you can be assured that Bagby Wealth Management will provide you with unbiased investment and financial planning advice. In most circumstances, no commissions will be involved in our investment advice or investment management*. In this way, your financial consultant's compensation is ultimately based on the performance of your investments. As your investments increase in value, so will your consultant's compensation. We believe this approach puts the incentive where it belongs - on the long-term performance of your investments.
Through this approach, Bagby Wealth Management will design and manage a portfolio that matches your risk tolerance and is designed to meet your objectives now and in the future. Whether you are driven by dreams for retirement, college aspirations for the kids or grandkids, saving up for a dream home or simply minimizing taxes - our team approach at Bagby Wealth Management will help you pursue your goals.


Contact Us to schedule a no-obligation consultation to learn how a fiduciary approach to managing your investment assets can help you pursue your long-term goals.

*Objective fee-based investment advice and wealth management services constitute over 99% of our revenue generated. Less than 1% of our revenue comes from commissioned products through an affiliated company, Bagby Financial Services, Inc. The 1% is generated, on occasion, when our advisors write a life insurance policy or use another commissionable product for a client through this affiliated company.
