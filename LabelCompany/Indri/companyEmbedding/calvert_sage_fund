Calvert Launches Three New Funds | Business Wire
























































Calvert Launches Three New Funds




Large Cap Value Fund employs new “SAGE” approach to sustainable 
      investment management; High Yield and Short-Term Government Bond Funds 
      added to fixed income line-up






December 15, 2008 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time



BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Calvert, an investment management firm, today introduced three new 
      strategies to its mutual fund product line: Calvert Large Cap Value Fund 
      (CLVAX), Calvert High Yield Bond Fund (SFHIX), and Calvert Short-Term 
      Government Fund (SFSTX). As of December 15, 2008, Calvert offers 57 
      funds.
    


      The three offerings are the result of a September 16, 2008 announcement 
      by UNIFI, a mutual holding company based in Lincoln, Nebraska and parent 
      company to Calvert, that it planned to consolidate the operations of its 
      two affiliated mutual fund companies. That transaction, which was 
      successfully completed today, combines the unique, individual strengths 
      of the companies resulting in a single mutual fund operation that 
      preserves the strong records of in-house portfolio management teams, 
      benefits from an extensive distribution network and creates efficiencies 
      in mutual fund operations.
    

Calvert Large Cap Value Fund (CLVAX)—formerly known as Summit 
      Everest Fund. The Fund seeks long-term growth of capital by investing in 
      large cap company equity securities that the portfolio manager believes 
      are undervalued. Lead portfolio manager James R. McGlynn and assistant 
      portfolio manager Yvonne M. Bishop joined CAMCO’s (the investment 
      advisor to the Calvert Funds) in-house equity team from Summit 
      Investment Partners, Inc. to provide continuity in the Fund’s portfolio 
      management. Calvert Large Cap Value Fund is the first offering under a 
      new Calvert SAGE™ ("Sustainability Achieved Through Greater Engagement") 
      approach to sustainable and responsible investment, which offers Calvert 
      investors the opportunity to invest in a broader universe of companies 
      than previously available through Calvert. To learn more about Calvert 
      SAGE, visit http://calvert.com/sri.html.
    

“We are pleased to offer a large cap value option to our 
      shareholders,” said Natalie Trunow, Senior Vice President and Head 
      of Equities at Calvert. “Using our new SAGE investment approach, we 
      will be able to give investors who are interested in sustainable 
      investing the opportunity to have exposure to the large cap value asset 
      class and also the opportunity to influence corporate responsibility in 
      a broader universe of companies,” she added.
    

      The SAGE approach first evaluates the portfolio for a threshold 
      responsibility standard with respect to tobacco, weapons and human 
      rights. In addition, SAGE emphasizes enhanced engagement to advance 
      environmental, social and governance performance in companies that 
      demonstrate varying degrees of commitment and progress toward corporate 
      responsibility and sustainability challenges.
    

“Over the last several years, we have seen a dramatic increase in 
      attention to these challenges as sustainability has become an 
      irreversibly mainstream agenda across Corporate America, even on the 
      part of many companies and within industries that had been laggards,” said 
      Bennett Freeman, Senior Vice President of Social Research and Policy. “The 
      SAGE approach was developed by Calvert to recognize progress in 
      companies that may not yet meet each and every one of our longstanding 
      criteria, but which are working towards sustainability in key areas that 
      we can in turn help reinforce through our direct engagement with them.
Putting this concept to work in Calvert Large Cap Value Fund is an 
      opportunity to influence a broader array of important companies, while 
      striving to achieve solid investment performance for our shareholders,” he 
      added.


Calvert High Yield Bond Fund (SFHIX). Under the leadership of 
      Greg Habeeb, Senior Vice President and Head of the Taxable Fixed Income 
      investment team, the Fund will follow the same research-intensive, 
      relative-value approach employed successfully in Calvert Income Fund and 
      Calvert Social Investment Fund Bond Portfolio. Assistant portfolio 
      managers Kevin Aug and Sam Cooper recently joined the team from Summit 
      Investment Partners to help manage Calvert High Yield Bond Fund.
    

Calvert Short-Term Government Fund (SFSTX). Another addition to 
      the taxable fund line-up and managed by Greg Habeeb and his team, 
      Short-Term Government invests in U.S. government securities and will 
      maintain a dollar-weighted, average effective maturity of less than 
      three years. The Fund will actively manage duration and yield curve 
      positions to maximize current income while preserving capital.
    

“These new funds give shareholders and their advisors an opportunity 
      to fine-tune their portfolios for the right mix of income, stability and 
      growth potential,” said Cathy Roy, Chief Investment Officer, Fixed 
      Income.
    

About Calvert:


      Calvert is an investment management firm and a known leader in 
      Sustainable and Responsible Investing (SRI). The firm now offers three 
      distinct approaches to SRI investing. Regardless of the approach, the 
      Fund begins with seeking out companies that are financially attractive. 
      The Calvert Signature Funds employ traditional SRI exclusions; the 
      Calvert Solution Funds provide solutions to issues such as alternative 
      energy and water; and the Calvert SAGE Funds may invest in companies not 
      typically included in traditional SRI portfolios in order to engage with 
      those companies in a more focused and targeted way on corporate social 
      responsibility issues. For more information on all of these approaches, 
      go to www.calvert.com.

Investment in mutual funds involves risk, including possible loss of 
      principal invested. Bond funds are subject to interest rate risk. When 
      interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities will generally 
      fall. Conversely, a drop in interest rates will generally cause an 
      increase in the value of fixed-income securities.
