The firm, which is based in New York City, was founded in 2000 by Steven B. Klinsky. Prior to founding New Mountain, Klinsky was a general partner of private equity firm Forstmann Little and Co., which he joined in 1984.[1] Prior to that, Klinsky was a co-founder of the leveraged buyout group at Goldman Sachs (1981-1984), where he helped execute over $3 billion of transactions.

Additionally, New Mountain portfolio companies spent approximately $3.5 billion in aggregate on research and development, software spending and capital expenditures. On average, New Mountain's portfolio companies pay above the median U.S. income.

Top Buys by Directors: Klinsky's $4.2M Bet on NMFC






DividendChannel.com




Aug 15, 2016 11:22 AM EDT













 




























































 The directors of a company tend to have a unique inside view into the business, so when directors make major buys, investors are wise to take notice. Presumably the only reason a director of a company would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So in this series we look at the largest insider buys by company directors over the trailing six month period, one of which was a total of $4.2M invested across 2 purchases by Steven B. Klinsky, Director at New Mountain Finance Corp ( NMFC).
