						INTRODUCING THE 2017 CTS-V SEDAN CARBON BLACK PACKAGE














                  These aggressively sporty design elements speak to the CTS-V Sedan’s strengths on—and off—the track.

LEARN MORE








					PERFORMANCE












					ENGINEERED FOR THE TRACK

Arm yourself with power and precision. The 2017 CTS-V dominates the road with a supercharged 6.2L V8 engine and an 8-speed automatic transmission plus structural and suspension components for decisive steering and cornering.




 
 











BREMBO® BRAKES
Uncompromised stopping power. Massive six piston front and four piston rear Brembo® brakes let you harness a powerful engine with durability, consistency and the capability for track-day performance straight from the factory.
The specifically sized and tuned rotors undergo a Ferritic Nitro-Carburizing process that greatly reduces corrosion and helps maintain smooth braking performance for a longer period of time.
8-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION
Tuned and tested on the track. The CTS-V houses an 8-speed automatic transmission that provides responsive shifting along with smooth and refined performance.
Shift through all 8 seamlessly and automatically select the right gear with Performance Algorithm Shifting to improve lap times, or switch to manual control by tapping the magnesium paddle shifters, mounted on the steering wheel for a truly hands-on experience.





















 
 










 
 
 
 




SUPERCHARGED 6.2L V8 ENGINE
Wield relentless power. An impressive 640-hp and 630 lb-ft of torque will push you from 0 to 60 in 3.7 seconds and has the ability to reach a top speed of 200 mph on the racetrack.

And for everyday-driving performance, it all works seamlessly with Direct Injection, Continuous Variable Valve Technology and Active Fuel Management.








PRECISE HANDLING

Expand











 
 









					TRACK CAPABLE












					TAKE IT STRAIGHT TO THE TRACK

                  Bred for the track, but certified for the road. A refined daily driver, the CTS-V is derived from track competition and designed to be track-capable from the factory.




 
 











PERFORMANCE TRACTION MANAGEMENT
Complete and utter control. Performance Traction Management provides you with competition spec traction and stability controls. Adjust to conditions with five modes specifically for the track: Wet, Dry, Sport 1, Sport 2 or Race.
At the same time, Launch Control monitors traction activity and ensures full-throttle off the line acceleration for incredible 0-60 times.
TRACK-CAPABLE COOLING
Cool, calm and collected. A large grille and fascia openings feed more air into a large-capacity radiator and multiple heat exchangers for cooling that adds up to maximum driving performance.












MICHELIN® PILOT® SUPER SPORT TIRES
Expand























 
 







					EXTERIOR












					A MORE DYNAMIC AERODYNAMIC

                  Every curve, edge and line deliberate. The striking looks come from a functionally designed exterior that supports the car’s capabilities by contributing to lift reduction, enhanced cooling and improved aero performance. With its athletic stance, wide body and low height, the CTS-V’s shape is both aggressive and intelligent.

V-SERIES GRILLE
An upfront statement. The V-Series aerodynamic stance plays a crucial role in performance. The front splitter and front hood vent steer air around or over the vehicle to reduce lift. The iconic mesh grille is engineered for maximum airflow to the engine.
CARBON FIBER HOOD
Light, but striking. A lightweight carbon fiber hood provides the CTS-V with optimal weight distribution and positively sleek looks.
Available carbon fiber package includes a unique carbon fiber splitter, hood vent, diffuser and the aggressive rear spoiler that generates greater downforce.
ADDITIONAL EXTERIOR FEATURES
Bold accents at every pivot. A finely tuned quad exhaust announces your arrival, while imposing 19” lightweight forged aluminum V-Series wheels combine attitude with function.
























					INTERIOR












					THE RACE CAR, REFINED

                  A most immaculate performance machine. Step inside the CTS-V and you’ll find refined finishes, prestige touches and a cockpit designed with only one thing in mind: The driver.




 





VIEW PHOTO GALLERY








STYLE, COMFORT & CONVENIENCE
Design invoked with a performance attitude. When you see the intricate matte carbon fiber trim and sueded microfiber accents, you’ll know that this is a V-Series vehicle. And with its signature thick-rim steering wheel with magnesium paddle shifters, the sophisticated interior of CTS-V elevates the experience for the driver.
RECONFIGURABLE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER
Curate your dash. The customizable instrument cluster lets you configure the 12.3” high-definition display to one of three themes. And the Head-Up Display lets you view select vehicle data through the windshield while keeping your eyes on the road.

						INTRODUCING THE 2017 CTS-V SEDAN CARBON BLACK PACKAGE














                  These aggressively sporty design elements speak to the CTS-V Sedan’s strengths on—and off—the track.

LEARN MORE








					PERFORMANCE












					ENGINEERED FOR THE TRACK

Arm yourself with power and precision. The 2017 CTS-V dominates the road with a supercharged 6.2L V8 engine and an 8-speed automatic transmission plus structural and suspension components for decisive steering and cornering.




 
 











BREMBO® BRAKES
Uncompromised stopping power. Massive six piston front and four piston rear Brembo® brakes let you harness a powerful engine with durability, consistency and the capability for track-day performance straight from the factory.
The specifically sized and tuned rotors undergo a Ferritic Nitro-Carburizing process that greatly reduces corrosion and helps maintain smooth braking performance for a longer period of time.
8-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION
Tuned and tested on the track. The CTS-V houses an 8-speed automatic transmission that provides responsive shifting along with smooth and refined performance.
Shift through all 8 seamlessly and automatically select the right gear with Performance Algorithm Shifting to improve lap times, or switch to manual control by tapping the magnesium paddle shifters, mounted on the steering wheel for a truly hands-on experience.





















 
 










 
 
 
 




SUPERCHARGED 6.2L V8 ENGINE
Wield relentless power. An impressive 640-hp and 630 lb-ft of torque will push you from 0 to 60 in 3.7 seconds and has the ability to reach a top speed of 200 mph on the racetrack.

And for everyday-driving performance, it all works seamlessly with Direct Injection, Continuous Variable Valve Technology and Active Fuel Management.








PRECISE HANDLING

Expand











 
 









					TRACK CAPABLE












					TAKE IT STRAIGHT TO THE TRACK

                  Bred for the track, but certified for the road. A refined daily driver, the CTS-V is derived from track competition and designed to be track-capable from the factory.




 
 











PERFORMANCE TRACTION MANAGEMENT
Complete and utter control. Performance Traction Management provides you with competition spec traction and stability controls. Adjust to conditions with five modes specifically for the track: Wet, Dry, Sport 1, Sport 2 or Race.
At the same time, Launch Control monitors traction activity and ensures full-throttle off the line acceleration for incredible 0-60 times.
TRACK-CAPABLE COOLING
Cool, calm and collected. A large grille and fascia openings feed more air into a large-capacity radiator and multiple heat exchangers for cooling that adds up to maximum driving performance.












MICHELIN® PILOT® SUPER SPORT TIRES
Expand























 
 







					EXTERIOR












					A MORE DYNAMIC AERODYNAMIC

                  Every curve, edge and line deliberate. The striking looks come from a functionally designed exterior that supports the car’s capabilities by contributing to lift reduction, enhanced cooling and improved aero performance. With its athletic stance, wide body and low height, the CTS-V’s shape is both aggressive and intelligent.

V-SERIES GRILLE
An upfront statement. The V-Series aerodynamic stance plays a crucial role in performance. The front splitter and front hood vent steer air around or over the vehicle to reduce lift. The iconic mesh grille is engineered for maximum airflow to the engine.
CARBON FIBER HOOD
Light, but striking. A lightweight carbon fiber hood provides the CTS-V with optimal weight distribution and positively sleek looks.
Available carbon fiber package includes a unique carbon fiber splitter, hood vent, diffuser and the aggressive rear spoiler that generates greater downforce.
ADDITIONAL EXTERIOR FEATURES
Bold accents at every pivot. A finely tuned quad exhaust announces your arrival, while imposing 19” lightweight forged aluminum V-Series wheels combine attitude with function.
























					INTERIOR












					THE RACE CAR, REFINED

                  A most immaculate performance machine. Step inside the CTS-V and you’ll find refined finishes, prestige touches and a cockpit designed with only one thing in mind: The driver.




 





VIEW PHOTO GALLERY








STYLE, COMFORT & CONVENIENCE
Design invoked with a performance attitude. When you see the intricate matte carbon fiber trim and sueded microfiber accents, you’ll know that this is a V-Series vehicle. And with its signature thick-rim steering wheel with magnesium paddle shifters, the sophisticated interior of CTS-V elevates the experience for the driver.
RECONFIGURABLE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER
Curate your dash. The customizable instrument cluster lets you configure the 12.3” high-definition display to one of three themes. And the Head-Up Display lets you view select vehicle data through the windshield while keeping your eyes on the road.
