��INVESTMENT POLICY AGREEMENT��

Exhibit 6.8 
INVESTMENT POLICY AGREEMENT

This Investment Policy Agreement (the �Agreement�), effective as of
��������������������, 20����, is entered into by and between Cottonwood Residential O.P., LP, a Delaware limited partnership
(�CROP�) and Cottonwood Multifamily REIT I O.P., LP, a Delaware limited partnership (�CW Multifamily OP I�). CROP and CW Multifamily OP I are individually referred to as a �Party� and collectively referred to as the
�Parties.�  WHEREAS, the Parties intend to enter into one or more joint ventures (individually, a �Joint Venture� and
collectively, the �Joint Ventures�) to acquire multifamily apartment communities (the �Projects�) and multifamily real estate related assets (the �Real Estate Related Assets�). 
WHEREAS, the Parties desire to minimize the conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with the acquisition and management of the
Projects and the Real Estate Related Assets.
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the
parties hereby agree as follows:
 1.�Competing Transactions.

1.1.�Investment by CW Multifamily OP I. Except as set forth below, CROP shall be required to bring each Project that meets the
Investment Criteria and Diversification Criteria, to CW Multifamily OP I if CW Multifamily OP I has equity available to make the required equity investment in such Project. CROP may, but shall not be required to, present other potential investments
in Real Estate Related Assets to CW Multifamily OP I. In addition, CROP may, in its sole discretion, present investment opportunities to CW Multifamily OP I that do not meet the Investment Criteria and Diversification Criteria. Notwithstanding the
