4Crawler Offroad specializes in those hard to find parts that you won't 
find included with the major upgrade parts you can get from the big 
mail order and on-line suppliers. For example, many, many places sell 
springs and shocks to lift your truck. But after you put on the springs 
and shocks, you may find that you need shims to correct the pinion 
angles on leaf-sprung trucks, or you need a panhard bracket on a 
coil-sprung truck or a bracket for the brake proportioning (LSPV) 
valve. Or you may need a little more lift on the front or rear end of 
the truck after installing the basic spring/shock lift kit. Or you may 
need a little more lift to clear a larger set of tires, etc. So that is 
where 4Crawler Offroad can "come to the rescue", we make all 
those other parts you need to finish off your lift and make it all work 
like it should. And we also realize that some folks might inherit a 
vehicle with a lift and want to restore it to stock, so we can even 
help out there with body lift removal kits, etc.

And please, Please, PLEASE be sure to include a 
valid Reply-To address in your e-mail if you expect to receive a reply. 
Several times a week, 4Crawler Offroad receives question by e-mail and 
the replies are returned as undeliverable due to countless e-mail 
delivery errors. So if you send a question and do not hear back in a 
reasonable amount of time, feel free to re-send the question, but be 
sure to double-check that there is a valid "Reply-To" address 
in the e-mail header or in the body of the message. And if the direct 
e-mail link above does not work, cut and past 
"Sales@4Crawler.com" into your e-mail program "To:" 
field and send a message that way.

Phone 
number available by request. 4Crawler Offroad has chosen to 
leverage the power of the Internet to handle most of our routine 
customer interactions. As such, we have no "brick and mortar" 
store front and we don't have a huge staff of folks sitting around 
awaiting your phone call. So, we don't put the number on the web site 
because we are barraged with e-mail requests (literally 24/7) for the 
most obscure questions, information and products. If we got even 10% of 
those contacts as phone calls, we would be spending all our time on the 
phone with folks asking for custom parts for a '51 Ford show truck or 
droning on and on with questions on how to get their 4Runner or pickup 
engine running or what sort of mods they are dreaming of making to 
their newly purchased rig or whatever, instead of making parts to fill 
orders for actual customers, like you! And, we could hire an answering 
service to handle the phone calls. But realize that this would just be 
a person to take orders, they would have no technical knowledge to 
answer your questions (that customers always seem to ask), so this is 
really not a satisfactory option in our estimation. We would also need 
to raise our pricing to cover the fixed costs of the answering service. 
But, we do realize some folks do like to ask questions or place an 
order over the phone, so if that applies to you, just ask and we'll 
send you our complete contact information.

NOTE: Due to high order volume, it may take some time for production and shipments to catch up. Order backlog could be up to 6 weeks.



Want to place a custom order for multiple 
items?

No problem, you can use this simple one-click ordering process below. 
Just select a Buy Now button below with the shipping applicable to the 
items you are ordering, tell us what parts you want and how much they 
cost and your payment/shipping information and that is all that is 
needed.


    All 4Crawler Offroad products are FOB 
    seller/origin. 
    
    Add up the cost of each item you want included in your order (excluding 
    postage): 
    

        Typical kit contents and totals are listed in the tables on the pages 
        above 
        
        Add 9.0% sales tax for shipments to a California address:

Automaticaaly added if using the Buy Now buttons below
If you live outside of California, no sales tax applies 


        For US addresses, add $7.00 for small items that fit in an envelope or 
        $15.00 for uninsured or $18.00 for insured
         Priority Mail shipping, for a total 
        

            Or use one of the "Buy Now" buttons below for pre-computed 
            shipping. 
            
            3 day typical Priority Mail delivery time 
        

International shipping
         options, also supply a local phone number for customs paperwork 


            US Mail shipping to Canada/Mexico of US$45.00 for all the above kits 
            
            US Priority Mail shipping to Europe/Central and South Americaof 
            US$67.00 for most items 
            
            US Priority Mail shipping to Asia/Australia/New Zealand of US$75.00 for 
            most items 
            
            For total weight up to 20 pounds 
            
            Typical shipping time is 6-10 days 
            
            20 lb. weight limit on the above international shipments. 
            

                For smaller items, under 4 lbs. and that will fit in a letter size flat 
                rate envelope, international postage runs US$33.00. 
                
                While many items fit this 4 lb. weight limitation, they generally can't 
                be combined as that will push the weight over the limit. Examples are 
                ball joint spacers (3 lbs.), Diff Drop Kit (2.5 lbs.), Panhard Drop 
                Brkt. (3 lbs.), etc. So no way to combine those sorts of parts into the 
                flat rate envelope, only option is the 20 lb. limit flat rate box, 
                

                    Note that the flat rate box shipping option does offer better package 
                    tracking than the envelope, as 
                    noted. So if that is a consideration, you might 
                    want to opt for the flat rate box shipping option. 
                    
                    One other consideration on shipping multiple items is for customs/duty 
                    fees at the destination country. If you have two packages worth say 
                    US$50/ea. the customs/duty fees may be much less than for one package 
                    with a US$100 value. 
                


Shipping 
            insurance available by special request.

Currency conversion



    Specify the vehicle details if applicable 
    
Or order all the items separately and we'll be happy to combine 
    the shipping (if desired) and ship in one package and refund 
    any excess postage. 
    

        May or may not be possible in all cases due to size and/or weight 
        limitations, but we'll do our best. 
    

    Shipping options below do not apply to Rock SliderZ kit orders as they 
    have their own shipping options 
    
Questions? 


And you can always order each item separately and then let us 
know if you want them combined into one shipment, if possible 
and we'll do that and refund any excess postage. But you need to tell 
us since some customers like to have things shipped separately as there 
are a few advantages. For example if you order 3 items, if we ship 
together we'll need to wait until all 3 items are ready to ship before 
we can send anything. Also, for international customers, if you had 4 
orders for $50/ea. and shipped them separately, there may be no customs 
fees due since the value is below the minimum assessment value, while a 
single order of $200 might be assessed taxes and fees. So please let us 
know your preferences for shipping multiple item orders.

Ordering/payment options below:


    Whatever ordering option you use, please be sure to DOUBLE 
    CHECK YOUR SHIPPING ADDRESS prior to submitting the 
    order. 
    

        Orders will be shipped to the address you specify, if that address is 
        incorrect, your order may be delayed 
        
        Returned orders will be reshipped at your expense. 
        
        We'll try to correct the address if you send it to us, but we 
        do get SO MANY orders with incorrect addresses it is hard 
        to keep track of which is which, so your best shot is to give us your 
        correct address to begin with.

Oldskool Forum, Military, and Shop/Dealer 
    Discount: 
    

        4Crawler Offroad is now offering a 10% discount program for all our 
        products for members of any on-line web forum (4x4wire.com, 
        YotaTech.com, Toyota120.com, FJCruiserForums.com, etc., anyone in 
        active military duty or a shop or dealer. 
        
        Since our normal on-line ordering system can't handle this discount, in 
        order to take advantage of the discount, you must write up the parts you want to 
        order on the discount order form (or use the discount 
        on-line order form below) total up the parts and subtract 10% (or 
        multiply by 0.9 if that works better for you) and add applicable sales 
        tax (for California orders) and shipping (as noted above - shipping 
        cost not discounted) and add your affiliation information (forum and 
        user name, military branch or shop information), e-mail and postal 
        addresses (where you want the parts shipped to) and mail that along 
        with a money order or certified check as 
        noted above. 
        

            Personal checks (US funds only) will be acceptable for forum discounts, 
            although we will make sure the checks clear prior to starting the order 
            and if the check bounces, we'll send the check to collections and will 
            also publicize the information. 
        

        For example, if the parts you want total $100.00, the discounted price 
        is $90.00. Add applicable state sales tax and shipping for a total.. 
        

            Only mailed in (a.k.a. envelope and stamp), will-call orders, or the 
            special on-line orders (below), will be afforded the discount, at this 
            time. No exceptions, except for the on-line order procedure described 
            below.. 
            
            To qualify forum discounts, we reserve the right to log into the 
            specified forum and search for at least one post by the user name 
            supplied and also to browse that user's profile and check that the 
            location and vehicle information are present and correspond to the 
            order. We feel that this information should be filled out by all forum 
            users so that others can know where you are and what you drive, in case 
            you forget to put that information in some future post asking for help 
            or information. 
        

        Feel free to drop us an e-mail to let us know to expect your order. 
        
        If you run a shop or retail outlet and would like to take advantage of 
        this discount, no problem, just add your business name in place of the 
        forum information. 
        

            And if you run a business in California and would like to resell our 
            products, download and submit a copy of a California 
            Resale Certificate to us by mail, e-mail or fax (see 
            above for contact information). 
        

        e-mail or fax (see above for contact information). For on-line orders, 
        contact us to request the on-line 
        discount order form


            If the above e-mail link doesn't work for you, send an e-mail to 
            forum@4Crawler.com and ask for the on-line discount order form. 
        

Only one discount of 10% applies at this time, there are 
        no multiple discounts for multiple affiliations.

Again, you MUST follow the instructions given on one of 
        the above order forms to the letter. 


Any deviation will result in no discount for your 
            order and we'll either bill you for the difference or cancel the order 
            (so you can re-submit it) as you prefer. 


And you can't make use of any of the "Buy Now" 
        buttons or order links on the web site to take advantage of this 
        discount. 


And we can't send you an invoice or process your 
            credit card through our system to qualify for this discount.


Sorry but that is the way it is.

    Returns: Parts may be returned for a refund within 60 days of original 
    purchase. 
    

        No need to obtain an RMA number or anything like that. 
        
        A 10% restocking fee will be deducted from original purchase price less 
        outgoing shipping. 
        

            Parts must be in new and unused condition for the refund. 
            

                Used or blemished parts can yield partial refunds at the discretion of 
                4Crawler Offroad. 
                
                Parts that have been modified by the customer or that have been built 
                to unique customer specifications are generally not refundable. 
                
                Returned items with missing components will have the refund adjusted 
                for the cost of the missing items (e.g. missing nuts or bolts, etc.) 
            

            The customer is responsible for return shipping charges. 
            
            Returned parts must include a copy of the original invoice or packing 
            slip for proper credit. 
            
            It is highly recommended that a package tracking number be obtained 
            from the shipper and that that number be transmitted to 4Crawler 
            Offroad so that we are aware that you have sent an item back and that 
            we can track it, know when it arrives and can pick it up at our PO box. 
            

                If you use the USPS.COM
                 on-line shipping label system, you can get the delivery/tracking 
                number at no additional cost and you can simply enter our e-mail 
                address (sales@4crawler.com) in the recipient field and we'll 
                automatically be sent that information. 
                
                If you don't have a tracking number, at least send us an e-mail noting 
                when and how you shipped the package so we can keep an eye out for it 
                to arrive. 
            


        One exception to this policy is in the case that the parts do not fit 
        properly, per the installation instructions, or that are outside of our 
        manufacturing tolerances. 
        

            The returned part(s) must be accompanied by photos or a detailed 
            description of the fitment issue. 
            
            In such a case 4Crawler Offroad will refund the full purchase price 
            less shipping. And as noted, please furnish a detailed description of 
            the fitment issue reported, including dimensions, so that this fitment 
            issue may be corrected for future orders. 
            
            Also, for items custom built to a customer's specifications, we 
            generally can't accept returns of those items at the full refund rate. 
            

                Reason being, we made the part to your specifications and if it does 
                not fit or work as you planned, we have done our part. 
                
                We may be able to offer a partial refund, depending on the item, 
                perhaps in the 25%-50% range, depending on how much re-work we'll need 
                to do to modify your custom part for some future order for a similar 
                part. 
            


        Items returned 60 days or more past the purchase date will be refunded 
        less any applicable transaction fees, typically 4% - 5%. 
        

            This time is from the date of purchase until we get our hands on the 
            returned item(s) so we can inspect them for missing parts or damage, so 
            be sure to allow enough time if planning to return an item for a 
            refund. 
        

        Items that are custom built to fit customer specifications may only be 
        returned for partial credit at the discretion of 4Crawler Offroad.

Unique Products That Really Work!

By Roger Brown	- October 1, 2000	



	Throughout many years of bass fishing I have seen so many different products that have been introduced to the bassin industry that I lost count years ago. Some products have been exceptional, some good, some just okay, and some not so good, and with the industry being in the multi-billion dollar bracket there are literally thousands of products on todays market, and out of these "thousands of products" there are just about a handful that I surely wouldnt be without, mostly because they have proven themselves time and time again to gain the "Exceptional" reputation they so richly deserve. 

I would like to talk about some of these unique products that I have stumbled onto over the years, especially the ones that have proven themselves to be in the "Select" catagory when it comes to bass fishing. But first let me explain a bit about my product sponsorships and how I promote them. When I agree to a product sponsorship from a certain company I have to really accept the quality, performance, and dependability of their products before I can agree to promote them, the reason for this is because I have to teach the students that enroll at my 3-day bass fishing school as well as my bass charter clients how to use these products and why I use them, but lets not forget the most important part, "A Great Product Will Sell Itself!"

PLASTIC BAITS

Now, the first type of product we will talk about is plastic baits. Over the years I have used selected plastic baits from many different companies and found that some of the companies may have a bait or two that might work well, but as a whole I would find myself shopping other companies to get the different designs, colors, sizes, textures, etc. that I really needed. (Boy, talk about your inconvenience right?)

Well, we dont have to be inconvenienced any more because I found (2) companies

that supply just about everything a serious angler needs to fill his or her plastic bait shopping list, and in all honesty Id have to say that "Gary Yamamoto Custom Baits" and "Budz Fishing Wayz Inc." (who produce the original Bobby Garland Gitzits) offer by far the best selection and quality in plastic baits that you will find on todays vast market. 

FISHING RODS

With all the different rod manufacturers world wide there are some really fine fishing rods on todays market. Ive used most all of them and I can see a lot of good features in most of these, but, the particular rods that I use (manufactured by Lamiglas) I find to be in the "Exceptional" catagory. I use Lamiglas Rods for many reasons such as; durability, strength, feel, comfort, quality, appearance, and selection and best of all, the Lamiglas Company has just about every type of fishing rod you will ever need for bass fishing.

PLASTIC RATTLES

When fishing with "Rattles" or "Glass & Brass" or any of these combinations with a Texas Rig, Carolina Rig, Tubes, etc. you will usually find that when fishing thick weeds, grass, moss, etc. the vegetation usually gets wrapped around your tackle (hooks, baits, swivels, and especially glass or brass beads!) and the whole purpose of the "Ticking Sound" is not what it should be, right? 


I found a company called H & H Plastic Rattles that has taken care of this problem. The company makes a sealed rattle for all the rigs mentioned as well as rattles for jigs, spinnerbaits, tubes, worms, and!!! they make these in color assortments to match your baits. 


Now, by placing the sealed Carolina Rig Rattle on your line and working the thick stuff, no matter how much vegetation gets on it, itll still make that ticking sound. After using Glass & Brass for so many years with all the frustrations that go with them, now I just simply put on a H & H Plastic Rattle made especially for Carolina Rigs and let me say, "Boy, do they work great!"

LURE RETRIEVERS

I used to own a lure retriever that consisted of a heavy weight with little handles sticking off of it and a line attached to it. Now, when the wind came up (like it usually does) it was almost impossible to direct the boat and try to send this contraption down to retrieve my lure, sound familiar?


I found a company that makes this retrieving thing simple! "Easy Retriever" is the name of it and it couldnt be easier to use. You just slip the clip on your line and down it goes, and most of the time it will knock your lure free from whatever obstruction it got hung up on. The best thing about this item is the cost!.... for a fraction of what I paid for the one with the string retriever you can actually purchase a package of (3) Easy Retrievers. A great time and money saver!

SCENTBOXES

I know youll love this one! When a angler uses a fish formula (or attractant) it is usually applied by squirting, pouring, or in the case of the jelly substances, rubbing and spreading it on the bait. I know from past experience that when you spray or pour this formula on a bait, some goes on your boat, yourself, and mostly in the water, right? These formulas are not good for the carpet or the finish of a boat. The average angler usually goes through several bottles of formula in the course of a season (especially if he or she uses it all the time.)


I have found a company that makes what they call a "Scentbox". It is a plastic box with the ability to hold usually 1/2 of a bottle of formula at a time and will last longer that you would usually go through about 5 bottles of formula, but, the best thing about this Scentbox is that you dont spill, spray, pour, or spread the formula on your carpet, boat, hands, or anything but the bait itself. You just simply grab the line right in front of the bait, lift the lid, place the bait onto the box, close the box, open it back up and make your cast. The Scentbox is truly one of the best products I have ever used!, in fact, 95% of my 3-Day Bass Fishing School students and Bass Charter clients have purchased these Scentboxes after using mine. The cost is about what you would pay for about 2 or 3 bottles of formula but you will save money because you wont go through near as much formula as you have in the past.

FISH FORMULAS

While being on the subject of the Scentbox, I found a certain Fish Formula (or Attractant) that works better than any Ive ever used in the past! This stuff is so good that Ive even doubled my setting ability with Jig & Pig combos using it, and if you have ever fished this type of bait you can understand what I mean, but not only Jig & Pig baits, this formula can be used on all artificial types of baits. The companys name is "Scientific Bass Products, Inc." and they make what they call "Kickn Bass" fish formula. Not only do they make a product for just bass, but they make a Kickn Trout and Kickn Catfish as well. Now, the nice part about the bass formulas is that they make a few different scents for bass such as Garlic, Crawfish, and a Anise Shad formula that really helps fish to hold on to your baits. As a pro angler, I know that a few extra seconds of a fish holding on to a bait can really make the difference between catching the fish or not!

UNDERWATER VIEWING

How many of you anglers have certain spots (honey holes) that youve been fishing for years? Wouldnt you like to find more spots like these?, of course you would! Now you can do just that with this product called the "CatchCam" made by the Axial Corporation. This under viewing camera is about the best you will find. I have one and the more I use it the better I like it. It has a 50 lead wire attached to a waterproof camera lens that is attached to a viewing screen to allow you to see anything on the bottom you want to see. I have fished many spots that held fish in the past but didnt know exactly why the areas held fish, but now I know. It is truly an amazing tool when it comes to locating bass, pre-fishing, or just learning why fish hold in certain areas. The picture on the viewing screen is crystal clear, in fact, you can see even the smallest blade of grass. Just remember, this shows the actual picture and not the liquid crystal image like you would see on your fish finder!

FISH CARE PRODUCTS

Probably one of the worst nightmares for a tournament angler is weighing in a dead fish. Not only does this hurt when you get points deducted from your total catch, but as a "Catch & Release" angler, nobody likes to see a dead sport fish, especially a bass! Guess what, I have some really good news.... I have stumbled onto a product called "Keep Alive" and what it is, is a oxygen infusor. I know you are probably wondering what in the world an oxygen infusor is so Ill tell you. This is a unit that you place in your livewell (it has suction cups on the bottom of it, completely submergible) take the wire lead clips and clip to your battery. Once the unit is operative it disperses millions of micro-fine bubbles that give more than a ample supply of oxygen to the fish in your livewell (which will keep them alive). This is good especially when fishing the warmer days when it gets hot and the surface temp get warm. Please!... make all efforts to keep the fish alive for release!......

BASS TOURNAMENT GOODIES

When fishing bass tournaments time is very precious right? I have found a couple of items that has really made a difference when it comes to not only the protection of fish, but has allowed me that few extra minutes needed to "Cash-In" in past tournaments, and has recently given me the extra precious minutes needed when I qualified for the Vermont B.A.S.S. Federation State Team for 2001. 


The first item is called "Bass Tags" made by Bag-Em Products. What this is, is a bass culling system that uses clips instead of stringer type snaps (that damage fish when you have to insert them). These clips with the colored tubes (attached) quickly attach to the fishs upper jaw securely without puncturing or damaging the fish. Along with this kit, you will receive a marking pencil and a weigh board to keep a quick record of your fish caught during the day.


The second product that the Bag-em Products Company makes is a great individual fish weigh bag that "once again" protects the fish from the damage of puncturing it when using the hook connected to your portable weigh scales. With this bag you simply put one fish in it, insert the hook from your scale into the provided holes already made into the bag (once again protecting the fish from puncture damage) and with the drain holes already provided in this unique bag it allows the water run out of the bag while weighing the fish for a accurate weight. Dont you just love companies that have "Fish Protection" in mind when it comes to the development of a product? This company also makes a very strong and durable Carry Bag (that will hold together!, not like others Ive used in the past that have either fallen apart or torn easily) with handles to carry those big stringers to the weigh-ins. All in all, the best thing about the Bag-em Products Company is that (I am very proud to announce!) they strive to be the global leader in the preservation of sport and tournament fishing by providing conservation minded products.

OUTDOOR PROTECTION

How many times while outdoors fishing have you been attacked by insects? This can be a real drag right?, especially while holding a rod in one hand and trying to reel in a fish with the other hand, then by time you get to put the rod down, youve been another victim of a insect bite. Or, how many times have you been out in the sun and got a good sunburn or even a windburn? Or, how many times have you been out fishing and get swarmed with Nats?......


I have been through all of these scenarios and then some and its not fun! So after doing some research on products that can remedy some of these problems, I not only found a company that has every product to take care of all of these situations, but this company also makes one of the best bass fishing products Ive seen in many years (which I will talk about in just a moment.)


The Tender Corporation is the companies name, and they make what they call a survivor pak that comes with the following items: 

 A power pen (which comes in handy when you solely depend on your flashlight batteries)..... 

 Natrapel (a Nat repellent)..... 

 Family Medic (a first aid cream)..... 

 Bens backyard formula (a insect repellent)..... 

 After Burn (a Aloe Vera base product that really soothes a burn from the sun or wind)..... 

 After Bite (a stick roll on to take away the itch from a insect bite)..... 

 A carry Bag (for all of these wonderful products to be carried in)..... 

 Usually we save the best for last, but before I tell you about this amazing product I need to relate to you why this product is so great. How many times have you went to make a cast with your rod when it gets wet from the rain and you almost throw your rod overboard? I know that I have lost a couple of rods in my days by doing just that, and I can assuredly say that it can mess up a good day, especially if its your favorite rod.


Now the last product you will find in this survivor pak is what the Tender Corporation calls "Dry Hands." This product is a solution you apply to your hands, rub it around and let it dry for a moment. Once youve done this, grab the handle of a "wet rod" and try to slide your hand down it using a little pressure, "You Cant Do It!" this solution actually prevents your rods from slipping out of your hands when you get wet. A big money saver?... Id say so!


The Tender Corporation makes all of these products separate of course, but with the survivor pak you get it all. I carry a pak both in my vehicle as well as my boat, and let me tell you, there has been several times I was grateful the products were there when I needed them.

CLOSING

Once again, these are all products that I have personally been involved with and will stand behind each and every one mentioned. All I can say is that you need to at least give them all a try and Im very confident that youll fully agree with me when I say that these products are second to none! If you would like more information on these products or would like to purchase any of these items please Email me at rlbrown@capital.net or call me at (518) 597-4240. Many of my Bass Fishing School students as well as Bass Charter clients are loyal to these products after using them. As the old saying goes; "Try it, Youll like it!"

About This BookReviewsTable of Contents 

Harvard University Press has partnered with De Gruyter to make available for sale worldwide virtually all in-copyright HUP books that had become unavailable since their original publication. The 2,800 titles in the “e-ditions” program can be purchased individually as PDF eBooks or as hardcover reprint (“print-on-demand”) editions via the “Available from De Gruyter” link above. They are also available to institutions in ten separate subject-area packages that reflect the entire spectrum of the Press’s catalog. More about the E-ditions Program »For many years, Roger Brown and his colleagues have studied the developing language of pre-school children—the language that ultimately will permit them to understand themselves and the world around them. This longitudinal research project records the conversational performances of three children, studying both semantic and grammatical aspects of their language development.
These core findings are related to recent work in psychology and linguistics—and especially to studies of the acquisition of languages other than English, including Finnish, German, Korean, and Samoan. Roger Brown has written the most exhaustive and searching analysis yet undertaken of the early stages of grammatical constructions and the meanings they convey.
The five stages of linguistic development Brown establishes are measured not by chronological age-since children vary greatly in the speed at which their speech develops—but by mean length of utterance. This volume treats the first two stages.
Stage I is the threshold of syntax, when children begin to combine words to make sentences. These sentences, Brown shows, are always limited to the same small set of semantic relations: nomination, recurrence, disappearance, attribution, possession, agency, and a few others.
Stage II is concerned with the modulations of basic structural meanings—modulations for number, time, aspect, specificity—through the gradual acquisition of grammatical morphemes such as inflections, prepositions, articles, and case markers. Fourteen morphemes are studied in depth and it is shown that the order of their acquisition is almost identical across children and is predicted by their relative semantic and grammatical complexity.
It is, ultimately, the intent of this work to focus on the nature and development of knowledge: knowledge concerning grammar and the meanings coded by grammar; knowledge inferred from performance, from sentences and the settings in which they are spoken, and from signs of comprehension or incomprehension of sentences.

July 13: Liu Xiaobo and the Responsibility of Being Alive
The Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Liu Xiaobo died today, a few short weeks after the Chinese government revealed that he was suffering from cancer that had progressed beyond treatment during his political imprisonment. The course of his life was forever altered by the Tiananmen Square demonstrations of 1989, and, as Perry Link notes at NYR Daily, Liu felt haunted by the “lost souls” of Tiananmen, “the aggrieved ghosts of students and workers alike whose ages would forever be the same as on the night they died.” His widow Liu Xia reports that he dedicated his Nobel Prize to them in 2010, as he’d done in 2003 after receiving an award from the Chinese Demo…

Roger Brown's College Notebook: Pinkerton product Polichetti settling into college baseball

By ROGER BROWN
March 19. 2017 1:11AM




Pinkerton grad John Polichetti is adjusting to college-level pitching in his first season at UMass Lowell. (Photo Courtesy of UMass Lowell)
UMASS-LOWELL freshman John Polichetti may have turned a corner in his collegiate baseball career last week when he collected five hits in three games (.455) and was named the America East Rookie of the Week.Polichetti had five hits in 11 at-bats, scored a run and drove in a run in Lowell's three victories: a doubleheader sweep of Manhattan and a 6-5 triumph over Delaware. He reached base in six of his 12 at-bats.Polichetti, an Atkinson resident who played high school baseball at Pinkerton Academy in Derry, said adjusting to college pitching has been difficult, but that his success last week helped his confidence at the plate. "The biggest difference for me is in high school you'd see one really good pitcher every few weeks, and in college you're facing a really good pitcher every day," Polichetti explained. "Across the board a (college) pitcher's ability to locate all three of his pitches is the biggest difference."My (offensive) numbers are low right now (he was batting .222 through 14 games) and I'm striking out more than I'm used to, but last week was really the first week where I was getting multiple hits per game and feeling good at the plate. It definitely was a breakout week for me."Polichetti had two hits, drove in three runs and walked once in Thursday's 13-6 victory over William & Mary. Although he played multiple positions in high school, Polichetti may have been known best as a pitcher during his days at Pinkerton. He's Lowell's starting third baseman and has been hitting sixth in the batting order. He said he may pitch in some midweek games for Lowell, but is concentrating on his offense and playing third."My mentality hasn't changed," he said. "Whatever the coach needs from me. I just wanted to find a way on the field and get to play every day. I'm grateful for the opportunity I have, but I don't want to get too comfortable because that's when things can get taken away from you."BaseballBrentwood's Jared Brescia, a freshman second baseman at Assumption, was named the Northeast-10 Rookie of the Week on Monday. Brescia hit .500 with a .636 on-base percentage to help Assumption post a 3-2 record in five games played in Florida. He had multiple hits in four of the five games, drew four walks, scored twice, stole two bases and had two RBIs.Brescia entered Saturday's doubleheader against New Haven batting .400 (16 for 40) and had collected at least one hit in 11 of Assumption's 13 games.Deerfield's Josh Partridge, a relief pitcher on the St. Joseph's College baseball team, was selected as the Great Northeast Athletic Conference Pitcher of the Week and was named to the D3Baseball.com Team of the Week on Monday. Partridge, who played at Concord High School, posted a 0.00 ERA in three relief appearances during the week. He recorded nine strikeouts, allowed three hits and didn't walk a batter in 8 2/3 innings. SoftballRochester's Shannon Colson, an outfielder on the St. Anselm College softball team, was named the Northeast-10 Conference's Rookie of the Week on Monday after she hit .391 (9 for 23) with a .462 on-base percentage during the first eight games of her college career.Men's basketballPlymouth State senior Jack Preston (Nashua) and freshman Jaylen Leroy (Manchester) were recently recognized by the the Little East Conference. Preston, a 6-foot-6 forward, was an LEC First-Team selection, and Leroy, a 6-foot-2 guard, was named to the LEC All-Rookie Team.Preston averaged 18.1 points and 8.1 rebounds per game last season. Leroy averaged 11.0 points per game and made 47 3-pointers, the most among freshmen in the league.Dartmouth sophomore Evan Boudreaux was named to the All-Ivy League Second Team last week. Boudreaux, a 6-foot-8 forward, finished the season as the Ivy League's leader in rebounding (9.5 per game) and ranked second in scoring (17.5 ppg). He was Dartmouth's leading rebounder in 25 of its 27 games and was the team's leading scorer in 21 contests.Colby-Sawyer sophomore Jourdain Bell was named to the Eastern College Athletic Conference Division III New England Men's Basketball First Team.Bell, a Manchester resident, averaged a team-high 20.1 points per game. He also led the Chargers in steals (54) and was second in assists (97). He ranked 18th nationally among Division III players in minutes players and was 40th in points scored.Londonderry's Marc Corey, a sophomore forward at St. Joseph's College, was named to the Great Northeast Athletic Conference Second Team. Corey averaged 10.8 points. 5.4 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game last season. He led the team in made 3-point shots with 39.Portsmouth's Harry Rafferty, a senior at Wesleyan, was named to the NESCAC Second Team after he averaged 13 points per game in 26 contests last season.Women's basketballRochester's Emily Benway, a sophomore forward at St. Joseph's College, was selected to the Maine Women's Basketball Coaches' Association All-State Second Team. Benway averaged 13.5 points and a team-high 8.7 rebounds per game during the 2016-17 season.Women's hockeySt. Anselm College coach Kerstin Matthews has been named one of eight finalists for the CCM American Hockey Coaches' Association Women's College Division Coach of the Year on Tuesday.Matthews, who was named the New England Hockey Conference Coach of the Year last month, led St. Anselm to NEHC regular-season and NEHC Open championships last season, when the Hawks posted a 22-2-3 record. The regular-season title was St. Anselm's first since 2007-08. It was the third time in the last four years the Hawks have won at least 20 games.Track and fieldKeene State senior Katelyn Terry was named the Little East Conference Women's Indoor Track Athlete of the Year. Terry, a Strafford resident, turned in a strong performance at the LEC/New England Alliance Championships, where she placed first in the 400-meter dash with a season-best time of 58.46. She also finished second in the 800 (2:21.91) and was fifth in the triple jump (10.56). Terry was also a part of the 4x400 relay that finished first (4:08.41).Plymouth State University sophomore Sam Brunnette was named the Little East Conference Men's Indoor Track Athlete of the Year, and freshman Derek Davies (Londonderry) was selected as the LEC Men's Indoor Field Athlete of the Year.Brunnette finished fifth in the mile at the New England Division III Championships in 4:17.84.

His personal best of 4.10 meters ranks 19th in New England.Moravian College senior Meg Brockett competed at the NCAA Division III Indoor Track & Field national championships earlier this month at North Central (Ill.)

Rubber components are used in many demanding applications, from tyres and seals to gloves and medical devices, and failure can be catastrophic. This review of rubber product failure outlines and illustrates the common causes of failure, while addressing ways of avoiding it. There has been increasing pressure to improve performance so that rubbers can be used at higher temperatures and in harsher environments. For example, the under-the-bonnet temperature has increased in some vehicles and new medical devices require longer lifetimes in potentially degrading biological fluids. The expectations of tyre performance in particular are increasing, and retreads have been in the spotlight for failures. The definition of failure depends on the application. For example, a racing car engine seal that lasts for one race may be acceptable, but in a normal car a life span of 10 years is more reasonable. If appearance is critical as in surface coatings and paints, then discolouration is failure, whilst in seals leakage is not acceptable. Each rubber product must be fit for the use specified by the consumer. Failure analysis is critical to product improvement. The problem is obvious to see, for example a hole in a hot water bottle, but the cause of the problem can be much harder to find. It can range from a design fault to poor material selection, to processing problems, to manufacturing errors such as poor dimensional tolerances, to poor installation, product abuse and unexpected service conditions. The rubber technologist must become a detective, gathering evidence, understanding the material type and using deductive reasoning. Testing and analysis of failed materials and components add to the information available for failure analysis. For example, stored aged tyres appeared superficially to be alright for use, but on drum testing small cracks grew more quickly than in new tyres leading to rapid failure in service. Quality control procedures such as product inspection, testing and material quality checks can help to reach 100% reliability. In critical applications such as electricians gloves for high voltage working, gloves are inspected before each use, while engine seals may be routinely replaced before the expected lifetime to avoid problems. It is customary to hide failures, thus the number of specific cases published in the literature is not high. However, several reviews have been written on specific products and references can be found at the end of this review. Around 400 abstracts from papers in the Polymer Library are included with an index. Subjects covered include tyre wear and failure, seals, engine components, rubber bonding failure, rubber failure due to chloramine in water, tank treads, gloves and condoms, medical devices and EPDM roofing membranes.

Executive Summary
Ever since it became clear that smart design led to the success of many products, companies have been employing it in other areas, from customer experiences, to strategy, to business ecosystems. But as design is used in increasingly complex contexts, a new hurdle has emerged: gaining acceptance of the “designed artifact” into the status quo. In fact, the more innovative a new design is, the more resistance it’s likely to meet. The solution, say the CEO of IDEO and the Rotman School’s former dean, is to also apply design thinking to the introduction of the innovation itself.
This process, intervention design, grew organically out of the iterative prototyping that designers did to help understand customers’ reactions to new products. Not only did iterative prototyping create better offerings, but it was a great way to get organizational funding and commitment, because it improved the chances of success and reduced fear of the unknown. Intervention design uses iterative prototyping to get buy-in too, but extends it to interactions with all the principal stakeholders—not just customers.
When Intercorp Group devised a revolutionary concept for Peru’s schools, it needed to win acceptance for corporate-run education and for a very different role for teachers. Thanks to intervention design, it now has 29 schools in operation and is rapidly growing.
HBR Reprint R1509C



Idea in Brief

The Problem
Complex new designs of products (say, an electric vehicle) or systems (like a school system) typically struggle to gain acceptance. Many good groundbreaking ideas fail in the starting gate.
Why It Happens
New products and systems often require people to change established business models and behaviors. As a result they encounter stiff resistance from their intended beneficiaries and from the people who have to deliver or operate them.
The Solution
Treat the introduction of the new product or system—the “designed artifact”—as a design challenge itself. When Intercorp Group in Peru took that approach, it won acceptance for a new technology-enabled school concept in which the teacher facilitates learning rather than serves as the sole lesson provider.


Throughout most of history, design was a process applied to physical objects. Raymond Loewy designed trains. Frank Lloyd Wright designed houses. Charles Eames designed furniture. Coco Chanel designed haute couture. Paul Rand designed logos. David Kelley designed products, including (most famously) the mouse for the Apple computer.
But as it became clear that smart, effective design was behind the success of many commercial goods, companies began employing it in more and more contexts. High-tech firms that hired designers to work on hardware (to, say, come up with the shape and layout of a smartphone) began asking them to create the look and feel of user-interface software. Then designers were asked to help improve user experiences. Soon firms were treating corporate strategy making as an exercise in design. Today design is even applied to helping multiple stakeholders and organizations work better as a system.

 The Explainer: Design Thinking 

      Popularized by David M. Kelley and Tim Brown of IDEO and Roger Martin of the Rotman School, design thinking has three major stages.

 Share



 See More Videos >


 See More Videos >







This is the classic path of intellectual progress. Each design process is more complicated and sophisticated than the one before it. Each was enabled by learning from the preceding stage. Designers could easily turn their minds to graphical user interfaces for software because they had experience designing the hardware on which the applications would run. Having crafted better experiences for computer users, designers could readily take on nondigital experiences, like patients’ hospital visits. And once they learned how to redesign the user experience in a single organization, they were more prepared to tackle the holistic experience in a system of organizations. The San Francisco Unified School District, for example, recently worked with IDEO to help redesign the cafeteria experience across all its schools.
As design has moved further from the world of products, its tools have been adapted and extended into a distinct new discipline: design thinking. Arguably, Nobel laureate Herbert Simon got the ball rolling with the 1969 classic The Sciences of the Artificial, which characterized design not so much as a physical process as a way of thinking. And Richard Buchanan made a seminal advance in his 1992 article “Wicked Problems in Design Thinking,” in which he proposed using design to solve extraordinarily persistent and difficult challenges.
But as the complexity of the design process increases, a new hurdle arises: the acceptance of what we might call “the designed artifact”—whether product, user experience, strategy, or complex system—by stakeholders. In the following pages we’ll explain this new challenge and demonstrate how design thinking can help strategic and system innovators make the new worlds they’ve imagined come to pass. In fact, we’d argue that with very complex artifacts, the design of their “intervention”—their introduction and integration into the status quo—is even more critical to success than the design of the artifacts themselves.
The New Challenge
The launch of a new product that resembles a company’s other offerings—say, a hybrid version of an existing car model—is typically seen as a positive thing. It produces new revenue and few perceived downsides for the organization. The new vehicle doesn’t cause any meaningful changes to the organization or the way its people work, so the design isn’t inherently threatening to anyone’s job or to the current power structure.

The Launch Is Just One Step in the Process

In his book Sketching User Experiences, user interface pioneer Bill Buxton describes the Apple iPod as the “overnight success” that took three years to happen. He documents the many design changes to the device that took place after its launch—and were essential to its eventual success.
As this story illustrates, a sophisticated designer recognizes that the task is first to build user acceptance of a new platform and later to add new features. When Jeff Hawkins developed the PalmPilot, the world’s first successful personal digital assistant, he insisted that it focus on only three things—a calendar, contacts, and notes—because he felt users initially could not handle complexity greater than that. Over time the PalmPilot evolved to include many more functions, but by then the core market understood the experience. The initial pitch for the iPod was an extremely simple “1,000 songs in your pocket.” The iTunes store, photos, games, and apps came along later, as users adopted the platform and welcomed more complexity.
As strategies and large systems become the focus of design thinking, imagining the launch as just one of many steps in introducing a new concept will become even more important. Before the launch, designers will confront increasing complexity in early dialogues with both the artifact’s intended users and the decision maker responsible for the design effort. A solution with purposely lower complexity will be introduced, but it will be designed to evolve as users respond. Iteration and an explicit role for users will be a key part of any intervention design.
New information and computing technologies will make it far easier to create and share early prototypes, even if they are complex systems, and gain feedback from a more diverse population of users. In this new world, the launch of a new design ceases to be the focus. Rather, it is just one step somewhere in the middle of a carefully designed intervention.
—Tim Brown


Of course, introducing something new is always worrisome. The hybrid might fail in the marketplace. That would be costly and embarrassing. It might cause other vehicles in the portfolio to be phased out, producing angst for those who support the older models. Yet the designer usually pays little attention to such concerns. Her job is to create a truly great new car, and the knock-on effects are left to others—people in marketing or HR—to manage.
The more complex and less tangible the designed artifact is, though, the less feasible it is for the designer to ignore its potential ripple effects. The business model itself may even need to be changed. That means the introduction of the new artifact requires design attention as well.
Consider this example: A couple of years ago, MassMutual was trying to find innovative ways to persuade people younger than 40 to buy life insurance—a notoriously hard sell. The standard approach would have been to design a special life insurance product and market it in the conventional way. But MassMutual concluded that this was unlikely to work. Instead the company worked with IDEO to design a completely new type of customer experience focused more broadly on educating people about long-term financial planning.
Launched in October 2014, “Society of Grownups” was conceived as a “master’s program for adulthood.” Rather than delivering it purely as an online course, the company made it a multichannel experience, with state-of-the-art digital budgeting and financial-planning tools, offices with classrooms and a library customers could visit, and a curriculum that included everything from investing in a 401(k) to buying good-value wine. That approach was hugely disruptive to the organization’s norms and processes, as it required not only a new brand and new digital tools but also new ways of working. In fact, every aspect of the organization had to be redesigned for the new service, which is intended to evolve as participants provide MassMutual with fresh insights into their needs.













When it comes to very complex artifacts—say, an entire business ecosystem—the problems of integrating a new design loom larger still. For example, the successful rollout of self-driving vehicles will require automobile manufacturers, technology providers, regulators, city and national governments, service firms, and end users to collaborate in new ways and engage in new behaviors. How will insurers work with manufacturers and users to analyze risk? How will data collected from self-driving cars be shared to manage traffic flows while protecting privacy?
New designs on this scale are intimidating. No wonder many genuinely innovative strategies and systems end up on a shelf somewhere—never acted on in any way. However, if you approach a large-scale change as two simultaneous and parallel challenges—the design of the artifact in question and the design of the intervention that brings it to life—you can increase the chances that it will take hold.
Designing the Intervention
Intervention design grew organically out of the iterative prototyping that was introduced to the design process as a way to better understand and predict customers’ reactions to a new artifact. In the traditional approach, product developers began by studying the user and creating a product brief. Then they worked hard to create a fabulous design, which the firm launched in the market. In the design-oriented approach popularized by IDEO, the work to understand users was deeper and more ethnographic than quantitative and statistical.
Initially, that was the significant distinction between the old and new approaches. But IDEO realized that no matter how deep the up-front understanding was, designers wouldn’t really be able to predict users’ reactions to the final product. So IDEO’s designers began to reengage with the users sooner, going to them with a very low-resolution prototype to get early feedback. Then they kept repeating the process in short cycles, steadily improving the product until the user was delighted with it. When IDEO’s client actually launched the product, it was an almost guaranteed success—a phenomenon that helped make rapid prototyping a best practice.

Iterative rapid-cycle prototyping didn’t just improve the artifact. It turned out to be a highly effective way to obtain the funding and organizational commitment to bring the new artifact to market. A new product, especially a relatively revolutionary one, always involves a consequential bet by the management team giving it the green light.
Often, fear of the unknown kills the new idea. With rapid prototyping, however, a team can be more confident of market success. This effect turns out to be even more important with complex, intangible designs.
In corporate strategy making, for example, a traditional approach is to have the strategist—whether in-house or a consultant—define the problem, devise the solution, and present it to the executive in charge. Often that executive has one of the following reactions: (1) This doesn’t address the problems I think are critical. (2) These aren’t the possibilities I would have considered. (3) These aren’t the things I would have studied. (4) This isn’t an answer that’s compelling to me. As a consequence, winning commitment to the strategy tends to be the exception rather than the rule, especially when the strategy represents a meaningful deviation from the status quo.
The answer is iterative interaction with the decision maker. This means going to the responsible executive early on and saying, “We think this is the problem we need to solve; to what extent does that match your view?” Soon thereafter the strategy designers go back again and say, “Here are the possibilities we want to explore, given the problem definition we agreed on; to what extent are they the possibilities you imagine? Are we missing some, and are any we’re considering nonstarters for you?” Later the designers return one more time to say, “We plan to do these analyses on the possibilities that we’ve agreed are worth exploring; to what extent are they analyses that you would want done, and are we missing any?”
With this approach, the final step of actually introducing a new strategy is almost a formality. The executive responsible for green-lighting it has helped define the problem, confirm the possibilities, and affirm the analyses. The proposed direction is no longer a jolt from left field. It has gradually won commitment throughout the process of its creation.
When the challenge is introducing change to a system—by, say, establishing a new kind of business or a new kind of school—the interactions have to extend even further, to all the principal stakeholders. We’ll now look at an example of this kind of intervention design, which involved a major experiment in social engineering that’s taking place in Peru.
Designing a New Peru
Intercorp Group is one of Peru’s biggest corporations, controlling almost 30 companies across a wide variety of industries. Its CEO, Carlos Rodríguez-Pastor Jr., inherited the company from his father, a former political exile who, upon his return in 1994, led a consortium that bought one of Peru’s largest banks, Banco Internacional del Peru, from the government. Rodríguez-Pastor took control of the bank when his father died, in 1995.














Rodríguez-Pastor wanted to be more than a banker. His ambition was to help transform Peru’s economy by building up its middle class. In the newly renamed Interbank he saw an opportunity to both create middle-class jobs and cater to middle-class needs. From the outset, however, he grasped that he couldn’t achieve this goal with the “great man” approach to strategy characteristic of the large, family-controlled conglomerates that often dominate emerging economies. Reaching it would take the carefully engineered engagement of many stakeholders.
Seeding a culture of innovation.
The first task was making the bank competitive. For ideas, Rodríguez-Pastor decided to look to the leading financial marketplace in his hemisphere, the United States. He persuaded an analyst at a U.S. brokerage house to let him join an investor tour of U.S. banks, even though Interbank wasn’t one of the broker’s clients.
If he wanted to build a business that could trigger social change, absorbing some insights by himself and bringing them home wouldn’t be enough, Rodríguez-Pastor realized. If he simply imposed his own ideas, buy-in would depend largely on his authority—not a context conducive to social transformation. He needed his managers to learn how to develop insights too, so that they could also spot and seize opportunities for advancing his broader ambition. So he talked the analyst into allowing four of his colleagues to join the tour.
This incident was emblematic of his participative approach to strategy making, which enabled Rodríguez-Pastor to build a strong, innovative management team that put the bank on a competitive footing and diversified the company into a range of businesses catering to the middle class: supermarkets, department stores, pharmacies, and cinemas. By 2015 Intercorp, the group built around Interbank, employed some 55,000 people and had projected revenues of $5 billion.
Over the years, Rodríguez-Pastor has expanded his investment in educating the management team. He sent managers each year to programs at top schools and companies (such as Harvard Business School and IDEO) and worked with those institutions to develop new programs for Intercorp, tossing out ideas that didn’t work and refining ones that did. Most recently, in conjunction with IDEO, Intercorp launched its own design center, La Victoria Lab. Located in an up-and-coming area of Lima, it serves as the core of a growing urban innovation hub.
But Rodríguez-Pastor didn’t stop at creating an innovative business group targeting middle-class consumers. The next step in his plan for social transformation involved moving Intercorp outside the traditional business domain.
From wallets to hearts and minds.
Good education is critical to a thriving middle class, but Peru was severely lagging in this department. The country’s public schools were lamentable, and the private sector was little better at equipping children for a middle-class future. Unless that changed, a positive cycle of productivity and prosperity was unlikely to emerge. Rodríguez-Pastor concluded that Intercorp would have to enter the education business with a value proposition targeted at middle-class parents.

Winning social acceptability for this venture was the real challenge—one complicated by the fact that education is always a minefield of vested interests. An intervention design, therefore, would be critical to the schools’ success. Rodríguez-Pastor worked closely with IDEO to map one out. They began by priming the stakeholders, who might well balk at the idea of a large business group operating schools for children—a controversial proposition even in a business-friendly country like the United States.
Intercorp’s first move was starting an award in 2007 for “the teacher who leaves a footprint,” given to the best teacher in each of the country’s 25 regions. It quickly became famous, in part because every teacher who received it also won a car. This established Intercorp’s genuine interest in improving education in Peru and helped pave the way for teachers, civil servants, and parents to accept the idea of a chain of schools owned by the company.
Next, in 2010 Intercorp purchased a small school business called San Felipe Neri, managed by entrepreneur Jorge Yzusqui Chessman. With one school in operation and two more in development, Chessman had plans for growth, but Intercorp’s experience in building large-scale businesses in Peru could take the venture far beyond what he envisioned. However, the business would have to reengineer its existing model, which required highly skilled teachers, who were in extremely short supply in Peru. Rodríguez-Pastor brought together managers from his other businesses—a marketing expert from his bank, a facilities expert from his supermarket chain, for instance—with IDEO to create a new model, Innova Schools. It would offer excellent education at a price affordable for middle-class families.
The team launched a six-month human-centered design process. It engaged hundreds of students, teachers, parents, and other stakeholders, exploring their needs and motivations, involving them in testing approaches, and soliciting their feedback on classroom layout and interactions. The result was a technology-enabled model that incorporated platforms such as the U.S. online-education pioneer Khan Academy. In it the teacher was positioned as a facilitator rather than the sole lesson provider.
The intervention design challenge was that parents might object to having their children learn via laptops in the classroom, and teachers might rebel at the notion of supporting learning rather than leading it. So after six months of preparation, Innova launched a full-scale pilot and brought in parents and teachers to design and run it.













The pilot demonstrated that students, parents, and teachers loved the model, but some of the assumptions were far off base. Parents didn’t object to the teaching approach; in fact, they insisted that the laptops not be taken away at the end of the pilot. Additionally, 85% of the students used the laptops outside classroom hours. The model was tweaked on the basis of the insights from the pilot, and both the parents and teachers became huge advocates for the Innova model in nearby locations.
Word of mouth spread, and soon the schools were fully enrolled before they were even built. Because Innova had a reputation for innovation, teachers wanted to work there, even though it paid less than the public system. With 29 schools up and running, Innova is now on track to meet its goal of 70 schools by 2020 and plans to expand into every market in Peru and even markets outside the country.
Spreading the wealth.
If it followed conventional business wisdom, Intercorp would have focused on the richer parts of the country’s capital, Lima, where a middle class was naturally emerging. But Rodríguez-Pastor recognized that the provinces needed a middle class as well. Fostering one there obviously involved job creation. One way Intercorp could create jobs was to expand its supermarket chain, which it had purchased from Royal Ahold in 2003 and renamed Supermercados Peruanos.
In 2007 the chain began establishing stores in the provinces. Local consumers were certainly receptive to the idea. When one store opened in Huancayo, curious customers queued up for an hour or more to enter it. For many it was their first experience with modern retail. By 2010 the chain was operating 67 supermarkets in nine regions. Today it boasts 102 stores nationwide.
Early on, Intercorp realized that retail ventures of this kind risked impoverishing local communities rather than enriching them. Though a supermarket did provide well-paid jobs, it could hurt the business of local farmers and producers. Since they were small scale and usually operated with low food-safety standards, it would be tempting to source almost everything from Lima. But the logistics costs of doing that would erode profit margins, and if the chain crowded out the local producers, it might destroy more jobs than it created.
Intercorp thus needed to stimulate local production through early engagement with local businesses. In 2010 the company launched the Perú Pasión program, with support from the Corporación Andina de Fomento (an NGO) and Huancayo’s regional government. Perú Pasión helps farmers and small manufacturers upgrade their capabilities enough to supply their local Supermercados Peruano. Over time some of these suppliers have even developed into regional or national suppliers in their own right.
Currently, Supermercados Peruanos sources 218 products, representing approximately $1.5 million in annual sales, from Perú Pasión businesses. One is Procesadora de Alimentos Velasquez. Originally a neighborhood bakery serving a few small nearby grocery shops, it began supplying a Supermercados store in 2010, generating just $6,000 in annual sales. Today, thanks to Perú Pasión’s help, it supplies three stores for nearly $40,000 in annual sales. Concepción Lacteos, a dairy producer, is another success. In 2010 it began supplying its local Supermercados store for about $2,500 in annual sales. In 2014 it supplied 28 stores, including the chain’s upscale outlets in Lima, and generated $100,000 in sales.
Intercorp’s success in boosting the middle class in Peru depended on the thoughtful design of many artifacts: a leading-edge bank, an innovative school system, and businesses adapted for frontier towns across Peru. But equally important has been the design of the introduction of these new artifacts into the status quo. Rodríguez-Pastor carefully mapped out the steps necessary to engage all the relevant parties in their adoption. He deepened the skills of the executives on his leadership team, increased the design know-how of his people, won over teachers and parents to the idea that a conglomerate could provide education, and partnered with local producers to build their capacity to supply supermarkets. In conjunction with well-designed artifacts, these carefully designed interventions have made the social transformation of Peru a real possibility rather than an idealistic aspiration.
The principles of this approach are clear and consistent. Intervention is a multistep process—consisting of many small steps, not a few big ones. Along the entire journey interactions with the users of a complex artifact are essential to weeding out bad designs and building confidence in the success of good ones.
Design thinking began as a way to improve the process of designing tangible products. But that’s not where it will end. The Intercorp story and others like it show that design thinking principles have the potential to be even more powerful when applied to managing the intangible challenges involved in getting people to engage with and adopt innovative new ideas and experiences.
