Our Story
How a game-changing goggle was born

















	Fog.
	The biggest
	buzz kill.

	You’re at the top of the run and ready to rip it up. But there’s a problem we’ve all had that will stop any session cold: fogged goggles.

	Fog is made when vapor in the air turns to water faster than it can evaporate. The biggest bummer is when that happens inside your goggles. And once they're fogged, your session is struggling. If you can't see, you can't ski.






The solution: klair™ technology







How it works

	Our patented KLAIR™ technology places an invisible heat-conductive film between a two-part lens. The battery sends a current through the film to heat the lens and keep fog away all day. It's the most powerful, comfortable, effective technology ever put in a goggle.


Active anti-fog vs. fog resistant

	Fog resistant goggles fail because they're more work than they're worth, requiring you to constantly adjust vents, turn on fans, or repeatedly wipe the lens.

	Active Anti-Fog technology works without you having to do anything because the lens is continuously powered—never allowing fog to form in the first place.

Abom, Inc. Warranty and Customer Support

Limited Warranty


                Abom goggles (the “Product”) are covered by a limited warranty (the “Limited Warranty”).  The terms and conditions of the Limited Warranty are provided below.
            

Scope of Limited Warranty


                Abom warrants that the Product will be free from defects in materials and workmanship for the Limited Warranty Period (defined below).  Abom does not warrant any user-caused lens scratches, normal wear and tear, or any damage or defects caused by improper care, negligence, modifications or alterations, improper product use, abuse, accidents, or loss of the Product.  Abom has the sole discretion to determine manufacturer’s defects.  If the Product suffers from a defect covered by the Limited Warranty, Abom will repair or replace the Product at its own cost.
            


                The Limited Warranty is only available to (1) the Product’s original purchaser and (2) a person who receives the Product as a gift from the original purchaser.  The Limited Warranty is only available if the Product was purchased from an authorized Abom dealer.
            

Limited Warranty Period


                The Limited Warranty lasts for a period of one year from the date of purchase by the Product’s original purchaser (the “Limited Warranty Period”), even if the original purchaser gives the Product to another individual at a later date.  To make a timely Limited Warranty claim, Abom must receive notice of your claim within the Limited Warranty Period.  If you make a Limited Warranty claim and Abom provides you with a replacement Product, a new one year Limited Warranty Period will begin as to the replacement Product.  The new one year Limited Warranty Period will start from the date that Abom ships you the replacement Product.
            

Scope of Implied Warranties


                All implied warranties, including the warranty of merchantability and the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, are limited to the Limited Warranty Period.  ABOM EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES FOR PERIODS BEYOND ONE YEAR FROM THE PRODUCT’S ORIGNAL PURCHASE DATE.
            

How to Make a Limited Warranty Claim


                To make a Limited Warranty claim, please contact Abom’s U.S. Headquarters at (844) 246-ABOM, Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Pacific time, or email us at warranty@abom.com.  To make a claim, you must provide a receipt for the Product showing that it was purchased from an authorized Abom dealer and that the Product is still within the Limited Warranty Period.  You will also be asked to provide details of the defect or problem with the Product.
            


                Upon reviewing the information that you provide, Abom will notify you whether your claim has been approved, denied, or tentatively approved.  Your claim may be tentatively approved if, for example, Abom must examine the Product in person to verify the defect.  Abom reserves the right to request any information or evidence that it needs to evaluate whether you have a valid claim.  Abom may require you to ship the Product to Abom for examination, repair, or replacement.  If shipment is required, you are responsible for any shipping, insurance, or other transportation costs, as well as any import fees, duties, and taxes. If shipment is required, send the Product, along with any other information Abom requests, to Abom’s U.S. Headquarters, located at:
            

            Abom, Inc.
            7145 SW Varns Street, Suite 101
            Portland, Oregon  97223
            Abom will pay the return shipping for all accepted Limited Warranty claims.

Applicability of State, Federal, and International Laws

For Immediate Release
Natasha Lucero-ConklinBackbone Medianatasha.lucero@backbonemedia.net(970) 963-4873, ext. 128Portand, Ore. — Jun 30, 2017Abom, Inc., manufacturer of the world’s first anti-fogging, heated goggles, announces an update to its intellectual property (IP) holdings. The U.S. Patent Office recently awarded Abom patent number 9,678,367, bringing the company’s total number to 19, with another 41 patent applications pending.
The new patent describes a multi-pane, multi-geometry eye-shield adapted to be interchangeably installed into the frame of a goggle, and optionally adapted for heating to prevent fogging.
“We believe that one of the best ways to build and protect value for our stakeholders and partners is to invest in intellectual property,” said Jack Cornelius, CEO of Abom. “Our portfolio of core patents surrounded by supporting patents gives us a point of leverage with competitors and opens up the opportunity for more licensing.”
Abom’s patents are divided into three groupings: structural, environmental and power management. Abom has launched eyewear products that eradicate foggy lenses in snowsports, military, tactical and safety markets. Abom’s ballistic-rated military winter goggles were recently tested by the U.S. Army with positive results.
About Abom, Inc.Founded in 2014, Abom, Inc., launched the world’s first microcontroller-managed heated fog-free goggles. Led by a group of investors, scientists and designers, Abom is on a mission to make the future safer and more fun with leading-edge technology. Look for more announcements in the future about new Abom products or products from Abom technology licensees, as other new products are on the drawing board for applications in various sports and industrial markets.

Abom, Inc, Announces Partnership With ADS, Inc.
other  /  October 10, 2016




Abom, Inc., the company that developed and patented heated lenses to prevent fogging in goggles and other protective eyewear, announced today that it has entered into a partnership with ADS, Inc.
ADS links military branches, first responders, law enforcement and government agencies with today’s most technically advanced product solutions. Based in Virginia Beach, ADS works with innovative suppliers across a range of industries to develop customized solutions that help customers overcome challenges and achieve mission success.
“We’re honored to have been selected as a product partner of such a highly regarded and productive organization,” said Jack Cornelius, Abom CEO. “We look forward to collaborating with the team at ADS in order to expand our reach and provide the very best anti-fog protective eyewear solutions in military and tactical sales markets.”
“We pride ourselves on connecting our customers with the finest products and solutions available,” said Parker Jarvis, ADS Senior Business Development Manager.  “Abom’s patented design and technology offer unique capabilities that provide an advantage for operators in a variety of scenarios.”
Abom has built a portfolio of 12 issued and 47 pending patents in three groupings (structural, environmental and power management) to provide a comprehensive and rapid solution to fogging. Abom’s snowsports goggles have received worldwide recognition, including Freeskier magazine’s “Best Of” selection, Popular Science magazine’s “Best of What’s New” list and Outside magazine’s Design & Tech package and “Best of the Show” award at the annual Snowsports Industry Association (SIA) tradeshow. Its goggles were selected as 2016/2017 ISPO category award-winner, among the most innovative outdoor products in the world and were also selected as a “gold medal winner” in the 2016 Edison Awards, Sports and Travel category.
Abom has also launched eyewear products that eradicate foggy lenses for the military, tactical and safety markets.  Abom’s ballistic-rated military winter goggles were recently tested by the U.S. Army and the testing team relayed their feedback about Abom’s anti-fog capability in one word: “awesome.”

Our Story
How a game-changing goggle was born











Fog.The biggestbuzz kill.
You’re at the top of the run and ready to rip it up. But there’s a problem we’ve all had that will stop any session cold: fogged goggles.Fog is made when vapor in the air turns to water faster than it can evaporate. The biggest bummer is when that happens inside your goggles. And once they're fogged, your session is struggling. If you can't see, you can't ski.






The solution: klair™ technology






How it worksOur patented KLAIR™ technology places an invisible heat-conductive film between a two-part lens. The battery sends a current through the film to heat the lens and keep fog away all day. It's the most powerful, comfortable, effective technology ever put in a goggle.Active anti-fog vs. fog resistantFog resistant goggles fail because they're more work than they're worth, requiring you to constantly adjust vents, turn on fans, or repeatedly wipe the lens. Active Anti-Fog technology works without you having to do anything because the lens is continuously powered—never allowing fog to form in the first place.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.

Our Story
How a game-changing goggle was born

















	Fog.
	The biggest
	buzz kill.

	You’re at the top of the run and ready to rip it up. But there’s a problem we’ve all had that will stop any session cold: fogged goggles.

	Fog is made when vapor in the air turns to water faster than it can evaporate. The biggest bummer is when that happens inside your goggles. And once they're fogged, your session is struggling. If you can't see, you can't ski.






The solution: klair™ technology







How it works

	Our patented KLAIR™ technology places an invisible heat-conductive film between a two-part lens. The battery sends a current through the film to heat the lens and keep fog away all day. It's the most powerful, comfortable, effective technology ever put in a goggle.


Active anti-fog vs. fog resistant

	Fog resistant goggles fail because they're more work than they're worth, requiring you to constantly adjust vents, turn on fans, or repeatedly wipe the lens.

	Active Anti-Fog technology works without you having to do anything because the lens is continuously powered—never allowing fog to form in the first place.
