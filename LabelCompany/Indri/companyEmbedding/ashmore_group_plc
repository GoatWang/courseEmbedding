Assets under management increased by US$2.8 billion during the period, comprising positive investment performance of US$1.6 billion and net inflows of US$1.2 billion.
Momentum in gross sales continued across the product range in the quarter and gross redemptions reduced again quarter-on-quarter. Subscriptions were from a diverse range of client types, and included both new mandates and additional allocations from existing clients. Net inflows were delivered in blended debt, corporate debt, equities and alternatives, while flows were flat in external debt, multi-asset and overlay/liquidity. Local currency experienced a net outflow as a consequence of a large institutional account redemption. 
Emerging Markets assets continued to deliver good absolute returns during the quarter and outperformed developed world fixed income and equity markets. Ashmore's investment processes generated positive investment performance across its fixed income and equities investment themes, with particularly strong performance in local currency followed by external debt. Performance was flat in multi-asset, alternatives and overlay/liquidity. The Group's investment track record relative to benchmarks remains strong over one, three and five years.
Mark Coombs, Chief Executive Officer, Ashmore Group plc, commented:
"Ashmore has performed well over the past 12 months, delivering a 12% increase in AuM through strong investment performance and net inflows in the past two quarters. Emerging Markets asset prices have started to reflect the resilient fundamentals of the underlying economies and investor activity levels are responding. Looking ahead, there is substantial absolute and relative value still available in Emerging Markets and investor allocations have much further to run from their significantly underweight levels."
 
Notes
1. For the translation of US dollar-denominated balance sheet items, the GBP/USD exchange rate was 1.2946 at 30 June 2017 (30 June 2016: 1.3234; 31 December 2016: 1.2340). For the translation of US dollar management fees, the average GBP/USD exchange rate achieved for the financial year was 1.2766 (FY2015/16: 1.4759).
Ashmore will announce its financial results in respect of the year ended 30 June 2017 on 7 September 2017.

Assets under management increased by US$2.8 billion during the period, comprising positive investment performance of US$1.6 billion and net inflows of US$1.2 billion.
Momentum in gross sales continued across the product range in the quarter and gross redemptions reduced again quarter-on-quarter. Subscriptions were from a diverse range of client types, and included both new mandates and additional allocations from existing clients. Net inflows were delivered in blended debt, corporate debt, equities and alternatives, while flows were flat in external debt, multi-asset and overlay/liquidity. Local currency experienced a net outflow as a consequence of a large institutional account redemption. 
Emerging Markets assets continued to deliver good absolute returns during the quarter and outperformed developed world fixed income and equity markets. Ashmore's investment processes generated positive investment performance across its fixed income and equities investment themes, with particularly strong performance in local currency followed by external debt. Performance was flat in multi-asset, alternatives and overlay/liquidity. The Group's investment track record relative to benchmarks remains strong over one, three and five years.
Mark Coombs, Chief Executive Officer, Ashmore Group plc, commented:
"Ashmore has performed well over the past 12 months, delivering a 12% increase in AuM through strong investment performance and net inflows in the past two quarters. Emerging Markets asset prices have started to reflect the resilient fundamentals of the underlying economies and investor activity levels are responding. Looking ahead, there is substantial absolute and relative value still available in Emerging Markets and investor allocations have much further to run from their significantly underweight levels."
 
Notes
1. For the translation of US dollar-denominated balance sheet items, the GBP/USD exchange rate was 1.2946 at 30 June 2017 (30 June 2016: 1.3234; 31 December 2016: 1.2340). For the translation of US dollar management fees, the average GBP/USD exchange rate achieved for the financial year was 1.2766 (FY2015/16: 1.4759).
Ashmore will announce its financial results in respect of the year ended 30 June 2017 on 7 September 2017.

					Our entire line, starting at $49, is Tag based.

					Innovative Features

					We’ve developed some great features to help you get things done quicker and more reliably.

					Subroutines:

					Break projects up into manageable chunks, and allow program reuse.

					Objects:

					Isolate data and create logic components to greatly improve development efficiency,

					maintainability and reliability.

					Linked Subroutines:

					Specify that multiple subroutines should use the same Objects.  Maybe you’ve

					got an initialization routine you’d like in one subroutine, and a process you want in another.  

					They can share an object, so you don’t have to pass data between the two.




					View your data and create operator controls with

					Awesome, Free HMI




					We’re serious about delivering the easiest to use, most productive PLC software.

					We could go on about our features, but seeing is believing, so Check out our vBuilder page,

vFactory page or Download vBuilder and vFactory. They're

					FREE




					Meet Branch








					Expansion has a vLink input port instead of USB. 

					Expansions are otherwise physically identical to Branch Main. 

					Your Sensors and Actuators are Branched Out, 

					Your PLC Should Branch With Them! 







					Branch's unique structure beats backplane and brick systems 

					at getting IO where it’s need, helping you run shorter wires and keep an organized system 




					Smarter IO
