Executive Team




 
President & CEO :: Ajay Virmani
“The creation of this new entity means Canadian businesses will have a
                  dedicated cargo consolidator - a shipping resource focused on providing 
                  quality cargo service across this great country.” 
As Chief Executive Officer of Cargojet, Ajay Virmani spearheaded  
                  the creation of the company in 2002, first purchasing fifty  
                  percent of its predecessor Canada 3000 Cargo in July of 2001. With  
                  plans in hand for expansion of its services as well a major rebranding 
                  of the company’s image which included a new name and logo, Virmani 
                  then acquired 100% of Canada 3000 Cargo in January 2002, and renamed 
                  his organization as Cargojet.
