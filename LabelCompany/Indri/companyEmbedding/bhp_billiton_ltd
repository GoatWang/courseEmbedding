         Activist warns BHP Billiton over its potash plans

MELBOURNE, Australia--BHP Billiton Ltd.'s (BHP.AU) incoming chairman faces another early test as one of the activist investors dogging the mining company warned against misspending billions of dollars in shareholder money diversifying into potash. In its latest salvo, New York hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. said it was concerned expanding into potash with a proposed development in Canada would be a severe strategic misstep and risked being the next U.S. shale, a business it has urged BHP to spin off. "This sounds alarmingly familiar," a spokesman for Elliott said. He said the recent appointment of relatively new board member Ken MacKenzie as the next chairman was an opportunity to set a new strategy and avoid repeating costly mistakes. "Billions in shareholder value is at stake," the spokesman said. Speaking at industry conference in Barcelona in May, BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said management could seek board approval for the Jansen potash project as early as next June, with possible first production in 2023. "We will only develop when the time is right," Mr. Mackenzie told an audience of industry executives and investors, adding the company's growth options would firstly focus on value. A spokesman for the company declined to comment on Elliott's latest attack. Elliott has been pushing for sweeping changes at BHP since last year, and in April went public with its case that called for BHP to exit its U.S. onshore oil-and-gas operations, which were bought at the peak of the natural-gas boom, and to collapse a dual U.K.-Australian structure in order to release billions of dollars in shareholder value and halt what it says has been a longstanding underperformance against rival Rio Tinto PLC

                                         and the broader equity market. It refined its case in May, urging BHP to launch an independent review of its global petroleum division, and encouraged Chairman-elect MacKenzie to address capital allocation and review the board and executive team. Although BHP has yet to make a decision on whether to develop a mining operation at its Jansen project in Saskatchewan, it has laid the ground work. In its quarterly production update on Wednesday, it said it was 70% of the way through a US$2.6 billion investment in excavation and other work and was digging the shaft for a mine. Days earlier, BHP published analysis that forecast demand for potash could double by the late 2040s, by which point it could be a US$50 billion market. Potash, a nutrient in plant growth, is a key ingredient in fertilizer, demand for which is expected to rise as the global population expands and diets become more varied. Elliott, which manages nearly US$33 billion, is known as an aggressive activist investor that is willing to chip away at the companies it targets. The investment firm managed by Paul Singer has been meeting with other BHP shareholders since it went public. Deutsche Bank estimated the Jansen project could cost BHP US$13 billion. In a research report, the investment bank earlier this month recommended BHP scrap what it said would be a lower-returning, technically risky project as part of a strategy revamp under Mr. MacKenzie that should focus on returns. BHP has proposed developing Jansen in several phases, the first at a US$4.7 billion incremental capital cost would have the capacity to product 4 million metric tons of potash a year and would have an internal rate of return of more than 12%. Broadening into potash would add a fifth pillar to the company's operations, which currently focus on iron ore, copper, coal, and oil and gas. Write to Robb M. Stewart at robb.stewart@wsj.com

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

BHP, the trading entity of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton plc and formerly known as BHP Billiton, is an Anglo-Australian multinational mining, metals and petroleum dual-listed public company headquartered in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Founded in 1885 in the isolated mining town of Broken Hill, it was the world's largest mining company measured by 2015 market values and Australia's fourth largest company (by revenue), formerly the largest.
BHP Billiton was formed in 2001 through the merger of the Australian Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) and the Anglo–Dutch Billiton plc.[4] The result is a dual-listed company. The Australia-registered BHP Billiton Limited, which has equal financial share in the company, has a primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange and is one of the largest companies in Australia measured by market capitalisation. The English-registered BHP Billiton plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
In April 2017 activist hedge fund manager Elliott Advisors proposed a plan for BHP to spin off its American petroleum assets and significantly restructure the business, including the scrapping of its dual Sydney-London listing, suggesting shares be offered only in the United Kingdom., while leaving its headquarters and tax residences in Australia where shares would trade as depositary instruments. At the time of the correspondence Elliott held about 4.1 percent of the issued shares in London-listed BHP Billiton PLC, worth $3.81 billion. Australia's government warned it would block moves to shift BHP's stock listing from Australia to the United Kingdom. Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison said the move would be contrary to the country's national interest and would breach government orders mandating a listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. BHP dismissed the plan saying the costs and risks of Elliott's proposal outweighed any potential benefits.[5]
In May 2017 with much of the former Billiton assets having been disposed of, BHP Billiton began to rebrand itself as BHP, at first in Australia and then globally. It replaced the slogan "The Big Australian" with "Think Big", with an advertising campaign rolling out in mid May 2017.[6] Work on the change began in 2015 according to BHP's chief external affairs officer.[7]
BHP's global headquarters and Australian registered (corporate) office is located at 171 Collins Street, Melbourne Australia.

History[edit]
Billiton[edit]




The former Billiton logo


Billiton was a mining company whose origins stretch back to 29 September 1860, when the articles of association were approved by a meeting of shareholders in the Groot Keizerhof hotel in The Hague, the Netherlands.[8]
Two months later, the company acquired the mineral rights to the tin-rich Billiton (Belitung) and Bangka Islands in the Netherlands Indies archipelago, off the eastern coast of Sumatra.[8]
Billiton's initial business forays included tin and lead smelting in the Netherlands, followed in the 1940s by bauxite mining in Indonesia and Suriname. In 1970, Shell acquired Billiton accelerated this growth.[8] The tin and lead smelter in Arnhem, the Netherlands, was shut down in the 1990s. Billiton owned a tin smelting and refining plant in Phuket, Thailand called Thaisarco (short for Thailand Smelting And Refining Company, Limited), which still exists today.[9]
In 1994, South Africa's Gencor Ltd. acquired the mining division of Billiton excluding the downstream metal division.[10] Billiton was divested from Gencor in 1997.[11]
In 1997, Billiton plc became a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[8] Throughout the 1990s and beyond, Billiton plc experienced considerable growth. Its portfolio included aluminium smelters in South Africa and Mozambique, nickel operations in Australia and Colombia, base metals mines in South America, Canada and South Africa, coal mines in Australia, Colombia and South Africa, as well as interests in operations in Brazil, Suriname, Australia (aluminium) and South Africa (titanium minerals and steel and ferroalloys).
In 2001 Billiton plc merged with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) to form BHP Billiton.[4]
In 2015, BHP Billiton spun off a number of its subsidiaries[12] in South Africa and Southern Africa to form a new company known as South32.[13][14] South32 is invested in manganese production[15] and coal mining activities in South Africa, Brazil, Australia and the Far East.
In August 2016, the company recorded its worst annual loss in history, $6.4 billion.[16]
Towards the end of 2016 BHP indicated it would be expanding its petroleum business with new investments in the sector.[17]

The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) also known by the nickname "the Big Australian",[18] was incorporated in 1885, operating the silver and lead mine at Broken Hill in western New South Wales, Australia.[19][20] The Broken Hill group floated on 10 August 1885.[21] The first consignment of Broken Hill ore (48 tons, 5 cwt, 3grs) was smelted at the Intercolonial Smelting and Refining Company's works at Spotswood, Melbourne.[21]

The resulting 35,605 ounces of silver raised a lot of interest when exhibited at the City of Melbourne Bank in Collins St. Some sceptics asserted the promoters were merely using silver from somewhere else, to ramp up the shares...Another shareholder, the dominating W.R. Wilson had had to lend [William Jamieson, General Manager] a new suit so he could take the first prospectus, printed at Silverton near Broken Hill on 20 June 1885, to Adelaide to start the float process.[21]

The geographic Broken Hill, for which the town was named, was discovered and named by Charles Sturt, and created much interest among prospectors, but nothing of note was discovered until Charles Rasp, boundary rider for the encompassing Mount Gipps Station, pegged out a 40-acre claim with contractors David James and James Poole, then with half-a-dozen backers (the Syndicate of Seven) including station manager George McCulloch (a young cousin of Victorian Premier Sir James McCulloch[22]) formed the Broken Hill Company to stake out the whole Hill. In the ensuing months of fruitless search and with costs mounting, several of the original seven parted with their shares, and at the eve of the Company's great success there were nine shareholders, including Rasp, McCulloch, William Jamieson (who bought up shares from several of the founders), Philip Charley, David James, James Poole, Bowes Kelly and W. R. Wilson.[23]
John Darling, Jr. became a director of the company in 1892 and was chairman of directors from 1907 to 1914.[24]
In 1915, the company ventured into steel manufacturing, with its operations based primarily in Newcastle, New South Wales. The decision to move from mining ore at Broken Hill to open a steelworks at Newcastle was due to the technical limitations in recovering value from mining the 'lower-lying sulphide ores'.[25] The discovery of Iron Knob and Iron Monarch near the western shore of the Spencer Gulf in South Australia combined with the development by the BHP metallurgist A. D. Carmichael of a technique for 'separating zinc sulphides from the accompanying earth and rock' led BHP 'to implement the startlingly simple and cheap process for liberating vast amounts of valuable metals out of sulphide ores, including huge heaps of tailings and slimes up to' 40 ft (12 m) high.[26]
The company began petroleum exploration in the 1960s with discoveries in Bass Strait, an activity which became an increasing focus.[27]
BHP began to diversify offshore in a variety of projects. One project was the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea, where the company was successfully sued by the indigenous inhabitants because of the environmental degradation caused by the mine operations.[28] BHP had better success with the giant Escondida copper mine in Chile (57.5 percent owned) and the EKATI Diamond Mine in northern Canada.[29] which it divested in 2013 to Dominion Diamond Corporation (formerly Harry Winston Diamond Corporation).[30]
The inefficiencies of what was, by global standards, a small steel operation in Newcastle finally caught up with the company and the Newcastle operations were closed in 1999.[31] The 'long products' side of the steel business was spun off to form OneSteel in 2000.[32]
BHP Billiton[edit]

In 2001, BHP merged with the Billiton mining company to form BHP Billiton. In 2002, the 'flat products' steel business was spun off to form BHP Steel. In 2003, BHP Steel changed its name to BlueScope Steel.[33]
In March 2005, BHP Billiton announced a US$7.3 billion agreed bid for another mining company, WMC Resources, owners of the Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium mine in South Australia, nickel operations in Western Australia and Queensland, and a fertiliser plant also in Queensland. The takeover achieved 90 percent acceptance on 17 June 2005, and 100 percent ownership was announced on 2 August 2005, achieved through compulsory acquisition of the last 10 percent of the shares.[34]
On 8 November 2007, BHP Billiton announced it was seeking to purchase rival mining group Rio Tinto Group in an all-share deal. The initial offer of 3.4 shares of BHP Billiton stock for each share of Rio Tinto was rejected by the board of Rio Tinto for "significantly undervaluing" the company. It was unknown at the time whether BHP Billiton would attempt to purchase Rio Tinto through some form of hostile takeover;[35] however, CEO Marius Kloppers met with many of Rio's shareholders following the announcement and reiterated that the offer for Rio was "compelling" and that BHP Billiton is very "patient".[36] A formal hostile bid of 3.4 BHP Billiton shares for each Rio Tinto share was announced on 6 February 2008.[37] The bid was withdrawn on 25 November 2008 due to a global recession.[38]
On 14 May 2008, BHP Billiton shares rose to a record high of A$48.90 after speculation that Chinese mining firm Chinalco was considering purchasing a large stake. BHP Billiton representatives had no comment.[39]
On 25 November 2008, Billiton announced that it would drop its A$66 billion takeover of rival Rio Tinto Group saying that the "risks to shareholder value" would "increase" to "an unacceptable level" due to the global financial crisis.[40]
On 21 January 2009, the company announced that in response to the global financial crisis the BHP Billiton Ravensthorpe Nickel Project in Western Australia would cease operations, with a resultant discontinuation of shipments of ore from Ravensthorpe to the Yabulu nickel plant in Queensland Australia.[41] Subsequently, the Yabulu refinery was sold to Queensland billionaire Mr Clive Palmer. Additionally, the Pinto Valley mine in the United States was closed. In total, 6,000 employees were laid off, including those laid off with the scaling back at some other projects.[42]
On 9 December 2009, BHP Billiton sold its Ravensthorpe Nickel Mine, which cost A$2.4 billion to build, to Vancouver-based First Quantum Minerals for US$340 million. First Quantum was one of three bidders for the mine and actually produced the lowest offer. The Canadian company plans to have the mine back in production in mid-2011. Ravensthorpe cost BHP US$3.6 billion in writedowns when it was shut in January 2009 after less than a year of production.[43]
In January 2010, after BHP Billiton bought Athabasca Potash for US$320m, The Economist reported that by 2020, BHP Billiton could produce approximately 15 percent of the world demand for potash.[44]
In August 2010, BHP Billiton made a hostile takeover bid worth US$40 billion for the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The bid came after BHP's first bid, made on 17 August, was rejected as being undervalued.[45] This acquisition marked a major strategic move by BHP outside hard commodities and commenced the diversification of its business away from resources with high exposure to carbon price risk (coal, petroleum, iron ore). The takeover bid was opposed by the Government of Saskatchewan under Premier Brad Wall. On 3 November, Canadian Industry Minister Tony Clement announced the preliminary rejection of the deal under the Investment Canada Act, giving BHP Billiton 30 days to refine their deal before a final decision was made.[46]
On 14 November 2010, the company announced that it was dropping its offer for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan.[47]
On 22 February 2011 BHP announced that it paid $4.75 billion in cash to Chesapeake Energy Corp for all of the company's Fayetteville shale assets which include 487,000 acres (1,970 km2) of mineral rights leases and 420 miles (680 km) of pipeline located in north central Arkansas in the United States. The wells on the mineral leases are currently producing about 415 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. BHP plans to spend $800 million to $1 billion a year over 10 years to develop the field and triple production.[48]
On 14 July 2011, BHP Billiton announced that it would acquire Petrohawk Energy of the United States for approximately $12.1 billion in cash, considerably expanding its shale natural gas resources[49] in an offer of $US38.75 per share.[50]
In August 2012, BHP Billiton announced that it was shelving its US$20 billion (£12 billion) Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine expansion project in South Australia, as a result of falling commodity prices and slowing global economic growth.[51][52] The company simultaneously announced a freeze on approving any major new expansion projects.[51][52]
Days after announcing the Olympic Dam pull-out, BHP announced that it was selling its Yeelirrie Uranium Project to Canadian Cameco for a fee of around $430 million. The sale was part of a broader move to step away from resource expansion in Australia.[53]
On 19 August 2014, BHP Billiton announced it would create an independent global metals and mining company based on a selection of its aluminium, coal, manganese, nickel and silver assets.[54] The newly formed entity, named South32, was subsequently demerged with listings on the Australian Securities Exchange the JSE and the London Stock Exchange.[54]
BHP Billiton agreed to pay a fine of $25 million to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in 2015 in connection with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act related to its "hospitality program" at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. BHP Billiton invited 176 government and state-owned enterprise officials to attend the Games on an all-expenses-paid package. While BHP Billiton claimed to have compliance processes in place to avoid conflicts of interest, the SEC found that BHP Billiton had invited officials from at least four countries where BHP Billiton had interests in influencing the officials' decisions (Congo, Guinea, Philippines and Burundi).[55]
In 2017, BHP Billiton announced a $2.2billion investment in the new BP platform in the Gulf of Mexico.[56] During the same year, as part of their plan to increase productivity at the Escondida mine in Chile,[57] which is the world's biggest copper mine, BHP Billiton attempted to get workers to accept a 4-year pay freeze, a 66% reduction in the end-of-conflict bonus offering, and increased shift flexibility. This resulted in a major workers' strike and forced the company to declare ‘force majeure’ on two shipments, which drove copper prices up by 4%.[58]
Corporate affairs[edit]
The Australian BHP Billiton Limited and the British BHP Billiton plc are separately listed with separate shareholder bodies, but they operate as one business with identical boards of directors and a single management structure.

Senior management[edit]
In 1998, with the stock price at less than $7 per share, BHP hired an American, Paul Anderson to reconstruct the company. Anderson was successful in this and completed his four-year stint with a merger between BHP and London-based Billiton. The CEO position was passed to Brian Gilbertson of Billiton but in 2003, after just six months in the CEO role, Gilbertson abruptly stepped down and cited irreconcilable differences with the boards as the reason for his resignation.[60]
Upon Gilbertson's departure, Chip Goodyear, an Anderson protégé, was appointed the new CEO and he continued in that role until his retirement on 30 September 2007, with the stock price over $80 per share. Marius Kloppers was Goodyear's successor.[61] Following the end of Kloppers' tenure in 2013, Andrew Mackenzie, the Chief Executive of Non-Ferrous, assumed the role of CEO. In response to investor demands and a diminishing mining boom, BHP Billiton announced in mid-April 2013 that Mackenzie's remuneration package would be 25 per cent less than that of Kloppers—Barry Fitzgerald, writing for The Australian, stated that the decision represented the introduction of a "new era of austerity" for the corporation.[62]

The United Nations Environment Programme has noted that BHP’s Ok Tedi mine site’s "uncontrolled discharge of 70 million tonnes of waste rock and mine tailings annually has spread more than 10 km (6.2 mi) down the Ok Tedi and Fly rivers, raising river beds and causing flooding, sediment deposition, forest damage, and a serious decline in the area's biodiversity."[66] The resulting devastation caused by the mining of Ok Tedi has included the loss of fish, a vital food source for the local community; loss of forest and crops due to flooding; and the loss of "areas of deep spiritual value for villagers are now submerged in mine tailings."[67]

Social and environmental responsibility[edit]




A village flooded in the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster (2015). The dam was a property of Samarco, a joint venture between Vale and BHP Billiton.


BHP Billiton is listed as one of the 90 companies extracting and marketing fossil fuels that are responsible for two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of the industrial age.[68] Its cumulative emissions until 2010 have been estimated at 7,606 MtCO2e, representing 0.52% of global industrial emissions between 1751-2010, and ranking it the 19th largest corporate polluter.[69] According to BHP Billiton management 10% of these emissions are from direct operations, while 90% are from products sold by the company.[70] BHP Billiton has been voluntarily reporting its direct GHG emissions since 1996. In 2013 it was criticised in 2013 for lobbying against carbon pricing in Australia.[71]
BHP Billiton voluntarily donates one per cent of pre-tax profit, calculated on the average of the previous three years’ pre-tax profit, in community programs[72] and made US$241.7 million of community donations including a US$100 million contribution to BHP Billiton corporate charitable entities.[73] BHP Billiton is a founding partner and co-funder (with the Australian Government) of Bush Blitz, operated by Australian Biological Resources Study with Earthwatch Australia.[74]
Significant accidents[edit]
Inclement weather caused a BHP Billiton helicopter to crash in Angola on 16 November 2007, killing the helicopter's five passengers. The dead were: BHP Billiton Angola Chief Operating Officer David Hopgood, Australian; Angola Technical Services Operations Manager Kevin Ayre, British; Wild Dog Helicopters pilot Kottie Breedt, South African; Guy Sommerfield of MMC, British; and Louwrens Prinsloo of Prinsloo Drilling, Namibian. The helicopter went down approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) from Alto Cuilo exploration facility in north eastern Angola. BHP Billiton responded by suspending operations in the country.[75]
On 5 November 2015 a dam holding back waste water from an iron ore mine in Mariana, south-eastern Brazil, owned by BHP Billiton and Vale collapsed, devastating a nearby town with mudslides, killing at least 17 people, injuring more than 50 and causing enormous ecological damage,[76] and threatening life along the river Rio Doce and the Atlantic sea near the mouth of the Rio Doce.[77] The accident was the biggest environmental disaster in Brazil's history.[78]

The former BHP Billiton logo


BHP, the trading entity of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton plc and formerly known as BHP Billiton, is an Anglo-Australian multinational mining, metals and petroleum dual-listed public company headquartered in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Founded in 1885 in the isolated mining town of Broken Hill, it was the world's largest mining company measured by 2015 market values and Australia's fourth largest company (by revenue), formerly the largest.
BHP Billiton was formed in 2001 through the merger of the Australian Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) and the Anglo–Dutch Billiton plc.[4] The result is a dual-listed company. The Australia-registered BHP Billiton Limited, which has equal financial share in the company, has a primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange and is one of the largest companies in Australia measured by market capitalisation. The English-registered BHP Billiton plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
In April 2017 activist hedge fund manager Elliott Advisors proposed a plan for BHP to spin off its American petroleum assets and significantly restructure the business, including the scrapping of its dual Sydney-London listing, suggesting shares be offered only in the United Kingdom., while leaving its headquarters and tax residences in Australia where shares would trade as depositary instruments. At the time of the correspondence Elliott held about 4.1 percent of the issued shares in London-listed BHP Billiton PLC, worth $3.81 billion. Australia's government warned it would block moves to shift BHP's stock listing from Australia to the United Kingdom. Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison said the move would be contrary to the country's national interest and would breach government orders mandating a listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. BHP dismissed the plan saying the costs and risks of Elliott's proposal outweighed any potential benefits.[5]
In May 2017 with much of the former Billiton assets having been disposed of, BHP Billiton began to rebrand itself as BHP, at first in Australia and then globally. It replaced the slogan "The Big Australian" with "Think Big", with an advertising campaign rolling out in mid May 2017.[6] Work on the change began in 2015 according to BHP's chief external affairs officer.[7]
BHP's global headquarters and Australian registered (corporate) office is located at 171 Collins Street, Melbourne Australia.

History[edit]
Billiton[edit]




The former Billiton logo


Billiton was a mining company whose origins stretch back to 29 September 1860, when the articles of association were approved by a meeting of shareholders in the Groot Keizerhof hotel in The Hague, the Netherlands.[8]
Two months later, the company acquired the mineral rights to the tin-rich Billiton (Belitung) and Bangka Islands in the Netherlands Indies archipelago, off the eastern coast of Sumatra.[8]
Billiton's initial business forays included tin and lead smelting in the Netherlands, followed in the 1940s by bauxite mining in Indonesia and Suriname. In 1970, Shell acquired Billiton accelerated this growth.[8] The tin and lead smelter in Arnhem, the Netherlands, was shut down in the 1990s. Billiton owned a tin smelting and refining plant in Phuket, Thailand called Thaisarco (short for Thailand Smelting And Refining Company, Limited), which still exists today.[9]
In 1994, South Africa's Gencor Ltd. acquired the mining division of Billiton excluding the downstream metal division.[10] Billiton was divested from Gencor in 1997.[11]
In 1997, Billiton plc became a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[8] Throughout the 1990s and beyond, Billiton plc experienced considerable growth. Its portfolio included aluminium smelters in South Africa and Mozambique, nickel operations in Australia and Colombia, base metals mines in South America, Canada and South Africa, coal mines in Australia, Colombia and South Africa, as well as interests in operations in Brazil, Suriname, Australia (aluminium) and South Africa (titanium minerals and steel and ferroalloys).
In 2001 Billiton plc merged with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) to form BHP Billiton.[4]
In 2015, BHP Billiton spun off a number of its subsidiaries[12] in South Africa and Southern Africa to form a new company known as South32.[13][14] South32 is invested in manganese production[15] and coal mining activities in South Africa, Brazil, Australia and the Far East.
In August 2016, the company recorded its worst annual loss in history, $6.4 billion.[16]
Towards the end of 2016 BHP indicated it would be expanding its petroleum business with new investments in the sector.[17]
Broken Hill Proprietary Company[edit]




The former Broken Hill Proprietary Company logo


The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) also known by the nickname "the Big Australian",[18] was incorporated in 1885, operating the silver and lead mine at Broken Hill in western New South Wales, Australia.[19][20] The Broken Hill group floated on 10 August 1885.[21] The first consignment of Broken Hill ore (48 tons, 5 cwt, 3grs) was smelted at the Intercolonial Smelting and Refining Company's works at Spotswood, Melbourne.[21]

The resulting 35,605 ounces of silver raised a lot of interest when exhibited at the City of Melbourne Bank in Collins St. Some sceptics asserted the promoters were merely using silver from somewhere else, to ramp up the shares...Another shareholder, the dominating W.R. Wilson had had to lend [William Jamieson, General Manager] a new suit so he could take the first prospectus, printed at Silverton near Broken Hill on 20 June 1885, to Adelaide to start the float process.[21]

The geographic Broken Hill, for which the town was named, was discovered and named by Charles Sturt, and created much interest among prospectors, but nothing of note was discovered until Charles Rasp, boundary rider for the encompassing Mount Gipps Station, pegged out a 40-acre claim with contractors David James and James Poole, then with half-a-dozen backers (the Syndicate of Seven) including station manager George McCulloch (a young cousin of Victorian Premier Sir James McCulloch[22]) formed the Broken Hill Company to stake out the whole Hill. In the ensuing months of fruitless search and with costs mounting, several of the original seven parted with their shares, and at the eve of the Company's great success there were nine shareholders, including Rasp, McCulloch, William Jamieson (who bought up shares from several of the founders), Philip Charley, David James, James Poole, Bowes Kelly and W. R. Wilson.[23]
John Darling, Jr. became a director of the company in 1892 and was chairman of directors from 1907 to 1914.[24]
In 1915, the company ventured into steel manufacturing, with its operations based primarily in Newcastle, New South Wales. The decision to move from mining ore at Broken Hill to open a steelworks at Newcastle was due to the technical limitations in recovering value from mining the 'lower-lying sulphide ores'.[25] The discovery of Iron Knob and Iron Monarch near the western shore of the Spencer Gulf in South Australia combined with the development by the BHP metallurgist A. D. Carmichael of a technique for 'separating zinc sulphides from the accompanying earth and rock' led BHP 'to implement the startlingly simple and cheap process for liberating vast amounts of valuable metals out of sulphide ores, including huge heaps of tailings and slimes up to' 40 ft (12 m) high.[26]
The company began petroleum exploration in the 1960s with discoveries in Bass Strait, an activity which became an increasing focus.[27]
BHP began to diversify offshore in a variety of projects. One project was the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea, where the company was successfully sued by the indigenous inhabitants because of the environmental degradation caused by the mine operations.[28] BHP had better success with the giant Escondida copper mine in Chile (57.5 percent owned) and the EKATI Diamond Mine in northern Canada.[29] which it divested in 2013 to Dominion Diamond Corporation (formerly Harry Winston Diamond Corporation).[30]
The inefficiencies of what was, by global standards, a small steel operation in Newcastle finally caught up with the company and the Newcastle operations were closed in 1999.[31] The 'long products' side of the steel business was spun off to form OneSteel in 2000.[32]
BHP Billiton[edit]

In 2001, BHP merged with the Billiton mining company to form BHP Billiton. In 2002, the 'flat products' steel business was spun off to form BHP Steel. In 2003, BHP Steel changed its name to BlueScope Steel.[33]
In March 2005, BHP Billiton announced a US$7.3 billion agreed bid for another mining company, WMC Resources, owners of the Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium mine in South Australia, nickel operations in Western Australia and Queensland, and a fertiliser plant also in Queensland. The takeover achieved 90 percent acceptance on 17 June 2005, and 100 percent ownership was announced on 2 August 2005, achieved through compulsory acquisition of the last 10 percent of the shares.[34]
On 8 November 2007, BHP Billiton announced it was seeking to purchase rival mining group Rio Tinto Group in an all-share deal. The initial offer of 3.4 shares of BHP Billiton stock for each share of Rio Tinto was rejected by the board of Rio Tinto for "significantly undervaluing" the company. It was unknown at the time whether BHP Billiton would attempt to purchase Rio Tinto through some form of hostile takeover;[35] however, CEO Marius Kloppers met with many of Rio's shareholders following the announcement and reiterated that the offer for Rio was "compelling" and that BHP Billiton is very "patient".[36] A formal hostile bid of 3.4 BHP Billiton shares for each Rio Tinto share was announced on 6 February 2008.[37] The bid was withdrawn on 25 November 2008 due to a global recession.[38]
On 14 May 2008, BHP Billiton shares rose to a record high of A$48.90 after speculation that Chinese mining firm Chinalco was considering purchasing a large stake. BHP Billiton representatives had no comment.[39]
On 25 November 2008, Billiton announced that it would drop its A$66 billion takeover of rival Rio Tinto Group saying that the "risks to shareholder value" would "increase" to "an unacceptable level" due to the global financial crisis.[40]
On 21 January 2009, the company announced that in response to the global financial crisis the BHP Billiton Ravensthorpe Nickel Project in Western Australia would cease operations, with a resultant discontinuation of shipments of ore from Ravensthorpe to the Yabulu nickel plant in Queensland Australia.[41] Subsequently, the Yabulu refinery was sold to Queensland billionaire Mr Clive Palmer. Additionally, the Pinto Valley mine in the United States was closed. In total, 6,000 employees were laid off, including those laid off with the scaling back at some other projects.[42]
On 9 December 2009, BHP Billiton sold its Ravensthorpe Nickel Mine, which cost A$2.4 billion to build, to Vancouver-based First Quantum Minerals for US$340 million. First Quantum was one of three bidders for the mine and actually produced the lowest offer. The Canadian company plans to have the mine back in production in mid-2011. Ravensthorpe cost BHP US$3.6 billion in writedowns when it was shut in January 2009 after less than a year of production.[43]
In January 2010, after BHP Billiton bought Athabasca Potash for US$320m, The Economist reported that by 2020, BHP Billiton could produce approximately 15 percent of the world demand for potash.[44]
In August 2010, BHP Billiton made a hostile takeover bid worth US$40 billion for the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The bid came after BHP's first bid, made on 17 August, was rejected as being undervalued.[45] This acquisition marked a major strategic move by BHP outside hard commodities and commenced the diversification of its business away from resources with high exposure to carbon price risk (coal, petroleum, iron ore). The takeover bid was opposed by the Government of Saskatchewan under Premier Brad Wall. On 3 November, Canadian Industry Minister Tony Clement announced the preliminary rejection of the deal under the Investment Canada Act, giving BHP Billiton 30 days to refine their deal before a final decision was made.[46]
On 14 November 2010, the company announced that it was dropping its offer for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan.[47]
On 22 February 2011 BHP announced that it paid $4.75 billion in cash to Chesapeake Energy Corp for all of the company's Fayetteville shale assets which include 487,000 acres (1,970 km2) of mineral rights leases and 420 miles (680 km) of pipeline located in north central Arkansas in the United States. The wells on the mineral leases are currently producing about 415 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. BHP plans to spend $800 million to $1 billion a year over 10 years to develop the field and triple production.[48]
On 14 July 2011, BHP Billiton announced that it would acquire Petrohawk Energy of the United States for approximately $12.1 billion in cash, considerably expanding its shale natural gas resources[49] in an offer of $US38.75 per share.[50]
In August 2012, BHP Billiton announced that it was shelving its US$20 billion (£12 billion) Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine expansion project in South Australia, as a result of falling commodity prices and slowing global economic growth.[51][52] The company simultaneously announced a freeze on approving any major new expansion projects.[51][52]
Days after announcing the Olympic Dam pull-out, BHP announced that it was selling its Yeelirrie Uranium Project to Canadian Cameco for a fee of around $430 million. The sale was part of a broader move to step away from resource expansion in Australia.[53]
On 19 August 2014, BHP Billiton announced it would create an independent global metals and mining company based on a selection of its aluminium, coal, manganese, nickel and silver assets.[54] The newly formed entity, named South32, was subsequently demerged with listings on the Australian Securities Exchange the JSE and the London Stock Exchange.[54]
BHP Billiton agreed to pay a fine of $25 million to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in 2015 in connection with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act related to its "hospitality program" at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. BHP Billiton invited 176 government and state-owned enterprise officials to attend the Games on an all-expenses-paid package. While BHP Billiton claimed to have compliance processes in place to avoid conflicts of interest, the SEC found that BHP Billiton had invited officials from at least four countries where BHP Billiton had interests in influencing the officials' decisions (Congo, Guinea, Philippines and Burundi).[55]
In 2017, BHP Billiton announced a $2.2billion investment in the new BP platform in the Gulf of Mexico.[56] During the same year, as part of their plan to increase productivity at the Escondida mine in Chile,[57] which is the world's biggest copper mine, BHP Billiton attempted to get workers to accept a 4-year pay freeze, a 66% reduction in the end-of-conflict bonus offering, and increased shift flexibility. This resulted in a major workers' strike and forced the company to declare ‘force majeure’ on two shipments, which drove copper prices up by 4%.[58]
Corporate affairs[edit]
The Australian BHP Billiton Limited and the British BHP Billiton plc are separately listed with separate shareholder bodies, but they operate as one business with identical boards of directors and a single management structure. The global headquarters of the BHP Billiton Group & BHP Billiton Limited (Australia) are located in Melbourne, Australia. BHP Billiton plc is located in London, England.[1] BHP Billiton also has offices in Houston, USA, Santiago, Perth, Brisbane, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Shanghai.
The company's shares trade on the following exchanges:[59]




BHP Billiton Limited

Australia (ASX: BHP)
US (NYSE: BHP)






BHP Billiton plc

UK (LSE: BLT)
US (NYSE: BBL)
South Africa (JSE: BIL)






Senior management[edit]
In 1998, with the stock price at less than $7 per share, BHP hired an American, Paul Anderson to reconstruct the company. Anderson was successful in this and completed his four-year stint with a merger between BHP and London-based Billiton. The CEO position was passed to Brian Gilbertson of Billiton but in 2003, after just six months in the CEO role, Gilbertson abruptly stepped down and cited irreconcilable differences with the boards as the reason for his resignation.[60]
Upon Gilbertson's departure, Chip Goodyear, an Anderson protégé, was appointed the new CEO and he continued in that role until his retirement on 30 September 2007, with the stock price over $80 per share. Marius Kloppers was Goodyear's successor.[61] Following the end of Kloppers' tenure in 2013, Andrew Mackenzie, the Chief Executive of Non-Ferrous, assumed the role of CEO. In response to investor demands and a diminishing mining boom, BHP Billiton announced in mid-April 2013 that Mackenzie's remuneration package would be 25 per cent less than that of Kloppers—Barry Fitzgerald, writing for The Australian, stated that the decision represented the introduction of a "new era of austerity" for the corporation.[62]
Operations[edit]
Current[edit]
BHP operates a wide variety of mining, processing and oil and gas production operations in over 25 countries,[63] employing approximately 41,000 people.
The company has four primary operational units, with an optional fifth operational unit, referred to as Businesses:

Coal
Copper
Iron ore
Petroleum
Potash

At the end of fiscal year 2015, BHP Billiton, produced more than 256 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe), 1.7 million tonnes (Mt) of copper, 233 Mt of iron ore, 43 Mt of metallurgical coal and 41 Mt of energy coal.
In addition it has subsidiary logistics companies BHP Transport and Logistics Pty Ltd (incorporating the former BHP Shipping) and BHPB Freight Pty Ltd.

The United Nations Environment Programme has noted that BHP’s Ok Tedi mine site’s "uncontrolled discharge of 70 million tonnes of waste rock and mine tailings annually has spread more than 10 km (6.2 mi) down the Ok Tedi and Fly rivers, raising river beds and causing flooding, sediment deposition, forest damage, and a serious decline in the area's biodiversity."[66] The resulting devastation caused by the mining of Ok Tedi has included the loss of fish, a vital food source for the local community; loss of forest and crops due to flooding; and the loss of "areas of deep spiritual value for villagers are now submerged in mine tailings."[67]

Social and environmental responsibility[edit]




A village flooded in the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster (2015). The dam was a property of Samarco, a joint venture between Vale and BHP Billiton.


BHP Billiton is listed as one of the 90 companies extracting and marketing fossil fuels that are responsible for two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of the industrial age.[68] Its cumulative emissions until 2010 have been estimated at 7,606 MtCO2e, representing 0.52% of global industrial emissions between 1751-2010, and ranking it the 19th largest corporate polluter.[69] According to BHP Billiton management 10% of these emissions are from direct operations, while 90% are from products sold by the company.[70] BHP Billiton has been voluntarily reporting its direct GHG emissions since 1996. In 2013 it was criticised in 2013 for lobbying against carbon pricing in Australia.[71]
BHP Billiton voluntarily donates one per cent of pre-tax profit, calculated on the average of the previous three years’ pre-tax profit, in community programs[72] and made US$241.7 million of community donations including a US$100 million contribution to BHP Billiton corporate charitable entities.[73] BHP Billiton is a founding partner and co-funder (with the Australian Government) of Bush Blitz, operated by Australian Biological Resources Study with Earthwatch Australia.[74]
Significant accidents[edit]
Inclement weather caused a BHP Billiton helicopter to crash in Angola on 16 November 2007, killing the helicopter's five passengers. The dead were: BHP Billiton Angola Chief Operating Officer David Hopgood, Australian; Angola Technical Services Operations Manager Kevin Ayre, British; Wild Dog Helicopters pilot Kottie Breedt, South African; Guy Sommerfield of MMC, British; and Louwrens Prinsloo of Prinsloo Drilling, Namibian. The helicopter went down approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) from Alto Cuilo exploration facility in north eastern Angola. BHP Billiton responded by suspending operations in the country.[75]
On 5 November 2015 a dam holding back waste water from an iron ore mine in Mariana, south-eastern Brazil, owned by BHP Billiton and Vale collapsed, devastating a nearby town with mudslides, killing at least 17 people, injuring more than 50 and causing enormous ecological damage,[76] and threatening life along the river Rio Doce and the Atlantic sea near the mouth of the Rio Doce.[77] The accident was the biggest environmental disaster in Brazil's history.[78]

The former BHP Billiton logo


BHP, the trading entity of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton plc and formerly known as BHP Billiton, is an Anglo-Australian multinational mining, metals and petroleum dual-listed public company headquartered in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Founded in 1885 in the isolated mining town of Broken Hill, it was the world's largest mining company measured by 2015 market values and Australia's fourth largest company (by revenue), formerly the largest.
BHP Billiton was formed in 2001 through the merger of the Australian Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) and the Anglo–Dutch Billiton plc.[4] The result is a dual-listed company. The Australia-registered BHP Billiton Limited, which has equal financial share in the company, has a primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange and is one of the largest companies in Australia measured by market capitalisation. The English-registered BHP Billiton plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
In April 2017 activist hedge fund manager Elliott Advisors proposed a plan for BHP to spin off its American petroleum assets and significantly restructure the business, including the scrapping of its dual Sydney-London listing, suggesting shares be offered only in the United Kingdom., while leaving its headquarters and tax residences in Australia where shares would trade as depositary instruments. At the time of the correspondence Elliott held about 4.1 percent of the issued shares in London-listed BHP Billiton PLC, worth $3.81 billion. Australia's government warned it would block moves to shift BHP's stock listing from Australia to the United Kingdom. Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison said the move would be contrary to the country's national interest and would breach government orders mandating a listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. BHP dismissed the plan saying the costs and risks of Elliott's proposal outweighed any potential benefits.[5]
In May 2017 with much of the former Billiton assets having been disposed of, BHP Billiton began to rebrand itself as BHP, at first in Australia and then globally. It replaced the slogan "The Big Australian" with "Think Big", with an advertising campaign rolling out in mid May 2017.[6] Work on the change began in 2015 according to BHP's chief external affairs officer.[7]
BHP's global headquarters and Australian registered (corporate) office is located at 171 Collins Street, Melbourne Australia.

History[edit]
Billiton[edit]




The former Billiton logo


Billiton was a mining company whose origins stretch back to 29 September 1860, when the articles of association were approved by a meeting of shareholders in the Groot Keizerhof hotel in The Hague, the Netherlands.[8]
Two months later, the company acquired the mineral rights to the tin-rich Billiton (Belitung) and Bangka Islands in the Netherlands Indies archipelago, off the eastern coast of Sumatra.[8]
Billiton's initial business forays included tin and lead smelting in the Netherlands, followed in the 1940s by bauxite mining in Indonesia and Suriname. In 1970, Shell acquired Billiton accelerated this growth.[8] The tin and lead smelter in Arnhem, the Netherlands, was shut down in the 1990s. Billiton owned a tin smelting and refining plant in Phuket, Thailand called Thaisarco (short for Thailand Smelting And Refining Company, Limited), which still exists today.[9]
In 1994, South Africa's Gencor Ltd. acquired the mining division of Billiton excluding the downstream metal division.[10] Billiton was divested from Gencor in 1997.[11]
In 1997, Billiton plc became a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[8] Throughout the 1990s and beyond, Billiton plc experienced considerable growth. Its portfolio included aluminium smelters in South Africa and Mozambique, nickel operations in Australia and Colombia, base metals mines in South America, Canada and South Africa, coal mines in Australia, Colombia and South Africa, as well as interests in operations in Brazil, Suriname, Australia (aluminium) and South Africa (titanium minerals and steel and ferroalloys).
In 2001 Billiton plc merged with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) to form BHP Billiton.[4]
In 2015, BHP Billiton spun off a number of its subsidiaries[12] in South Africa and Southern Africa to form a new company known as South32.[13][14] South32 is invested in manganese production[15] and coal mining activities in South Africa, Brazil, Australia and the Far East.
In August 2016, the company recorded its worst annual loss in history, $6.4 billion.[16]
Towards the end of 2016 BHP indicated it would be expanding its petroleum business with new investments in the sector.[17]
Broken Hill Proprietary Company[edit]




The former Broken Hill Proprietary Company logo


The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) also known by the nickname "the Big Australian",[18] was incorporated in 1885, operating the silver and lead mine at Broken Hill in western New South Wales, Australia.[19][20] The Broken Hill group floated on 10 August 1885.[21] The first consignment of Broken Hill ore (48 tons, 5 cwt, 3grs) was smelted at the Intercolonial Smelting and Refining Company's works at Spotswood, Melbourne.[21]

The resulting 35,605 ounces of silver raised a lot of interest when exhibited at the City of Melbourne Bank in Collins St. Some sceptics asserted the promoters were merely using silver from somewhere else, to ramp up the shares...Another shareholder, the dominating W.R. Wilson had had to lend [William Jamieson, General Manager] a new suit so he could take the first prospectus, printed at Silverton near Broken Hill on 20 June 1885, to Adelaide to start the float process.[21]

The geographic Broken Hill, for which the town was named, was discovered and named by Charles Sturt, and created much interest among prospectors, but nothing of note was discovered until Charles Rasp, boundary rider for the encompassing Mount Gipps Station, pegged out a 40-acre claim with contractors David James and James Poole, then with half-a-dozen backers (the Syndicate of Seven) including station manager George McCulloch (a young cousin of Victorian Premier Sir James McCulloch[22]) formed the Broken Hill Company to stake out the whole Hill. In the ensuing months of fruitless search and with costs mounting, several of the original seven parted with their shares, and at the eve of the Company's great success there were nine shareholders, including Rasp, McCulloch, William Jamieson (who bought up shares from several of the founders), Philip Charley, David James, James Poole, Bowes Kelly and W. R. Wilson.[23]
John Darling, Jr. became a director of the company in 1892 and was chairman of directors from 1907 to 1914.[24]
In 1915, the company ventured into steel manufacturing, with its operations based primarily in Newcastle, New South Wales. The decision to move from mining ore at Broken Hill to open a steelworks at Newcastle was due to the technical limitations in recovering value from mining the 'lower-lying sulphide ores'.[25] The discovery of Iron Knob and Iron Monarch near the western shore of the Spencer Gulf in South Australia combined with the development by the BHP metallurgist A. D. Carmichael of a technique for 'separating zinc sulphides from the accompanying earth and rock' led BHP 'to implement the startlingly simple and cheap process for liberating vast amounts of valuable metals out of sulphide ores, including huge heaps of tailings and slimes up to' 40 ft (12 m) high.[26]
The company began petroleum exploration in the 1960s with discoveries in Bass Strait, an activity which became an increasing focus.[27]
BHP began to diversify offshore in a variety of projects. One project was the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea, where the company was successfully sued by the indigenous inhabitants because of the environmental degradation caused by the mine operations.[28] BHP had better success with the giant Escondida copper mine in Chile (57.5 percent owned) and the EKATI Diamond Mine in northern Canada.[29] which it divested in 2013 to Dominion Diamond Corporation (formerly Harry Winston Diamond Corporation).[30]
The inefficiencies of what was, by global standards, a small steel operation in Newcastle finally caught up with the company and the Newcastle operations were closed in 1999.[31] The 'long products' side of the steel business was spun off to form OneSteel in 2000.[32]
BHP Billiton[edit]

In 2001, BHP merged with the Billiton mining company to form BHP Billiton. In 2002, the 'flat products' steel business was spun off to form BHP Steel. In 2003, BHP Steel changed its name to BlueScope Steel.[33]
In March 2005, BHP Billiton announced a US$7.3 billion agreed bid for another mining company, WMC Resources, owners of the Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium mine in South Australia, nickel operations in Western Australia and Queensland, and a fertiliser plant also in Queensland. The takeover achieved 90 percent acceptance on 17 June 2005, and 100 percent ownership was announced on 2 August 2005, achieved through compulsory acquisition of the last 10 percent of the shares.[34]
On 8 November 2007, BHP Billiton announced it was seeking to purchase rival mining group Rio Tinto Group in an all-share deal. The initial offer of 3.4 shares of BHP Billiton stock for each share of Rio Tinto was rejected by the board of Rio Tinto for "significantly undervaluing" the company. It was unknown at the time whether BHP Billiton would attempt to purchase Rio Tinto through some form of hostile takeover;[35] however, CEO Marius Kloppers met with many of Rio's shareholders following the announcement and reiterated that the offer for Rio was "compelling" and that BHP Billiton is very "patient".[36] A formal hostile bid of 3.4 BHP Billiton shares for each Rio Tinto share was announced on 6 February 2008.[37] The bid was withdrawn on 25 November 2008 due to a global recession.[38]
On 14 May 2008, BHP Billiton shares rose to a record high of A$48.90 after speculation that Chinese mining firm Chinalco was considering purchasing a large stake. BHP Billiton representatives had no comment.[39]
On 25 November 2008, Billiton announced that it would drop its A$66 billion takeover of rival Rio Tinto Group saying that the "risks to shareholder value" would "increase" to "an unacceptable level" due to the global financial crisis.[40]
On 21 January 2009, the company announced that in response to the global financial crisis the BHP Billiton Ravensthorpe Nickel Project in Western Australia would cease operations, with a resultant discontinuation of shipments of ore from Ravensthorpe to the Yabulu nickel plant in Queensland Australia.[41] Subsequently, the Yabulu refinery was sold to Queensland billionaire Mr Clive Palmer. Additionally, the Pinto Valley mine in the United States was closed. In total, 6,000 employees were laid off, including those laid off with the scaling back at some other projects.[42]
On 9 December 2009, BHP Billiton sold its Ravensthorpe Nickel Mine, which cost A$2.4 billion to build, to Vancouver-based First Quantum Minerals for US$340 million. First Quantum was one of three bidders for the mine and actually produced the lowest offer. The Canadian company plans to have the mine back in production in mid-2011. Ravensthorpe cost BHP US$3.6 billion in writedowns when it was shut in January 2009 after less than a year of production.[43]
In January 2010, after BHP Billiton bought Athabasca Potash for US$320m, The Economist reported that by 2020, BHP Billiton could produce approximately 15 percent of the world demand for potash.[44]
In August 2010, BHP Billiton made a hostile takeover bid worth US$40 billion for the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The bid came after BHP's first bid, made on 17 August, was rejected as being undervalued.[45] This acquisition marked a major strategic move by BHP outside hard commodities and commenced the diversification of its business away from resources with high exposure to carbon price risk (coal, petroleum, iron ore). The takeover bid was opposed by the Government of Saskatchewan under Premier Brad Wall. On 3 November, Canadian Industry Minister Tony Clement announced the preliminary rejection of the deal under the Investment Canada Act, giving BHP Billiton 30 days to refine their deal before a final decision was made.[46]
On 14 November 2010, the company announced that it was dropping its offer for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan.[47]
On 22 February 2011 BHP announced that it paid $4.75 billion in cash to Chesapeake Energy Corp for all of the company's Fayetteville shale assets which include 487,000 acres (1,970 km2) of mineral rights leases and 420 miles (680 km) of pipeline located in north central Arkansas in the United States. The wells on the mineral leases are currently producing about 415 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. BHP plans to spend $800 million to $1 billion a year over 10 years to develop the field and triple production.[48]
On 14 July 2011, BHP Billiton announced that it would acquire Petrohawk Energy of the United States for approximately $12.1 billion in cash, considerably expanding its shale natural gas resources[49] in an offer of $US38.75 per share.[50]
In August 2012, BHP Billiton announced that it was shelving its US$20 billion (£12 billion) Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine expansion project in South Australia, as a result of falling commodity prices and slowing global economic growth.[51][52] The company simultaneously announced a freeze on approving any major new expansion projects.[51][52]
Days after announcing the Olympic Dam pull-out, BHP announced that it was selling its Yeelirrie Uranium Project to Canadian Cameco for a fee of around $430 million. The sale was part of a broader move to step away from resource expansion in Australia.[53]
On 19 August 2014, BHP Billiton announced it would create an independent global metals and mining company based on a selection of its aluminium, coal, manganese, nickel and silver assets.[54] The newly formed entity, named South32, was subsequently demerged with listings on the Australian Securities Exchange the JSE and the London Stock Exchange.[54]
BHP Billiton agreed to pay a fine of $25 million to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in 2015 in connection with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act related to its "hospitality program" at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. BHP Billiton invited 176 government and state-owned enterprise officials to attend the Games on an all-expenses-paid package. While BHP Billiton claimed to have compliance processes in place to avoid conflicts of interest, the SEC found that BHP Billiton had invited officials from at least four countries where BHP Billiton had interests in influencing the officials' decisions (Congo, Guinea, Philippines and Burundi).[55]
In 2017, BHP Billiton announced a $2.2billion investment in the new BP platform in the Gulf of Mexico.[56] During the same year, as part of their plan to increase productivity at the Escondida mine in Chile,[57] which is the world's biggest copper mine, BHP Billiton attempted to get workers to accept a 4-year pay freeze, a 66% reduction in the end-of-conflict bonus offering, and increased shift flexibility. This resulted in a major workers' strike and forced the company to declare ‘force majeure’ on two shipments, which drove copper prices up by 4%.[58]
Corporate affairs[edit]
The Australian BHP Billiton Limited and the British BHP Billiton plc are separately listed with separate shareholder bodies, but they operate as one business with identical boards of directors and a single management structure. The global headquarters of the BHP Billiton Group & BHP Billiton Limited (Australia) are located in Melbourne, Australia. BHP Billiton plc is located in London, England.[1] BHP Billiton also has offices in Houston, USA, Santiago, Perth, Brisbane, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Shanghai.

Senior management[edit]
In 1998, with the stock price at less than $7 per share, BHP hired an American, Paul Anderson to reconstruct the company. Anderson was successful in this and completed his four-year stint with a merger between BHP and London-based Billiton. The CEO position was passed to Brian Gilbertson of Billiton but in 2003, after just six months in the CEO role, Gilbertson abruptly stepped down and cited irreconcilable differences with the boards as the reason for his resignation.[60]
Upon Gilbertson's departure, Chip Goodyear, an Anderson protégé, was appointed the new CEO and he continued in that role until his retirement on 30 September 2007, with the stock price over $80 per share. Marius Kloppers was Goodyear's successor.[61] Following the end of Kloppers' tenure in 2013, Andrew Mackenzie, the Chief Executive of Non-Ferrous, assumed the role of CEO. In response to investor demands and a diminishing mining boom, BHP Billiton announced in mid-April 2013 that Mackenzie's remuneration package would be 25 per cent less than that of Kloppers—Barry Fitzgerald, writing for The Australian, stated that the decision represented the introduction of a "new era of austerity" for the corporation.[62]
Operations[edit]
Current[edit]
BHP operates a wide variety of mining, processing and oil and gas production operations in over 25 countries,[63] employing approximately 41,000 people.
The company has four primary operational units, with an optional fifth operational unit, referred to as Businesses:

Coal
Copper
Iron ore
Petroleum
Potash

At the end of fiscal year 2015, BHP Billiton, produced more than 256 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe), 1.7 million tonnes (Mt) of copper, 233 Mt of iron ore, 43 Mt of metallurgical coal and 41 Mt of energy coal.
In addition it has subsidiary logistics companies BHP Transport and Logistics Pty Ltd (incorporating the former BHP Shipping) and BHPB Freight Pty Ltd.

The United Nations Environment Programme has noted that BHP’s Ok Tedi mine site’s "uncontrolled discharge of 70 million tonnes of waste rock and mine tailings annually has spread more than 10 km (6.2 mi) down the Ok Tedi and Fly rivers, raising river beds and causing flooding, sediment deposition, forest damage, and a serious decline in the area's biodiversity."[66] The resulting devastation caused by the mining of Ok Tedi has included the loss of fish, a vital food source for the local community; loss of forest and crops due to flooding; and the loss of "areas of deep spiritual value for villagers are now submerged in mine tailings."[67]

Social and environmental responsibility[edit]




A village flooded in the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster (2015). The dam was a property of Samarco, a joint venture between Vale and BHP Billiton.


BHP Billiton is listed as one of the 90 companies extracting and marketing fossil fuels that are responsible for two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of the industrial age.[68] Its cumulative emissions until 2010 have been estimated at 7,606 MtCO2e, representing 0.52% of global industrial emissions between 1751-2010, and ranking it the 19th largest corporate polluter.[69] According to BHP Billiton management 10% of these emissions are from direct operations, while 90% are from products sold by the company.[70] BHP Billiton has been voluntarily reporting its direct GHG emissions since 1996. In 2013 it was criticised in 2013 for lobbying against carbon pricing in Australia.[71]
BHP Billiton voluntarily donates one per cent of pre-tax profit, calculated on the average of the previous three years’ pre-tax profit, in community programs[72] and made US$241.7 million of community donations including a US$100 million contribution to BHP Billiton corporate charitable entities.[73] BHP Billiton is a founding partner and co-funder (with the Australian Government) of Bush Blitz, operated by Australian Biological Resources Study with Earthwatch Australia.[74]
Significant accidents[edit]
Inclement weather caused a BHP Billiton helicopter to crash in Angola on 16 November 2007, killing the helicopter's five passengers. The dead were: BHP Billiton Angola Chief Operating Officer David Hopgood, Australian; Angola Technical Services Operations Manager Kevin Ayre, British; Wild Dog Helicopters pilot Kottie Breedt, South African; Guy Sommerfield of MMC, British; and Louwrens Prinsloo of Prinsloo Drilling, Namibian. The helicopter went down approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) from Alto Cuilo exploration facility in north eastern Angola. BHP Billiton responded by suspending operations in the country.[75]
On 5 November 2015 a dam holding back waste water from an iron ore mine in Mariana, south-eastern Brazil, owned by BHP Billiton and Vale collapsed, devastating a nearby town with mudslides, killing at least 17 people, injuring more than 50 and causing enormous ecological damage,[76] and threatening life along the river Rio Doce and the Atlantic sea near the mouth of the Rio Doce.[77] The accident was the biggest environmental disaster in Brazil's history.[78]

The former BHP Billiton logo


BHP, the trading entity of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton plc and formerly known as BHP Billiton, is an Anglo-Australian multinational mining, metals and petroleum dual-listed public company headquartered in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Founded in 1885 in the isolated mining town of Broken Hill, it was the world's largest mining company measured by 2015 market values and Australia's fourth largest company (by revenue), formerly the largest.
BHP Billiton was formed in 2001 through the merger of the Australian Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) and the Anglo–Dutch Billiton plc.[4] The result is a dual-listed company. The Australia-registered BHP Billiton Limited, which has equal financial share in the company, has a primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange and is one of the largest companies in Australia measured by market capitalisation. The English-registered BHP Billiton plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
In April 2017 activist hedge fund manager Elliott Advisors proposed a plan for BHP to spin off its American petroleum assets and significantly restructure the business, including the scrapping of its dual Sydney-London listing, suggesting shares be offered only in the United Kingdom., while leaving its headquarters and tax residences in Australia where shares would trade as depositary instruments. At the time of the correspondence Elliott held about 4.1 percent of the issued shares in London-listed BHP Billiton PLC, worth $3.81 billion. Australia's government warned it would block moves to shift BHP's stock listing from Australia to the United Kingdom. Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison said the move would be contrary to the country's national interest and would breach government orders mandating a listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. BHP dismissed the plan saying the costs and risks of Elliott's proposal outweighed any potential benefits.[5]
In May 2017 with much of the former Billiton assets having been disposed of, BHP Billiton began to rebrand itself as BHP, at first in Australia and then globally. It replaced the slogan "The Big Australian" with "Think Big", with an advertising campaign rolling out in mid May 2017.[6] Work on the change began in 2015 according to BHP's chief external affairs officer.[7]
BHP's global headquarters and Australian registered (corporate) office is located at 171 Collins Street, Melbourne Australia.

History[edit]
Billiton[edit]




The former Billiton logo


Billiton was a mining company whose origins stretch back to 29 September 1860, when the articles of association were approved by a meeting of shareholders in the Groot Keizerhof hotel in The Hague, the Netherlands.[8]
Two months later, the company acquired the mineral rights to the tin-rich Billiton (Belitung) and Bangka Islands in the Netherlands Indies archipelago, off the eastern coast of Sumatra.[8]
Billiton's initial business forays included tin and lead smelting in the Netherlands, followed in the 1940s by bauxite mining in Indonesia and Suriname. In 1970, Shell acquired Billiton accelerated this growth.[8] The tin and lead smelter in Arnhem, the Netherlands, was shut down in the 1990s. Billiton owned a tin smelting and refining plant in Phuket, Thailand called Thaisarco (short for Thailand Smelting And Refining Company, Limited), which still exists today.[9]
In 1994, South Africa's Gencor Ltd. acquired the mining division of Billiton excluding the downstream metal division.[10] Billiton was divested from Gencor in 1997.[11]
In 1997, Billiton plc became a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[8] Throughout the 1990s and beyond, Billiton plc experienced considerable growth. Its portfolio included aluminium smelters in South Africa and Mozambique, nickel operations in Australia and Colombia, base metals mines in South America, Canada and South Africa, coal mines in Australia, Colombia and South Africa, as well as interests in operations in Brazil, Suriname, Australia (aluminium) and South Africa (titanium minerals and steel and ferroalloys).
In 2001 Billiton plc merged with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) to form BHP Billiton.[4]
In 2015, BHP Billiton spun off a number of its subsidiaries[12] in South Africa and Southern Africa to form a new company known as South32.[13][14] South32 is invested in manganese production[15] and coal mining activities in South Africa, Brazil, Australia and the Far East.
In August 2016, the company recorded its worst annual loss in history, $6.4 billion.[16]
Towards the end of 2016 BHP indicated it would be expanding its petroleum business with new investments in the sector.[17]
Broken Hill Proprietary Company[edit]




The former Broken Hill Proprietary Company logo


The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) also known by the nickname "the Big Australian",[18] was incorporated in 1885, operating the silver and lead mine at Broken Hill in western New South Wales, Australia.[19][20] The Broken Hill group floated on 10 August 1885.[21] The first consignment of Broken Hill ore (48 tons, 5 cwt, 3grs) was smelted at the Intercolonial Smelting and Refining Company's works at Spotswood, Melbourne.[21]

The resulting 35,605 ounces of silver raised a lot of interest when exhibited at the City of Melbourne Bank in Collins St. Some sceptics asserted the promoters were merely using silver from somewhere else, to ramp up the shares...Another shareholder, the dominating W.R. Wilson had had to lend [William Jamieson, General Manager] a new suit so he could take the first prospectus, printed at Silverton near Broken Hill on 20 June 1885, to Adelaide to start the float process.[21]

The geographic Broken Hill, for which the town was named, was discovered and named by Charles Sturt, and created much interest among prospectors, but nothing of note was discovered until Charles Rasp, boundary rider for the encompassing Mount Gipps Station, pegged out a 40-acre claim with contractors David James and James Poole, then with half-a-dozen backers (the Syndicate of Seven) including station manager George McCulloch (a young cousin of Victorian Premier Sir James McCulloch[22]) formed the Broken Hill Company to stake out the whole Hill. In the ensuing months of fruitless search and with costs mounting, several of the original seven parted with their shares, and at the eve of the Company's great success there were nine shareholders, including Rasp, McCulloch, William Jamieson (who bought up shares from several of the founders), Philip Charley, David James, James Poole, Bowes Kelly and W. R. Wilson.[23]
John Darling, Jr. became a director of the company in 1892 and was chairman of directors from 1907 to 1914.[24]
In 1915, the company ventured into steel manufacturing, with its operations based primarily in Newcastle, New South Wales. The decision to move from mining ore at Broken Hill to open a steelworks at Newcastle was due to the technical limitations in recovering value from mining the 'lower-lying sulphide ores'.[25] The discovery of Iron Knob and Iron Monarch near the western shore of the Spencer Gulf in South Australia combined with the development by the BHP metallurgist A. D. Carmichael of a technique for 'separating zinc sulphides from the accompanying earth and rock' led BHP 'to implement the startlingly simple and cheap process for liberating vast amounts of valuable metals out of sulphide ores, including huge heaps of tailings and slimes up to' 40 ft (12 m) high.[26]
The company began petroleum exploration in the 1960s with discoveries in Bass Strait, an activity which became an increasing focus.[27]
BHP began to diversify offshore in a variety of projects. One project was the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea, where the company was successfully sued by the indigenous inhabitants because of the environmental degradation caused by the mine operations.[28] BHP had better success with the giant Escondida copper mine in Chile (57.5 percent owned) and the EKATI Diamond Mine in northern Canada.[29] which it divested in 2013 to Dominion Diamond Corporation (formerly Harry Winston Diamond Corporation).[30]
The inefficiencies of what was, by global standards, a small steel operation in Newcastle finally caught up with the company and the Newcastle operations were closed in 1999.[31] The 'long products' side of the steel business was spun off to form OneSteel in 2000.[32]
BHP Billiton[edit]

In 2001, BHP merged with the Billiton mining company to form BHP Billiton. In 2002, the 'flat products' steel business was spun off to form BHP Steel. In 2003, BHP Steel changed its name to BlueScope Steel.[33]
In March 2005, BHP Billiton announced a US$7.3 billion agreed bid for another mining company, WMC Resources, owners of the Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium mine in South Australia, nickel operations in Western Australia and Queensland, and a fertiliser plant also in Queensland. The takeover achieved 90 percent acceptance on 17 June 2005, and 100 percent ownership was announced on 2 August 2005, achieved through compulsory acquisition of the last 10 percent of the shares.[34]
On 8 November 2007, BHP Billiton announced it was seeking to purchase rival mining group Rio Tinto Group in an all-share deal. The initial offer of 3.4 shares of BHP Billiton stock for each share of Rio Tinto was rejected by the board of Rio Tinto for "significantly undervaluing" the company. It was unknown at the time whether BHP Billiton would attempt to purchase Rio Tinto through some form of hostile takeover;[35] however, CEO Marius Kloppers met with many of Rio's shareholders following the announcement and reiterated that the offer for Rio was "compelling" and that BHP Billiton is very "patient".[36] A formal hostile bid of 3.4 BHP Billiton shares for each Rio Tinto share was announced on 6 February 2008.[37] The bid was withdrawn on 25 November 2008 due to a global recession.[38]
On 14 May 2008, BHP Billiton shares rose to a record high of A$48.90 after speculation that Chinese mining firm Chinalco was considering purchasing a large stake. BHP Billiton representatives had no comment.[39]
On 25 November 2008, Billiton announced that it would drop its A$66 billion takeover of rival Rio Tinto Group saying that the "risks to shareholder value" would "increase" to "an unacceptable level" due to the global financial crisis.[40]
On 21 January 2009, the company announced that in response to the global financial crisis the BHP Billiton Ravensthorpe Nickel Project in Western Australia would cease operations, with a resultant discontinuation of shipments of ore from Ravensthorpe to the Yabulu nickel plant in Queensland Australia.[41] Subsequently, the Yabulu refinery was sold to Queensland billionaire Mr Clive Palmer. Additionally, the Pinto Valley mine in the United States was closed. In total, 6,000 employees were laid off, including those laid off with the scaling back at some other projects.[42]
On 9 December 2009, BHP Billiton sold its Ravensthorpe Nickel Mine, which cost A$2.4 billion to build, to Vancouver-based First Quantum Minerals for US$340 million. First Quantum was one of three bidders for the mine and actually produced the lowest offer. The Canadian company plans to have the mine back in production in mid-2011. Ravensthorpe cost BHP US$3.6 billion in writedowns when it was shut in January 2009 after less than a year of production.[43]
In January 2010, after BHP Billiton bought Athabasca Potash for US$320m, The Economist reported that by 2020, BHP Billiton could produce approximately 15 percent of the world demand for potash.[44]
In August 2010, BHP Billiton made a hostile takeover bid worth US$40 billion for the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The bid came after BHP's first bid, made on 17 August, was rejected as being undervalued.[45] This acquisition marked a major strategic move by BHP outside hard commodities and commenced the diversification of its business away from resources with high exposure to carbon price risk (coal, petroleum, iron ore). The takeover bid was opposed by the Government of Saskatchewan under Premier Brad Wall. On 3 November, Canadian Industry Minister Tony Clement announced the preliminary rejection of the deal under the Investment Canada Act, giving BHP Billiton 30 days to refine their deal before a final decision was made.[46]
On 14 November 2010, the company announced that it was dropping its offer for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan.[47]
On 22 February 2011 BHP announced that it paid $4.75 billion in cash to Chesapeake Energy Corp for all of the company's Fayetteville shale assets which include 487,000 acres (1,970 km2) of mineral rights leases and 420 miles (680 km) of pipeline located in north central Arkansas in the United States. The wells on the mineral leases are currently producing about 415 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. BHP plans to spend $800 million to $1 billion a year over 10 years to develop the field and triple production.[48]
On 14 July 2011, BHP Billiton announced that it would acquire Petrohawk Energy of the United States for approximately $12.1 billion in cash, considerably expanding its shale natural gas resources[49] in an offer of $US38.75 per share.[50]
In August 2012, BHP Billiton announced that it was shelving its US$20 billion (£12 billion) Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine expansion project in South Australia, as a result of falling commodity prices and slowing global economic growth.[51][52] The company simultaneously announced a freeze on approving any major new expansion projects.[51][52]
Days after announcing the Olympic Dam pull-out, BHP announced that it was selling its Yeelirrie Uranium Project to Canadian Cameco for a fee of around $430 million. The sale was part of a broader move to step away from resource expansion in Australia.[53]
On 19 August 2014, BHP Billiton announced it would create an independent global metals and mining company based on a selection of its aluminium, coal, manganese, nickel and silver assets.[54] The newly formed entity, named South32, was subsequently demerged with listings on the Australian Securities Exchange the JSE and the London Stock Exchange.[54]
BHP Billiton agreed to pay a fine of $25 million to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in 2015 in connection with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act related to its "hospitality program" at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. BHP Billiton invited 176 government and state-owned enterprise officials to attend the Games on an all-expenses-paid package. While BHP Billiton claimed to have compliance processes in place to avoid conflicts of interest, the SEC found that BHP Billiton had invited officials from at least four countries where BHP Billiton had interests in influencing the officials' decisions (Congo, Guinea, Philippines and Burundi).[55]
In 2017, BHP Billiton announced a $2.2billion investment in the new BP platform in the Gulf of Mexico.[56] During the same year, as part of their plan to increase productivity at the Escondida mine in Chile,[57] which is the world's biggest copper mine, BHP Billiton attempted to get workers to accept a 4-year pay freeze, a 66% reduction in the end-of-conflict bonus offering, and increased shift flexibility. This resulted in a major workers' strike and forced the company to declare ‘force majeure’ on two shipments, which drove copper prices up by 4%.[58]
Corporate affairs[edit]

Senior management[edit]
In 1998, with the stock price at less than $7 per share, BHP hired an American, Paul Anderson to reconstruct the company. Anderson was successful in this and completed his four-year stint with a merger between BHP and London-based Billiton. The CEO position was passed to Brian Gilbertson of Billiton but in 2003, after just six months in the CEO role, Gilbertson abruptly stepped down and cited irreconcilable differences with the boards as the reason for his resignation.[60]
Upon Gilbertson's departure, Chip Goodyear, an Anderson protégé, was appointed the new CEO and he continued in that role until his retirement on 30 September 2007, with the stock price over $80 per share. Marius Kloppers was Goodyear's successor.[61] Following the end of Kloppers' tenure in 2013, Andrew Mackenzie, the Chief Executive of Non-Ferrous, assumed the role of CEO. In response to investor demands and a diminishing mining boom, BHP Billiton announced in mid-April 2013 that Mackenzie's remuneration package would be 25 per cent less than that of Kloppers—Barry Fitzgerald, writing for The Australian, stated that the decision represented the introduction of a "new era of austerity" for the corporation.[62]
Operations[edit]

The United Nations Environment Programme has noted that BHP’s Ok Tedi mine site’s "uncontrolled discharge of 70 million tonnes of waste rock and mine tailings annually has spread more than 10 km (6.2 mi) down the Ok Tedi and Fly rivers, raising river beds and causing flooding, sediment deposition, forest damage, and a serious decline in the area's biodiversity."[66] The resulting devastation caused by the mining of Ok Tedi has included the loss of fish, a vital food source for the local community; loss of forest and crops due to flooding; and the loss of "areas of deep spiritual value for villagers are now submerged in mine tailings."[67]

Social and environmental responsibility[edit]




A village flooded in the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster (2015). The dam was a property of Samarco, a joint venture between Vale and BHP Billiton.


BHP Billiton is listed as one of the 90 companies extracting and marketing fossil fuels that are responsible for two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of the industrial age.[68] Its cumulative emissions until 2010 have been estimated at 7,606 MtCO2e, representing 0.52% of global industrial emissions between 1751-2010, and ranking it the 19th largest corporate polluter.[69] According to BHP Billiton management 10% of these emissions are from direct operations, while 90% are from products sold by the company.[70] BHP Billiton has been voluntarily reporting its direct GHG emissions since 1996. In 2013 it was criticised in 2013 for lobbying against carbon pricing in Australia.[71]
BHP Billiton voluntarily donates one per cent of pre-tax profit, calculated on the average of the previous three years’ pre-tax profit, in community programs[72] and made US$241.7 million of community donations including a US$100 million contribution to BHP Billiton corporate charitable entities.[73] BHP Billiton is a founding partner and co-funder (with the Australian Government) of Bush Blitz, operated by Australian Biological Resources Study with Earthwatch Australia.[74]
Significant accidents[edit]
Inclement weather caused a BHP Billiton helicopter to crash in Angola on 16 November 2007, killing the helicopter's five passengers. The dead were: BHP Billiton Angola Chief Operating Officer David Hopgood, Australian; Angola Technical Services Operations Manager Kevin Ayre, British; Wild Dog Helicopters pilot Kottie Breedt, South African; Guy Sommerfield of MMC, British; and Louwrens Prinsloo of Prinsloo Drilling, Namibian. The helicopter went down approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) from Alto Cuilo exploration facility in north eastern Angola. BHP Billiton responded by suspending operations in the country.[75]
On 5 November 2015 a dam holding back waste water from an iron ore mine in Mariana, south-eastern Brazil, owned by BHP Billiton and Vale collapsed, devastating a nearby town with mudslides, killing at least 17 people, injuring more than 50 and causing enormous ecological damage,[76] and threatening life along the river Rio Doce and the Atlantic sea near the mouth of the Rio Doce.[77] The accident was the biggest environmental disaster in Brazil's history.[78]

The former BHP Billiton logo


BHP, the trading entity of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton plc and formerly known as BHP Billiton, is an Anglo-Australian multinational mining, metals and petroleum dual-listed public company headquartered in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Founded in 1885 in the isolated mining town of Broken Hill, it was the world's largest mining company measured by 2015 market values and Australia's fourth largest company (by revenue), formerly the largest.
BHP Billiton was formed in 2001 through the merger of the Australian Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) and the Anglo–Dutch Billiton plc.[4] The result is a dual-listed company. The Australia-registered BHP Billiton Limited, which has equal financial share in the company, has a primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange and is one of the largest companies in Australia measured by market capitalisation. The English-registered BHP Billiton plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
In April 2017 activist hedge fund manager Elliott Advisors proposed a plan for BHP to spin off its American petroleum assets and significantly restructure the business, including the scrapping of its dual Sydney-London listing, suggesting shares be offered only in the United Kingdom., while leaving its headquarters and tax residences in Australia where shares would trade as depositary instruments. At the time of the correspondence Elliott held about 4.1 percent of the issued shares in London-listed BHP Billiton PLC, worth $3.81 billion. Australia's government warned it would block moves to shift BHP's stock listing from Australia to the United Kingdom. Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison said the move would be contrary to the country's national interest and would breach government orders mandating a listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. BHP dismissed the plan saying the costs and risks of Elliott's proposal outweighed any potential benefits.[5]
In May 2017 with much of the former Billiton assets having been disposed of, BHP Billiton began to rebrand itself as BHP, at first in Australia and then globally. It replaced the slogan "The Big Australian" with "Think Big", with an advertising campaign rolling out in mid May 2017.[6] Work on the change began in 2015 according to BHP's chief external affairs officer.[7]
BHP's global headquarters and Australian registered (corporate) office is located at 171 Collins Street, Melbourne Australia.

History[edit]
Billiton[edit]




The former Billiton logo


Billiton was a mining company whose origins stretch back to 29 September 1860, when the articles of association were approved by a meeting of shareholders in the Groot Keizerhof hotel in The Hague, the Netherlands.[8]
Two months later, the company acquired the mineral rights to the tin-rich Billiton (Belitung) and Bangka Islands in the Netherlands Indies archipelago, off the eastern coast of Sumatra.[8]
Billiton's initial business forays included tin and lead smelting in the Netherlands, followed in the 1940s by bauxite mining in Indonesia and Suriname. In 1970, Shell acquired Billiton accelerated this growth.[8] The tin and lead smelter in Arnhem, the Netherlands, was shut down in the 1990s. Billiton owned a tin smelting and refining plant in Phuket, Thailand called Thaisarco (short for Thailand Smelting And Refining Company, Limited), which still exists today.[9]
In 1994, South Africa's Gencor Ltd. acquired the mining division of Billiton excluding the downstream metal division.[10] Billiton was divested from Gencor in 1997.[11]
In 1997, Billiton plc became a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[8] Throughout the 1990s and beyond, Billiton plc experienced considerable growth. Its portfolio included aluminium smelters in South Africa and Mozambique, nickel operations in Australia and Colombia, base metals mines in South America, Canada and South Africa, coal mines in Australia, Colombia and South Africa, as well as interests in operations in Brazil, Suriname, Australia (aluminium) and South Africa (titanium minerals and steel and ferroalloys).
In 2001 Billiton plc merged with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) to form BHP Billiton.[4]
In 2015, BHP Billiton spun off a number of its subsidiaries[12] in South Africa and Southern Africa to form a new company known as South32.[13][14] South32 is invested in manganese production[15] and coal mining activities in South Africa, Brazil, Australia and the Far East.
In August 2016, the company recorded its worst annual loss in history, $6.4 billion.[16]
Towards the end of 2016 BHP indicated it would be expanding its petroleum business with new investments in the sector.[17]
Broken Hill Proprietary Company[edit]




The former Broken Hill Proprietary Company logo


The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) also known by the nickname "the Big Australian",[18] was incorporated in 1885, operating the silver and lead mine at Broken Hill in western New South Wales, Australia.[19][20] The Broken Hill group floated on 10 August 1885.[21] The first consignment of Broken Hill ore (48 tons, 5 cwt, 3grs) was smelted at the Intercolonial Smelting and Refining Company's works at Spotswood, Melbourne.[21]

The resulting 35,605 ounces of silver raised a lot of interest when exhibited at the City of Melbourne Bank in Collins St. Some sceptics asserted the promoters were merely using silver from somewhere else, to ramp up the shares...Another shareholder, the dominating W.R. Wilson had had to lend [William Jamieson, General Manager] a new suit so he could take the first prospectus, printed at Silverton near Broken Hill on 20 June 1885, to Adelaide to start the float process.[21]

The geographic Broken Hill, for which the town was named, was discovered and named by Charles Sturt, and created much interest among prospectors, but nothing of note was discovered until Charles Rasp, boundary rider for the encompassing Mount Gipps Station, pegged out a 40-acre claim with contractors David James and James Poole, then with half-a-dozen backers (the Syndicate of Seven) including station manager George McCulloch (a young cousin of Victorian Premier Sir James McCulloch[22]) formed the Broken Hill Company to stake out the whole Hill. In the ensuing months of fruitless search and with costs mounting, several of the original seven parted with their shares, and at the eve of the Company's great success there were nine shareholders, including Rasp, McCulloch, William Jamieson (who bought up shares from several of the founders), Philip Charley, David James, James Poole, Bowes Kelly and W. R. Wilson.[23]
John Darling, Jr. became a director of the company in 1892 and was chairman of directors from 1907 to 1914.[24]
In 1915, the company ventured into steel manufacturing, with its operations based primarily in Newcastle, New South Wales. The decision to move from mining ore at Broken Hill to open a steelworks at Newcastle was due to the technical limitations in recovering value from mining the 'lower-lying sulphide ores'.[25] The discovery of Iron Knob and Iron Monarch near the western shore of the Spencer Gulf in South Australia combined with the development by the BHP metallurgist A. D. Carmichael of a technique for 'separating zinc sulphides from the accompanying earth and rock' led BHP 'to implement the startlingly simple and cheap process for liberating vast amounts of valuable metals out of sulphide ores, including huge heaps of tailings and slimes up to' 40 ft (12 m) high.[26]
The company began petroleum exploration in the 1960s with discoveries in Bass Strait, an activity which became an increasing focus.[27]
BHP began to diversify offshore in a variety of projects. One project was the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea, where the company was successfully sued by the indigenous inhabitants because of the environmental degradation caused by the mine operations.[28] BHP had better success with the giant Escondida copper mine in Chile (57.5 percent owned) and the EKATI Diamond Mine in northern Canada.[29] which it divested in 2013 to Dominion Diamond Corporation (formerly Harry Winston Diamond Corporation).[30]
The inefficiencies of what was, by global standards, a small steel operation in Newcastle finally caught up with the company and the Newcastle operations were closed in 1999.[31] The 'long products' side of the steel business was spun off to form OneSteel in 2000.[32]
BHP Billiton[edit]

In 2001, BHP merged with the Billiton mining company to form BHP Billiton. In 2002, the 'flat products' steel business was spun off to form BHP Steel. In 2003, BHP Steel changed its name to BlueScope Steel.[33]
In March 2005, BHP Billiton announced a US$7.3 billion agreed bid for another mining company, WMC Resources, owners of the Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium mine in South Australia, nickel operations in Western Australia and Queensland, and a fertiliser plant also in Queensland. The takeover achieved 90 percent acceptance on 17 June 2005, and 100 percent ownership was announced on 2 August 2005, achieved through compulsory acquisition of the last 10 percent of the shares.[34]
On 8 November 2007, BHP Billiton announced it was seeking to purchase rival mining group Rio Tinto Group in an all-share deal. The initial offer of 3.4 shares of BHP Billiton stock for each share of Rio Tinto was rejected by the board of Rio Tinto for "significantly undervaluing" the company. It was unknown at the time whether BHP Billiton would attempt to purchase Rio Tinto through some form of hostile takeover;[35] however, CEO Marius Kloppers met with many of Rio's shareholders following the announcement and reiterated that the offer for Rio was "compelling" and that BHP Billiton is very "patient".[36] A formal hostile bid of 3.4 BHP Billiton shares for each Rio Tinto share was announced on 6 February 2008.[37] The bid was withdrawn on 25 November 2008 due to a global recession.[38]
On 14 May 2008, BHP Billiton shares rose to a record high of A$48.90 after speculation that Chinese mining firm Chinalco was considering purchasing a large stake. BHP Billiton representatives had no comment.[39]
On 25 November 2008, Billiton announced that it would drop its A$66 billion takeover of rival Rio Tinto Group saying that the "risks to shareholder value" would "increase" to "an unacceptable level" due to the global financial crisis.[40]
On 21 January 2009, the company announced that in response to the global financial crisis the BHP Billiton Ravensthorpe Nickel Project in Western Australia would cease operations, with a resultant discontinuation of shipments of ore from Ravensthorpe to the Yabulu nickel plant in Queensland Australia.[41] Subsequently, the Yabulu refinery was sold to Queensland billionaire Mr Clive Palmer. Additionally, the Pinto Valley mine in the United States was closed. In total, 6,000 employees were laid off, including those laid off with the scaling back at some other projects.[42]
On 9 December 2009, BHP Billiton sold its Ravensthorpe Nickel Mine, which cost A$2.4 billion to build, to Vancouver-based First Quantum Minerals for US$340 million. First Quantum was one of three bidders for the mine and actually produced the lowest offer. The Canadian company plans to have the mine back in production in mid-2011. Ravensthorpe cost BHP US$3.6 billion in writedowns when it was shut in January 2009 after less than a year of production.[43]
In January 2010, after BHP Billiton bought Athabasca Potash for US$320m, The Economist reported that by 2020, BHP Billiton could produce approximately 15 percent of the world demand for potash.[44]
In August 2010, BHP Billiton made a hostile takeover bid worth US$40 billion for the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The bid came after BHP's first bid, made on 17 August, was rejected as being undervalued.[45] This acquisition marked a major strategic move by BHP outside hard commodities and commenced the diversification of its business away from resources with high exposure to carbon price risk (coal, petroleum, iron ore). The takeover bid was opposed by the Government of Saskatchewan under Premier Brad Wall. On 3 November, Canadian Industry Minister Tony Clement announced the preliminary rejection of the deal under the Investment Canada Act, giving BHP Billiton 30 days to refine their deal before a final decision was made.[46]
On 14 November 2010, the company announced that it was dropping its offer for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan.[47]
On 22 February 2011 BHP announced that it paid $4.75 billion in cash to Chesapeake Energy Corp for all of the company's Fayetteville shale assets which include 487,000 acres (1,970 km2) of mineral rights leases and 420 miles (680 km) of pipeline located in north central Arkansas in the United States. The wells on the mineral leases are currently producing about 415 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. BHP plans to spend $800 million to $1 billion a year over 10 years to develop the field and triple production.[48]
On 14 July 2011, BHP Billiton announced that it would acquire Petrohawk Energy of the United States for approximately $12.1 billion in cash, considerably expanding its shale natural gas resources[49] in an offer of $US38.75 per share.[50]
In August 2012, BHP Billiton announced that it was shelving its US$20 billion (£12 billion) Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine expansion project in South Australia, as a result of falling commodity prices and slowing global economic growth.[51][52] The company simultaneously announced a freeze on approving any major new expansion projects.[51][52]
Days after announcing the Olympic Dam pull-out, BHP announced that it was selling its Yeelirrie Uranium Project to Canadian Cameco for a fee of around $430 million. The sale was part of a broader move to step away from resource expansion in Australia.[53]
On 19 August 2014, BHP Billiton announced it would create an independent global metals and mining company based on a selection of its aluminium, coal, manganese, nickel and silver assets.[54] The newly formed entity, named South32, was subsequently demerged with listings on the Australian Securities Exchange the JSE and the London Stock Exchange.[54]
BHP Billiton agreed to pay a fine of $25 million to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in 2015 in connection with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act related to its "hospitality program" at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. BHP Billiton invited 176 government and state-owned enterprise officials to attend the Games on an all-expenses-paid package. While BHP Billiton claimed to have compliance processes in place to avoid conflicts of interest, the SEC found that BHP Billiton had invited officials from at least four countries where BHP Billiton had interests in influencing the officials' decisions (Congo, Guinea, Philippines and Burundi).[55]
In 2017, BHP Billiton announced a $2.2billion investment in the new BP platform in the Gulf of Mexico.[56] During the same year, as part of their plan to increase productivity at the Escondida mine in Chile,[57] which is the world's biggest copper mine, BHP Billiton attempted to get workers to accept a 4-year pay freeze, a 66% reduction in the end-of-conflict bonus offering, and increased shift flexibility. This resulted in a major workers' strike and forced the company to declare ‘force majeure’ on two shipments, which drove copper prices up by 4%.[58]
Corporate affairs[edit]
The Australian BHP Billiton Limited and the British BHP Billiton plc are separately listed with separate shareholder bodies, but they operate as one business with identical boards of directors and a single management structure. The global headquarters of the BHP Billiton Group & BHP Billiton Limited (Australia) are located in Melbourne, Australia. BHP Billiton plc is located in London, England.[1] BHP Billiton also has offices in Houston, USA, Santiago, Perth, Brisbane, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Shanghai.
The company's shares trade on the following exchanges:[59]

Senior management[edit]
In 1998, with the stock price at less than $7 per share, BHP hired an American, Paul Anderson to reconstruct the company. Anderson was successful in this and completed his four-year stint with a merger between BHP and London-based Billiton. The CEO position was passed to Brian Gilbertson of Billiton but in 2003, after just six months in the CEO role, Gilbertson abruptly stepped down and cited irreconcilable differences with the boards as the reason for his resignation.[60]
Upon Gilbertson's departure, Chip Goodyear, an Anderson protégé, was appointed the new CEO and he continued in that role until his retirement on 30 September 2007, with the stock price over $80 per share. Marius Kloppers was Goodyear's successor.[61] Following the end of Kloppers' tenure in 2013, Andrew Mackenzie, the Chief Executive of Non-Ferrous, assumed the role of CEO. In response to investor demands and a diminishing mining boom, BHP Billiton announced in mid-April 2013 that Mackenzie's remuneration package would be 25 per cent less than that of Kloppers—Barry Fitzgerald, writing for The Australian, stated that the decision represented the introduction of a "new era of austerity" for the corporation.[62]
Operations[edit]
Current[edit]
BHP operates a wide variety of mining, processing and oil and gas production operations in over 25 countries,[63] employing approximately 41,000 people.
The company has four primary operational units, with an optional fifth operational unit, referred to as Businesses:

Coal
Copper
Iron ore
Petroleum
Potash

At the end of fiscal year 2015, BHP Billiton, produced more than 256 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe), 1.7 million tonnes (Mt) of copper, 233 Mt of iron ore, 43 Mt of metallurgical coal and 41 Mt of energy coal.
In addition it has subsidiary logistics companies BHP Transport and Logistics Pty Ltd (incorporating the former BHP Shipping) and BHPB Freight Pty Ltd.

The United Nations Environment Programme has noted that BHP’s Ok Tedi mine site’s "uncontrolled discharge of 70 million tonnes of waste rock and mine tailings annually has spread more than 10 km (6.2 mi) down the Ok Tedi and Fly rivers, raising river beds and causing flooding, sediment deposition, forest damage, and a serious decline in the area's biodiversity."[66] The resulting devastation caused by the mining of Ok Tedi has included the loss of fish, a vital food source for the local community; loss of forest and crops due to flooding; and the loss of "areas of deep spiritual value for villagers are now submerged in mine tailings."[67]

Social and environmental responsibility[edit]




A village flooded in the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster (2015). The dam was a property of Samarco, a joint venture between Vale and BHP Billiton.


BHP Billiton is listed as one of the 90 companies extracting and marketing fossil fuels that are responsible for two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of the industrial age.[68] Its cumulative emissions until 2010 have been estimated at 7,606 MtCO2e, representing 0.52% of global industrial emissions between 1751-2010, and ranking it the 19th largest corporate polluter.[69] According to BHP Billiton management 10% of these emissions are from direct operations, while 90% are from products sold by the company.[70] BHP Billiton has been voluntarily reporting its direct GHG emissions since 1996. In 2013 it was criticised in 2013 for lobbying against carbon pricing in Australia.[71]
BHP Billiton voluntarily donates one per cent of pre-tax profit, calculated on the average of the previous three years’ pre-tax profit, in community programs[72] and made US$241.7 million of community donations including a US$100 million contribution to BHP Billiton corporate charitable entities.[73] BHP Billiton is a founding partner and co-funder (with the Australian Government) of Bush Blitz, operated by Australian Biological Resources Study with Earthwatch Australia.[74]
Significant accidents[edit]
Inclement weather caused a BHP Billiton helicopter to crash in Angola on 16 November 2007, killing the helicopter's five passengers. The dead were: BHP Billiton Angola Chief Operating Officer David Hopgood, Australian; Angola Technical Services Operations Manager Kevin Ayre, British; Wild Dog Helicopters pilot Kottie Breedt, South African; Guy Sommerfield of MMC, British; and Louwrens Prinsloo of Prinsloo Drilling, Namibian. The helicopter went down approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) from Alto Cuilo exploration facility in north eastern Angola. BHP Billiton responded by suspending operations in the country.[75]
On 5 November 2015 a dam holding back waste water from an iron ore mine in Mariana, south-eastern Brazil, owned by BHP Billiton and Vale collapsed, devastating a nearby town with mudslides, killing at least 17 people, injuring more than 50 and causing enormous ecological damage,[76] and threatening life along the river Rio Doce and the Atlantic sea near the mouth of the Rio Doce.[77] The accident was the biggest environmental disaster in Brazil's history.[78]

The former BHP Billiton logo


BHP, the trading entity of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton plc and formerly known as BHP Billiton, is an Anglo-Australian multinational mining, metals and petroleum dual-listed public company headquartered in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Founded in 1885 in the isolated mining town of Broken Hill, it was the world's largest mining company measured by 2015 market values and Australia's fourth largest company (by revenue), formerly the largest.
BHP Billiton was formed in 2001 through the merger of the Australian Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) and the Anglo–Dutch Billiton plc.[4] The result is a dual-listed company. The Australia-registered BHP Billiton Limited, which has equal financial share in the company, has a primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange and is one of the largest companies in Australia measured by market capitalisation. The English-registered BHP Billiton plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
In April 2017 activist hedge fund manager Elliott Advisors proposed a plan for BHP to spin off its American petroleum assets and significantly restructure the business, including the scrapping of its dual Sydney-London listing, suggesting shares be offered only in the United Kingdom., while leaving its headquarters and tax residences in Australia where shares would trade as depositary instruments. At the time of the correspondence Elliott held about 4.1 percent of the issued shares in London-listed BHP Billiton PLC, worth $3.81 billion. Australia's government warned it would block moves to shift BHP's stock listing from Australia to the United Kingdom. Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison said the move would be contrary to the country's national interest and would breach government orders mandating a listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. BHP dismissed the plan saying the costs and risks of Elliott's proposal outweighed any potential benefits.[5]
In May 2017 with much of the former Billiton assets having been disposed of, BHP Billiton began to rebrand itself as BHP, at first in Australia and then globally. It replaced the slogan "The Big Australian" with "Think Big", with an advertising campaign rolling out in mid May 2017.[6] Work on the change began in 2015 according to BHP's chief external affairs officer.[7]
BHP's global headquarters and Australian registered (corporate) office is located at 171 Collins Street, Melbourne Australia.

History[edit]
Billiton[edit]




The former Billiton logo


Billiton was a mining company whose origins stretch back to 29 September 1860, when the articles of association were approved by a meeting of shareholders in the Groot Keizerhof hotel in The Hague, the Netherlands.[8]
Two months later, the company acquired the mineral rights to the tin-rich Billiton (Belitung) and Bangka Islands in the Netherlands Indies archipelago, off the eastern coast of Sumatra.[8]
Billiton's initial business forays included tin and lead smelting in the Netherlands, followed in the 1940s by bauxite mining in Indonesia and Suriname. In 1970, Shell acquired Billiton accelerated this growth.[8] The tin and lead smelter in Arnhem, the Netherlands, was shut down in the 1990s. Billiton owned a tin smelting and refining plant in Phuket, Thailand called Thaisarco (short for Thailand Smelting And Refining Company, Limited), which still exists today.[9]
In 1994, South Africa's Gencor Ltd. acquired the mining division of Billiton excluding the downstream metal division.[10] Billiton was divested from Gencor in 1997.[11]
In 1997, Billiton plc became a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[8] Throughout the 1990s and beyond, Billiton plc experienced considerable growth. Its portfolio included aluminium smelters in South Africa and Mozambique, nickel operations in Australia and Colombia, base metals mines in South America, Canada and South Africa, coal mines in Australia, Colombia and South Africa, as well as interests in operations in Brazil, Suriname, Australia (aluminium) and South Africa (titanium minerals and steel and ferroalloys).
In 2001 Billiton plc merged with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) to form BHP Billiton.[4]
In 2015, BHP Billiton spun off a number of its subsidiaries[12] in South Africa and Southern Africa to form a new company known as South32.[13][14] South32 is invested in manganese production[15] and coal mining activities in South Africa, Brazil, Australia and the Far East.
In August 2016, the company recorded its worst annual loss in history, $6.4 billion.[16]
Towards the end of 2016 BHP indicated it would be expanding its petroleum business with new investments in the sector.[17]
Broken Hill Proprietary Company[edit]




The former Broken Hill Proprietary Company logo


The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) also known by the nickname "the Big Australian",[18] was incorporated in 1885, operating the silver and lead mine at Broken Hill in western New South Wales, Australia.[19][20] The Broken Hill group floated on 10 August 1885.[21] The first consignment of Broken Hill ore (48 tons, 5 cwt, 3grs) was smelted at the Intercolonial Smelting and Refining Company's works at Spotswood, Melbourne.[21]

The resulting 35,605 ounces of silver raised a lot of interest when exhibited at the City of Melbourne Bank in Collins St. Some sceptics asserted the promoters were merely using silver from somewhere else, to ramp up the shares...Another shareholder, the dominating W.R. Wilson had had to lend [William Jamieson, General Manager] a new suit so he could take the first prospectus, printed at Silverton near Broken Hill on 20 June 1885, to Adelaide to start the float process.[21]

The geographic Broken Hill, for which the town was named, was discovered and named by Charles Sturt, and created much interest among prospectors, but nothing of note was discovered until Charles Rasp, boundary rider for the encompassing Mount Gipps Station, pegged out a 40-acre claim with contractors David James and James Poole, then with half-a-dozen backers (the Syndicate of Seven) including station manager George McCulloch (a young cousin of Victorian Premier Sir James McCulloch[22]) formed the Broken Hill Company to stake out the whole Hill. In the ensuing months of fruitless search and with costs mounting, several of the original seven parted with their shares, and at the eve of the Company's great success there were nine shareholders, including Rasp, McCulloch, William Jamieson (who bought up shares from several of the founders), Philip Charley, David James, James Poole, Bowes Kelly and W. R. Wilson.[23]
John Darling, Jr. became a director of the company in 1892 and was chairman of directors from 1907 to 1914.[24]
In 1915, the company ventured into steel manufacturing, with its operations based primarily in Newcastle, New South Wales. The decision to move from mining ore at Broken Hill to open a steelworks at Newcastle was due to the technical limitations in recovering value from mining the 'lower-lying sulphide ores'.[25] The discovery of Iron Knob and Iron Monarch near the western shore of the Spencer Gulf in South Australia combined with the development by the BHP metallurgist A. D. Carmichael of a technique for 'separating zinc sulphides from the accompanying earth and rock' led BHP 'to implement the startlingly simple and cheap process for liberating vast amounts of valuable metals out of sulphide ores, including huge heaps of tailings and slimes up to' 40 ft (12 m) high.[26]
The company began petroleum exploration in the 1960s with discoveries in Bass Strait, an activity which became an increasing focus.[27]
BHP began to diversify offshore in a variety of projects. One project was the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea, where the company was successfully sued by the indigenous inhabitants because of the environmental degradation caused by the mine operations.[28] BHP had better success with the giant Escondida copper mine in Chile (57.5 percent owned) and the EKATI Diamond Mine in northern Canada.[29] which it divested in 2013 to Dominion Diamond Corporation (formerly Harry Winston Diamond Corporation).[30]
The inefficiencies of what was, by global standards, a small steel operation in Newcastle finally caught up with the company and the Newcastle operations were closed in 1999.[31] The 'long products' side of the steel business was spun off to form OneSteel in 2000.[32]
BHP Billiton[edit]

In 2001, BHP merged with the Billiton mining company to form BHP Billiton. In 2002, the 'flat products' steel business was spun off to form BHP Steel. In 2003, BHP Steel changed its name to BlueScope Steel.[33]
In March 2005, BHP Billiton announced a US$7.3 billion agreed bid for another mining company, WMC Resources, owners of the Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium mine in South Australia, nickel operations in Western Australia and Queensland, and a fertiliser plant also in Queensland. The takeover achieved 90 percent acceptance on 17 June 2005, and 100 percent ownership was announced on 2 August 2005, achieved through compulsory acquisition of the last 10 percent of the shares.[34]
On 8 November 2007, BHP Billiton announced it was seeking to purchase rival mining group Rio Tinto Group in an all-share deal. The initial offer of 3.4 shares of BHP Billiton stock for each share of Rio Tinto was rejected by the board of Rio Tinto for "significantly undervaluing" the company. It was unknown at the time whether BHP Billiton would attempt to purchase Rio Tinto through some form of hostile takeover;[35] however, CEO Marius Kloppers met with many of Rio's shareholders following the announcement and reiterated that the offer for Rio was "compelling" and that BHP Billiton is very "patient".[36] A formal hostile bid of 3.4 BHP Billiton shares for each Rio Tinto share was announced on 6 February 2008.[37] The bid was withdrawn on 25 November 2008 due to a global recession.[38]
On 14 May 2008, BHP Billiton shares rose to a record high of A$48.90 after speculation that Chinese mining firm Chinalco was considering purchasing a large stake. BHP Billiton representatives had no comment.[39]
On 25 November 2008, Billiton announced that it would drop its A$66 billion takeover of rival Rio Tinto Group saying that the "risks to shareholder value" would "increase" to "an unacceptable level" due to the global financial crisis.[40]
On 21 January 2009, the company announced that in response to the global financial crisis the BHP Billiton Ravensthorpe Nickel Project in Western Australia would cease operations, with a resultant discontinuation of shipments of ore from Ravensthorpe to the Yabulu nickel plant in Queensland Australia.[41] Subsequently, the Yabulu refinery was sold to Queensland billionaire Mr Clive Palmer. Additionally, the Pinto Valley mine in the United States was closed. In total, 6,000 employees were laid off, including those laid off with the scaling back at some other projects.[42]
On 9 December 2009, BHP Billiton sold its Ravensthorpe Nickel Mine, which cost A$2.4 billion to build, to Vancouver-based First Quantum Minerals for US$340 million. First Quantum was one of three bidders for the mine and actually produced the lowest offer. The Canadian company plans to have the mine back in production in mid-2011. Ravensthorpe cost BHP US$3.6 billion in writedowns when it was shut in January 2009 after less than a year of production.[43]
In January 2010, after BHP Billiton bought Athabasca Potash for US$320m, The Economist reported that by 2020, BHP Billiton could produce approximately 15 percent of the world demand for potash.[44]
In August 2010, BHP Billiton made a hostile takeover bid worth US$40 billion for the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The bid came after BHP's first bid, made on 17 August, was rejected as being undervalued.[45] This acquisition marked a major strategic move by BHP outside hard commodities and commenced the diversification of its business away from resources with high exposure to carbon price risk (coal, petroleum, iron ore). The takeover bid was opposed by the Government of Saskatchewan under Premier Brad Wall. On 3 November, Canadian Industry Minister Tony Clement announced the preliminary rejection of the deal under the Investment Canada Act, giving BHP Billiton 30 days to refine their deal before a final decision was made.[46]
On 14 November 2010, the company announced that it was dropping its offer for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan.[47]
On 22 February 2011 BHP announced that it paid $4.75 billion in cash to Chesapeake Energy Corp for all of the company's Fayetteville shale assets which include 487,000 acres (1,970 km2) of mineral rights leases and 420 miles (680 km) of pipeline located in north central Arkansas in the United States. The wells on the mineral leases are currently producing about 415 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. BHP plans to spend $800 million to $1 billion a year over 10 years to develop the field and triple production.[48]
On 14 July 2011, BHP Billiton announced that it would acquire Petrohawk Energy of the United States for approximately $12.1 billion in cash, considerably expanding its shale natural gas resources[49] in an offer of $US38.75 per share.[50]
In August 2012, BHP Billiton announced that it was shelving its US$20 billion (£12 billion) Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine expansion project in South Australia, as a result of falling commodity prices and slowing global economic growth.[51][52] The company simultaneously announced a freeze on approving any major new expansion projects.[51][52]
Days after announcing the Olympic Dam pull-out, BHP announced that it was selling its Yeelirrie Uranium Project to Canadian Cameco for a fee of around $430 million. The sale was part of a broader move to step away from resource expansion in Australia.[53]
On 19 August 2014, BHP Billiton announced it would create an independent global metals and mining company based on a selection of its aluminium, coal, manganese, nickel and silver assets.[54] The newly formed entity, named South32, was subsequently demerged with listings on the Australian Securities Exchange the JSE and the London Stock Exchange.[54]
BHP Billiton agreed to pay a fine of $25 million to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in 2015 in connection with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act related to its "hospitality program" at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. BHP Billiton invited 176 government and state-owned enterprise officials to attend the Games on an all-expenses-paid package. While BHP Billiton claimed to have compliance processes in place to avoid conflicts of interest, the SEC found that BHP Billiton had invited officials from at least four countries where BHP Billiton had interests in influencing the officials' decisions (Congo, Guinea, Philippines and Burundi).[55]
In 2017, BHP Billiton announced a $2.2billion investment in the new BP platform in the Gulf of Mexico.[56] During the same year, as part of their plan to increase productivity at the Escondida mine in Chile,[57] which is the world's biggest copper mine, BHP Billiton attempted to get workers to accept a 4-year pay freeze, a 66% reduction in the end-of-conflict bonus offering, and increased shift flexibility. This resulted in a major workers' strike and forced the company to declare ‘force majeure’ on two shipments, which drove copper prices up by 4%.[58]
Corporate affairs[edit]
The Australian BHP Billiton Limited and the British BHP Billiton plc are separately listed with separate shareholder bodies, but they operate as one business with identical boards of directors and a single management structure. The global headquarters of the BHP Billiton Group & BHP Billiton Limited (Australia) are located in Melbourne, Australia. BHP Billiton plc is located in London, England.[1] BHP Billiton also has offices in Houston, USA, Santiago, Perth, Brisbane, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Shanghai.

Senior management[edit]
In 1998, with the stock price at less than $7 per share, BHP hired an American, Paul Anderson to reconstruct the company. Anderson was successful in this and completed his four-year stint with a merger between BHP and London-based Billiton. The CEO position was passed to Brian Gilbertson of Billiton but in 2003, after just six months in the CEO role, Gilbertson abruptly stepped down and cited irreconcilable differences with the boards as the reason for his resignation.[60]
Upon Gilbertson's departure, Chip Goodyear, an Anderson protégé, was appointed the new CEO and he continued in that role until his retirement on 30 September 2007, with the stock price over $80 per share. Marius Kloppers was Goodyear's successor.[61] Following the end of Kloppers' tenure in 2013, Andrew Mackenzie, the Chief Executive of Non-Ferrous, assumed the role of CEO. In response to investor demands and a diminishing mining boom, BHP Billiton announced in mid-April 2013 that Mackenzie's remuneration package would be 25 per cent less than that of Kloppers—Barry Fitzgerald, writing for The Australian, stated that the decision represented the introduction of a "new era of austerity" for the corporation.[62]
Operations[edit]
Current[edit]
BHP operates a wide variety of mining, processing and oil and gas production operations in over 25 countries,[63] employing approximately 41,000 people.
The company has four primary operational units, with an optional fifth operational unit, referred to as Businesses:

Coal
Copper
Iron ore
Petroleum
Potash

At the end of fiscal year 2015, BHP Billiton, produced more than 256 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe), 1.7 million tonnes (Mt) of copper, 233 Mt of iron ore, 43 Mt of metallurgical coal and 41 Mt of energy coal.
In addition it has subsidiary logistics companies BHP Transport and Logistics Pty Ltd (incorporating the former BHP Shipping) and BHPB Freight Pty Ltd.

United Kingdom

Liverpool Bay oil and gas field




The United Nations Environment Programme has noted that BHP’s Ok Tedi mine site’s "uncontrolled discharge of 70 million tonnes of waste rock and mine tailings annually has spread more than 10 km (6.2 mi) down the Ok Tedi and Fly rivers, raising river beds and causing flooding, sediment deposition, forest damage, and a serious decline in the area's biodiversity."[66] The resulting devastation caused by the mining of Ok Tedi has included the loss of fish, a vital food source for the local community; loss of forest and crops due to flooding; and the loss of "areas of deep spiritual value for villagers are now submerged in mine tailings."[67]

Social and environmental responsibility[edit]




A village flooded in the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster (2015). The dam was a property of Samarco, a joint venture between Vale and BHP Billiton.


BHP Billiton is listed as one of the 90 companies extracting and marketing fossil fuels that are responsible for two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of the industrial age.[68] Its cumulative emissions until 2010 have been estimated at 7,606 MtCO2e, representing 0.52% of global industrial emissions between 1751-2010, and ranking it the 19th largest corporate polluter.[69] According to BHP Billiton management 10% of these emissions are from direct operations, while 90% are from products sold by the company.[70] BHP Billiton has been voluntarily reporting its direct GHG emissions since 1996. In 2013 it was criticised in 2013 for lobbying against carbon pricing in Australia.[71]
BHP Billiton voluntarily donates one per cent of pre-tax profit, calculated on the average of the previous three years’ pre-tax profit, in community programs[72] and made US$241.7 million of community donations including a US$100 million contribution to BHP Billiton corporate charitable entities.[73] BHP Billiton is a founding partner and co-funder (with the Australian Government) of Bush Blitz, operated by Australian Biological Resources Study with Earthwatch Australia.[74]
Significant accidents[edit]
Inclement weather caused a BHP Billiton helicopter to crash in Angola on 16 November 2007, killing the helicopter's five passengers. The dead were: BHP Billiton Angola Chief Operating Officer David Hopgood, Australian; Angola Technical Services Operations Manager Kevin Ayre, British; Wild Dog Helicopters pilot Kottie Breedt, South African; Guy Sommerfield of MMC, British; and Louwrens Prinsloo of Prinsloo Drilling, Namibian. The helicopter went down approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) from Alto Cuilo exploration facility in north eastern Angola. BHP Billiton responded by suspending operations in the country.[75]
On 5 November 2015 a dam holding back waste water from an iron ore mine in Mariana, south-eastern Brazil, owned by BHP Billiton and Vale collapsed, devastating a nearby town with mudslides, killing at least 17 people, injuring more than 50 and causing enormous ecological damage,[76] and threatening life along the river Rio Doce and the Atlantic sea near the mouth of the Rio Doce.[77] The accident was the biggest environmental disaster in Brazil's history.[78]

         BHP Billiton to step up U.S. shale production

MELBOURNE, Australia--BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP.AU) said Wednesday it plans to step up activity in the U.S. oil-and-gas shale fields that activist shareholders are agitating for the resources company to offload. The move is expected to revive flagging onshore production volumes even as BHP continues to invest in conventional energy operations and exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and other basins while seeking to sell some unwanted U.S. shale acreage. BHP has been forced to defend its strategy after New York hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. led a series of attacks in recent months, calling for a sweeping overhaul of the world's largest-listed mining company and criticizing the billions of dollars spent on acquisitions and mistimed share buybacks. The push by Elliott and other shareholders has drawn BHP's petroleum division into the spotlight and revived questions about the billions of dollars spent picking on onshore U.S. assets at the height of the natural-gas boom. BHP on Wednesday forecast a rise in overall production across its operations over the 2018 financial year, as steady growth in iron-ore output and a rebound in commodities including copper offset a further drop in petroleum volumes in the 12 months through June. The company expects to have up 10 rigs operating in its U.S. shale fields in the coming year, double the number currently drilling for oil and gas after it added two more in the recent quarter, Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said. That will see it spending about US$1.2 billion onshore U.S., the bulk of its US$2 billion petroleum expenditure budget for fiscal 2018, which is expected to deliver a 35% increase in shale production the following year after an expected decline in the current period, the company said. After months of discussions with BHP and its directors, Elliott in April went public with its calls for the company to spin off its U.S. petroleum business and to rid itself of its dual-listed structure in favor of a main listing in London. In May, it refined its attack, urging BHP to launch an independent review of all its oil-and-gas assets globally and to collapse its listed structure around the Australian shares to unlock shareholder value and halt an underperformance in the shares. A spokesman for Elliott declined to comment Wednesday on BHP's quarterly production update or plans. Other investors have entered the fray, including Australian fund manager Tribeca Investment Partners, which has called for BHP to divest its U.S. onshore oil-and-gas assets. AMP Capital, one of BHP's largest shareholders, has said BHP now needs to prove the worth of its U.S. onshore business and why it is compatible with the broader portfolio. BHP has rejected the criticism, arguing that ending its U.K.-Australia structure would be too costly and that there was a beneficial fit between its mining and petroleum operations, although Mr. Mackenzie earlier this year conceded BHP had mistimed the shale acquisitions and had more recently pivoted its focus toward conventional assets. In the production report, Mr. Mackenzie said the company was pushing ahead with an exit from noncore U.S. acreage, and a sale of the southern Hawkville assets in Texas was expected by September. It also doesn't plan further development of its operations in the gas-rich Fayetteville in Arkansas and is considering sale of these assets. Elsewhere in the portfolio, Mr. Mackenzie said drilling of the Wildling-2 appraisal well in the Gulf of Mexico will continue and results were expected this quarter, while the recently approved second phase of the Mad Dog project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico would expand oil volumes as supply tightens. In the last financial year, BHP's petroleum production fell 13% to 208 million barrels of oil equivalent due to the deferral of activity onshore U.S. and natural field decline in the conventional assets. It forecast output would fall 9%-13% in the year ahead. Production of iron ore, the biggest driver of BHP's earnings in the previous fiscal year rose 4% to 231 million metric tons in the just-ended fiscal year as prices rebounded, with record volumes at BHP's mines in Western Australia. BHP said it expected output to grow by between 3% and 5% this year. Production of coking coal, used alongside iron ore to producer steel, fell 6% to 40 million tons in fiscal 2017, in line with a target that was cut in April due to damage to the rail network caused by a cyclone in Australia's east coast. BHP said production was expected to climb 10%-15% this year. Thermal coal, which is used by power stations, was 7% higher at 29 million tons and is forecast to be steady to 3% higher this year. And copper production is expected to jump by 25%-35% this year after falling 16% in fiscal 2017 to 1.33 million tons--the lower end of revised guidance after output was held back by a 44-day strike at the Escondida mine in Chile as well as disruptions at its Olympic Dam mine in South Australia due to maintenance and after a state-wide power outage.

AT&T shares gain 3% in premarket after company surprises analyst with Q2 wireless results
              
              Shares of AT&T Inc.  were up more than 3% in premarket trade on Wednesday after the company reported second-quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday that beat Wall Street expectations. The internet, phone and TV provider also reported wireless phone results that surprised analysts. AT&T added 127,000 new wireless postpaid subscribers, far above FactSet's consensus for 20,500 adds, and the company reported record low churn, thanks in part to DirecTV. "Despite the competitive environment, and solid volumes from T-Mobile, bundling with [DirecTV] drove strong wireless results," wrote Jefferies analyst Mike McCormack. The company lost 351,000 traditional TV subscribers in the quarter, though that was offset thanks to its internet live TV offering DirecTV Now, which the company said has half a million subscribers. But management admitted that cord-cutting in the TV landscape is still having an impact and in fact has increased. "Comments around cord-cutting and OTT adoption bear monitoring as inflection in trends could indicate accelerating linear subscriber declines," McCormack wrote. AT&T shares have declined nearly 15% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 index  has gained close to 11%.

AMD's stock soars toward 5-month high as analysts boost price targets after upbeat results
              
              Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  soared 9% in premarket trade Wednesday, putting them on track to open at a 5-month high, after the chip maker reported a surprise second-quarter profit and revenue that rose above forecasts. That prompted no less than 10 of the 31 analysts surveyed by FactSet to raise their price targets. The average target price has increased 11% to $13.78, which is 10% below where the stock is currently trading ahead of the open. The average rating remains hold. Analyst Kevin Cassidy at Stifel Nicolaus raised his target to $13 from $11, saying he was "impressed" with new product revenue upside, but said he was keeping the rating at hold until gross margin expansion is more evident. Susquehanna Financial's Christopher Rolland raised his target to $15 from $12, but stayed at a neutral rating. "While we are incrementally more constructive on the new products' prospects, we question the shorter-term benefit received from the initial Ryzen channel build with PC OEMs and cryptocurrency-driven GPU demand," Rolland wrote in a note to clients. The stock had run up 24.4% year to date through Tuesday, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index  had rallied 21.6% and the S&P 500  had gained 10.6%.

The stock, which wasn't active in premarket trade, has rallied 12.2% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

Biogen shares surge 2% after upgrade to buy at Goldman Sachs
              
              Biogen Inc.  shares surged as much as 2% in premarket trade Wednesday after the company was upgraded to buy at Goldman Sachs and its price target was raised by nearly 20% to $338. Biogen shares closed at $282.96 on Tuesday. Goldman Sachs analyst Terence Flynn said that Biogen's Alzheimer's drug aducanumab "could now be one of the first disease-modifying drugs to reach the market," selling as much as $12 billion at peak. Late-stage clinical trial results for Biogen's aducanumab are expected in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020, but results for partner Eisai's Alzeimer's drug BAN2401 -- expected by the end of this year -- should reflect on Biogen's drug, Flynn said. The field for an Alzheimer's disease drug opened up more after a late-stage trial for Eli Lilly & Co.'s  Alzheimer's drug solanezumab failed to meet its primary endpoint last fall. Though investors have worried about competitive and pricing threats to Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise, Flynn said those were "overblown." Flynn also expressed high hopes for the company's "under-leveraged" balance sheet, and recommended more aggressive share buybacks. Biogen shares have lifted 1.1% over the last three months, compared with a 3.8% rise in the S&P 500 .

U.S. Steel names new CFO

					U.S. Steel Corp.  named Wednesday Kevin Bradley as its chief financial officer, taking the place of interim CFO Pipasu Soni. Bradley were previously the CFO of Terex Corp. . Soni was appointed interim CFO in June after David Burritt took over the role of chief executive officer. "Kevin possesses the vast financial knowledge and strong leadership skills necessary to strengthen our balance sheet, help improve our operations and realize improvements in safety, quality, delivery and cost," said CEO Burritt. The stock soared 7.4% in premarket trade toward a 3-month high, after the steel maker beat second-quarter profit expectations and provided upbeat guidance. The stock has tumbled 26% year to date through Tuesday, while the S&P 500  has gained 11%.

US Steel shares jump 7% premarket after earnings beat; J.P. Morgan rates stock overweight

					Shares of U.S. Steel Corp.  rocketed 7% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the company reported stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter and offered upbeat guidance for the year. US Steel said it had per-share earnings of $1.48 a share on revenue of $3.14 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated earnings of 36 cents a share on revenue of $2.98 billion. U.S. Steel expects full-year earnings of $1.70 a share, while analysts estimate earnings of 84 cents a share. J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Gambardella said the beat was driven by flat rolled realized prices and costs. "Costs were lower due
to the benefits from the restart of the Keetac facility and typical seasonal improvements in the mining operations," he wrote in a note ahead of the company's earnings call. "Tubular posted a smaller than
expected loss with higher shipments and average selling prices as well as
lower costs."  J.P. Morgan is expecting the call to hear questions on guidance, the company's asset revitalization program and management's view on Section 232. President Trump has asked the Department of Commerce to conduct a seldom-used Section 232 investigation to determine whether steel imports are harming U.S. national security. Secretary Wilbur Ross has said he intends to complete the report by the end of June. J.P. Morgan rates the stock as overweight. US Steel shares are down 26% in 2017 through Tuesday, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.6%.

Freeport-McMoRan shares gain 2% after company swings to a profit in Q2
              
              Shares of Freeport-McMoRan Inc.  rose more than 2% premarket on Tuesday after the metals and mining company swung to a profit in the second quarter after a loss the year earlier. Net income for the second quarter came in at $268 million, or 18 cents per share, after a loss of $479 million, or 38 cents per share, during the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings for the quarter was 17 cents, below FactSet's consensus of 20 cents. Revenue for the quarter hit $3.71 billion, up from $3.33 billion during the same quarter a year ago and above FactSet's consensus for $3.67 billion. "We are encouraged  by recent progress in our active negotiations with the Indonesian government to resolve issues involving  our contractual rights," said Freeport-McMoRan Chief Executive Richard Adkerson in a statement. Shares of Freeport-McMoRan have fallen nearly 2% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 index  is up more than 10%.

CFRA sticks with hold rating on Arconic, citing uncertainty about CEO search, Grenfell Tower liability
              
              CFRA said Monday it is sticking with a hold recommendation on shares of Arconic Inc. , after the spinoff from Alcoa Inc. reported second-quarter earnings. Analyst Matthew Miller said his 12-month price target of $27 implies an EV/EBITDA multiple of 9.0 times his 2017 EBITDA view, a discount to peers that trade at an average forward EV/EBITDA of 9.3 times. The target "is justified by uncertainty regarding the ongoing CEO search and the potential liability from the cladding used on the Grenfell Tower," Miller wrote in a note. Arconic said earlier it had no control over the aluminum panels used in the exterior of the London tower, that are believed to have ignited during a fire in June that killed at least 80 people. The company had already said it will stop selling the panels for use in high-rise buildings. Miller said he is trimming his 2017 EPS estimate by 3 cents and his 2018 EPS estimate by 5 cents. Shares were down 0.7% in late trade, while the S&P 500  was down 0.1%.

Gold settles with a slight loss, ending its streak of gains
              
              Gold prices saw a small loss Monday--enough to put an end to their six-session streak of gains. Prices turned lower as U.S. dollar added to earlier strength, with the ICE U.S. Dollar Index  up 0.2% at 94.03, near the session's high of 94.12, as gold prices settled. A stronger dollar often pressures prices for gold that's traded in the greenback. August gold  fell 60 cents, or less than 0.1%, at $1,254.30 an ounce.

U.K. Serious Fraud Office investigating suspected corruption by Rio Tinto in Guinea
              
              The U.K. Serious Fraud Office said Monday it has opened an investigation into "suspected corruption" by mining giant Rio Tinto Plc  in the Republic of Guinea. The SFO, which is responsible for dealing with fraud, bribery and corruption, said the investigation is looking into the company, its employees and others associated with it. Rio Tinto's American Depositary Receipts were down about 1% in New York, but are up about 13% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained about 10%.

Caterpillar's stock surges after BMO Capital says business has 'passed the lows'
              
              Shares of Caterpillar Inc.  climbed 1.2% in premarket trade Monday, after the agriculture and farming equipment maker was upgraded at BMO Capital, citing an improving profit outlook as the cyclical recovery for industrial companies continues. Analyst Joel Tiss raised his rating to outperform after being at market perform for at least the last three years. Tiss said there were three primary reasons for finally turning bullish on Caterpillar: "the unfolding cyclical recovery" and its potential benefits for the company; "the significant cost-cutting program underway" and the "new management team that is expected to concentrate on expanding profitability." He raised his stock price target to $125, which was 17% above Friday's closing price of $106.59, from $110. Tiss said he still believes the mining and energy markets still have a difficult road ahead, which suggests it may be unlikely to see a robust demand surge in the near term, "but there are signs we have passed the lows in many areas." The stock has rallied 14.9% year to date through Friday, while both the SPDR Industrial Select Sector ETF  and S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

Arconic shares surge 6% premarket after company beats on profit, raises outlook
              
              Shares of Arconic Inc. , the former aluminum operations of Alcoa before that company split in two, jumped 6% in premarket trade Monday, after the company beat second-quarter profit and sales estimates and raised its guidance. Arconic said it had net income of $212 million, or 43 cents a share, in the second quarter, up from $135 million, or 27 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, EPS came to 32 cents, ahead of the FactSet consensus of 26 cents a share. Revenue rose 1% to $3.3 billion, also ahead of the FactSet consensus of $3.2 billion. The company said it is raising its full-year guidance after a "solid" first half, and now expects revenue of $12.3 billion to $12.7 billion, up from prior guidance of $11.8 billion to $12.4 billion. Adjusted EPS is expected to range from $1.15 to $1.20, up from a prior $1.10 to $1.20. The FactSet consensus is for full-year EPS of $1.16 and revenue of $12.5 billion.

Gold marks highest settlement in a month, up over 2% for the week
              
              Gold prices settled Friday at their highest level in four weeks, with investment demand for the precious metal getting a boost from turmoil in the White House and weakness in the U.S. dollar. August gold  added $9.40, or 0.8%, to settle at $1,254.90 an ounce. Prices stretched their streak of gains to a sixth-straight session, tallying a climb of about 2.2% for the week.

Oil prices drop toward session lows, but gold trades near the day's highs
              
              Oil prices dropped to fresh session lows Friday, pressured as tanker-tracker Petro-Logistics said OPEC oil output is poised to climb by 145,000 barrels a day this month, according to a report from Reuters. The news came ahead of a weekly update on the number of active U.S. oil rigs from Baker Hughes. Gold prices, meanwhile, touched new session highs, finding some support as a haven investment following reports that White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has resigned. September West Texas Intermediate crude fell $1.09, or 2.3%, to $45.83 a barrel, after a low at $45.71. August gold  traded at $1,252.70 an ounce, up $7.20, or 0.6%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

BHP, the trading entity of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton plc and formerly known as BHP Billiton, is an Anglo-Australian multinational mining, metals and petroleum dual-listed public company headquartered in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Founded in 1885 in the isolated mining town of Broken Hill, it was the world's largest mining company measured by 2015 market values and Australia's fourth largest company (by revenue), formerly the largest.
BHP Billiton was formed in 2001 through the merger of the Australian Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) and the Anglo–Dutch Billiton plc.[4] The result is a dual-listed company. The Australia-registered BHP Billiton Limited, which has equal financial share in the company, has a primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange and is one of the largest companies in Australia measured by market capitalisation. The English-registered BHP Billiton plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
In April 2017 activist hedge fund manager Elliott Advisors proposed a plan for BHP to spin off its American petroleum assets and significantly restructure the business, including the scrapping of its dual Sydney-London listing, suggesting shares be offered only in the United Kingdom., while leaving its headquarters and tax residences in Australia where shares would trade as depositary instruments. At the time of the correspondence Elliott held about 4.1 percent of the issued shares in London-listed BHP Billiton PLC, worth $3.81 billion. Australia's government warned it would block moves to shift BHP's stock listing from Australia to the United Kingdom. Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison said the move would be contrary to the country's national interest and would breach government orders mandating a listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. BHP dismissed the plan saying the costs and risks of Elliott's proposal outweighed any potential benefits.[5]
In May 2017 with much of the former Billiton assets having been disposed of, BHP Billiton began to rebrand itself as BHP, at first in Australia and then globally. It replaced the slogan "The Big Australian" with "Think Big", with an advertising campaign rolling out in mid May 2017.[6] Work on the change began in 2015 according to BHP's chief external affairs officer.[7]
BHP's global headquarters and Australian registered (corporate) office is located at 171 Collins Street, Melbourne Australia.

History[edit]
Billiton[edit]




The former Billiton logo


Billiton was a mining company whose origins stretch back to 29 September 1860, when the articles of association were approved by a meeting of shareholders in the Groot Keizerhof hotel in The Hague, the Netherlands.[8]
Two months later, the company acquired the mineral rights to the tin-rich Billiton (Belitung) and Bangka Islands in the Netherlands Indies archipelago, off the eastern coast of Sumatra.[8]
Billiton's initial business forays included tin and lead smelting in the Netherlands, followed in the 1940s by bauxite mining in Indonesia and Suriname. In 1970, Shell acquired Billiton accelerated this growth.[8] The tin and lead smelter in Arnhem, the Netherlands, was shut down in the 1990s. Billiton owned a tin smelting and refining plant in Phuket, Thailand called Thaisarco (short for Thailand Smelting And Refining Company, Limited), which still exists today.[9]
In 1994, South Africa's Gencor Ltd. acquired the mining division of Billiton excluding the downstream metal division.[10] Billiton was divested from Gencor in 1997.[11]
In 1997, Billiton plc became a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[8] Throughout the 1990s and beyond, Billiton plc experienced considerable growth. Its portfolio included aluminium smelters in South Africa and Mozambique, nickel operations in Australia and Colombia, base metals mines in South America, Canada and South Africa, coal mines in Australia, Colombia and South Africa, as well as interests in operations in Brazil, Suriname, Australia (aluminium) and South Africa (titanium minerals and steel and ferroalloys).
In 2001 Billiton plc merged with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) to form BHP Billiton.[4]
In 2015, BHP Billiton spun off a number of its subsidiaries[12] in South Africa and Southern Africa to form a new company known as South32.[13][14] South32 is invested in manganese production[15] and coal mining activities in South Africa, Brazil, Australia and the Far East.
In August 2016, the company recorded its worst annual loss in history, $6.4 billion.[16]
Towards the end of 2016 BHP indicated it would be expanding its petroleum business with new investments in the sector.[17]
Broken Hill Proprietary Company[edit]




The former Broken Hill Proprietary Company logo


The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) also known by the nickname "the Big Australian",[18] was incorporated in 1885, operating the silver and lead mine at Broken Hill in western New South Wales, Australia.[19][20] The Broken Hill group floated on 10 August 1885.[21] The first consignment of Broken Hill ore (48 tons, 5 cwt, 3grs) was smelted at the Intercolonial Smelting and Refining Company's works at Spotswood, Melbourne.[21]

The resulting 35,605 ounces of silver raised a lot of interest when exhibited at the City of Melbourne Bank in Collins St. Some sceptics asserted the promoters were merely using silver from somewhere else, to ramp up the shares...Another shareholder, the dominating W.R. Wilson had had to lend [William Jamieson, General Manager] a new suit so he could take the first prospectus, printed at Silverton near Broken Hill on 20 June 1885, to Adelaide to start the float process.[21]

The geographic Broken Hill, for which the town was named, was discovered and named by Charles Sturt, and created much interest among prospectors, but nothing of note was discovered until Charles Rasp, boundary rider for the encompassing Mount Gipps Station, pegged out a 40-acre claim with contractors David James and James Poole, then with half-a-dozen backers (the Syndicate of Seven) including station manager George McCulloch (a young cousin of Victorian Premier Sir James McCulloch[22]) formed the Broken Hill Company to stake out the whole Hill. In the ensuing months of fruitless search and with costs mounting, several of the original seven parted with their shares, and at the eve of the Company's great success there were nine shareholders, including Rasp, McCulloch, William Jamieson (who bought up shares from several of the founders), Philip Charley, David James, James Poole, Bowes Kelly and W. R. Wilson.[23]
John Darling, Jr. became a director of the company in 1892 and was chairman of directors from 1907 to 1914.[24]
In 1915, the company ventured into steel manufacturing, with its operations based primarily in Newcastle, New South Wales. The decision to move from mining ore at Broken Hill to open a steelworks at Newcastle was due to the technical limitations in recovering value from mining the 'lower-lying sulphide ores'.[25] The discovery of Iron Knob and Iron Monarch near the western shore of the Spencer Gulf in South Australia combined with the development by the BHP metallurgist A. D. Carmichael of a technique for 'separating zinc sulphides from the accompanying earth and rock' led BHP 'to implement the startlingly simple and cheap process for liberating vast amounts of valuable metals out of sulphide ores, including huge heaps of tailings and slimes up to' 40 ft (12 m) high.[26]
The company began petroleum exploration in the 1960s with discoveries in Bass Strait, an activity which became an increasing focus.[27]
BHP began to diversify offshore in a variety of projects. One project was the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea, where the company was successfully sued by the indigenous inhabitants because of the environmental degradation caused by the mine operations.[28] BHP had better success with the giant Escondida copper mine in Chile (57.5 percent owned) and the EKATI Diamond Mine in northern Canada.[29] which it divested in 2013 to Dominion Diamond Corporation (formerly Harry Winston Diamond Corporation).[30]
The inefficiencies of what was, by global standards, a small steel operation in Newcastle finally caught up with the company and the Newcastle operations were closed in 1999.[31] The 'long products' side of the steel business was spun off to form OneSteel in 2000.[32]
BHP Billiton[edit]

In 2001, BHP merged with the Billiton mining company to form BHP Billiton. In 2002, the 'flat products' steel business was spun off to form BHP Steel. In 2003, BHP Steel changed its name to BlueScope Steel.[33]
In March 2005, BHP Billiton announced a US$7.3 billion agreed bid for another mining company, WMC Resources, owners of the Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium mine in South Australia, nickel operations in Western Australia and Queensland, and a fertiliser plant also in Queensland. The takeover achieved 90 percent acceptance on 17 June 2005, and 100 percent ownership was announced on 2 August 2005, achieved through compulsory acquisition of the last 10 percent of the shares.[34]
On 8 November 2007, BHP Billiton announced it was seeking to purchase rival mining group Rio Tinto Group in an all-share deal. The initial offer of 3.4 shares of BHP Billiton stock for each share of Rio Tinto was rejected by the board of Rio Tinto for "significantly undervaluing" the company. It was unknown at the time whether BHP Billiton would attempt to purchase Rio Tinto through some form of hostile takeover;[35] however, CEO Marius Kloppers met with many of Rio's shareholders following the announcement and reiterated that the offer for Rio was "compelling" and that BHP Billiton is very "patient".[36] A formal hostile bid of 3.4 BHP Billiton shares for each Rio Tinto share was announced on 6 February 2008.[37] The bid was withdrawn on 25 November 2008 due to a global recession.[38]
On 14 May 2008, BHP Billiton shares rose to a record high of A$48.90 after speculation that Chinese mining firm Chinalco was considering purchasing a large stake. BHP Billiton representatives had no comment.[39]
On 25 November 2008, Billiton announced that it would drop its A$66 billion takeover of rival Rio Tinto Group saying that the "risks to shareholder value" would "increase" to "an unacceptable level" due to the global financial crisis.[40]
On 21 January 2009, the company announced that in response to the global financial crisis the BHP Billiton Ravensthorpe Nickel Project in Western Australia would cease operations, with a resultant discontinuation of shipments of ore from Ravensthorpe to the Yabulu nickel plant in Queensland Australia.[41] Subsequently, the Yabulu refinery was sold to Queensland billionaire Mr Clive Palmer. Additionally, the Pinto Valley mine in the United States was closed. In total, 6,000 employees were laid off, including those laid off with the scaling back at some other projects.[42]
On 9 December 2009, BHP Billiton sold its Ravensthorpe Nickel Mine, which cost A$2.4 billion to build, to Vancouver-based First Quantum Minerals for US$340 million. First Quantum was one of three bidders for the mine and actually produced the lowest offer. The Canadian company plans to have the mine back in production in mid-2011. Ravensthorpe cost BHP US$3.6 billion in writedowns when it was shut in January 2009 after less than a year of production.[43]
In January 2010, after BHP Billiton bought Athabasca Potash for US$320m, The Economist reported that by 2020, BHP Billiton could produce approximately 15 percent of the world demand for potash.[44]
In August 2010, BHP Billiton made a hostile takeover bid worth US$40 billion for the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The bid came after BHP's first bid, made on 17 August, was rejected as being undervalued.[45] This acquisition marked a major strategic move by BHP outside hard commodities and commenced the diversification of its business away from resources with high exposure to carbon price risk (coal, petroleum, iron ore). The takeover bid was opposed by the Government of Saskatchewan under Premier Brad Wall. On 3 November, Canadian Industry Minister Tony Clement announced the preliminary rejection of the deal under the Investment Canada Act, giving BHP Billiton 30 days to refine their deal before a final decision was made.[46]
On 14 November 2010, the company announced that it was dropping its offer for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan.[47]
On 22 February 2011 BHP announced that it paid $4.75 billion in cash to Chesapeake Energy Corp for all of the company's Fayetteville shale assets which include 487,000 acres (1,970 km2) of mineral rights leases and 420 miles (680 km) of pipeline located in north central Arkansas in the United States. The wells on the mineral leases are currently producing about 415 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. BHP plans to spend $800 million to $1 billion a year over 10 years to develop the field and triple production.[48]
On 14 July 2011, BHP Billiton announced that it would acquire Petrohawk Energy of the United States for approximately $12.1 billion in cash, considerably expanding its shale natural gas resources[49] in an offer of $US38.75 per share.[50]
In August 2012, BHP Billiton announced that it was shelving its US$20 billion (£12 billion) Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine expansion project in South Australia, as a result of falling commodity prices and slowing global economic growth.[51][52] The company simultaneously announced a freeze on approving any major new expansion projects.[51][52]
Days after announcing the Olympic Dam pull-out, BHP announced that it was selling its Yeelirrie Uranium Project to Canadian Cameco for a fee of around $430 million. The sale was part of a broader move to step away from resource expansion in Australia.[53]
On 19 August 2014, BHP Billiton announced it would create an independent global metals and mining company based on a selection of its aluminium, coal, manganese, nickel and silver assets.[54] The newly formed entity, named South32, was subsequently demerged with listings on the Australian Securities Exchange the JSE and the London Stock Exchange.[54]
BHP Billiton agreed to pay a fine of $25 million to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in 2015 in connection with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act related to its "hospitality program" at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. BHP Billiton invited 176 government and state-owned enterprise officials to attend the Games on an all-expenses-paid package. While BHP Billiton claimed to have compliance processes in place to avoid conflicts of interest, the SEC found that BHP Billiton had invited officials from at least four countries where BHP Billiton had interests in influencing the officials' decisions (Congo, Guinea, Philippines and Burundi).[55]
In 2017, BHP Billiton announced a $2.2billion investment in the new BP platform in the Gulf of Mexico.[56] During the same year, as part of their plan to increase productivity at the Escondida mine in Chile,[57] which is the world's biggest copper mine, BHP Billiton attempted to get workers to accept a 4-year pay freeze, a 66% reduction in the end-of-conflict bonus offering, and increased shift flexibility. This resulted in a major workers' strike and forced the company to declare ‘force majeure’ on two shipments, which drove copper prices up by 4%.[58]

Senior management[edit]
In 1998, with the stock price at less than $7 per share, BHP hired an American, Paul Anderson to reconstruct the company. Anderson was successful in this and completed his four-year stint with a merger between BHP and London-based Billiton. The CEO position was passed to Brian Gilbertson of Billiton but in 2003, after just six months in the CEO role, Gilbertson abruptly stepped down and cited irreconcilable differences with the boards as the reason for his resignation.[60]
Upon Gilbertson's departure, Chip Goodyear, an Anderson protégé, was appointed the new CEO and he continued in that role until his retirement on 30 September 2007, with the stock price over $80 per share. Marius Kloppers was Goodyear's successor.[61] Following the end of Kloppers' tenure in 2013, Andrew Mackenzie, the Chief Executive of Non-Ferrous, assumed the role of CEO. In response to investor demands and a diminishing mining boom, BHP Billiton announced in mid-April 2013 that Mackenzie's remuneration package would be 25 per cent less than that of Kloppers—Barry Fitzgerald, writing for The Australian, stated that the decision represented the introduction of a "new era of austerity" for the corporation.[62]
Operations[edit]
Current[edit]
BHP operates a wide variety of mining, processing and oil and gas production operations in over 25 countries,[63] employing approximately 41,000 people.
The company has four primary operational units, with an optional fifth operational unit, referred to as Businesses:

Coal
Copper
Iron ore
Petroleum
Potash

At the end of fiscal year 2015, BHP Billiton, produced more than 256 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe), 1.7 million tonnes (Mt) of copper, 233 Mt of iron ore, 43 Mt of metallurgical coal and 41 Mt of energy coal.
In addition it has subsidiary logistics companies BHP Transport and Logistics Pty Ltd (incorporating the former BHP Shipping) and BHPB Freight Pty Ltd.

United Kingdom

Liverpool Bay oil and gas field




The United Nations Environment Programme has noted that BHP’s Ok Tedi mine site’s "uncontrolled discharge of 70 million tonnes of waste rock and mine tailings annually has spread more than 10 km (6.2 mi) down the Ok Tedi and Fly rivers, raising river beds and causing flooding, sediment deposition, forest damage, and a serious decline in the area's biodiversity."[66] The resulting devastation caused by the mining of Ok Tedi has included the loss of fish, a vital food source for the local community; loss of forest and crops due to flooding; and the loss of "areas of deep spiritual value for villagers are now submerged in mine tailings."[67]

Social and environmental responsibility[edit]




A village flooded in the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster (2015). The dam was a property of Samarco, a joint venture between Vale and BHP Billiton.


BHP Billiton is listed as one of the 90 companies extracting and marketing fossil fuels that are responsible for two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of the industrial age.[68] Its cumulative emissions until 2010 have been estimated at 7,606 MtCO2e, representing 0.52% of global industrial emissions between 1751-2010, and ranking it the 19th largest corporate polluter.[69] According to BHP Billiton management 10% of these emissions are from direct operations, while 90% are from products sold by the company.[70] BHP Billiton has been voluntarily reporting its direct GHG emissions since 1996. In 2013 it was criticised in 2013 for lobbying against carbon pricing in Australia.[71]
BHP Billiton voluntarily donates one per cent of pre-tax profit, calculated on the average of the previous three years’ pre-tax profit, in community programs[72] and made US$241.7 million of community donations including a US$100 million contribution to BHP Billiton corporate charitable entities.[73] BHP Billiton is a founding partner and co-funder (with the Australian Government) of Bush Blitz, operated by Australian Biological Resources Study with Earthwatch Australia.[74]
Significant accidents[edit]
Inclement weather caused a BHP Billiton helicopter to crash in Angola on 16 November 2007, killing the helicopter's five passengers. The dead were: BHP Billiton Angola Chief Operating Officer David Hopgood, Australian; Angola Technical Services Operations Manager Kevin Ayre, British; Wild Dog Helicopters pilot Kottie Breedt, South African; Guy Sommerfield of MMC, British; and Louwrens Prinsloo of Prinsloo Drilling, Namibian. The helicopter went down approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) from Alto Cuilo exploration facility in north eastern Angola. BHP Billiton responded by suspending operations in the country.[75]
On 5 November 2015 a dam holding back waste water from an iron ore mine in Mariana, south-eastern Brazil, owned by BHP Billiton and Vale collapsed, devastating a nearby town with mudslides, killing at least 17 people, injuring more than 50 and causing enormous ecological damage,[76] and threatening life along the river Rio Doce and the Atlantic sea near the mouth of the Rio Doce.[77] The accident was the biggest environmental disaster in Brazil's history.[78]

The former BHP Billiton logo


BHP, the trading entity of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton plc and formerly known as BHP Billiton, is an Anglo-Australian multinational mining, metals and petroleum dual-listed public company headquartered in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Founded in 1885 in the isolated mining town of Broken Hill, it was the world's largest mining company measured by 2015 market values and Australia's fourth largest company (by revenue), formerly the largest.
BHP Billiton was formed in 2001 through the merger of the Australian Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) and the Anglo–Dutch Billiton plc.[4] The result is a dual-listed company. The Australia-registered BHP Billiton Limited, which has equal financial share in the company, has a primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange and is one of the largest companies in Australia measured by market capitalisation. The English-registered BHP Billiton plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
In April 2017 activist hedge fund manager Elliott Advisors proposed a plan for BHP to spin off its American petroleum assets and significantly restructure the business, including the scrapping of its dual Sydney-London listing, suggesting shares be offered only in the United Kingdom., while leaving its headquarters and tax residences in Australia where shares would trade as depositary instruments. At the time of the correspondence Elliott held about 4.1 percent of the issued shares in London-listed BHP Billiton PLC, worth $3.81 billion. Australia's government warned it would block moves to shift BHP's stock listing from Australia to the United Kingdom. Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison said the move would be contrary to the country's national interest and would breach government orders mandating a listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. BHP dismissed the plan saying the costs and risks of Elliott's proposal outweighed any potential benefits.[5]
In May 2017 with much of the former Billiton assets having been disposed of, BHP Billiton began to rebrand itself as BHP, at first in Australia and then globally. It replaced the slogan "The Big Australian" with "Think Big", with an advertising campaign rolling out in mid May 2017.[6] Work on the change began in 2015 according to BHP's chief external affairs officer.[7]
BHP's global headquarters and Australian registered (corporate) office is located at 171 Collins Street, Melbourne Australia.

History[edit]
Billiton[edit]




The former Billiton logo


Billiton was a mining company whose origins stretch back to 29 September 1860, when the articles of association were approved by a meeting of shareholders in the Groot Keizerhof hotel in The Hague, the Netherlands.[8]
Two months later, the company acquired the mineral rights to the tin-rich Billiton (Belitung) and Bangka Islands in the Netherlands Indies archipelago, off the eastern coast of Sumatra.[8]
Billiton's initial business forays included tin and lead smelting in the Netherlands, followed in the 1940s by bauxite mining in Indonesia and Suriname. In 1970, Shell acquired Billiton accelerated this growth.[8] The tin and lead smelter in Arnhem, the Netherlands, was shut down in the 1990s. Billiton owned a tin smelting and refining plant in Phuket, Thailand called Thaisarco (short for Thailand Smelting And Refining Company, Limited), which still exists today.[9]
In 1994, South Africa's Gencor Ltd. acquired the mining division of Billiton excluding the downstream metal division.[10] Billiton was divested from Gencor in 1997.[11]
In 1997, Billiton plc became a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[8] Throughout the 1990s and beyond, Billiton plc experienced considerable growth. Its portfolio included aluminium smelters in South Africa and Mozambique, nickel operations in Australia and Colombia, base metals mines in South America, Canada and South Africa, coal mines in Australia, Colombia and South Africa, as well as interests in operations in Brazil, Suriname, Australia (aluminium) and South Africa (titanium minerals and steel and ferroalloys).
In 2001 Billiton plc merged with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) to form BHP Billiton.[4]
In 2015, BHP Billiton spun off a number of its subsidiaries[12] in South Africa and Southern Africa to form a new company known as South32.[13][14] South32 is invested in manganese production[15] and coal mining activities in South Africa, Brazil, Australia and the Far East.
In August 2016, the company recorded its worst annual loss in history, $6.4 billion.[16]
Towards the end of 2016 BHP indicated it would be expanding its petroleum business with new investments in the sector.[17]
Broken Hill Proprietary Company[edit]




The former Broken Hill Proprietary Company logo


The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) also known by the nickname "the Big Australian",[18] was incorporated in 1885, operating the silver and lead mine at Broken Hill in western New South Wales, Australia.[19][20] The Broken Hill group floated on 10 August 1885.[21] The first consignment of Broken Hill ore (48 tons, 5 cwt, 3grs) was smelted at the Intercolonial Smelting and Refining Company's works at Spotswood, Melbourne.[21]

The resulting 35,605 ounces of silver raised a lot of interest when exhibited at the City of Melbourne Bank in Collins St. Some sceptics asserted the promoters were merely using silver from somewhere else, to ramp up the shares...Another shareholder, the dominating W.R. Wilson had had to lend [William Jamieson, General Manager] a new suit so he could take the first prospectus, printed at Silverton near Broken Hill on 20 June 1885, to Adelaide to start the float process.[21]

The geographic Broken Hill, for which the town was named, was discovered and named by Charles Sturt, and created much interest among prospectors, but nothing of note was discovered until Charles Rasp, boundary rider for the encompassing Mount Gipps Station, pegged out a 40-acre claim with contractors David James and James Poole, then with half-a-dozen backers (the Syndicate of Seven) including station manager George McCulloch (a young cousin of Victorian Premier Sir James McCulloch[22]) formed the Broken Hill Company to stake out the whole Hill. In the ensuing months of fruitless search and with costs mounting, several of the original seven parted with their shares, and at the eve of the Company's great success there were nine shareholders, including Rasp, McCulloch, William Jamieson (who bought up shares from several of the founders), Philip Charley, David James, James Poole, Bowes Kelly and W. R. Wilson.[23]
John Darling, Jr. became a director of the company in 1892 and was chairman of directors from 1907 to 1914.[24]
In 1915, the company ventured into steel manufacturing, with its operations based primarily in Newcastle, New South Wales. The decision to move from mining ore at Broken Hill to open a steelworks at Newcastle was due to the technical limitations in recovering value from mining the 'lower-lying sulphide ores'.[25] The discovery of Iron Knob and Iron Monarch near the western shore of the Spencer Gulf in South Australia combined with the development by the BHP metallurgist A. D. Carmichael of a technique for 'separating zinc sulphides from the accompanying earth and rock' led BHP 'to implement the startlingly simple and cheap process for liberating vast amounts of valuable metals out of sulphide ores, including huge heaps of tailings and slimes up to' 40 ft (12 m) high.[26]
The company began petroleum exploration in the 1960s with discoveries in Bass Strait, an activity which became an increasing focus.[27]
BHP began to diversify offshore in a variety of projects. One project was the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea, where the company was successfully sued by the indigenous inhabitants because of the environmental degradation caused by the mine operations.[28] BHP had better success with the giant Escondida copper mine in Chile (57.5 percent owned) and the EKATI Diamond Mine in northern Canada.[29] which it divested in 2013 to Dominion Diamond Corporation (formerly Harry Winston Diamond Corporation).[30]
The inefficiencies of what was, by global standards, a small steel operation in Newcastle finally caught up with the company and the Newcastle operations were closed in 1999.[31] The 'long products' side of the steel business was spun off to form OneSteel in 2000.[32]
BHP Billiton[edit]

In 2001, BHP merged with the Billiton mining company to form BHP Billiton. In 2002, the 'flat products' steel business was spun off to form BHP Steel. In 2003, BHP Steel changed its name to BlueScope Steel.[33]
In March 2005, BHP Billiton announced a US$7.3 billion agreed bid for another mining company, WMC Resources, owners of the Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium mine in South Australia, nickel operations in Western Australia and Queensland, and a fertiliser plant also in Queensland. The takeover achieved 90 percent acceptance on 17 June 2005, and 100 percent ownership was announced on 2 August 2005, achieved through compulsory acquisition of the last 10 percent of the shares.[34]
On 8 November 2007, BHP Billiton announced it was seeking to purchase rival mining group Rio Tinto Group in an all-share deal. The initial offer of 3.4 shares of BHP Billiton stock for each share of Rio Tinto was rejected by the board of Rio Tinto for "significantly undervaluing" the company. It was unknown at the time whether BHP Billiton would attempt to purchase Rio Tinto through some form of hostile takeover;[35] however, CEO Marius Kloppers met with many of Rio's shareholders following the announcement and reiterated that the offer for Rio was "compelling" and that BHP Billiton is very "patient".[36] A formal hostile bid of 3.4 BHP Billiton shares for each Rio Tinto share was announced on 6 February 2008.[37] The bid was withdrawn on 25 November 2008 due to a global recession.[38]
On 14 May 2008, BHP Billiton shares rose to a record high of A$48.90 after speculation that Chinese mining firm Chinalco was considering purchasing a large stake. BHP Billiton representatives had no comment.[39]
On 25 November 2008, Billiton announced that it would drop its A$66 billion takeover of rival Rio Tinto Group saying that the "risks to shareholder value" would "increase" to "an unacceptable level" due to the global financial crisis.[40]
On 21 January 2009, the company announced that in response to the global financial crisis the BHP Billiton Ravensthorpe Nickel Project in Western Australia would cease operations, with a resultant discontinuation of shipments of ore from Ravensthorpe to the Yabulu nickel plant in Queensland Australia.[41] Subsequently, the Yabulu refinery was sold to Queensland billionaire Mr Clive Palmer. Additionally, the Pinto Valley mine in the United States was closed. In total, 6,000 employees were laid off, including those laid off with the scaling back at some other projects.[42]
On 9 December 2009, BHP Billiton sold its Ravensthorpe Nickel Mine, which cost A$2.4 billion to build, to Vancouver-based First Quantum Minerals for US$340 million. First Quantum was one of three bidders for the mine and actually produced the lowest offer. The Canadian company plans to have the mine back in production in mid-2011. Ravensthorpe cost BHP US$3.6 billion in writedowns when it was shut in January 2009 after less than a year of production.[43]
In January 2010, after BHP Billiton bought Athabasca Potash for US$320m, The Economist reported that by 2020, BHP Billiton could produce approximately 15 percent of the world demand for potash.[44]
In August 2010, BHP Billiton made a hostile takeover bid worth US$40 billion for the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The bid came after BHP's first bid, made on 17 August, was rejected as being undervalued.[45] This acquisition marked a major strategic move by BHP outside hard commodities and commenced the diversification of its business away from resources with high exposure to carbon price risk (coal, petroleum, iron ore). The takeover bid was opposed by the Government of Saskatchewan under Premier Brad Wall. On 3 November, Canadian Industry Minister Tony Clement announced the preliminary rejection of the deal under the Investment Canada Act, giving BHP Billiton 30 days to refine their deal before a final decision was made.[46]
On 14 November 2010, the company announced that it was dropping its offer for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan.[47]
On 22 February 2011 BHP announced that it paid $4.75 billion in cash to Chesapeake Energy Corp for all of the company's Fayetteville shale assets which include 487,000 acres (1,970 km2) of mineral rights leases and 420 miles (680 km) of pipeline located in north central Arkansas in the United States. The wells on the mineral leases are currently producing about 415 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. BHP plans to spend $800 million to $1 billion a year over 10 years to develop the field and triple production.[48]
On 14 July 2011, BHP Billiton announced that it would acquire Petrohawk Energy of the United States for approximately $12.1 billion in cash, considerably expanding its shale natural gas resources[49] in an offer of $US38.75 per share.[50]
In August 2012, BHP Billiton announced that it was shelving its US$20 billion (£12 billion) Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine expansion project in South Australia, as a result of falling commodity prices and slowing global economic growth.[51][52] The company simultaneously announced a freeze on approving any major new expansion projects.[51][52]
Days after announcing the Olympic Dam pull-out, BHP announced that it was selling its Yeelirrie Uranium Project to Canadian Cameco for a fee of around $430 million. The sale was part of a broader move to step away from resource expansion in Australia.[53]
On 19 August 2014, BHP Billiton announced it would create an independent global metals and mining company based on a selection of its aluminium, coal, manganese, nickel and silver assets.[54] The newly formed entity, named South32, was subsequently demerged with listings on the Australian Securities Exchange the JSE and the London Stock Exchange.[54]
BHP Billiton agreed to pay a fine of $25 million to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in 2015 in connection with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act related to its "hospitality program" at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. BHP Billiton invited 176 government and state-owned enterprise officials to attend the Games on an all-expenses-paid package. While BHP Billiton claimed to have compliance processes in place to avoid conflicts of interest, the SEC found that BHP Billiton had invited officials from at least four countries where BHP Billiton had interests in influencing the officials' decisions (Congo, Guinea, Philippines and Burundi).[55]
In 2017, BHP Billiton announced a $2.2billion investment in the new BP platform in the Gulf of Mexico.[56] During the same year, as part of their plan to increase productivity at the Escondida mine in Chile,[57] which is the world's biggest copper mine, BHP Billiton attempted to get workers to accept a 4-year pay freeze, a 66% reduction in the end-of-conflict bonus offering, and increased shift flexibility. This resulted in a major workers' strike and forced the company to declare ‘force majeure’ on two shipments, which drove copper prices up by 4%.[58]
Corporate affairs[edit]
The Australian BHP Billiton Limited and the British BHP Billiton plc are separately listed with separate shareholder bodies, but they operate as one business with identical boards of directors and a single management structure. The global headquarters of the BHP Billiton Group & BHP Billiton Limited (Australia) are located in Melbourne, Australia. BHP Billiton plc is located in London, England.[1] BHP Billiton also has offices in Houston, USA, Santiago, Perth, Brisbane, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Shanghai.
The company's shares trade on the following exchanges:[59]

Senior management[edit]
In 1998, with the stock price at less than $7 per share, BHP hired an American, Paul Anderson to reconstruct the company. Anderson was successful in this and completed his four-year stint with a merger between BHP and London-based Billiton. The CEO position was passed to Brian Gilbertson of Billiton but in 2003, after just six months in the CEO role, Gilbertson abruptly stepped down and cited irreconcilable differences with the boards as the reason for his resignation.[60]
Upon Gilbertson's departure, Chip Goodyear, an Anderson protégé, was appointed the new CEO and he continued in that role until his retirement on 30 September 2007, with the stock price over $80 per share. Marius Kloppers was Goodyear's successor.[61] Following the end of Kloppers' tenure in 2013, Andrew Mackenzie, the Chief Executive of Non-Ferrous, assumed the role of CEO. In response to investor demands and a diminishing mining boom, BHP Billiton announced in mid-April 2013 that Mackenzie's remuneration package would be 25 per cent less than that of Kloppers—Barry Fitzgerald, writing for The Australian, stated that the decision represented the introduction of a "new era of austerity" for the corporation.[62]
Operations[edit]
Current[edit]
BHP operates a wide variety of mining, processing and oil and gas production operations in over 25 countries,[63] employing approximately 41,000 people.
The company has four primary operational units, with an optional fifth operational unit, referred to as Businesses:

Coal
Copper
Iron ore
Petroleum
Potash

At the end of fiscal year 2015, BHP Billiton, produced more than 256 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe), 1.7 million tonnes (Mt) of copper, 233 Mt of iron ore, 43 Mt of metallurgical coal and 41 Mt of energy coal.
In addition it has subsidiary logistics companies BHP Transport and Logistics Pty Ltd (incorporating the former BHP Shipping) and BHPB Freight Pty Ltd.

The United Nations Environment Programme has noted that BHP’s Ok Tedi mine site’s "uncontrolled discharge of 70 million tonnes of waste rock and mine tailings annually has spread more than 10 km (6.2 mi) down the Ok Tedi and Fly rivers, raising river beds and causing flooding, sediment deposition, forest damage, and a serious decline in the area's biodiversity."[66] The resulting devastation caused by the mining of Ok Tedi has included the loss of fish, a vital food source for the local community; loss of forest and crops due to flooding; and the loss of "areas of deep spiritual value for villagers are now submerged in mine tailings."[67]

Social and environmental responsibility[edit]




A village flooded in the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster (2015). The dam was a property of Samarco, a joint venture between Vale and BHP Billiton.


BHP Billiton is listed as one of the 90 companies extracting and marketing fossil fuels that are responsible for two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of the industrial age.[68] Its cumulative emissions until 2010 have been estimated at 7,606 MtCO2e, representing 0.52% of global industrial emissions between 1751-2010, and ranking it the 19th largest corporate polluter.[69] According to BHP Billiton management 10% of these emissions are from direct operations, while 90% are from products sold by the company.[70] BHP Billiton has been voluntarily reporting its direct GHG emissions since 1996. In 2013 it was criticised in 2013 for lobbying against carbon pricing in Australia.[71]
BHP Billiton voluntarily donates one per cent of pre-tax profit, calculated on the average of the previous three years’ pre-tax profit, in community programs[72] and made US$241.7 million of community donations including a US$100 million contribution to BHP Billiton corporate charitable entities.[73] BHP Billiton is a founding partner and co-funder (with the Australian Government) of Bush Blitz, operated by Australian Biological Resources Study with Earthwatch Australia.[74]
Significant accidents[edit]
Inclement weather caused a BHP Billiton helicopter to crash in Angola on 16 November 2007, killing the helicopter's five passengers. The dead were: BHP Billiton Angola Chief Operating Officer David Hopgood, Australian; Angola Technical Services Operations Manager Kevin Ayre, British; Wild Dog Helicopters pilot Kottie Breedt, South African; Guy Sommerfield of MMC, British; and Louwrens Prinsloo of Prinsloo Drilling, Namibian. The helicopter went down approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) from Alto Cuilo exploration facility in north eastern Angola. BHP Billiton responded by suspending operations in the country.[75]
On 5 November 2015 a dam holding back waste water from an iron ore mine in Mariana, south-eastern Brazil, owned by BHP Billiton and Vale collapsed, devastating a nearby town with mudslides, killing at least 17 people, injuring more than 50 and causing enormous ecological damage,[76] and threatening life along the river Rio Doce and the Atlantic sea near the mouth of the Rio Doce.[77] The accident was the biggest environmental disaster in Brazil's history.[78]

The former BHP Billiton logo


BHP, the trading entity of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton plc and formerly known as BHP Billiton, is an Anglo-Australian multinational mining, metals and petroleum dual-listed public company headquartered in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Founded in 1885 in the isolated mining town of Broken Hill, it was the world's largest mining company measured by 2015 market values and Australia's fourth largest company (by revenue), formerly the largest.
BHP Billiton was formed in 2001 through the merger of the Australian Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) and the Anglo–Dutch Billiton plc.[4] The result is a dual-listed company. The Australia-registered BHP Billiton Limited, which has equal financial share in the company, has a primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange and is one of the largest companies in Australia measured by market capitalisation. The English-registered BHP Billiton plc has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
In April 2017 activist hedge fund manager Elliott Advisors proposed a plan for BHP to spin off its American petroleum assets and significantly restructure the business, including the scrapping of its dual Sydney-London listing, suggesting shares be offered only in the United Kingdom., while leaving its headquarters and tax residences in Australia where shares would trade as depositary instruments. At the time of the correspondence Elliott held about 4.1 percent of the issued shares in London-listed BHP Billiton PLC, worth $3.81 billion. Australia's government warned it would block moves to shift BHP's stock listing from Australia to the United Kingdom. Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison said the move would be contrary to the country's national interest and would breach government orders mandating a listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. BHP dismissed the plan saying the costs and risks of Elliott's proposal outweighed any potential benefits.[5]
In May 2017 with much of the former Billiton assets having been disposed of, BHP Billiton began to rebrand itself as BHP, at first in Australia and then globally. It replaced the slogan "The Big Australian" with "Think Big", with an advertising campaign rolling out in mid May 2017.[6] Work on the change began in 2015 according to BHP's chief external affairs officer.[7]
BHP's global headquarters and Australian registered (corporate) office is located at 171 Collins Street, Melbourne Australia.

History[edit]
Billiton[edit]




The former Billiton logo


Billiton was a mining company whose origins stretch back to 29 September 1860, when the articles of association were approved by a meeting of shareholders in the Groot Keizerhof hotel in The Hague, the Netherlands.[8]
Two months later, the company acquired the mineral rights to the tin-rich Billiton (Belitung) and Bangka Islands in the Netherlands Indies archipelago, off the eastern coast of Sumatra.[8]
Billiton's initial business forays included tin and lead smelting in the Netherlands, followed in the 1940s by bauxite mining in Indonesia and Suriname. In 1970, Shell acquired Billiton accelerated this growth.[8] The tin and lead smelter in Arnhem, the Netherlands, was shut down in the 1990s. Billiton owned a tin smelting and refining plant in Phuket, Thailand called Thaisarco (short for Thailand Smelting And Refining Company, Limited), which still exists today.[9]
In 1994, South Africa's Gencor Ltd. acquired the mining division of Billiton excluding the downstream metal division.[10] Billiton was divested from Gencor in 1997.[11]
In 1997, Billiton plc became a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[8] Throughout the 1990s and beyond, Billiton plc experienced considerable growth. Its portfolio included aluminium smelters in South Africa and Mozambique, nickel operations in Australia and Colombia, base metals mines in South America, Canada and South Africa, coal mines in Australia, Colombia and South Africa, as well as interests in operations in Brazil, Suriname, Australia (aluminium) and South Africa (titanium minerals and steel and ferroalloys).
In 2001 Billiton plc merged with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) to form BHP Billiton.[4]
In 2015, BHP Billiton spun off a number of its subsidiaries[12] in South Africa and Southern Africa to form a new company known as South32.[13][14] South32 is invested in manganese production[15] and coal mining activities in South Africa, Brazil, Australia and the Far East.
In August 2016, the company recorded its worst annual loss in history, $6.4 billion.[16]
Towards the end of 2016 BHP indicated it would be expanding its petroleum business with new investments in the sector.[17]
Broken Hill Proprietary Company[edit]




The former Broken Hill Proprietary Company logo


The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) also known by the nickname "the Big Australian",[18] was incorporated in 1885, operating the silver and lead mine at Broken Hill in western New South Wales, Australia.[19][20] The Broken Hill group floated on 10 August 1885.[21] The first consignment of Broken Hill ore (48 tons, 5 cwt, 3grs) was smelted at the Intercolonial Smelting and Refining Company's works at Spotswood, Melbourne.[21]

The resulting 35,605 ounces of silver raised a lot of interest when exhibited at the City of Melbourne Bank in Collins St. Some sceptics asserted the promoters were merely using silver from somewhere else, to ramp up the shares...Another shareholder, the dominating W.R. Wilson had had to lend [William Jamieson, General Manager] a new suit so he could take the first prospectus, printed at Silverton near Broken Hill on 20 June 1885, to Adelaide to start the float process.[21]

The geographic Broken Hill, for which the town was named, was discovered and named by Charles Sturt, and created much interest among prospectors, but nothing of note was discovered until Charles Rasp, boundary rider for the encompassing Mount Gipps Station, pegged out a 40-acre claim with contractors David James and James Poole, then with half-a-dozen backers (the Syndicate of Seven) including station manager George McCulloch (a young cousin of Victorian Premier Sir James McCulloch[22]) formed the Broken Hill Company to stake out the whole Hill. In the ensuing months of fruitless search and with costs mounting, several of the original seven parted with their shares, and at the eve of the Company's great success there were nine shareholders, including Rasp, McCulloch, William Jamieson (who bought up shares from several of the founders), Philip Charley, David James, James Poole, Bowes Kelly and W. R. Wilson.[23]
John Darling, Jr. became a director of the company in 1892 and was chairman of directors from 1907 to 1914.[24]
In 1915, the company ventured into steel manufacturing, with its operations based primarily in Newcastle, New South Wales. The decision to move from mining ore at Broken Hill to open a steelworks at Newcastle was due to the technical limitations in recovering value from mining the 'lower-lying sulphide ores'.[25] The discovery of Iron Knob and Iron Monarch near the western shore of the Spencer Gulf in South Australia combined with the development by the BHP metallurgist A. D. Carmichael of a technique for 'separating zinc sulphides from the accompanying earth and rock' led BHP 'to implement the startlingly simple and cheap process for liberating vast amounts of valuable metals out of sulphide ores, including huge heaps of tailings and slimes up to' 40 ft (12 m) high.[26]
The company began petroleum exploration in the 1960s with discoveries in Bass Strait, an activity which became an increasing focus.[27]
BHP began to diversify offshore in a variety of projects. One project was the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea, where the company was successfully sued by the indigenous inhabitants because of the environmental degradation caused by the mine operations.[28] BHP had better success with the giant Escondida copper mine in Chile (57.5 percent owned) and the EKATI Diamond Mine in northern Canada.[29] which it divested in 2013 to Dominion Diamond Corporation (formerly Harry Winston Diamond Corporation).[30]
The inefficiencies of what was, by global standards, a small steel operation in Newcastle finally caught up with the company and the Newcastle operations were closed in 1999.[31] The 'long products' side of the steel business was spun off to form OneSteel in 2000.[32]
BHP Billiton[edit]

In 2001, BHP merged with the Billiton mining company to form BHP Billiton. In 2002, the 'flat products' steel business was spun off to form BHP Steel. In 2003, BHP Steel changed its name to BlueScope Steel.[33]
In March 2005, BHP Billiton announced a US$7.3 billion agreed bid for another mining company, WMC Resources, owners of the Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium mine in South Australia, nickel operations in Western Australia and Queensland, and a fertiliser plant also in Queensland. The takeover achieved 90 percent acceptance on 17 June 2005, and 100 percent ownership was announced on 2 August 2005, achieved through compulsory acquisition of the last 10 percent of the shares.[34]
On 8 November 2007, BHP Billiton announced it was seeking to purchase rival mining group Rio Tinto Group in an all-share deal. The initial offer of 3.4 shares of BHP Billiton stock for each share of Rio Tinto was rejected by the board of Rio Tinto for "significantly undervaluing" the company. It was unknown at the time whether BHP Billiton would attempt to purchase Rio Tinto through some form of hostile takeover;[35] however, CEO Marius Kloppers met with many of Rio's shareholders following the announcement and reiterated that the offer for Rio was "compelling" and that BHP Billiton is very "patient".[36] A formal hostile bid of 3.4 BHP Billiton shares for each Rio Tinto share was announced on 6 February 2008.[37] The bid was withdrawn on 25 November 2008 due to a global recession.[38]
On 14 May 2008, BHP Billiton shares rose to a record high of A$48.90 after speculation that Chinese mining firm Chinalco was considering purchasing a large stake. BHP Billiton representatives had no comment.[39]
On 25 November 2008, Billiton announced that it would drop its A$66 billion takeover of rival Rio Tinto Group saying that the "risks to shareholder value" would "increase" to "an unacceptable level" due to the global financial crisis.[40]
On 21 January 2009, the company announced that in response to the global financial crisis the BHP Billiton Ravensthorpe Nickel Project in Western Australia would cease operations, with a resultant discontinuation of shipments of ore from Ravensthorpe to the Yabulu nickel plant in Queensland Australia.[41] Subsequently, the Yabulu refinery was sold to Queensland billionaire Mr Clive Palmer. Additionally, the Pinto Valley mine in the United States was closed. In total, 6,000 employees were laid off, including those laid off with the scaling back at some other projects.[42]
On 9 December 2009, BHP Billiton sold its Ravensthorpe Nickel Mine, which cost A$2.4 billion to build, to Vancouver-based First Quantum Minerals for US$340 million. First Quantum was one of three bidders for the mine and actually produced the lowest offer. The Canadian company plans to have the mine back in production in mid-2011. Ravensthorpe cost BHP US$3.6 billion in writedowns when it was shut in January 2009 after less than a year of production.[43]
In January 2010, after BHP Billiton bought Athabasca Potash for US$320m, The Economist reported that by 2020, BHP Billiton could produce approximately 15 percent of the world demand for potash.[44]
In August 2010, BHP Billiton made a hostile takeover bid worth US$40 billion for the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The bid came after BHP's first bid, made on 17 August, was rejected as being undervalued.[45] This acquisition marked a major strategic move by BHP outside hard commodities and commenced the diversification of its business away from resources with high exposure to carbon price risk (coal, petroleum, iron ore). The takeover bid was opposed by the Government of Saskatchewan under Premier Brad Wall. On 3 November, Canadian Industry Minister Tony Clement announced the preliminary rejection of the deal under the Investment Canada Act, giving BHP Billiton 30 days to refine their deal before a final decision was made.[46]
On 14 November 2010, the company announced that it was dropping its offer for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan.[47]
On 22 February 2011 BHP announced that it paid $4.75 billion in cash to Chesapeake Energy Corp for all of the company's Fayetteville shale assets which include 487,000 acres (1,970 km2) of mineral rights leases and 420 miles (680 km) of pipeline located in north central Arkansas in the United States. The wells on the mineral leases are currently producing about 415 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. BHP plans to spend $800 million to $1 billion a year over 10 years to develop the field and triple production.[48]
On 14 July 2011, BHP Billiton announced that it would acquire Petrohawk Energy of the United States for approximately $12.1 billion in cash, considerably expanding its shale natural gas resources[49] in an offer of $US38.75 per share.[50]
In August 2012, BHP Billiton announced that it was shelving its US$20 billion (£12 billion) Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine expansion project in South Australia, as a result of falling commodity prices and slowing global economic growth.[51][52] The company simultaneously announced a freeze on approving any major new expansion projects.[51][52]
Days after announcing the Olympic Dam pull-out, BHP announced that it was selling its Yeelirrie Uranium Project to Canadian Cameco for a fee of around $430 million. The sale was part of a broader move to step away from resource expansion in Australia.[53]
On 19 August 2014, BHP Billiton announced it would create an independent global metals and mining company based on a selection of its aluminium, coal, manganese, nickel and silver assets.[54] The newly formed entity, named South32, was subsequently demerged with listings on the Australian Securities Exchange the JSE and the London Stock Exchange.[54]
BHP Billiton agreed to pay a fine of $25 million to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in 2015 in connection with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act related to its "hospitality program" at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. BHP Billiton invited 176 government and state-owned enterprise officials to attend the Games on an all-expenses-paid package. While BHP Billiton claimed to have compliance processes in place to avoid conflicts of interest, the SEC found that BHP Billiton had invited officials from at least four countries where BHP Billiton had interests in influencing the officials' decisions (Congo, Guinea, Philippines and Burundi).[55]
In 2017, BHP Billiton announced a $2.2billion investment in the new BP platform in the Gulf of Mexico.[56] During the same year, as part of their plan to increase productivity at the Escondida mine in Chile,[57] which is the world's biggest copper mine, BHP Billiton attempted to get workers to accept a 4-year pay freeze, a 66% reduction in the end-of-conflict bonus offering, and increased shift flexibility. This resulted in a major workers' strike and forced the company to declare ‘force majeure’ on two shipments, which drove copper prices up by 4%.[58]
Corporate affairs[edit]
The Australian BHP Billiton Limited and the British BHP Billiton plc are separately listed with separate shareholder bodies, but they operate as one business with identical boards of directors and a single management structure. The global headquarters of the BHP Billiton Group & BHP Billiton Limited (Australia) are located in Melbourne, Australia. BHP Billiton plc is located in London, England.[1] BHP Billiton also has offices in Houston, USA, Santiago, Perth, Brisbane, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Shanghai.
The company's shares trade on the following exchanges:[59]

Australia (ASX: BHP)
US (NYSE: BHP)






BHP Billiton plc

UK (LSE: BLT)
US (NYSE: BBL)
South Africa (JSE: BIL)






Senior management[edit]
In 1998, with the stock price at less than $7 per share, BHP hired an American, Paul Anderson to reconstruct the company. Anderson was successful in this and completed his four-year stint with a merger between BHP and London-based Billiton. The CEO position was passed to Brian Gilbertson of Billiton but in 2003, after just six months in the CEO role, Gilbertson abruptly stepped down and cited irreconcilable differences with the boards as the reason for his resignation.[60]
Upon Gilbertson's departure, Chip Goodyear, an Anderson protégé, was appointed the new CEO and he continued in that role until his retirement on 30 September 2007, with the stock price over $80 per share. Marius Kloppers was Goodyear's successor.[61] Following the end of Kloppers' tenure in 2013, Andrew Mackenzie, the Chief Executive of Non-Ferrous, assumed the role of CEO. In response to investor demands and a diminishing mining boom, BHP Billiton announced in mid-April 2013 that Mackenzie's remuneration package would be 25 per cent less than that of Kloppers—Barry Fitzgerald, writing for The Australian, stated that the decision represented the introduction of a "new era of austerity" for the corporation.[62]
Operations[edit]
Current[edit]
BHP operates a wide variety of mining, processing and oil and gas production operations in over 25 countries,[63] employing approximately 41,000 people.
The company has four primary operational units, with an optional fifth operational unit, referred to as Businesses:

Coal
Copper
Iron ore
Petroleum
Potash

At the end of fiscal year 2015, BHP Billiton, produced more than 256 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe), 1.7 million tonnes (Mt) of copper, 233 Mt of iron ore, 43 Mt of metallurgical coal and 41 Mt of energy coal.
In addition it has subsidiary logistics companies BHP Transport and Logistics Pty Ltd (incorporating the former BHP Shipping) and BHPB Freight Pty Ltd.

The United Nations Environment Programme has noted that BHP’s Ok Tedi mine site’s "uncontrolled discharge of 70 million tonnes of waste rock and mine tailings annually has spread more than 10 km (6.2 mi) down the Ok Tedi and Fly rivers, raising river beds and causing flooding, sediment deposition, forest damage, and a serious decline in the area's biodiversity."[66] The resulting devastation caused by the mining of Ok Tedi has included the loss of fish, a vital food source for the local community; loss of forest and crops due to flooding; and the loss of "areas of deep spiritual value for villagers are now submerged in mine tailings."[67]

Social and environmental responsibility[edit]




A village flooded in the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster (2015). The dam was a property of Samarco, a joint venture between Vale and BHP Billiton.


BHP Billiton is listed as one of the 90 companies extracting and marketing fossil fuels that are responsible for two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of the industrial age.[68] Its cumulative emissions until 2010 have been estimated at 7,606 MtCO2e, representing 0.52% of global industrial emissions between 1751-2010, and ranking it the 19th largest corporate polluter.[69] According to BHP Billiton management 10% of these emissions are from direct operations, while 90% are from products sold by the company.[70] BHP Billiton has been voluntarily reporting its direct GHG emissions since 1996. In 2013 it was criticised in 2013 for lobbying against carbon pricing in Australia.[71]
BHP Billiton voluntarily donates one per cent of pre-tax profit, calculated on the average of the previous three years’ pre-tax profit, in community programs[72] and made US$241.7 million of community donations including a US$100 million contribution to BHP Billiton corporate charitable entities.[73] BHP Billiton is a founding partner and co-funder (with the Australian Government) of Bush Blitz, operated by Australian Biological Resources Study with Earthwatch Australia.[74]
Significant accidents[edit]
Inclement weather caused a BHP Billiton helicopter to crash in Angola on 16 November 2007, killing the helicopter's five passengers. The dead were: BHP Billiton Angola Chief Operating Officer David Hopgood, Australian; Angola Technical Services Operations Manager Kevin Ayre, British; Wild Dog Helicopters pilot Kottie Breedt, South African; Guy Sommerfield of MMC, British; and Louwrens Prinsloo of Prinsloo Drilling, Namibian. The helicopter went down approximately 80 kilometres (50 mi) from Alto Cuilo exploration facility in north eastern Angola. BHP Billiton responded by suspending operations in the country.[75]
On 5 November 2015 a dam holding back waste water from an iron ore mine in Mariana, south-eastern Brazil, owned by BHP Billiton and Vale collapsed, devastating a nearby town with mudslides, killing at least 17 people, injuring more than 50 and causing enormous ecological damage,[76] and threatening life along the river Rio Doce and the Atlantic sea near the mouth of the Rio Doce.[77] The accident was the biggest environmental disaster in Brazil's history.[78]
