      the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We intend for all such 
      forward-looking statements to be covered by the applicable safe harbor 
      provisions for forward-looking statements contained in those acts. Such 
      statements include, in particular, statements about our plans, 
      strategies, and prospects and are subject to certain risks and 
      uncertainties, including known and unknown risks, which could cause 
      actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated.
Therefore, such statements are not intended to be a guarantee of our 
      performance in future periods. Such forward-looking statements can 
      generally be identified by our use of forward-looking terminology such 
      as "may," "will," "expect," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," 
      "believe," "continue," or other similar words. Readers are cautioned not 
      to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak 
      only as of the date of this press release. We make no representations or 
      warranties (express or implied) about the accuracy of any such 
      forward-looking statements contained in this press release, and we do 
      not intend to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, 
      whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.


Any such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, 
      uncertainties, and other factors and are based on a number of 
      assumptions involving judgments with respect to, among other things, 
      future economic, competitive, and market conditions, all of which are 
      difficult or impossible to predict accurately. To the extent that our 
      assumptions differ from actual conditions, our ability to accurately 
      anticipate results expressed in such forward-looking statements, 
      including our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations, 
      make distributions to stockholders, and maintain the value of our real 
      estate properties, may be significantly hindered. See Item 1A in the 
      Company's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year 
      ended December 31, 2014, for a discussion of some of the risks and 
      uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
      those presented in our forward-looking statements. The risk factors 
      described in our Annual Report are not the only ones we face, but do 
      represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to 
      us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that 
      we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.

Columbia Property Trust Names Carmen M. Bowser To Board Of Directors






Business Wire




Dec 22, 2015 6:30 AM EST













 




























































  Columbia Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE: CXP) has elected Carmen M. Bowser as a member of the Board of Directors, effective January 1, 2016.  Ms. Bowser has been active in the commercial real estate arena for 30 years, working for institutional lenders, banks and other capital providers. Most recently, as managing vice president at Capital One Bank, Ms. Bowser oversaw the underwriting and asset management activities for the bank's $30 billion commercial real estate debt portfolio. Prior to Capital One, she held senior positions at Prudential, TIAA-CREF and Arbor National Commercial Mortgage Company. In addition to having responsibility for originating portfolio, agency and CMBS loans for clients in the U.S. and Canada, she also made investments in private equity funds, negotiated equity joint ventures and made direct property acquisitions. During her real estate career, Ms. Bowser has closed over $6 billion in transactions.  A long-time member of WX New York Women Executives in Real Estate, which recently named her its 2015 Woman of the Year, Ms. Bowser is also a member of the Urban Land Institute and the Real Estate Lenders Association, and she is a past chair of the Finance Committee of the Real Estate Board of New York.  "Carmen's vast experience, including leadership roles at some of the most respected real estate investment firms, gives her valuable perspective on our business," noted Nelson Mills, president and chief executive officer of Columbia Property Trust. "Having spent the majority of her career in New York City, Carmen also brings a wealth of knowledge about that key market. We will benefit greatly from her contributions and insight."
