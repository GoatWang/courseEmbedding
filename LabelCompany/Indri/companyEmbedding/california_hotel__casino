Whether you’re a high roller or a low-key lounger, Las Vegas has something to suit your vacation taste. Sample fare from top chefs and cornucopian buffets, try your luck at one of the world’s premier casinos, or take in a spectacular show. Just wandering the Strip is enough to get your heart pumping. Once you’ve had enough of the razzle-dazzle, wave hello to the toothy sea life at the Mandalay Bay Shark Reef, hike Red Rock Canyon, or visit the Neon Museum, where old signs take on new life.

California Hotel and Casino


The California Hotel and Casino (also known as The Cal) opened in 1975 at a cost of $10 million with a hotel and casino located in Downtown Las Vegas, Nevada near the Fremont Street Experience. When it opened it had 325 rooms which has since been expanded to 781.[1]
The California has been owned by Boyd Gaming since it was built by Sam Boyd.[1]
After facing slow business initially, Boyd soon began focusing on the Hawaiian market, offering Hawaiian food and encouraging a more casual atmosphere.[2] He introduced vacation packages from the islands, with charter airfares as low as $9.90. An estimated 80-90% of visitors to Las Vegas from Hawaii stay at a Boyd property. Boyd's Hawaiian marketing, which extended to the Fremont and Main Street Station with their later acquisitions, is credited with helping to build a large Hawaiian community in Las Vegas, which is sometimes called "the ninth island".[2]
In 1989, the hotel designated the term Golden Arm, after Stanley Fujitake rolled dice for three hours and six minutes in craps without losing.[3]
In 1994 an additional tower was added and the remainder of the hotel was remodeled.[1] The property is connected to Main Street Station by an enclosed walkway.

“Fresh casino look, same great people”


Reviewed 3 days ago
NEW 


via mobile




Last time I had visited was seven years ago and wow what a difference the renovation made... bright casino, clean and modern casino restrooms and the guest rooms are gorgeous! Suite (photos shared) 2308 was beautiful, spacious and close to the elevator and couldn't hear any hallway noise (there was a great group of class reunion folks gathered in the next suite and we couldn't even hear them once our door closed). Same great service and friendly staff from valet and reception to restaurant and casino dealers. I felt safe during my 3 day/2 night stay whether I was with my husband or with my female friends, especially during the early hours of morning. Would love to visit again and won't wait another seven years.

“California hotel.”


Reviewed 4 days ago
NEW 



This was my first time staying downtown and it won't be my last. We enjoyed the hotel and very small pool and loved the 777 brewpub at the connected property Main Street station. The room was great brand new carpet and bathroom with good water pressure. My only problem was the air conditioner would only cool the room to 72 to 74 degrees so we slept with no blankets but it wasn't too bad and for the price. I was on the bottom level that had rooms and I never heard any noise whatsoever. Fremont street is only a block away a very easy 1 min walk. We'll definitely stay on fremont again next time and probably at the cal because of location and no resort fees and the friendliness of the entire staff. We can't wait to come back, just hope our luck improves.




Stayed July 2017

“Budget, but comfortable”


Reviewed 1 week ago




This hotel looks like it was recently renovated within the last two years. It is clean and very comfortable. The staff are very friendly, although I don't think that they move at a pace that is more expected on the strip (kind of lackadaisical). The food fare in the restaurants is very much themed towards Hawaii - not a bad thing. I stayed at this hotel in mid-2017 and found the casino to be far less crowded than the last time I stayed here (2003).


Room Tip: Stay away from elevators (noisy), but be prepared to walk down LONG halls.

“Great time!”


Reviewed 2 weeks ago



via mobile




Downtown Vegas is the best place to gamble and have a great time! And one of the best hotels to stay at ,especially for the price, is the California hotel and casino! They take care of you like the Vegas of old, where customers come first and they have a great rewards program for an added bonus! I will always stay at The Cal when in downtown, if closer to airport/strip I'll stay at the O'rleans. They are both owned by the Boyd Corp. I can't wait to go back!!!

“Very nice”


Reviewed 3 weeks ago




We stayed here for 4 nights the last week of June for a family reunion. We had a few concerns because of location but were very happy with our room and the hotel in general. While not as impressive as the newer hotels in the strip, our room was newly remodeled and was very nice. We ate a number of meals at the Main Street Cafe and the food was very good and reasonably priced. We won on the slots which is always a good thing. We walked to Fremont Street in the evening and felt comfortable doing so. In general it was a very good experience. No complaints.


Room Tip: We were on the 20th floor. Non smoking and did not smell smoke. I have breathing problems so this...

“Loved the room and location ”


Reviewed 3 weeks ago

My first time staying downtown Las Vegas and I was not disappointed. I got a special room rate online and booked it early as price of rooms went up. The rooms have been updated and actually are better than rooms I've stayed in on the strip. I did not spend a lot of time at casino because it does not have a poker room.

“Great for the price.”


Reviewed June 15, 2017



via mobile




This is not a new hotel, but it's clean. The employees were friendly. Food was reasonable. Pool is not impressive. If you just need a comfortable place to lay your head and that's only a block form Fremont, then this is a good choice. If you want luxury and a fancy pool go to the strip. I'm a fan of both places. If you want a cheap trip go to Fremont street!

Reviewed June 9, 2017

I received a flyer in the mail for a promotion with Boyd Gaming and Vacations Hawaii, they say you can get a four night hotel + 3 meals per day + hotel luggage handling for $111.00. The airfare is NOT INCLUDED! I called them and found out that the airfare is $657. - $820. + the $111. What a scam! That is NOT A SPECIAL! You can book Hawaiian Air and get a cheaper price. Come on Vacations Hawaii.... are you that lame? I would not recommend going with Vacations Hawaii, they are way too greedy!!

“Better than Expected - more Aloha”


Reviewed May 28, 2017



via mobile




Clientele are mostly Asian as it is a Hawaiian themed hotel. We stayed at Bluegreen resorts and stayed at California Hotel for a day. We heard a bunch of yelling from the streets. Also, sometimes you can hear the train which is a block away. The room was very modern and very nice. We stayed on floor 14. I liked how you can walk to Main Street Station Casino via covered walkway. The bedding was up to date and very nice. The had nice shutters on the windows. The bathroom was all modern and had nice shower. They need a detachable shower head and then it would be perfect. There was a really nice large mirror to help you look at your entire self (which Bluegreen Resorts didn't have). Also the room had a large 60" flat screen tv. They have a lot of good Asian restaurants and a good buffet either at CA Hotel and at Main St. Station Casino. There are a bunch of street people which might be a bit scary but if you are with a group or with someone it should be ok. The hotel is a block from the Fremont canopy show. We would stay here again. We usually stay at the Golden Nugget but the CA Hotel may be my favorite now. I tried to book one night at the Nugget but they wouldn't let me and that is why we ended up at CA Hotel.

“Great time!”


Reviewed 2 weeks ago



via mobile




Downtown Vegas is the best place to gamble and have a great time! And one of the best hotels to stay at ,especially for the price, is the California hotel and casino! They take care of you like the Vegas of old, where customers come first and they have a great rewards program for an added bonus! I will always stay at The Cal when in downtown, if closer to airport/strip I'll stay at the O'rleans. They are both owned by the Boyd Corp. I can't wait to go back!!!

“Very nice”


Reviewed 3 weeks ago




We stayed here for 4 nights the last week of June for a family reunion. We had a few concerns because of location but were very happy with our room and the hotel in general. While not as impressive as the newer hotels in the strip, our room was newly remodeled and was very nice. We ate a number of meals at the Main Street Cafe and the food was very good and reasonably priced. We won on the slots which is always a good thing. We walked to Fremont Street in the evening and felt comfortable doing so. In general it was a very good experience. No complaints.


Room Tip: We were on the 20th floor. Non smoking and did not smell smoke. I have breathing problems so this...

“Loved the room and location ”


Reviewed 3 weeks ago



via mobile




My first time staying downtown Las Vegas and I was not disappointed. I got a special room rate online and booked it early as price of rooms went up. The rooms have been updated and actually are better than rooms I've stayed in on the strip. I did not spend a lot of time at casino because it does not have a poker room.

“Great for the price.”


Reviewed June 15, 2017



via mobile




This is not a new hotel, but it's clean. The employees were friendly. Food was reasonable. Pool is not impressive. If you just need a comfortable place to lay your head and that's only a block form Fremont, then this is a good choice. If you want luxury and a fancy pool go to the strip. I'm a fan of both places. If you want a cheap trip go to Fremont street!

“Boyd & Vacations Hawaii SCAM!”


Reviewed June 9, 2017



via mobile




I received a flyer in the mail for a promotion with Boyd Gaming and Vacations Hawaii, they say you can get a four night hotel + 3 meals per day + hotel luggage handling for $111.00. The airfare is NOT INCLUDED! I called them and found out that the airfare is $657. - $820. + the $111. What a scam! That is NOT A SPECIAL! You can book Hawaiian Air and get a cheaper price. Come on Vacations Hawaii.... are you that lame? I would not recommend going with Vacations Hawaii, they are way too greedy!!

“Better than Expected - more Aloha”


Reviewed May 28, 2017



via mobile




Clientele are mostly Asian as it is a Hawaiian themed hotel. We stayed at Bluegreen resorts and stayed at California Hotel for a day. We heard a bunch of yelling from the streets. Also, sometimes you can hear the train which is a block away. The room was very modern and very nice. We stayed on floor 14. I liked how you can walk to Main Street Station Casino via covered walkway. The bedding was up to date and very nice. The had nice shutters on the windows. The bathroom was all modern and had nice shower. They need a detachable shower head and then it would be perfect. There was a really nice large mirror to help you look at your entire self (which Bluegreen Resorts didn't have). Also the room had a large 60" flat screen tv. They have a lot of good Asian restaurants and a good buffet either at CA Hotel and at Main St. Station Casino. There are a bunch of street people which might be a bit scary but if you are with a group or with someone it should be ok. The hotel is a block from the Fremont canopy show. We would stay here again. We usually stay at the Golden Nugget but the CA Hotel may be my favorite now. I tried to book one night at the Nugget but they wouldn't let me and that is why we ended up at CA Hotel.

“Pleasantly Surprised”


Reviewed May 27, 2017



via mobile




I've been staying at the Downtown Grand when visiting Vegas but I play at the Main Street mostly. They sent me a card for a free room so I figured I'd take advantage. The outside of the building looks a little old and run down but once you enter the casino, you can tell it has been remodeled. The ceilings in the room are short because it's old but they have been redone very well. The beds had nice linens, the carpet and decor was attractive and the bathroom was great. I really liked the tile that looks like hardwood and the enormous shower. The parking lot is attached which was nice because not all hotels downtown have attached parking. It's a block off Fremont street so it's not as loud at night. I highly recommend staying here if you want a nice room downtown. I will definitely be back!

California Hotel and Casino


The California Hotel and Casino (also known as The Cal) opened in 1975 at a cost of $10 million with a hotel and casino located in Downtown Las Vegas, Nevada near the Fremont Street Experience. When it opened it had 325 rooms which has since been expanded to 781.[1]
The California has been owned by Boyd Gaming since it was built by Sam Boyd.[1]
After facing slow business initially, Boyd soon began focusing on the Hawaiian market, offering Hawaiian food and encouraging a more casual atmosphere.[2] He introduced vacation packages from the islands, with charter airfares as low as $9.90. An estimated 80-90% of visitors to Las Vegas from Hawaii stay at a Boyd property. Boyd's Hawaiian marketing, which extended to the Fremont and Main Street Station with their later acquisitions, is credited with helping to build a large Hawaiian community in Las Vegas, which is sometimes called "the ninth island".[2]
In 1989, the hotel designated the term Golden Arm, after Stanley Fujitake rolled dice for three hours and six minutes in craps without losing.[3]
In 1994 an additional tower was added and the remainder of the hotel was remodeled.[1] The property is connected to Main Street Station by an enclosed walkway.

                 Fremont Street ExperienceThe Fremont Street Experience is a pedestrian mall in the heart of old Las Vegas. Its defining feature is a 1500-ft-long, 90-ft-high barrel vaulted canopy that covers four blocks of the street and transforms it into a unique entertainment attraction. The underside of the canopy comprises 12.5 million LED modules used as a backdrop for regularly scheduled animated displays. Sound is provided by a 550,000-watt system that uses 220 speakers attached under the canopy. The 15-minute shows are presented on an hourly basis after dark. Admission is free. The Fremont Street Experience has provided a basis for restoring and preserving older Vegas attractions literally under the umbrella of a new one. The Golden Nugget, Binion's Horseshoe, and the Golden Gate are all located here. In addition to hotels, restaurants, and casinos, Fremont Street is home to the Neon Museum, which preserves neon displays from casinos that no longer exist—like the famous lamp from the Aladdin casino. The canopy also provides a protected venue for outdoor concerts and shows.moreless Neon MuseumThe neon museum is an outdoor walking tour which is located downtown at the Fremont Street Experience. It displays the neon signs of hotels and other venues that have been imploded to make space for the bigger and more modern mega hotels. The signs which can be seen include the genie lamp of the old Aladdin hotel, the sign of the Hacienda Hotel and many more. The museum also offers a tour through their bone-yard in which visitors can view old neon signs from across the country. These tours have to be pre-arranged and are only available for groups of more than 10 people.moreless Siegfried & Roy's Secret Garden and Dolphin HabitatThe white tiger habitat is located at the south end of the resort and can be visited 24 hours a day. The critically endangered animals are living in an environment that is most suitable for their needs and comfort. They are rotated in and out of the habitat during the day, if they are not on show they are living in Siegfried and Roys secret garden. The habitat is held completely in white to allow the animals to blend in with the background which enhances their feeling for security. A special glas makes it not only more enjoyable for the visitor to watch the animals but also regulates the temparature within the enclosure.morelessHotel searchUSANevadaHotels in Las VegasCalifornia Hotel & Casinoimportant link

Four Of The Best Booking Sites For Hotels And Accommodations


February 7, 2017
You want to make sure that things go as smoothly as they possibly can before and during your much needed vacation. Even if you have chosen your destination, your planning does not stop there. There are several other things that you must consider and perhaps the most important is where you will stay during your time away. It does not matter whether you are looking for a hotel that will offer you plenty of comfort or if you are traveling on a budget, but still want to be near the major attractions, you can find what you are looking for by using an online booking site. The following list includes four of the best online sites for booking hotels and other accommodation:
Guest Reservations
This website makes booking a hotel for your vacation extremely easy and this is what has helped propel it to the top of the list by users. Users will notice how the site is very easy to navigate and it only takes a few clicks to book and secure all of your accommodations. The website’s main focus is to direct users towards hotels that are the most relevant based on what they are searching for. This way, they can spend less time booking reservations and more time packing for their long awaited weekend getaway or two-week vacation. They also offer the lowest rate guaranteed, which is hard for other booking sites to live up to.
HotWire
HotWire has some of the lowest prices on average when compared to other booking sites. However, with HotWire, you will not know the name of the hotel or its location until you have made the reservation. This sometimes puts off users who would prefer to view pictures of the hotel options before making a final decision. Although, if you love adventure, you will save money using HotWire.
Hotels.com
Hotels.com is a hotel booking site that provides users with several search features, so they can book the hotel they are most interested in. However, the site does make contacting customer service or getting answers to particular questions frustrating. You can book a hotel anywhere in the world and even find a pet and children friendly one. The average hotel booking on this site is higher than the average on other sites and there have been several complaints it, but users have reported finding unexpected savings, especially when they receive discounts via email.
Travelocity
Travelocity provides you with a list of average prices for rooms in the area you are interested in. This will let you know which hotels will give you the best deals for all of the amenities you want. However, you will be hard pressed to find any last minute savings on this website. This is considered a one stop shop for travelers. You will be able to tailor your search down to the final detail.
It does not matter if you are preparing for a business trip in New York or you want to backpack throughout Europe, you can use these sites to book flights, hotels, and other amenities. The best online booking sites will provide you with an accurate picture of the accommodations you should expect once you arrive at your destination, a user friendly interface, and low rates.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
