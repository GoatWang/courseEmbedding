BattleFin Partnership Announcement







	BattleFin, LLC and EarlyIQ, Inc. Announce Partnership


	Newly created partnership delivers industry leading transparency in hedge fund market
SAN DIEGO, CA -- January 21, 2015 
Today, BattleFin, the original tournament platform for hedge fund competition, and EarlyIQ, Inc., a hosted information and analytics company serving early stage capital markets, announced their partnership to provide industry leading transparency and trust within the hedge fund market. Launching at the BattleFin Discovery Day in Miami, Florida on January 27, 2015, competing hedge funds and managers will have participated in the EarlyIQ diligence screening process and the resulting reports will be made available to all investors at the Discovery Day Event. This unique proactive approach helps promote transparency among the managers and investors.
"EarlyIQ gives me the comfort that when I invest in manager I know they have been carefully vetted.  ” said Tim Harrington, Co-Founder of BattleFin.  “Moreover, I gain deep visibility into the verified backgrounds of all the control persons involved in the fund, all in a simple online format. In the post Madoff era this is a necessity."
EarlyIQ due diligence reports deliver professional level insight into companies, hedge funds, and other entities that are seeking private capital, all in an efficient and easily understood format that makes the information accessible and meaningful to professional and non-professional investors. Moving far beyond simple "background checks" typically associated with due diligence, the EarlyIQ process is unique in that all parties to the investment relationship are involved in the process from beginning to end. The reports capture a thorough and verified picture into the company and management team.
"We haven't seen a more powerful sourcing engine for investment talent than the BattleFin global seeding tournaments and now their events like the BattleFin Discovery Day put investors and strategies together in one place” said Steve Yin, CEO of EarlyIQ. “We’re excited to be a partner in helping provide unique value in the hedge fund space.”
BattleFin’s Discovery Day, taking place January 27, 2015 at The Palms Hotel, Miami Beach, is a unique hedge fund industry event that matches early stage funds and managers with investors looking to get access to these early stage alpha generators.  The format of the event is 30 minute 1 on 1 meetings with managers looking to “Collect Capital and not business cards”.

    Predict short term movements in stock prices using news and sentiment data provided by RavenPack 


The Big Data Combine engineered by BattleFin are rapid fire, live tryouts for computer scientists with elite predictive analytic skills intent on monetizing their models. The first stage of the competition is a predictive modeling competition that requires participants to develop a model that predicts stock price movements using sentiment data provided by RavenPack. Traders, analysts and investors are always looking for techniques to better predict price movements.  Knowing whether a security will increase or decrease allows traders to make better investment decisions and manage risk more effectively. 
This competition is designed to identify people with the talent to create a predictive model using financial data. Competitors are given intraday trading data showing stock price movements at 5 minute intervals and asked to predict the change two hours in the future. The winners of the predictive modeling phase are invited to the "live" Big Data Combine tryouts in Miami, FL. Up to 12 finalists will be selected to compete in the live event in Miami. The lucky few will pitch their predictive model to expert judges and an engaged audience. They have only three minutes to present in non-technical terms three items: personal background, predictive model description, and how they would use there model to make money in finance. If their model and presentation impresses our judges, they will be eligible to work with BattleFin and Deltix to convert their predictive model into a trading strategy.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
