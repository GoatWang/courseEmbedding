										russell.huffer posted a topic in  General Discussion






			Can someone recommend an alternative to cubecart that will import my stock etc as I feel that cubecart has so lost it's way. I could not upgrade last time from 6.1.1 to 6.1.7 but was told 6.1.7 would fix this if I upgraded manually, now 6.1.8 out and I have the same problem, fed up with this now and would rather change to a working upgradable shop even if it means a monthly payment. The real problem with cubecart is that since it stopped charging there appears to be a big push on paying for some one to update your site and this problem feels very convenient. 
 


	Bored now and wish to leave.

			Only had 3 items in my store when updated, so added a dozen or so more yesterday no problem. Added one item this morning and it showed up in the shop but when clicked it just returned http500 error, reloaded and deleated reinstalled item but same problem.
 


	The fix in the end was to click force upgrade button.
 


	Hopefully just a one off.

			Have heard nothing back from this developer mentioned above, however I have managed to get access to cpanel so does this mean that I can now do my upgrade to fix my shop. I have read the instructions I understand upload all expanded files from zip and overwrite existing, the bit I find lacking is how to run setup do you click a file in the setup directory or what please could you explain that and I will give it a go.

			Thanks for your help, I understand what you say if I can get to 6.1.7 the bug is fixed but a correct fix would be to be able to click the update button not manually get to 6.1.7 to get the update button working again, as stated earlier the people writing the code broke the code but now it is my problem to get it fixed, which I find wrong, there should be a patch or something that can be run as admin for people like me. Not manually update requiring server access.

			I know that is what I have worked out. So basically this shop has a problem that the update button no longer works and if you have no server access you have no means of updating that is a very sad state of affairs and a massive backwards step, come on code writers this has been a known problem for a while I belive so when are you going to sort out the problem that you caused, it has become my problem but I have no means to fix it, so I need to rely on you.

How to solve this error



							
								
									
										russell.huffer posted a topic in  Technical Support






			Hi,
 


	 
 


	I can add and edit most products but if I put a lot of options ie colour choice has 37 colours available I can create the product but if I try to change anything at all I get the following
 


	Forbidden



	You don't have permission to access /admin.php on this server.
 


	Additionally, a 403 Forbidden error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.
 


	 
 


	 
 


	please could you explain what is wrong and how to fix, is version 5.16 I believe.
 


	 
 


	Kind regards

			So do I just click the upgrade button in maintenance sit back and watch it all happen or will I need to do something else and if I do click the button and it fails is it easy to get back to where I was before attempting upgrade.
 


	 
 


	Thanks

CTBUH 2009 Chicago Conference - Russell Huffer    .         .                                                                    .    .           .                     Russell Huffer Chairman and CEO of Viracon’s parent company, Apogee Enterprises “Envelope as Environmental Filter”  Many believe that the envelope of a tall building has a significant role to play in responding to climate change.  The tall building envelope certainly has a major influence on overall building performance, or sustainability, as well as its aesthetic or design appeal. In this presentation we hear from the CEO of one of the world’s largest suppliers of façade materials – Viracon – on what strategies can be developed with respect to envelope.        .                   .Biography       Russ Huffer was elected Apogee chairman in June 1999, in addition to having been elected president and chief executive officer (CEO) in January 1998. As chairman and CEO, he has repositioned Apogee for growth, exiting unprofitable businesses and developing growth strategies that focus on the company’s architectural glass products and services, and picture framing glass businesses. He also spearheaded the company’s successful adoption of the Six Sigma/Lean business improvement process that has reduced costs and improved operations. He joined Apogee in 1986 as vice president and general manager of Viracon, the leading fabricator of coated, high-performance architectural glass for global markets. In 1996, he was promoted to president of the Glass Technologies segment to further develop these glass coatings businesses into market leaders. Before joining Apogee, Russ spent six years in various management positions with Guardian Industries’ coatings, float glass and glass fabrication divisions. Previously, he spent two years as a senior designer at Ford Motor Company and seven years in the U.S. Air Force. He has worked directly on three patented low-emissivity (energy-efficient) glass coatings and developed reflective high-performance glass coatings, all for use on commercial buildings. Russ holds a bachelors degree from the U.S. Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado, and a masters degree from Troy University, Troy, Alabama. He is vice chairman of the board of directors of the Danny Thompson Memorial Golf Tournament; a member of the Southern Minnesota Leadership Circle; and a member of the board of directors of Hutchinson Technology Inc..
