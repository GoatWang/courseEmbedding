You should read the following discussion together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, as well as with the risk factors, financial statements, and related notes included thereto in our Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 and our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (the "Annual Report").  Forward Looking Statements  Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report, including in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1935. Forward-looking statements represent management's beliefs and assumptions based on currently available information. Forward-looking statements relate to matters such as our industry, business strategy, goals and expectations concerning our market position, future operations, margins, profitability, capital expenditures, liquidity and capital resources, commitments and contingencies, and other financial and operating information. We have used the words "anticipate," "assume," "believe," "budget," "continue," "could," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "potential," "predict," "project," "will," "future" and similar terms and phrases to identify forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations regarding future events, results, or outcomes. These expectations may or may not be realized. Some of these expectations may be based upon assumptions or judgments that prove to be incorrect. In addition, our business and operations involve numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could result in our expectations not being realized, or materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual events, results and outcomes may differ materially from our expectations due to a variety of factors. Although it is not possible to identify all of these factors, they include, among others, the following and the other factors described under the heading "Risk Factors" in the Annual Report and this Quarterly Report:  Risks Related to Our Business and Industry  ?  Risks Related to Our Refinery Operations Business Segment  ?  BLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY FORM 10-Q 9/30/16  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  ?  Risks Related to Our Pipelines and Oil and Gas Properties  ?  Any one of these factors or a combination of these factors could materially affect our future results of operations and could influence whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required to do so.  Overview  Blue Dolphin is primarily an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products. Our primary asset is a 15,000 bpd crude oil and condensate processing facility that is located in Nixon, Texas (the "Nixon Facility"). As part of our refinery business segment, we conduct petroleum storage and terminaling operations under third-party lease agreements at the Nixon Facility. We also own and operate pipeline assets. Information on or accessible through our website (http://www.blue-dolphin-energy.com) is not incorporated by reference in or otherwise made a part of this Quarterly Report.  Refinery Operations  The Nixon Facility is situated on approximately 56 acres in Nixon, Wilson County, Texas. The Nixon Facility consists of a distillation unit, naphtha stabilizer unit, depropanizer unit, and related loading and unloading facilities and utilities. As of September 30, 2016, the site contained approximately 842,000 bbls of crude oil, condensate, and refined petroleum product storage capacity. We are currently constructing an additional 256,000 bbls of petroleum storage capacity at the Nixon Facility. When construction is complete, total crude oil, condensate, and refined petroleum product storage capacity at the Nixon Facility will exceed 1,000,000 bbls.  With a current capacity of 15,000 bpd, the Nixon Facility is considered a "topping unit" because it is primarily comprised of a crude distillation unit, the first stage of the crude oil refining process. The Nixon Facility's current level of complexity allows us to refine crude oil and condensate into finished and intermediate petroleum products. Our refined petroleum products are primarily sold in the U.S. Jet fuel, our only finished product, is sold in nearby markets to wholesalers. Our intermediate products, including LPG, naphtha, HOBM, and AGO are primarily sold in nearby markets to wholesalers and refiners as a feedstock for further blending and processing. With the opening of the Mexican diesel market to private companies, we began exporting low sulfur diesel to Mexico during the second quarter of 2016.  BLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY FORM 10-Q 9/30/16  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  The Nixon Facility uses light crude oil and condensate sourced in the Eagle Ford Shale as feedstock. The following diagram reflects a high level overview of the current refining process at the Nixon Facility:  Pipeline Transportation  Our pipeline transportation operations involve the gathering and transportation of oil and natural gas for producers/shippers operating offshore in the vicinity of our pipelines, as well as leasehold interests in oil and natural gas properties, in the Gulf of Mexico. Our pipeline transportation operations represented less than 1% of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Structure and Management  We were formed as a Delaware corporation in 1986. We are currently controlled by Lazarus Energy Holdings, LLC ("LEH"), which owns approximately 81% of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock). LEH manages and operates all of our properties pursuant to an Operating Agreement (the "Operating Agreement"). Jonathan Carroll is Chairman of the Board of Directors (the "Board"), Chief Executive Officer and President of Blue Dolphin, as well as a majority owner of LEH. (See "Part I, Financial Information, Item 1. Financial Statements - Note (8) Related Party Transactions," "Note (9) Long-Term Debt, Net," and "Note (19) Commitments and Contingencies - Financing Agreements" for additional disclosures related to LEH, the Operating Agreement, and Jonathan Carroll.)  Our operations are conducted through the following active subsidiaries:  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  (See "Part I, Item 2. Properties" of the Annual Report for additional information regarding our operating subsidiaries.)  BLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY FORM 10-Q 9/30/16  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  Operating Risks  Execution of our business strategy depends on several factors, including adequate crude oil and condensate sourcing, levels of accounts receivable, refined petroleum product inventories, accounts payable, capital expenditures, and adequate access to credit on satisfactory terms. These factors may be impacted by general economic, political, financial, competitive, and other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business and operational strategy will achieve anticipated outcomes. Our operations, liquidity, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if: (i) our strategy is not successful, (ii) our working capital requirements are not funded through Operations Payments by GEL TEX Marketing, LLC ("GEL") under a Joint Marketing Agreement (the "Joint Marketing Agreement"), our profit share under the Joint Marketing Agreement, or certain advances from LEH, or (iii) we have future covenant violations under our loan agreements that are not waived.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had a net loss of $1,938,551 compared to net income of $1,264,233 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a net loss of $7,250,371 compared to net income of $5,103,476 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (current portion) of $1,677,485 and $4,160,999, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, we had current assets of $22,404,232 and current liabilities (including the current portion of long-term debt) of $59,754,725, reflecting a working capital deficit of $37,350,493. Excluding the current portion of long-term debt, we had a working capital deficit of $5,229,711 as of September 30, 2016. Non-payment of Operations Payments to us by GEL under the Joint Marketing Agreement resulting from a contract-related dispute between the parties contributed to the working capital deficit as of September 30, 2016.  As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (current portion) of $1,853,875 and $3,175,299, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had current assets of $19,629,841 and current liabilities (including the current portion of long-term debt) of $20,228,648, reflecting a working capital deficit of $598,807.  In addition to the Joint Marketing Agreement, we are party to a variety of contracts and agreements with Genesis and its affiliates that enable the purchase of crude oil and condensate, transportation of crude oil and condensate, and other services. Certain of these agreements with Genesis and its affiliates have successive one-year renewals until August 2019 unless sooner terminated by Genesis or its affiliates with 180 days' prior written notice. An adverse change in our relationship with Genesis could have a material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity, and financial condition. We are currently involved in a dispute with Genesis over certain contractual matters. (See "Part I. Financial Information, Item 1. Financial Statements - Note (19) Commitments and Contingencies - Genesis Agreements" and "Legal Matters," as well as "Part  As of September 30, 2016, we were in violation of certain financial covenants in secured loan agreements with Sovereign Bank ("Sovereign"). As a result of these covenant defaults, Sovereign could declare the amounts owed under these loan agreements immediately due and payable, exercise its rights with respect to collateral securing our obligations under these loan agreements, and/or exercise any other rights and remedies available. Sovereign waived the financial covenant defaults as of the quarter ended September 30, 2016. However, the debt associated with these loans was classified within the current portion of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet the financial covenants in the future. There can be no assurance that Sovereign will provide future waivers, which may have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. (See "Part I. Financial Information, Item 1. Financial Statements - Note (9) Long-Term Debt, Net and Note (20) Subsequent Events" for additional disclosures related to our long-term debt and financial covenant violations.)  BLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY FORM 10-Q 9/30/16  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  Major Influences on Results of Operations  Our earnings and cash flows from our refinery operations business segment are primarily affected by the relationship between refined petroleum product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. Crude oil refining is primarily a margin-based business, and in order to increase profitability, it is important for a refinery to maximize the yields of higher value finished and intermediate products and to minimize the costs of feedstock and operating expenses. Our cost to acquire crude oil and condensate and the price for which our refined petroleum products are ultimately sold depend on several factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil and refined petroleum products, which depend on changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, availability of and access to transportation infrastructure, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuel, and governmental regulations, among other factors.  Crude oil and refined petroleum product prices are also affected by other factors, such as local and general market conditions and the operating levels of competing refineries. Crude oil costs and the prices of refined petroleum products have historically been subject to wide fluctuations. An expansion or upgrade of our competitors' facilities, price volatility, international political and economic developments, and other factors beyond our control are likely to continue to play an important role in crude oil refining industry economics. Moreover, the refining industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for refined petroleum products, such as increases in the demand for gasoline during the summer driving season and for home heating oil during the winter. These factors can impact, among other things, the level of inventories in the market, resulting in price volatility and a negative impact on product margins. In addition to current market conditions, there are long-term factors that may impact the demand for refined petroleum products. These factors include mandated renewable fuels standards, proposed climate change laws and regulations, and increased mileage standards for vehicles.  Key Relationships  Relationship with LEH  We currently rely on Operations Payments and our profit share under the Joint Marketing Agreement and advances from LEH to fund our working capital requirements. If GEL does not advance Operations Payments and the profit share is insufficient to fund our working capital requirements, LEH may, but is not required to, fund our working capital requirements. There can be no assurances that LEH will continue to fund our working capital requirements.  LEH also manages and operates all of our properties pursuant to the Operating Agreement. For services rendered, LEH receives reimbursements and fees. (See "Part I, Financial Information, Item 1. Financial Statements - Note (8) Related Party Transactions" for additional disclosures related to LEH and the Operating Agreement.)  Relationship with Genesis  We are party to a variety of contracts and agreements with Genesis and its affiliates that enable the purchase of crude oil and condensate, transportation of crude oil and condensate, and other services. (See "Part I, Financial Information, Item 1. Financial Statements - Note (19) Commitments and Contingencies - Genesis Agreements" for a summary of these agreements.) We currently have a contract-related dispute with GEL related to these agreements. In connection with this dispute, GEL significantly under delivered crude oil and condensate to the Nixon Facility under the Crude Supply Agreement during the second quarter of 2016. This resulted in significant refinery downtime and a significant decrease in refinery throughput, refinery production, and refined petroleum product sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Although GEL resumed normal delivery of crude oil and condensate to the Nixon Facility in July 2016, the adverse change in our relationship with Genesis has had a material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity, and financial condition. In addition, the contract-related dispute has disrupted our normal business operations and diverted management's focus away from operations. (See "Part I. Financial Information, Item 1. Financial Statements - Note (19) Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Matters" and "Part II. Other Information, Item 1A. Risk Factors" for a discussion of the current contract-related dispute with Genesis.)  BLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY FORM 10-Q 9/30/16  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)  Results of Operations  We have two reportable business segments: (i) Refinery Operations and (ii) Pipeline Transportation. Business activities related to our Refinery Operations business segment are conducted at the Nixon Facility and represent approximately 99% of our operations. Business activities related to our Pipeline Transportation business segment are primarily conducted in the Gulf of Mexico through our pipeline assets and leasehold interests in oil and gas properties and represent less than 1% of our operations.
