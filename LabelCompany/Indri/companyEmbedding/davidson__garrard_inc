Davidson & Garrard is an independent, fee-only registered investment advisory firm with multiple offices located in the beautiful state of Virginia.







The Firm
The investment landscape has evolved dramatically over the past 27 years, and D&G has continued to evolve and keep pace. While maintaining its historic focus on carefully selected individual stocks and bonds, D&G has grown into a globally-oriented, multi-asset class manager.




The D&G Difference
In all that we do, the cornerstone principle we follow is to place the best interests of each client first. As an SEC Registered Investment Advisor, we take seriously our position as a fiduciary, bound legally and ethically to the highest standard of care, prudence and integrity in our work on behalf of our clients.




Our Services
A bewildering array of asset classes, conflicting and confusing advice, and reduced time confront today's investors as they seek to manage their financial assets and secure their financial futures. D&G seeks to address these challenges for its clients with a high-touch, personalized approach.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo
