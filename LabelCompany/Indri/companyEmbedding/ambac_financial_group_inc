Ambac Financial Group, Inc. ("Ambac"), headquartered in New York City, is a holding company whose subsidiaries, including its principal operating subsidiaries, Ambac Assurance Corporation ("AAC"), Everspan Financial Guarantee Corp. and Ambac Assurance UK Limited ("Ambac UK"), provide financial guarantees and other financial services to clients in both the public and private sectors globally. AAC, including the Segregated Account of AAC (in rehabilitation), is a guarantor of public finance and structured finance obligations.  Ambac's primary goal is to maximize stockholder value by executing the following key strategies: active runoff of AAC and its subsidiaries through transaction terminations, policy commutations, settlements and restructurings that we believe will improve our risk profile, and maximizing the risk-adjusted return on invested assets; loss recovery through litigation and exercise of contractual and legal rights; improved cost effectiveness and efficiency of the operating platform; rationalization of AAC's capital and liability structures, enabling simplification of corporate governance and facilitating the successful rehabilitation of the Segregated Account; and selective business transactions offering attractive risk adjusted returns that, among other things, may permit utilization of Ambac's tax net operating loss carry-forwards.  Ambac‘s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "AMBC".  The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Ambac contains substantial restrictions on the ability to transfer Ambac's common stock. Subject to limited exceptions, any attempted transfer of common stock shall be prohibited and void to the extent that, as a result of such transfer (or any series of transfers of which such transfer is a part), any person or group of persons shall become a holder of 5% or more of Ambac's common stock or a holder of 5% or more of Ambac's common stock increases its ownership interest.  Ambac is committed to providing timely and accurate information to the investing public, consistent with our legal and regulatory obligations. To that end, we use our website to convey information about our businesses, including the anticipated release of quarterly financial results, quarterly financial, statistical and business-related information, and the posting of updates to the status of certain primary residential mortgage backed securities litigations.

Ambac Emerges from Bankruptcy


            
                
NEW YORK, May 1, 2013  - Ambac Financial Group, Inc. (“Ambac” or the “Company”)  announced today the effectiveness of its Second Modified Fifth Amended Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”), which marks the completion of its financial restructuring and Ambac’s emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. “I would like thank all of those who dedicated so much time and effort, including our employees and advisors, in helping us complete our restructuring,” said Diana Adams, Ambac’s President and CEO. “This is an exciting day and the start of a new chapter for all of us at Ambac,” Ms. Adams added. “We emerge with a stronger balance sheet and a commitment to a successful future.  Looking forward, we expect to pursue a number of new initiatives and identify the best opportunities for Ambac and our stakeholders.”
Under the terms of the restructuring, all allowed claims of Ambac’s former creditors were discharged and such creditors received new common stock, and in certain instances, new warrants, issued by the reorganized company. Ambac’s new common stock and warrants are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbols AMBC and AMBCW, respectively.  All common stock of the Company in existence prior to Ambac’s emergence from bankruptcy has been cancelled.  Holders of such existing stock have not, and will not, receive distributions under the Plan.

(“Ambac”), headquartered in New York City, is a holding company whose subsidiaries, including its principal operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance Corporation (“Ambac Assurance”), Everspan Financial Guarantee Corporation, and Ambac Assurance UK Limited, provided financial guarantees and other financial services to clients in both the public and private sectors globally.

Credit rating[edit]
Ambac and other bond guarantors such as MBIA were hit hard by the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis and on January 18, 2008, its Fitch credit rating was lowered from AAA (the highest) to AA when its plans to raise two billion dollars in new capital failed.[4] Moody's and S&P, however, chose to affirm Ambac's AAA with their agencies after it succeeded in raising $1.5 billion in new capital in March 2008.[5] In early 2008, the spectre of the major bond guarantors failing to be able to pay off insurance claims on a trillion dollars of securities backed by sub-prime mortgages and other securitized debt led to attempts to shore them up with infusions of capital.[6] On June 19, 2008 Moody's downgraded Ambac's credit rating three notches to Aa3.[7]
Ambac's ratings continued to decline during 2008–2010. Moody's Investors Service lowered the rating of the senior unsecured debt of Ambac Financial Group Inc. (Ambac Financial) to C from Ca and placed the Caa2 insurance financial strength ratings (IFSR) of Ambac Assurance Corporation (AAC) on review for possible upgrade on 3/26/2010.[8] On March 25, 2010, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services revised its counterparty credit, financial strength and financial enhancement ratings on Ambac Assurance Corp. (Ambac) to 'R' from 'CC'.[9] An 'R' rating is a non-investment grade rating.[10] On June 8, 2010 Ambac announced that it would likely seek a pre-packaged bankruptcy as it was unable to pay dividends from its bond insurance unit to the holding company. Since that time Ambac has dropped appreciably in share price to approximately 0.50 per share as of the end of August 2010.[11]
Ambac missed an interest payment on its debt on November 1, 2010[12] and filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on November 8, 2010. [13][14]
Ambac exited Chapter 11 on May 1, 2013, issuing 45 million new common shares and approximately 5 million new warrants to holders of allowed claims. Nader Tavakoli, who later became Chief Executive Officer, was on Ambac’s Board of Directors during the time of the registration statement.
After serving as interim President and CEO, and then Executive Chairman in 2015, the Board formally appointed Tavakoli to the position of President and CEO in January 2016. Tavakoli helped lead a turnaround during his tenure that included "substantial progress" in areas such as "risk and loss analytics, operational efficiency, asset management, shareholder communication, and loss management, including our major loss recovery cases."[15]
Tavakoli was succeeded by current CEO Claude LeBlanc in 2017, who said upon assuming the role that "I look forward to working with Ambac's Board, talented management team, dedicated employees and primary regulator to continue executing the company's strategies to optimize assets and reduce liabilities, while maintaining a clear focus on risk and regulatory matters."[16]

Description




Ambac Financial Group, Inc. (Ambac) is a financial services holding company. The Company operates through two segments: Financial Guarantee and Financial Services. The Financial Guarantee segment includes insurance policies and credit derivative contracts. Its Financial Guarantee is conducted through its operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance Corporation and its subsidiary Ambac Assurance UK Limited. Financial Guarantee provides a guarantee that protects the holder of a debt obligation against non-payment when due. Financial Services provide financial and investment products, such as investment agreements, funding conduits and interest rate swaps, principally to the clients of its financial guarantee business. Its investment agreements are issued to structured finance and municipal issuers through its subsidiary, Ambac Capital Funding. Financial Services also maintain interest rate derivatives to mitigate exposure to floating rate insured obligations in the Financial Guarantee segment.

Ambac Financial Group, Inc. (Ambac), incorporated on April 29, 1991, is a financial services holding company. The Company operates through two segments: Financial Guarantee and Financial Services. The Financial Guarantee segment includes insurance policies and credit derivative contracts. The Financial Services business segment provides financial and investment products, including investment agreements, funding conduits and interest rate swaps, principally to the clients of its financial guarantee business. Its subsidiaries include Ambac Assurance Corporation (Ambac Assurance), Everspan Financial Guarantee Corp. and Ambac Assurance UK Limited (Ambac UK).Financial Guarantee BusinessAmbac's Financial Guarantee business segment is conducted through its primary operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance and its subsidiary Ambac UK. Insurance policies insured by Ambac Assurance and Ambac UK guarantee payment when due of the principal and interest on the obligations guaranteed. Ambac Assurance also has another financial guarantee subsidiary, Everspan Financial Guarantee Corp. The Financial Guarantee segment provides a guarantee, which protects the holder of a debt obligation against non-payment when due. Pursuant to such guarantees, Ambac Assurance and its subsidiaries make payments if the obligor responsible for making payments fails to do so when scheduled. The primary activities in the Company's derivative products business are to manage the runoff of derivatives with financial guarantee clients and to facilitate the mitigation of interest rate exposure for the Financial Guarantee segment through swaps and exchange traded the United States treasury futures.Financial Services BusinessThe Company's Financial Services business segment is conducted through subsidiaries of Ambac Assurance, which provide financial and investment products, including investment agreements, funding conduits and interest rate swaps, principally to the clients of its financial guarantee business. The Company's investment agreements are issued to structured finance and municipal issuers through its subsidiary, Ambac Capital Funding. Investment agreements are customized for each investor to provide guaranteed interest and return of principal in accordance with their requirements. Each investment agreement is insured by Ambac Assurance through a financial guarantee insurance policy.Ambac Assurance insures all of the obligations of its financial services subsidiaries. These businesses are in active runoff, which is being effectuated by transaction terminations, settlements and scheduled amortization of contracts. The Financial Services business also maintains interest rate derivatives to mitigate exposure to floating rate insured obligations in the Financial Guarantee segment. Derivative transactions are executed through Ambac Financial Services (AFS), a subsidiary of Ambac Assurance. The Company through its subsidiary AFS, provides interest rate swaps to states, municipalities and their authorities, asset-backed issuers and other entities in connection with their financings. AFS manages its interest rate swaps business with the goal of retaining some basis risk and excess interest rate sensitivity as an economic hedge against the effects of rising interest rates elsewhere in the Company, including on Ambac's financial guarantee exposures.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
