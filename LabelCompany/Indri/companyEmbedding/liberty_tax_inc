Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

A typical location in a strip mall in Hillsboro, Oregon


John Hewitt began his career at H&R Block as a tax preparer in 1969 and was later promoted to regional director of 250 offices. In 1982, he went on to found Jackson Hewitt Tax Service, which he grew to over 1,300 offices until it was sold for $483 million in 1997.[citation needed]
Awards[edit]
Entrepreneur magazine has ranked Liberty Tax Service on its “Franchise 500” list of best franchise opportunities since 1998. Liberty Tax Service is the only tax franchise on the Forbes magazine’s “Top 20 Franchises for the Buck.” (2012) [14] In July, 2011 Vetrepreneur magazine named Liberty Tax on its "Military Friendly" franchise list. In its Summer 2011 issue, Small Business Opportunities magazine ranked Liberty Tax one of the "75 Hot Franchises to Get into Now".[citation needed] In June, G.I. Jobs named Liberty Tax Service on its list of "Military Friendly" franchises.[citation needed]
Olive Tree Publishing, Inc., the publisher of the Black EOE Journal, the Hispanic Network Magazine, and the Professional Woman’s Magazine, announced that Liberty Tax Service has been recognized in their publications the past three years. Liberty Tax Service is the only tax service that was included on the list of "25 Top Franchises for Hispanics" in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011 published by Poder, formerly Hispanic Enterprise magazine.[citation needed]
Criticism and legal actions[edit]
Liberty tax has been the subject to criticism related to their business practices. Many of these have become the subject of legal actions by former franchise owners and some state attorneys general:

Liberty tax makes use of "sign wavers", people dressed in costume actively advertising for nearby franchises. They have come under criticism for violating zoning regulations,[15] disrupting traffic [16][17]
Liberty tax was sued by the State of California in 2009 for promising its customers speedy tax refunds while failing to disclose that they were actually taking out high-interest bank loans on their behalf subject to finance charges and debt collections, a state appeals court has ruled in upholding a $1.3 million judgment against the tax preparation firm.[18][19]
Liberty Tax franchises were the subject of a class action suit in South Carolina in 2011. The suit claims that the firm inflated business expenses and produced false information about charitable donations and that the Liberty Tax Service office they hired did not follow through with a guarantee to assist them during the audit process. The suit claims that Liberty Tax had a plan or a scheme to increase their profits by filing false, fraudulent or inappropriate forms.[20][21]
Liberty Tax has been accused of engaging in predatory lending targeted at low income and military families. The alleged abuses relate to what is known as refund anticipation loans (RAL). An RAL is a high interest rate short-term loan secured by a taxpayer's expected tax refund, and designed to offer customers quicker access to funds, rather than waiting for their tax refund from the IRS. The New York State Division of Human Rights in 2008 filed a complaint against Liberty Tax Service and others, seeking to limit the tax preparers' ability to market RALs.[citation needed] According to the DHR's court filings, military families and ethnic minority families have found themselves in deep debt having to use their tax-refund and savings just to keep up with interest payments that can balloon up to 700% annualized when they get RALs.[22]

Liberty Tax Service is an American company specializing in the preparation of tax returns for individuals and small businesses. It is the third largest tax preparation franchise in the United States. The company began in Canada in 1997 when John Hewitt, co-founder of Jackson Hewitt, acquired a Canadian tax franchisor, U&R Tax Depot. In 1998, the company became Liberty Tax Service and opened five offices in the United States.[1] Liberty Tax Service is the primary subsidiary of Liberty Tax, Inc., a NASDAQ-traded company.
Liberty Tax Service appeared on Forbes "Top 20 Franchises for the Buck" in 2012.[2] Liberty Tax Service is well known for its wavers, people in Statue of Liberty costumes and Uncle Sam costumes, used as a form of guerrilla marketing.[3][4][5][6][7] On October 28, 2011, a flash mob of costumed Lady Libertys danced in Times Square to promote Liberty Tax Service and celebrate the anniversary of the Statue of Liberty.[8][9]

A typical location in a strip mall in Hillsboro, Oregon


John Hewitt began his career at H&R Block as a tax preparer in 1969 and was later promoted to regional director of 250 offices. In 1982, he went on to found Jackson Hewitt Tax Service, which he grew to over 1,300 offices until it was sold for $483 million in 1997.[citation needed]
Awards[edit]
Entrepreneur magazine has ranked Liberty Tax Service on its “Franchise 500” list of best franchise opportunities since 1998. Liberty Tax Service is the only tax franchise on the Forbes magazine’s “Top 20 Franchises for the Buck.” (2012) [14] In July, 2011 Vetrepreneur magazine named Liberty Tax on its "Military Friendly" franchise list. In its Summer 2011 issue, Small Business Opportunities magazine ranked Liberty Tax one of the "75 Hot Franchises to Get into Now".[citation needed] In June, G.I. Jobs named Liberty Tax Service on its list of "Military Friendly" franchises.[citation needed]
Olive Tree Publishing, Inc., the publisher of the Black EOE Journal, the Hispanic Network Magazine, and the Professional Woman’s Magazine, announced that Liberty Tax Service has been recognized in their publications the past three years. Liberty Tax Service is the only tax service that was included on the list of "25 Top Franchises for Hispanics" in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011 published by Poder, formerly Hispanic Enterprise magazine.[citation needed]
Criticism and legal actions[edit]
Liberty tax has been the subject to criticism related to their business practices. Many of these have become the subject of legal actions by former franchise owners and some state attorneys general:

Liberty tax makes use of "sign wavers", people dressed in costume actively advertising for nearby franchises. They have come under criticism for violating zoning regulations,[15] disrupting traffic [16][17]
Liberty tax was sued by the State of California in 2009 for promising its customers speedy tax refunds while failing to disclose that they were actually taking out high-interest bank loans on their behalf subject to finance charges and debt collections, a state appeals court has ruled in upholding a $1.3 million judgment against the tax preparation firm.[18][19]
Liberty Tax franchises were the subject of a class action suit in South Carolina in 2011. The suit claims that the firm inflated business expenses and produced false information about charitable donations and that the Liberty Tax Service office they hired did not follow through with a guarantee to assist them during the audit process. The suit claims that Liberty Tax had a plan or a scheme to increase their profits by filing false, fraudulent or inappropriate forms.[20][21]
Liberty Tax has been accused of engaging in predatory lending targeted at low income and military families. The alleged abuses relate to what is known as refund anticipation loans (RAL). An RAL is a high interest rate short-term loan secured by a taxpayer's expected tax refund, and designed to offer customers quicker access to funds, rather than waiting for their tax refund from the IRS. The New York State Division of Human Rights in 2008 filed a complaint against Liberty Tax Service and others, seeking to limit the tax preparers' ability to market RALs.[citation needed] According to the DHR's court filings, military families and ethnic minority families have found themselves in deep debt having to use their tax-refund and savings just to keep up with interest payments that can balloon up to 700% annualized when they get RALs.[22]

LIBERTY TAX, INC. Company Profile

   Liberty Tax (formerly JTH Holding) wants to free you from those tax preparation shackles. It is the third-largest income tax preparation chain (behind H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt). Liberty Tax provides computerized tax preparation services through about 4,200 offices throughout the US and in Canada. More than 98% of the offices are operated by franchises and are easily recognized by the costumed Uncle Sams or Lady Libertys waving out front. The company's eSmart Tax product allows customers to file their taxes online. Liberty Tax also offers tax-preparation courses, refund loans, audit assistance, and related programs and services. CEO John Hewitt founded the company in 1997.

LIBERTY TAX, INC. Revenue and Financial Data

   Liberty Tax (formerly JTH Holding) wants to free you from those tax preparation shackles. It is the third-largest income tax preparation chain (behind H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt). Liberty Tax provides computerized tax preparation services through about 4,200 offices throughout the US and in Canada. More than 98% of the offices are operated by franchises and are easily recognized by the costumed Uncle Sams or Lady Libertys waving out front. The company's eSmart Tax product allows customers to file their taxes online. Liberty Tax also offers tax-preparation courses, refund loans, audit assistance, and related programs and services. CEO John Hewitt founded the company in 1997.

Bad News for Income-Seeking Investors

Liberty Tax Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 4.38% Yield (TAX)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

Liberty Tax is Now Oversold (TAX)
Legendary investor Warren Buffett advises to be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.

TAX: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released by the NASDAQ for the 12/31/2015 settlement date, and Liberty Tax Inc is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 8.95 "days to cover" versus the median component at 5.74. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.

We've served more than 1.4 million people all across America in need of relief from IRS back taxes. Below are comments from taxpayers who have been successful at putting stress and worry over IRS back taxes behind them.





...from the first phone call I felt so relieved. Their confidence of relieving from this IRS burden rubbed off on me. I was still scared and spent many sleepness nights worrying but contacting them was the best thing I could have done. I feel like a 100 pounds is off my shoulders so I want to thank Tax Defense. They even told me that I can always call them years from now if I have any questions or need advise and that is another reason why I would advise people to put their trust in them as I did... — Sherri
When you receive a letter in the mail that has IRS on it - you tend to lose a lot of sleep and sometimes don't even open the envelope! I've had that experience and after making contact with TDN, I have to tell you, I slept better. They certainly know how to work through the issues and tame the 900 pound gorilla! — Steve B.
I have to tell you that I was so nervous going through this process however [my tax specialist] walked me though the steps and explained everything in detail. She was able to have a tax levy on my wages released the same day we talked. Trust them they are the real thing. I can't thank you enough [my tax specialist]. — Joel P.

View Common Questions About Tax Relief


Q: Why would the IRS agree to settle back taxes for less?
A: There are a variety of reasons why the IRS agrees to work with taxpayers and settle for less. Often individuals or families are experiencing financial hardship, whether through loss of a job or income, illness, extenuating business or marital circumstances, or a number of other reasons. In addition, there may be "doubt as to collectability", "doubt as to liability", "innocent spouse" or a variety of other tax relief options or tax appeal provisions under the current tax code. In addition, the IRS may lower your tax liability because they feel you simply don't have the financial ability to pay the full amount owed within the statutory time period.
Q: How Can the IRS Fresh Start Initiative Provide Relief for Taxpayers?
A. The IRS Fresh Start program is an effort on the part of the IRS to make it easier for financially distressed taxpayers to resolve back taxes as quickly as possible.  Through a free tax relief consultation, taxpayers can find out if the leniency offered via Fresh Start can provide relief for IRS penalties, IRS liens, and also offer more streamlined processes for Installment Agreement and Offers in Compromise.
Q: What should you do if you've received a collection letter/notice from IRS?
A: Do not ignore IRS letters or enforcement notices. They may be auto-generated but, if ignored, they will lead to a wage garnishment, tax lien, bank account levy or other asset seizure or enforcement action. Stay in contact with the IRS and consider the advantages of a free tax relief consultation - speaking to tax relief specialists who can apprise you fully of your tax relief rights and options under the law and, at your request, negotiate directly with the IRS, to bring your case to a favorable resolution.
Q. How does a free tax relief consultation work?
A. As an individual or business, when you contact the IRS directly, you will likely be communicating with a frontline IRS collector whose task it is to collect on the total amount of tax liability assessed. Through a free tax relief consultation, you will have the opportunity to get a free and fair assessment from a tax relief specialist who can review with you all the circumstances surrounding the amount you owe the IRS, or the IRS claims you owe.  In addition, the tax resolution specialist can also take the time to listen to you, understand what you are going through, and review the options available to reach the best possible settlement with the IRS.
Q. What are some of the most common reasons why taxpayers may qualify for relief?
Many people owe the IRS back taxes for a variety of reasons, in many cases due to unforeseen circumstances beyond their control - including personal or financial hardship, business hardship, medical issues and more. In addition, taxpayers may not have been able to file back taxes for one or more years, or feel they have been unfairly assessed.  There also may be taxpayers who fall into the "currently not collectable" status because they simply cannot afford to pay the tax assessed. In many cases, taxpayers may qualify for relief via the IRS Fresh Start initiative.
Q: If I've fallen behind on my taxes and have the ability to pay the original amount but cannot afford to pay all the penalties and interest added on, can I pay the original amount?
A: Yes, you may qualify for a "Penalty Abatement" to remove penalties and interest. The IRS may waive penalties and interest for a variety of reasons including medical reasons, poor accounting advice, ignorance of the tax laws that apply, ex-spouse circumstances, the need to care and provide for a loved one, and more.
Q: Who can most benefit from tax relief assistance?
A: Typically, individuals and businesses who owe the IRS back taxes ranging from $10,000 to $250,000 or more can realize the greatest benefit from tax relief services.  Tax relief specialists and attorneys have a depth of knowledge and expertise and understand how to apply current tax relief code to reach the best possible tax resolution on behalf of taxpayers - including those who have not filed returns for one or multiple years for a variety of reasons. In addition, tax relief can help individuals or businesses in need of immediate relief to stop or prevent a wage garnishment, tax lien, or bank account levy.
Q: What are the benefits of a free tax relief consultation?
A: For individuals and businesses who owe back taxes to the IRS and have an urgent need to stop or prevent IRS enforcement action and settle IRS tax debt for substantially less than the full amount owed, a free tax relief consultation will provide an overview of the taxpayer's legal tax relief rights and options to resolve taxes and settle for less. All tax relief consultations come with no obligation and there is no charge to get an honest assessment of your current situation and the realistic IRS settlement options available to you.

We've served more than 1.4 million people all across America in need of relief from IRS back taxes. Below are comments from taxpayers who have been successful at putting stress and worry over IRS back taxes behind them.





...from the first phone call I felt so relieved. Their confidence of relieving from this IRS burden rubbed off on me. I was still scared and spent many sleepness nights worrying but contacting them was the best thing I could have done. I feel like a 100 pounds is off my shoulders so I want to thank Tax Defense. They even told me that I can always call them years from now if I have any questions or need advise and that is another reason why I would advise people to put their trust in them as I did... — Sherri
When you receive a letter in the mail that has IRS on it - you tend to lose a lot of sleep and sometimes don't even open the envelope! I've had that experience and after making contact with TDN, I have to tell you, I slept better. They certainly know how to work through the issues and tame the 900 pound gorilla! — Steve B.
I have to tell you that I was so nervous going through this process however [my tax specialist] walked me though the steps and explained everything in detail. She was able to have a tax levy on my wages released the same day we talked. Trust them they are the real thing. I can't thank you enough [my tax specialist]. — Joel P.








How It Works


Individuals or businesses in need of IRS relief from back taxes call or submit a request online to receive a free consultation from tax resolution experts.

Tax relief specialists take the time to listen, understand your current situation and goals (including any immediate relief you may need to stop or prevent a wage garnishment, tax lien, or bank levy.)

Based on your unique circumstances, tax resolution experts apply existing tax relief code to provide your best options to get immediate relief and reach the lowest possible settlement with the IRS.

You may choose to resolve IRS back taxes on your own, or utilize the expertise of tax specialists who will negotiate the best possible IRS resolution or settlement on your behalf. There are no upfront retainer fees and any fees that apply must be pre-approved by taxpayers in advance, based on the scope of services provided.

View Common Questions About Tax Relief


Q: Why would the IRS agree to settle back taxes for less?
A: There are a variety of reasons why the IRS agrees to work with taxpayers and settle for less. Often individuals or families are experiencing financial hardship, whether through loss of a job or income, illness, extenuating business or marital circumstances, or a number of other reasons. In addition, there may be "doubt as to collectability", "doubt as to liability", "innocent spouse" or a variety of other tax relief options or tax appeal provisions under the current tax code. In addition, the IRS may lower your tax liability because they feel you simply don't have the financial ability to pay the full amount owed within the statutory time period.
Q: How Can the IRS Fresh Start Initiative Provide Relief for Taxpayers?
A. The IRS Fresh Start program is an effort on the part of the IRS to make it easier for financially distressed taxpayers to resolve back taxes as quickly as possible.  Through a free tax relief consultation, taxpayers can find out if the leniency offered via Fresh Start can provide relief for IRS penalties, IRS liens, and also offer more streamlined processes for Installment Agreement and Offers in Compromise.
Q: What should you do if you've received a collection letter/notice from IRS?
A: Do not ignore IRS letters or enforcement notices. They may be auto-generated but, if ignored, they will lead to a wage garnishment, tax lien, bank account levy or other asset seizure or enforcement action. Stay in contact with the IRS and consider the advantages of a free tax relief consultation - speaking to tax relief specialists who can apprise you fully of your tax relief rights and options under the law and, at your request, negotiate directly with the IRS, to bring your case to a favorable resolution.
Q. How does a free tax relief consultation work?
A. As an individual or business, when you contact the IRS directly, you will likely be communicating with a frontline IRS collector whose task it is to collect on the total amount of tax liability assessed. Through a free tax relief consultation, you will have the opportunity to get a free and fair assessment from a tax relief specialist who can review with you all the circumstances surrounding the amount you owe the IRS, or the IRS claims you owe.  In addition, the tax resolution specialist can also take the time to listen to you, understand what you are going through, and review the options available to reach the best possible settlement with the IRS.
Q. What are some of the most common reasons why taxpayers may qualify for relief?
Many people owe the IRS back taxes for a variety of reasons, in many cases due to unforeseen circumstances beyond their control - including personal or financial hardship, business hardship, medical issues and more. In addition, taxpayers may not have been able to file back taxes for one or more years, or feel they have been unfairly assessed.  There also may be taxpayers who fall into the "currently not collectable" status because they simply cannot afford to pay the tax assessed. In many cases, taxpayers may qualify for relief via the IRS Fresh Start initiative.
Q: If I've fallen behind on my taxes and have the ability to pay the original amount but cannot afford to pay all the penalties and interest added on, can I pay the original amount?
A: Yes, you may qualify for a "Penalty Abatement" to remove penalties and interest. The IRS may waive penalties and interest for a variety of reasons including medical reasons, poor accounting advice, ignorance of the tax laws that apply, ex-spouse circumstances, the need to care and provide for a loved one, and more.
Q: Who can most benefit from tax relief assistance?
A: Typically, individuals and businesses who owe the IRS back taxes ranging from $10,000 to $250,000 or more can realize the greatest benefit from tax relief services.  Tax relief specialists and attorneys have a depth of knowledge and expertise and understand how to apply current tax relief code to reach the best possible tax resolution on behalf of taxpayers - including those who have not filed returns for one or multiple years for a variety of reasons. In addition, tax relief can help individuals or businesses in need of immediate relief to stop or prevent a wage garnishment, tax lien, or bank account levy.
Q: What are the benefits of a free tax relief consultation?
A: For individuals and businesses who owe back taxes to the IRS and have an urgent need to stop or prevent IRS enforcement action and settle IRS tax debt for substantially less than the full amount owed, a free tax relief consultation will provide an overview of the taxpayer's legal tax relief rights and options to resolve taxes and settle for less. All tax relief consultations come with no obligation and there is no charge to get an honest assessment of your current situation and the realistic IRS settlement options available to you.

 “It's really been an easy process”

Listen to Richard: 



 “They just do what they know best”

Listen to Paul: 



 “You guys have been great”
