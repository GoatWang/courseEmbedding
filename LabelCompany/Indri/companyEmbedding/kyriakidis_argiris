My husband and I were very excited to try this product, but unfortunately we didn't receive what we expected. I'm very upset because we were looking forward to trying it all day. It ended up being a sticky mess instead.

FAQs 




Q
 Are lubricants safe to use with condoms?


A
K-Y® Jelly, Liquid, LOVE Sensuality, Warming Jelly, and Warming Liquid are all compatible with latex condoms. K-Y® Intense is compatible with both latex and polyisoprene condoms. K-Y® True Feel and K-Y® Liquibeads are both compatible with latex, polyisoprene and polyurethane condoms. K-Y® LOVE Passion, Touch, Ultragel and Yours+Mine are not condom compatible.






Q
 Can you use lubricants with a massager?


A
Many people find using lubricants with a massager to be a revelation. It lets the massager glide over the body - easily giving an intense feeling. KY® Jelly™, Yours +Mine™ and Warming Jelly™ lubricants are safe to use with all K-Y massagers and wash off with water.






Q
 How do I apply lubricant and how much do I need?


A
There are really no rules here. The best thing to do is just relax, enjoy and experiment. If trying it for the first time, simply squeeze a little lubricant onto your fingertips and gently apply to your intimate areas. Lubricant can be used with or without a condom, either when it is already on or before. Take care not to use too much before you put the condom on, otherwise it may slip off during sex. You can always apply more if you need it.






Q
 If a woman doesn't produce the right amount of lubrication does it mean that she's not turned on?


A
No. There are lots of reasons why a woman might experience dryness including stress, after having a baby, using tampons, and changes in hormone levels.






Q
 Where on the body can lubes be used?


A
 KY lubes are safe to use all over the body.






Q
 Why should I use lubricants?


A
Lubricants can be used to enhance sensation, add a bit of fun or just top up natural levels of lubrication. KY lubricants have been specially designed to give you more comfort and help enjoy your intimate moments.

Beyond Intercourse: A Recipe for Her Orgasm



Featured







When it comes to the female orgasm; women want them, men want to provide them and yet surprisingly, few are sure on how to achieve them. Although technique is part of it, there are many other factors that come into play when it comes to achieving an orgasm. Find out how you and your partner can get the most out of your intimate moments, as you both relax and ease your way into orgasmic bliss.  It all starts with pre-sex:Contrary to popular belief, the female orgasm isn’t mechanical, able to be programmed at the drop of a dime. While sex for men are usually able to disassociate sexual desires from their feelings, whereas most women are more likely to be aroused by her partner’s desire for her, surroundings, and a relaxing atmosphere that encourages affection.  For most women, feeling wanted and appreciated by their partners can have a positive reaction on their sex life and allow them to become more respondent to their partner’s advances. Some experts also suggest that the pre-sex preparation can begin long before the clothes come off. Taking her on a date, cooking her dinner, or helping her around the house for example all help her unwind and feel cared for, which will then spill over in to the bedroom. Think of it as ‘subconscious foreplay’. Add foreplayMany women like much longer foreplay than their partners realize. This may, therefore, be linked to a subconscious feeling by the woman that she wants to feel affection and pleasure by her partner, rather than just feeling that he is in a hurry to reach his own climax. Women like to experience different things when it comes to foreplay, so try to mix it up with your partner, and don’t be afraid to ask her what she wants and what feels good for her. Many studies suggest that oral sex is the most effective for women to climax, so perhaps start with your fingers and then move down with your lips the closer you think she is getting to orgasm. Do try other things too if oral sex doesn’t do it for her. Gently touching and kissing all the female erogenous zones – legs, breasts, neck and ears – can really heat things up too. Be sensitive and responsive when you get a good reaction to something - keep going. Go Longer According to the Kinsey Institute, while 85% of men believe that their partners had an orgasm during their last sexual encounter, only 64% women reported actually experiencing one. To combat this, when you are having sex, opt for positions that are less stimulating for him and more effective for her. Spooning, for example, is a very romantic position, meaning that the woman can feel her partner’s arms around her, feeling safe and comfortable, which should help her relax into it and bring her closer to orgasm. This position also has a far gentler pace and shallower penetration, than say the missionary, which means he is less likely to get aroused too quickly – so will hopefully be more in sync with her. In addition to incorporating sex positions that help focus on slowing things down, add K-Y Duration™ lubricant to help prolong the time until ejaculation while giving you the control to stay in the moment longer. Mix it upA lot of couples tend to have the same routine when it comes to foreplay and sex, therefore, sometimes orgasms are harder to achieve as the woman generally knows what’s going to happen next. If, however, you try to vary from your routine, perhaps trying a new position or introducing a sex toy, then both partners will feel a heightened sense of excitement, thus making climax easier. Also, switching the location of your embrace can be helpful too - if you normally only have sex in the bedroom, try moving to the kitchen or the bathroom for a change and enjoy the sensation of doing something a little different together.



 

















Sexual Performance Anxiety: How to Overcome in the Bedroom



Featured







Sexual performance anxiety affects almost all men at some point in their sex lives; however, that should come as no surprise. For most, sex is both an emotional and physical act. However, stress on the body can heavily impact the way the body responds to intimacy. With the help of 5 tips, you can learn how to reduce performance anxieties for a calmer, more fulfilling sex life. Stop thinking of sex as a ‘performance’Some men view sex as a demonstration of their manhood - they think it's all about how ‘big’ they should be and how well they perform. This preoccupation with performance can be a problem when it comes to anxiety. Rather than a romantic encounter, sex becomes goal orientated. By changing the psyche, you can improve the situation and reduce the need to panic. Sex should be based on connecting with your partner and providing an atmosphere where you two can physically and mentally connect. Address any anxietiesWhen experiencing anxiety, the body goes into a heightened state of alert- causing difficulty for your partner to maintain an erection. However, sexual anxiety can be addressed through a number of relaxation techniques. Whether you decide to partake in regular workouts or want to improve your breathing through yoga; these activities can help decrease blood pressure and muscle tension in the body, making for a better and more improved performance in the bedroom. CommunicationCommunication is vital in any relationship, but all the more so to address sexual anxieties. Talking with your partner can improve your connection while allowing you both the opportunity to discuss your fears and concerns. Don't be afraid to reveal your desires and fantasies, while remaining open to your partner's feedback and suggestions. Being clear on what you both need, want and expect can prevent you from making it a bigger issue than it needs to be. Clear your mindSex is undoubtedly important in a loving relationship; however, worrying or over thinking about outside problems can inhibit your performance. Instead, focus on kissing, cuddling, and holding your partner. By relaxing and staying in the moment, you are able to enjoy each more making it a more pleasurable experience. For a better time with your partner; let sex happen spontaneously, preferably without any forward planning as this can help clear your mind and increase passion. K-Y ® Duration  is another great addition to add to your bedroom routine for a longer, more pleasurable connection with your partner.  Lifestyle changesCertain lifestyle changes can help to address anxiety issues. For example, eating a balanced diet, getting more sleep, and partaking in regular exercise, can help to combat sexual concerns. However, the abuse of drugs and alcohol can also have long-term detrimental physiological impacts on performance and should be avoided. For some, these can be a short term fix for relaxation; but over time, they can in fact lead to greater anxiety and further complicate problems. By eliminating these substances, it can help improve your general health for a more substantial and better sex life.



 

















5 Ways to Get More Sleep 



Featured







Researchers have uncovered that inefficient sleep quantity is associated with increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. To help maximize the amount of sleep you get each night, incorporate a healthy sleep routine. This can make the difference between a restlessness night and a peaceful slumber. Here are 5 simple tips to get the most out of your sleep routine. Remove any distractionsA study published in the journal Nature revealed that artificial blue light emitted from electronic devices such as your smart phone or tablet can activate neurons within the brain that can prevent you from feeling tired. Light can trigger an increase in heart rate, body temperature and brain activity level; therefore, blue light that is emitted by electronic gadgets can disrupt your melatonin levels. To get the most restful sleep, shut off your devices an hour before sleep. If you are not tired or struggle with sleeping, read a book or spend time with your partner. Avoid caffeineWhile caffeine cannot replace sleep, it can temporarily make one feel more alert by blocking sleep-inducing chemicals in the brain and increasing adrenaline production. Most people consume coffee or soda during the day, and caffeine can stay in the body for several hours, long after a drink was had. Therefore, it is best to limit the amount of caffeine you drink for a minimum of six hours prior to bedtime. Create a sleep-inducing environmentIf you toss and turn most nights, a dark, quiet, and cool environment can help improve sleep. Any source of light, be it an overhead lamp or something as small as a digital clock, can inhibit the secretion of melatonin, which is the hormone that promotes sleep. Your body temperature naturally drops while you sleep, so cooling down your bedroom can help speed up the process and allow you to doze off quicker. However, as your body transitions through different stages of sleep, any unexpected noise can disrupt your sleep causing you to have more shallow cycles. To prevent this, limit any outside noises by playing soft, calming music. Have a patternKeep your mealtime and bedtime consistent even on the weekends as your body establishes a routine. Whether it’s getting to bed at 10 PM or listening to relaxing music before you fall asleep, keeping a regular schedule not only increases the amount of sleep you can receive each night, it can also improve the quality, ensuring you feel alert and refreshed the next morning. Become more activeExercising three times a week for 20-30 minutes can have a noticeable impact on the quality of your sleep while also improving your overall fitness. Exercise is a great way to get your heart pumping while arousing the nervous system to help achieve and maintain sleep. However, try to avoid strenuous exercise in the evening and before bedtime as this can disrupt your sleep.
