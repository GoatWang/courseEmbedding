EnXnet, Inc












EnXnet Moving Forward with Thermal Air Control
System
 
Tulsa, OK, October 20, 2011 EnXnet, Inc. (OTC Symbol:�
EXNT) (German WKN# A0HMDW) is pleased to announce major strides have
been made to move into the final production proto-type of our Green
Environmentally Safe Thermal Air Control System (Tac
Unit) with major improvements.
 
Since September 6, 2011 available
funds have provided for modifications to the patented system moving us forward
very quickly and successfully.� The goal
is to improve the efficiency and durability of the system, as the focused use
is in the trucking industry.� Specialized
integrated components internal in the system are interfaced with a highly
conductive metallic material thus converting this energy to a usable thermal
heat or cooling source.� This energy,
heat or cooling, is then transported using a specially designed thermal
conductive fluid base.� We have named
this conversion process Thermalation�.� The
conversion process of electrical power to thermal energy is a completely
Environmentally Safe process requiring no CFC�s or Freon based refrigerants.
 
With the upgrades, Shore
Power becomes an available option which will give the trucker the use of AC
power where it�s available.� The regular
power comes from a 12 Volt auxiliary system that is recharged by the trucks
alternator with no concern for main batteries to be affected by our system.
 
The cost of idling adds not
only to the cost of fuel but added repair costs in the operating expenses of a
trucking company.� New and stronger laws
require truckers to get at least 10 hours of down time a day.� With the Tac Unit,
they won�t have to idle their truck during this time saving them money and
protecting our Environment at the same time. 
 
This release may include
forward-looking statements from the company that may or may not
materialize.  Additional information on factors that could potentially
affect the company�s financial results may be found in the company�s filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

					Full Description



EnXnet, Inc., incorporated on March 30, 1999, is a natural gas and petroleum exploitation, development and production company engaged in locating and developing hydrocarbon resources, primarily in the Rocky Mountain region. The Company's principal business is the acquisition of leasehold interests in petroleum and natural gas rights, either directly or indirectly, and the exploitation and development of properties subject to these leases. The Company has leased property in Colorado and is searching for additional opportunities in the natural gas and petroleum industry. The Company has leased a total of over 4,250 acres of mineral rights in Colorado. The Company has no revenues from its operations.The Company is engaged in the development, marketing and licensing of technologies and business strategies and practices. It is primarily focusing on products, solutions and services that support and enhance environmental products and multimedia management. Its legacy products include Thermal Air Control (TAC) Unit, ThinDisc, Tap'n Go II and Disc Security Tag (DSTag). The TAC Unit provides air conditioning and heating for semi-truck cabs. The TAC Unit uses approximately 12 volt technology and is operated from the truck's auxiliary batteries. The batteries are recharged by the truck's alternator while running. With the TAC Unit, a truck can remain parked with the motor off and maintain an environment for the driver while burning no diesel fuel for over 10 hours on the auxiliary battery system.The Company's Thin Disc is its optical disc having a reduced planar thickness. Thin Disc's primary function is to make any size optical disc thinner with reading solution in players that play optical disc media. Its DSTag utilizes electronic article surveillance (EAS) tags that are embedded or adhered to a digital versatile disc (DVD) or compact disc (CD) during the injection mold phase of the manufacturing process. Additionally, it can give content developers, manufacturers and distributors the ability to protect their investment by providing a means to authenticate legitimate products over counterfeit products produced by unauthorized manufacturers.

EnXnet's Emerging Technology Solves Privacy Concerns






April 15, 2004 06:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



				TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 15, 2004--EnXnet, Inc. (OTCBB:EXNT) announces that it has filed its latest patent application for a new Radio Frequency Identification Deactivation Device (RFID).  RFID devices are currently used to provide accurate tracking and detection of products from the point of manufacture to their delivery to the retailer, thus providing manufacturers, distributors and marketers an accurate, inexpensive and rapid method of tracking inventory and an effective piracy and theft deterrent. 

 EnXnet's emerging technology provides the solution to the personal privacy concerns of the ACLU and other personal privacy advocates to the widespread application of RFID Electronic Article Surveillance devices by its internal design and construction which causes permanent deactivation of the RFID at the point of sale.  "This exciting new technology offers everyone in the product chain, from manufacturer to end user, assurance of product quality and integrity while protecting them from any invasion of privacy issues," said Ryan Corley, President of EnXnet, Inc. "We anticipate that the consumer product industries, from manufacturer to marketer, should be very receptive to this new invention."  Almost every retail store in the United States, and many worldwide, has one or more EAS systems already in place, therefore nominal additional expense and limited personnel training is incurred by the retail stores in order for the new device to work efficiently in their establishments. The inclusion of EnXnet's revolutionary RFID technology will allow tracking and inventory control from the point of manufacture to the final retail sale of the product.  RFID devices can hold a significant amount of information including, but not limited to, date of manufacture, lot number, plant ID, unique security codes, date of shipment, and other pertinent information. When triggered by a remote electronic signal the device transmits this data to an appropriate receiver. These signals can be read at a reasonable distance and can penetrate a shipping container or trailer, thus allowing the operator to take a complete inventory of the container without opening the doors. This allows verification and authentication of the container's contents very rapidly and inexpensively.  Many marketers, including some of the largest in the world, would like to incorporate the RFID devices into the final consumer packaging to reap all of the obvious benefits thereof.  Currently most RFID tags are used on shipping containers, pallets, cases and multiple unit cartons rather than on individual product packaging. This is mainly because a major problem arises when an RFID device is attached or implanted in a consumer product after purchase by a consumer at the point of sale. Left activated, the RFID device allows for tracking of the product right into the consumer's home or place of business, obviously an invasion of personal privacy. It is this factor that has the ACLU and other personal privacy advocates complaining. While a number of efforts have been made to solve this problem, none have been successful to date.  EnXnet's new technology solves this problem cheaply and efficiently.  "The Company anticipates that licensing fees from manufacturers should grow rapidly as the new technology takes hold in the marketplace," Mark Pempsell, Director of Marketing for EnXnet, Inc. acknowledged. "Of great importance is the fact that our technology can replace current tagging methods at little or no increase in cost to the manufacturer while greatly improving inventory control and theft prevention."  This release may include forward-looking statements from the company that may or may not materialize. Additional information on factors that could potentially affect the company's financial results may be found in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
