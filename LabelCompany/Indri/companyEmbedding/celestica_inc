History[edit]
Origins[edit]
Celestica's Toronto headquarters were originally the location of IBM's Toronto sales and support offices, which also supported a small manufacturing unit which built metal boxes for their mainframe computers and associated support systems. Eugene Polistuk, a graduate of the University of Toronto in 1969,[3] joined IBM and rose through the ranks before taking over the Toronto manufacturing division in 1986.[4]
As the world turned from mainframes to microcomputers, Polistuk's operations were forced to reduce headcount in 1986 and 1988. In response, Polistuk started to diversify the plant's product lines, building circuit boards, memory products and power supplies that could be used in a wide variety of IBM products. The $300 million investment was successful, and by 1993 most IBM divisions were buying some of the systems produced in Toronto. The factory site expanded several times.[4]
Spin-off[edit]
As IBM transitioned from a hardware company to a software and services company, the future of the manufacturing unit was in doubt despite its financial successes. In 1992 Polistuk suggested that the entire division be spun off into a separate company that would offer their services to anyone. His arguments slowly won over IBM's management, and in January 1994, Celestica was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM Canada.[4] IBM's other divisions at the location moved to new buildings in Markham.
Polistuk immediately invoked changes in order to break out of what he saw as a moribund management structure left over from the IBM days. An early move was to institute a 5% pay cut in exchange for a profit sharing program that could reap up to 30% of base pay.[4] Another move was to make the same share offerings to everyone in the company, breaking with conventional options plans that offer the best prices to executives.[3]
By the end of Celestica's first year of operations, they had signed up 40 new customers. Non-IBM customers had originally accounted for only 10% of their output, but was now standing at 30% and growing. This process was helped as major players in the computer industry started the process of outsourcing their own production systems. However, Polistuk felt that the only way to truly reach their potential was to have someone buy the company from IBM.[4]
Onex purchase[edit]
In May 1994, Polistuk met with Anthony Melman of Onex Corporation about a potential buy-out. IBM was not interested in selling, however, as the division was one of the most profitable sections of their Canadian operations. However, after continued agitation, in 1996 IBM Canada agreed to sell the business and hired Nesbitt Burns to find potential buyers. After a selection process, five were allowed to review Celestica's books. Onex's bid of $750 million for 69% of the company won the final selection in October 1996.[4]
This triggered rapid expansion at Celestica. In 1997 they bought UK-based Design to Distribution, the manufacturing division of International Computers Limited which itself was part-owned by Fujitsu. Later that year they purchased major portions of Hewlett-Packard's manufacturing lines, including their PC board plant in Fort Collins, CO, their system assembly plant in New Hampshire, and their system design shop in Chelmsford, MA. In October they bought Ascent Power Technology, who had power supply manufacturing in Canada, the US and UK.[4]
By the end of the year, only 25% of its business came from IBM.
Going public[edit]
In July 1998 Onex took the company public, raising $414 million, the largest IPO in the EMS field. This infusion of capital sparked another round of growth, and during the year the company bought International Manufacturing Services in Asia, and added factories in northern California, Mexico, and Ireland. By the end of the year, the company was turning over $3.2 billion annually.[4]
By 1998 the global EMS market was estimated to be around $60 billion, with projections that it would be over $150 billion 2003. Polistuk considered this to be conservative, noting "By 2001, to be among the largest contract manufacturers in this business, you'll need $10 billion in annual revenues. Just five years ago, nobody would have thought there would be a $10 billion EMS, but soon that is going to be the minimum to be a Tier 1 company."[5]
Several additional stock offerings were made from the original Onex pool; $251 million in March 1999 and $225 million in May. A second public offering in November added $488 million. The money was used to fund more purchases, adding five factories in the Czech Republic, two in Italy and another each in Ireland, the US, Brazil and Malaysia. By the end of the year they had a turnover of $5.3 billion, making them the third largest EMS in the world. On 6 June 2001, Polistuk was appointed Chairman of the Board.[6]
Crash[edit]
The dot-com crash and telecoms crash in 2001 led to a worldwide drying-up of EMS work. In April 2001 the company announced it was laying off 3,000 people, about 10% of its workforce.[7] The company later announced that Polistuk would be taking a 1/3 pay cut as part of a wider series of compensation rollbacks.[8]
Several rounds of lowered guidance followed, in spite of new supplier contracts and continued acquisitions. Losses mounted, and on 29 January 2004, the company announced that Polistuk would be retiring. In April, Stephen Delaney took over the CEO position.[9] A second round of layoffs followed in 2005, along with the sale of several divisions. Operations stabilized, along with the rest of the market, through 2008.
Operations[edit]
Celestica’s global manufacturing network comprises over 20 locations in the Americas, Europe and Asia.
Controversy[edit]
On Friday, 12 January 2007 a shareholder class action suit was filed in New York against Celestica and members of the company’s executive team. The complaint alleges that the company made materially false and misleading statements about the business and failed to disclose adverse facts, namely:

(i) that the Company was experiencing declining demand in its Mexican operations and that the division was carrying significant amounts of unneeded inventory which would have to be written off;
(ii) that the Company was experiencing declining demand in its Information Technology (IT) and Communications market segments as its larger customers scaled back purchases; and that the stock dropped when this information later became public.

This class action suit was dismissed in 2010.[10]

History[edit]
Origins[edit]
Celestica's Toronto headquarters were originally the location of IBM's Toronto sales and support offices, which also supported a small manufacturing unit which built metal boxes for their mainframe computers and associated support systems. Eugene Polistuk, a graduate of the University of Toronto in 1969,[3] joined IBM and rose through the ranks before taking over the Toronto manufacturing division in 1986.[4]
As the world turned from mainframes to microcomputers, Polistuk's operations were forced to reduce headcount in 1986 and 1988. In response, Polistuk started to diversify the plant's product lines, building circuit boards, memory products and power supplies that could be used in a wide variety of IBM products. The $300 million investment was successful, and by 1993 most IBM divisions were buying some of the systems produced in Toronto. The factory site expanded several times.[4]
Spin-off[edit]
As IBM transitioned from a hardware company to a software and services company, the future of the manufacturing unit was in doubt despite its financial successes. In 1992 Polistuk suggested that the entire division be spun off into a separate company that would offer their services to anyone. His arguments slowly won over IBM's management, and in January 1994, Celestica was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM Canada.[4] IBM's other divisions at the location moved to new buildings in Markham.
Polistuk immediately invoked changes in order to break out of what he saw as a moribund management structure left over from the IBM days. An early move was to institute a 5% pay cut in exchange for a profit sharing program that could reap up to 30% of base pay.[4] Another move was to make the same share offerings to everyone in the company, breaking with conventional options plans that offer the best prices to executives.[3]
By the end of Celestica's first year of operations, they had signed up 40 new customers. Non-IBM customers had originally accounted for only 10% of their output, but was now standing at 30% and growing. This process was helped as major players in the computer industry started the process of outsourcing their own production systems. However, Polistuk felt that the only way to truly reach their potential was to have someone buy the company from IBM.[4]
Onex purchase[edit]
In May 1994, Polistuk met with Anthony Melman of Onex Corporation about a potential buy-out. IBM was not interested in selling, however, as the division was one of the most profitable sections of their Canadian operations. However, after continued agitation, in 1996 IBM Canada agreed to sell the business and hired Nesbitt Burns to find potential buyers. After a selection process, five were allowed to review Celestica's books. Onex's bid of $750 million for 69% of the company won the final selection in October 1996.[4]
This triggered rapid expansion at Celestica. In 1997 they bought UK-based Design to Distribution, the manufacturing division of International Computers Limited which itself was part-owned by Fujitsu. Later that year they purchased major portions of Hewlett-Packard's manufacturing lines, including their PC board plant in Fort Collins, CO, their system assembly plant in New Hampshire, and their system design shop in Chelmsford, MA. In October they bought Ascent Power Technology, who had power supply manufacturing in Canada, the US and UK.[4]
By the end of the year, only 25% of its business came from IBM.
Going public[edit]
In July 1998 Onex took the company public, raising $414 million, the largest IPO in the EMS field. This infusion of capital sparked another round of growth, and during the year the company bought International Manufacturing Services in Asia, and added factories in northern California, Mexico, and Ireland. By the end of the year, the company was turning over $3.2 billion annually.[4]
By 1998 the global EMS market was estimated to be around $60 billion, with projections that it would be over $150 billion 2003. Polistuk considered this to be conservative, noting "By 2001, to be among the largest contract manufacturers in this business, you'll need $10 billion in annual revenues. Just five years ago, nobody would have thought there would be a $10 billion EMS, but soon that is going to be the minimum to be a Tier 1 company."[5]
Several additional stock offerings were made from the original Onex pool; $251 million in March 1999 and $225 million in May. A second public offering in November added $488 million. The money was used to fund more purchases, adding five factories in the Czech Republic, two in Italy and another each in Ireland, the US, Brazil and Malaysia. By the end of the year they had a turnover of $5.3 billion, making them the third largest EMS in the world. On 6 June 2001, Polistuk was appointed Chairman of the Board.[6]
Crash[edit]
The dot-com crash and telecoms crash in 2001 led to a worldwide drying-up of EMS work. In April 2001 the company announced it was laying off 3,000 people, about 10% of its workforce.[7] The company later announced that Polistuk would be taking a 1/3 pay cut as part of a wider series of compensation rollbacks.[8]
Several rounds of lowered guidance followed, in spite of new supplier contracts and continued acquisitions. Losses mounted, and on 29 January 2004, the company announced that Polistuk would be retiring. In April, Stephen Delaney took over the CEO position.[9] A second round of layoffs followed in 2005, along with the sale of several divisions. Operations stabilized, along with the rest of the market, through 2008.
Operations[edit]
Celestica’s global manufacturing network comprises over 20 locations in the Americas, Europe and Asia.
Controversy[edit]
On Friday, 12 January 2007 a shareholder class action suit was filed in New York against Celestica and members of the company’s executive team. The complaint alleges that the company made materially false and misleading statements about the business and failed to disclose adverse facts, namely:

(i) that the Company was experiencing declining demand in its Mexican operations and that the division was carrying significant amounts of unneeded inventory which would have to be written off;
(ii) that the Company was experiencing declining demand in its Information Technology (IT) and Communications market segments as its larger customers scaled back purchases; and that the stock dropped when this information later became public.

This class action suit was dismissed in 2010.[10]

Celestica Opens Microelectronics Laboratory to Bring Products to Market










Celestica Opens Microelectronics Laboratory to Bring Products to Market



July 2, 2014




State-of-the-art facility accelerates prototyping and commercialization
 of miniaturized electronics products 


TORONTO, July 2, 2014 /PRNewswire/ - Celestica Inc. (NYSE, TSX: CLS), a global
 leader in the delivery of end-to-end product lifecycle solutions, today
 announced the opening of its new microelectronics laboratory at its
 headquarters in Toronto, Ontario in Canada. The new facility will
 enable start-ups, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and large
 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to quickly commercialize their
 latest ideas for miniaturizing electronics products through prototyping
 to volume production.


(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140701/123764)


"Microelectronics is in demand for high-reliability markets such as
 healthcare, aerospace, defense, communications and renewable energy. As
 optics and photonics technologies permeate these high-reliability
 sectors, it is becoming increasingly more important to miniaturize and
 cost reduce," said Shawn Blakney, Senior Director, Technology and
 Innovation, Celestica. "Smaller electronics provide the flexibility for
 lighter, portable and potentially more affordable devices, a trend that
 is already proven in the consumer market."


The unique 1100-square foot, ISO class-6 clean room is a controlled
 environment for temperature, humidity and airborne particles. The
 laboratory provides new miniaturization solutions using bare die
 packaging technologies. The goal is to reduce production costs, enhance
 signal integrity, and improve thermal performance for high-reliability
 applications.


The location of the laboratory is a strategic choice with Toronto being
 the largest ICT (Information, Communication and Technology) hub in
 Canada. The laboratory will significantly bolster the infrastructure
 for product enablement in Canada and may also be leveraged by global
 customers looking to commercialize a product. Start ups, SMEs as well
 as OEMs can now have quick access to talent and the technologies in
 this facility to bring electronics products to target markets quickly
 and affordably.


"The new microelectronics laboratory complements our existing
 capabilities in Toronto including our materials laboratory and surface
 mount technology manufacturing," added Blakney. "As we look to the
 future, microelectronics will play an increasing role in technology,
 and with this new capability, we can help our customers to keep up with
 the pace of change and stay competitive in their markets."


About CelesticaCelestica is dedicated to delivering end-to-end product lifecycle
 solutions to drive our customers' success. Through our simplified
 global operations network and information technology platform, we are
 solid partners who deliver informed, flexible solutions that enable our
 customers to succeed in the markets they serve. Committed to providing

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.
