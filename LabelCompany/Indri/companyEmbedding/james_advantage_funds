            The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year Morningstar Rating™ metrics.

            As of 06/30/2017            the James Balanced: Golden Rainbow was rated against 400, 348, 240, and 400 conservative allocation funds over the 3-, 5-, 10-, and overall number of fundsyear periods respectively.

The James Mid Cap was rated against 356, 310, 217, and 356 mid cap blend funds over the 3-, 5-, 10-, and overall number of fundsyear periods respectively. The James Small Cap was rated against 337, 294, 198, and 337 small value funds over the 3-, 5-, 10-, and overall number of fundsyear periods respectively.

The James Long-Short was rated against 175, 90, and 175 Long-Short funds over the 3-, 5-, and overall number of fundsyear periods respectively. The James Balanced: Golden Rainbow has received Morningstar's 2 stars for the three year period, 3 stars for the five year period, and 5 stars for the ten year period. The James Balanced: Golden Rainbow (I) has received Morningstar's 2 stars for the three year period, 3 stars for the five year period, and 5 stars for the ten year period. The James Mid Cap has received Morningstar's 2 stars for the three year period, 2 stars for the five year period, and 2 stars for the ten year period.

            Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on Morningstar's risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in a category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Morningstar Ratings™ are for the specified share class; other classes may have different performance characteristics.
            



                                You should carefully consider the investment objectives, potential risks, management fees, and charges and expenses of the Fund before investing.

                The performance data quoted represents past performance.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted.  The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. The average annual total returns assume reinvestment of income, dividends and capital gains distributions and reflect changes in net asset value.  You should note that the James Advantage Funds are professionally managed mutual funds while the indices are unmanaged, do not incur expenses and are not available for investment.                 Mid, Small and Micro Cap investing involve greater risk not associated with investing in more established companies, such as greater price volatility, business risk, less liquidity and increased competitive threat. Fund holdings and sector weightings are subject to change without notice. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

            The James Balanced: Golden Rainbow Fund seeks to provide total return through a combination of growth and income and preservation of capital in declining markets.
Investment Strategy
    Under normal circumstances, the James Balanced: Golden Rainbow Fund invests primarily in equity securities of foreign and domestic companies that the Adviser believes are undervalued, and in fixed income securities. The Fund will normally hold both equity securities and fixed income securities, with at least 25% of its assets in equity securities and at least 25% of its assets in fixed income securities.  Equity securities that the Fund will principally invest in are common stocks, preferred stocks and exchange traded funds ("ETFs") that invest primarily in equity securities. Some or all of the equity portion of the Fund may be invested in small and micro capitalization companies. Fixed income securities that the Fund will principally invest in are U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, municipal bonds and/or sovereign bonds of any maturity, as well as ETFs that invest primarily in such securities. Any non-US government securities in the Fund's portfolio will consist primarily of issues rated "Baa2" or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") or "BBB" or better by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P") and unrated securities determined by the Adviser to be of equivalent quality, as well as high quality money market instruments. The Fund will attempt to provide total return in excess of the rate of inflation over the long term (3 to 5 years)

Economy
                    Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth over the last ten years has been among the lowest in our nation’s history. However, recent upsurges in consumer and business expectations could prove beneficial. 
                    
                    While hope is rising, concerns remain on when and what will get done in Washington. Campaign promises have included lowering corporate tax rates and eliminating two federal regulations for every new one passed. Proposed infrastructure spending is for $1 trillion over the next ten years. Too often campaign promises are delayed, watered down or abandoned.

Among the challenges for the economy are the ending of the lax monetary policy era. Further, rising inflation could eventually prove problematic. While unlikely, a trade war would put pressure on U.S. and worldwide GDP growth. Overall, we believe economic activity should improve over 2016.

                    






Positives
Negatives



Rising spending on big ticket items

More active Federal Reserve



Potential for lower taxes and regulations

Stronger dollar



Upsurge in consumer expectations

Uncertain tax and spending policies



Recession tripwires are benign

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
