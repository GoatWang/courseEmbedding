Massimo Ferragamo
February 15, 2015 by admin 


 
Massimo Ferragamo
Massimo Ferragamo, how did you become the “American Ferragamo?”
The best things in life happen by chance. Back when I was a humble student, I had a conversation with the chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue who was visiting Florence. He suggested I do the executive training programme at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York, which at the time was Ferragamo’s biggest client. I had lived twenty-three years in Florence, and so I found this to be an interesting prospect. I asked my mother if I could interrupt my university studies to do the six-month course. She said I could as long as I returned to Florence to graduate.
So what happened?
I did my six months, and I fell in love with New York and the way of working in the United States. They were opening our direct offices in New York in that same period so I mustered up the courage to call my mother and my older brother Ferruccio and tell them that I didn’t want to come back to finish my law degree. I added that I would happily do a three-year work experience in our offices. On one hand, they were sorry that I didn’t want to finish my studies, but on the other hand, they were happy that I wanted to be part of the family business, which is something I hadn’t thought about doing before.
How did it go?
Those three years became thirty-three years.
New York Flagship Store on Fifth Avenue.
Have you become American?
No, absolutely not. You can’t change who you are, especially if you were born in Italy. However, I do appreciate America and its positive qualities very much.
What is it like to live between two continents?
The only negative thing is the logistics because you are always on an airplane. But nobody can appreciate the United States more than a European – perhaps even more than an American can. Nothing is too big in the United States and nothing is impossible. They are always ready to listen if you have a good idea, and then there’s a way of doing things that is incredibly efficient. In Italy it’s very different.
Is it a matter of discipline?
Yes, and then there is that Anglo-Saxon training, or in other words, that natural inherent ability to avoid bureaucracy.
In front: Mr. Ferruccio and Mrs. Ferragamo. Middle from left: James Ferragamo, Mrs. Fulvia Visconti Ferragamo, Mr. Massimo FerragamoBack from left: Diego di san Giuliano, Mrs. Angelica Visconti Ruspoli & Mrs. Giovanna Gentile Ferragamo. New York.
What does the American market represent for Ferragamo?
Historically it has always been the most relevant market. My father Salvatore Ferragamo started by opening his first boutique in Hollywood. He started out in the United States. Today the American market represents 23% of what we do in the world, and we have forty-eight boutiques in the United States.
Are shoes always your number-one product?
Yes. Let’s say leather, men’s and women’s shoes, bags, small leather goods like belts, and wallets, etc.
Ferragamo Vara Pumps
Is everything made in Italy?
It is 110% made in either Tuscany or southern Italy!
Do you remember your father Salvatore Ferragamo?
Unfortunately no. I wasn’t even three years old when he died and therefore my mother was both a mother and father to me and my older brother Ferruccio.
All six of your siblings has a role in the company if I’m not mistaken.
Yes. Each of us wanted to help my mother who took over in the company after my father died in 1960.
Since then you have grown a lot. Today Ferragamo is listed on the stock market. Why did you decide to go that route?
Yes, we’ve been listed on the stock exchange for three years, and this was a decision we made to give continuity and solidity to the company as well as discipline. We are even more disciplined than we were before.
Mr. Ferruccio Ferragamo, Mr. Leonardo Ferragamo, Mrs. Ferragamo, Mrs. Giovanna Gentile Ferragamo, Mr. Diego di San Giuliano (son of Mrs Fiamma di San Giuliano Ferragamo), Mrs. Fulvia Visconti Ferragamo and Mr. Massimo Ferragamo.  Milan, June 29, 2011, listing on the Milan stock exchange.
Is the Ferragamo name well known in the United States?
Yes, because we’ve been around a long time. The fact that we have been around for a long time is a guarantee of the tradition and a solid base, but you need to be constantly updating things and looking to the future because you need to get back in the game every single day.
How are things in the luxury industry during times of economic crisis?
I have been in the United States for thirty-three years, and I’ve lived through at least three serious recessions. Aside from the one in 2008 that had negative repercussions for just about everyone, we have never really felt the impact. Even with the recession of 2008, we started to grow in 2009 more than before. If I had to sum things up in a sentence, I’d say that, “Luxury companies are the last to feel economic crises and the first to bounce back.”
Why is that?
When you make products that have intrinsic value and the right price/quality ratio, a product that is marketed to a client that knows he or she can count on that product, and most importantly, there can’t be a crisis for accessories because they are absolutely necessary.
What about fashion?
Fashion may be the industry that feels the crisis the most.
Do you think the drop in price of petroleum will influence your sales?
When it comes to petroleum, I’m not a financial expert and so I can’t say. But I can say that a strong dollar is something fundamental for a European company, and if people have more money in their pockets because petroleum costs less, then it is certainly a positive thing.
Rosewood Castiglion del Bosco, Golf Course Landscape
But you have other businesses in Italy. You make wine and have a resort?
Yes. Years ago I bought “Castiglion del Bosco,” a historic producer of Brunello di Montalcino, one of Italy’s most famous and prestigious wines. I renovated it and turned it into a luxury resort. We have ten rustic farmhouses, twenty-three suites, two restaurants, a spa, and a gorgeous golf course that is the only private golf course in Italy, being also set within a UNESCO world heritage site. At the beginning of the year, we signed a management agreement with Rosewood Hotels and Resorts to manage the hospitality part. We are usually booked solid during the summer. The winemaking part is my passion, and today we are the fifth largest producer of Brunello. Fortunately that side of things is going very well also.
The winery and the resort are yours?
Yes. These are my things that reflect my passion for the countryside and real estate projects. Real-estate endeavours are second nature in my family.
The Ferragamo family also has hotels, doesn’t it?
Yes. There’s Lungarno Alberghi, which has beautiful hotels that are very central, next to the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, and a small hotel in Rome in Via Condotti. We like this business, and we hope to expand more into it. My brother Leonardo manages it.
What does your job entail?
I hope to serve as a watchful eye for my family and our interests in the United States. For the last few years, I’ve had my own business activities, which have taken up a lot of my time. Today I have less of an operational role in the company as we are now listed on the stock market, and the group has a more managerial structure.
You are also a director of Yum! Brands, which is a group that has Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. How did you get involved in that?
It is something that came about by chance. I was asked by the company chairman Andy Pearson who had worked with my mother and I on a case study of Ferragamo for Harvard University. When he was asked in 1997 to manage the spin-off of these companies from PepsiCo, he asked if I wanted to be part of the Board. I felt honoured, and all of the people are of the highest level.
What have you learned after thirty years in the United States?
I have learned a great deal, especially in terms of the efficient and practical way of working. I am amazed by this country because it can teach anyone who comes here how to adapt to the system. Here there’s a system, and whoever comes here has to adapt, or is better off returning home.
Is it a difficult country?
Yes. You need to work and produce. Despite all of the difficulties, there is only 4% unemployment here.
Ferragamo Headquarters: Palazzo Spini Feroni, Florence.
Is Florence your city?
I miss it, but fortunately, I go quite often. I have a house there, a lot of friends, and my heart always beats for Florence and the Fiorentina team!
What about your children?
I have two sons, and they feel Italian and speak Italian, but they were born and have been raised in America. When one of my sons was eight years old, he told me that he feels Italian during the World Cup for football, but he feels American in a war.
What differences do you pick up on living between New York and Florence?
The difference is that in Florence and in Tuscany, life is on a more human scale. You can walk around easily, there are small trattorias, and you experience the life of the city more.
What about family?
Family is incredibly important to me. I have been married to Chiara for twenty years, and she was immediately taken with New York the same way I was. Naturally, extended family is also important. I can sum it up with one example. My mother Wanda Ferragamo called me yesterday from her office in Florence – where at ninety-three years of age she goes daily – because she was worried. She had heard on the news how cold it was in New York, and she wanted to make sure I was bundled up.
We are very, very close in my family thanks to my mother who has always preached and practiced fairness without favourites for all of us. This is the basis for the strong bond that there is among we siblings. Furthermore, we’ve established a similar set of very precise rules for future generations. A limited number of people who can enter into the company with specific credentials to gain access.
Mr. and Mrs. Ferragamo with all the children.From left: Ms.Giovanna, Ms. Fulvia, Ms. Fiamma, Mr. Leonardo, Mrs. Ferragamo, Mr. Ferruccio, Mr. Massimo and Mr. Salvatore Ferragamo.
What’s in the Ferragamo DNA?
Being really in touch with reality. Honesty in all areas in terms of what you do; and the products need to be absolutely honest. A desire for innovation and respect for people.

Early life[edit]
Salvatore Ferragamo was born in 1898 in Bonito, near Avellino, the eleventh of 14 children, to a poor family. After making his first pair of shoes at age nine, for his sisters to wear at their confirmation, young Salvatore decided that he had found his calling.
Career[edit]
After studying shoemaking in Naples for a year, Ferragamo opened a small store based in his parent's home. In 1914, he emigrated to Boston, where one of his brothers worked in a cowboy boot factory. After a brief stint at the factory, Ferragamo convinced his brothers to move to California, first Santa Barbara then Hollywood. It was here that Ferragamo found success, initially opening a shop for repair and made-to-measure shoes, which soon became prized items among celebrities of the day, leading to a long period of designing footwear for the cinema. However, his thriving reputation as 'Shoemaker to the Stars' only partially satisfied him. He could not fathom why his shoes pleased the eye yet hurt the foot, so he proceeded to study anatomy at the University of Southern California.
After spending thirteen years in the United States, Ferragamo returned to Italy in 1927, this time settling in Florence. He began to fashion shoes for the wealthiest and most powerful women of the century, from the Maharani of Cooch Behar to Eva Peron to Marilyn Monroe. He opened a workshop in the Via Mannelli, concentrating his efforts in experimenting with design, applying for patents for ornamental and utility models and some related inventions. Although he filed for bankruptcy in 1933 due to bad management and economic pressures, Ferragamo nonetheless expanded his operation during the 1950s to a workforce of around 700 expert artisans that produced 350 pairs of handmade shoes a day.
“The Rainbow” was created by Salvatore Ferragamo in 1938 and was the first instance of the platform shoe returning in modern days in the West. The platform sandal was designed for Judy Garland, an American singer, actress, and vaudevillian. This shoe was a tribute to Judy Garland’s signature song “Over the Rainbow” performed in the Wizard of Oz in 1938. The shoe was a crafted using uniquely shaped slabs of cork that were covered in suede to build up the wedge and gold kidskin was used for the straps. His creation was a result of experimentations with new materials because of wartime rationing during World War II[1]
Death and legacy[edit]
Salvatore Ferragamo died in 1960 at the age of 62, but his name lives on as an international company, which has expanded its operations to include luxury shoes, bags, eyewear, silk accessories, watches, perfumes and a ready-to-wear clothing line. At his death his wife Wanda and later their six children (Fiamma, Giovanna, Fulvia, Ferruccio, Massimo and Leonardo) ran the company. Ferragamo was always recognized as a visionary, and his designs ranged from the strikingly bizarre objet d'art to the traditionally elegant, often serving as the main inspiration to other footwear designers of his time and beyond.
His most famous invention is arguably the "Cage Heel". Fiamma (Salvatore's eldest daughter who died in 1998) inherited her father's inimitable talent and came up with the "Vara pumps" in 1978.
A museum dedicated to Ferragamo's life and work opened in the Palazzo Spini Feroni in 1995. The palazzo had been bought by Ferragamo in the 1930s.
In March 2013, Ferragamo's fashion house, Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A., established the Ferragamo Foundation in Florence. The foundation was formed to cultivate young fashion designers, based on the ideas of Salvatore Ferragamo.[2]
Present day[edit]
The company is currently owned by the Ferragamo family, which in November 2006 included Salvatore's widow Wanda, five children, 23 grandchildren and other relatives. There is a rule that only 3 members of the family can work at the company, prompting fierce competition.

Early life[edit]
Salvatore Ferragamo was born in 1898 in Bonito, near Avellino, the eleventh of 14 children, to a poor family. After making his first pair of shoes at age nine, for his sisters to wear at their confirmation, young Salvatore decided that he had found his calling.
Career[edit]
After studying shoemaking in Naples for a year, Ferragamo opened a small store based in his parent's home. In 1914, he emigrated to Boston, where one of his brothers worked in a cowboy boot factory. After a brief stint at the factory, Ferragamo convinced his brothers to move to California, first Santa Barbara then Hollywood. It was here that Ferragamo found success, initially opening a shop for repair and made-to-measure shoes, which soon became prized items among celebrities of the day, leading to a long period of designing footwear for the cinema. However, his thriving reputation as 'Shoemaker to the Stars' only partially satisfied him. He could not fathom why his shoes pleased the eye yet hurt the foot, so he proceeded to study anatomy at the University of Southern California.
After spending thirteen years in the United States, Ferragamo returned to Italy in 1927, this time settling in Florence. He began to fashion shoes for the wealthiest and most powerful women of the century, from the Maharani of Cooch Behar to Eva Peron to Marilyn Monroe. He opened a workshop in the Via Mannelli, concentrating his efforts in experimenting with design, applying for patents for ornamental and utility models and some related inventions. Although he filed for bankruptcy in 1933 due to bad management and economic pressures, Ferragamo nonetheless expanded his operation during the 1950s to a workforce of around 700 expert artisans that produced 350 pairs of handmade shoes a day.
“The Rainbow” was created by Salvatore Ferragamo in 1938 and was the first instance of the platform shoe returning in modern days in the West. The platform sandal was designed for Judy Garland, an American singer, actress, and vaudevillian. This shoe was a tribute to Judy Garland’s signature song “Over the Rainbow” performed in the Wizard of Oz in 1938. The shoe was a crafted using uniquely shaped slabs of cork that were covered in suede to build up the wedge and gold kidskin was used for the straps. His creation was a result of experimentations with new materials because of wartime rationing during World War II[1]
Death and legacy[edit]
Salvatore Ferragamo died in 1960 at the age of 62, but his name lives on as an international company, which has expanded its operations to include luxury shoes, bags, eyewear, silk accessories, watches, perfumes and a ready-to-wear clothing line. At his death his wife Wanda and later their six children (Fiamma, Giovanna, Fulvia, Ferruccio, Massimo and Leonardo) ran the company. Ferragamo was always recognized as a visionary, and his designs ranged from the strikingly bizarre objet d'art to the traditionally elegant, often serving as the main inspiration to other footwear designers of his time and beyond.
His most famous invention is arguably the "Cage Heel". Fiamma (Salvatore's eldest daughter who died in 1998) inherited her father's inimitable talent and came up with the "Vara pumps" in 1978.
A museum dedicated to Ferragamo's life and work opened in the Palazzo Spini Feroni in 1995. The palazzo had been bought by Ferragamo in the 1930s.
In March 2013, Ferragamo's fashion house, Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A., established the Ferragamo Foundation in Florence. The foundation was formed to cultivate young fashion designers, based on the ideas of Salvatore Ferragamo.[2]
Present day[edit]
The company is currently owned by the Ferragamo family, which in November 2006 included Salvatore's widow Wanda, five children, 23 grandchildren and other relatives. There is a rule that only 3 members of the family can work at the company, prompting fierce competition.
Family[edit]

Wanda Ferragamo Miletti: has led the group since 1960, when her husband and founder of the company, Salvatore, died. She is currently Honorary Chairman.

Her passion for her work, her imagination and inventiveness have led to the creation of some of the brand’s most iconic products, such as Vara shoe and the Gancino.

History[edit]




Palazzo Spini Feroni: The headquarters of Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A. in Florence.


Salvatore Ferragamo emigrated from southern Italy to Boston and then California in 1914. He opened the Hollywood Boot Shop in 1923, and made shoes[2] for movie stars such as Joan Crawford and Gloria Swanson, as well as for films such as Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments.[3] He returned to Italy and set up a shoe shop in Florence in 1927.[4] However, the modern shoemaking company regards 1928 as the date of its foundation and so celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2008.[3] Salvatore filed for bankruptcy in 1933,[citation needed] during the Great Depression, but by 1938 he was in a position to buy the Palazzo Spini Feroni, one of the great palaces of Florence,[3] which now houses the company's flagship store and a museum dedicated to Ferragamo's life and work.
The company flourished after World War II, expanding the workforce to 700 craftsmen producing 350 pairs of hand-made shoes a day.[citation needed] After Salvatore's death in 1960, his widow Wanda took over the running of the business and expanded its operations to include eyewear, perfume, belts, scarves,[4] bags, watches, and a ready to wear clothing line.




Ferruccio Ferragamo, current president of Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A.


The company is currently owned by the Ferragamo family, which in November 2006 included Salvatore's widow Wanda, five children, 23 grandchildren and other relatives.[5] There is a rule that only 3 members of the family can work at the company, prompting fierce competition.[5] To ease these tensions, in September 2006, the family announced a plan to float 48% of the company on the stock market, and since October 2006 Michele Norsa has served as managing and general director.[4] However, as of January 2008, this plan may be on put on hold in the midst of the downturn in the financial market.[6] If the listing on the stock market proceeds, the fund will be directed primarily towards building its positions in China.[7] The company is holding its 80th birthday exhibition in Shanghai.[3]
In 2011 the company was listed on the stock exchange.[8]
For the fiscal year 2016, Salvatore Ferragamo reported preliminary consolidated revenues of 1,438 million euros. As of December 31, 2016, the Salvatore Ferragamo Group's retail network consisted of 402 directly operated stores (DOS), while the wholesale and travel retail channel included 281 third party operated stores (TPOS), as well as presence in major department stores and high-end multi-brand specialty stores.[9]
On August 2, 2016 Eraldo Poletto was appointed as new CEO of the group.
Innovations[edit]
Throughout its history, the company has been known for innovative designs and use of materials. Such ingenuity goes back to Salvatore's time in California, when he studied anatomy to make shoes which were more comfortable. Notable innovations include the wedge heel, the shell-shaped sole, the ‘invisible’ sandal, metal heels and soles, the 18-carat gold sandal, the sock-shoe, sculpture heels, and the gloved arch shoe created for the Maharani of Cooch Behar in 1938.[3] Metal-reinforced stiletto heels were made famous by Marilyn Monroe.[4] The company is also known for the ‘Gancini’ decoration, the ‘Vara’ patent ballet pump, the Salvatore bag and the use of patchwork.[3] It makes also eyewear and watches in partnership with Marchon and Timex Group.
Clients[edit]
Salvatore worked with film stars and celebrities from his earliest days in Hollywood. Clients over the years included Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren and Greta Garbo,[4] as well as Andy Warhol, Grace Mugabe and Diana, Princess of Wales.[3] The company made Margaret Thatcher's famous handbags[7] and for King Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuck during the coronation on November 6, 2008 in Thimpu, Bhutan.

History[edit]




Palazzo Spini Feroni: The headquarters of Salvatore Ferragamo S.p.A. in Florence.


Salvatore Ferragamo emigrated from southern Italy to Boston and then California in 1914. He opened the Hollywood Boot Shop in 1923, and made shoes[2] for movie stars such as Joan Crawford and Gloria Swanson, as well as for films such as Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments.[3] He returned to Italy and set up a shoe shop in Florence in 1927.[4] However, the modern shoemaking company regards 1928 as the date of its foundation and so celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2008.[3] Salvatore filed for bankruptcy in 1933,[citation needed] during the Great Depression, but by 1938 he was in a position to buy the Palazzo Spini Feroni, one of the great palaces of Florence,[3] which now houses the company's flagship store and a museum dedicated to Ferragamo's life and work.
The company flourished after World War II, expanding the workforce to 700 craftsmen producing 350 pairs of hand-made shoes a day.[citation needed] After Salvatore's death in 1960, his widow Wanda took over the running of the business and expanded its operations to include eyewear, perfume, belts, scarves,[4] bags, watches, and a ready to wear clothing line.

The company is currently owned by the Ferragamo family, which in November 2006 included Salvatore's widow Wanda, five children, 23 grandchildren and other relatives.[5] There is a rule that only 3 members of the family can work at the company, prompting fierce competition.[5] To ease these tensions, in September 2006, the family announced a plan to float 48% of the company on the stock market, and since October 2006 Michele Norsa has served as managing and general director.[4] However, as of January 2008, this plan may be on put on hold in the midst of the downturn in the financial market.[6] If the listing on the stock market proceeds, the fund will be directed primarily towards building its positions in China.[7] The company is holding its 80th birthday exhibition in Shanghai.[3]
In 2011 the company was listed on the stock exchange.[8]
For the fiscal year 2016, Salvatore Ferragamo reported preliminary consolidated revenues of 1,438 million euros. As of December 31, 2016, the Salvatore Ferragamo Group's retail network consisted of 402 directly operated stores (DOS), while the wholesale and travel retail channel included 281 third party operated stores (TPOS), as well as presence in major department stores and high-end multi-brand specialty stores.[9]
On August 2, 2016 Eraldo Poletto was appointed as new CEO of the group.
Innovations[edit]
Throughout its history, the company has been known for innovative designs and use of materials. Such ingenuity goes back to Salvatore's time in California, when he studied anatomy to make shoes which were more comfortable. Notable innovations include the wedge heel, the shell-shaped sole, the ‘invisible’ sandal, metal heels and soles, the 18-carat gold sandal, the sock-shoe, sculpture heels, and the gloved arch shoe created for the Maharani of Cooch Behar in 1938.[3] Metal-reinforced stiletto heels were made famous by Marilyn Monroe.[4] The company is also known for the ‘Gancini’ decoration, the ‘Vara’ patent ballet pump, the Salvatore bag and the use of patchwork.[3] It makes also eyewear and watches in partnership with Marchon and Timex Group.
Clients[edit]
Salvatore worked with film stars and celebrities from his earliest days in Hollywood. Clients over the years included Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren and Greta Garbo,[4] as well as Andy Warhol, Grace Mugabe and Diana, Princess of Wales.[3] The company made Margaret Thatcher's famous handbags[7] and for King Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuck during the coronation on November 6, 2008 in Thimpu, Bhutan.

As the chairman of Ferragamo USA, Massimo Ferragamo, 59, the youngest son of the founder of the fashion house Salvatore Ferragamo, has strong roots in fashion, but recently, he’s unexpectedly found a second career in the world of hospitality. In 2003, Mr. Ferragamo, prompted by his penchant for Tuscan wine, purchased Castiglion del Bosco — an 800-year-old, 5,000-acre estate in Montalcino, Tuscany — and spent five years transforming the property into an upscale resort.Mr. Ferragamo spends several months a year in Tuscany and spoke to The New York Times recently about his love of the region. Below are edited excerpts from the interview.What gave you the idea you to turn Castiglion del Bosco into a resort?I wanted to get involved in producing wine in Tuscany because I have always loved Tuscan wines, especially Brunellos, and a friend of mine heard that the property was for sale and took me to see it. It was a massive estate that was somewhat run-down, and the vineyards were only 150 acres out of 5,000. The best use of the land was to turn it into a resort, so that’s what I ended up doing.Tuscany is a well-traversed destination. What are some hidden gems?Definitely Punta Ala, a town set on the Tyrrhenian Sea. I grew up going there in the summers with my family, and it has incredible sailing and a nice beach. Then, in the countryside, there are the most charming villages around Monte Amiata, which are untouched by time, like Abbadia San Salvatore and Piancastagnaio. And around the villages you have pristine pastureland that’s rich with chestnut trees.

September is beautiful because it’s harvest time, and the weather is pleasant. April and May are also great when it comes to weather, and November is the time to go for white truffles — the town of San Miniato has a great truffle fair then. I’m also a fan of Tuscany in winter — it’s nice to sit in front of a fire with a delicious glass of red wine at night. During the day, you can go on long walks through the countryside and take scenic drives, but without any crowds.

Visiting wineries tends to be a staple activity for tourists to Tuscany. How should they pick which wineries to visit? They should visit ones that produce high-quality wines and have scenic estates but stick to seeing two wineries a day — any more and you won’t appreciate anything you saw or tasted. Ask locals or your hotel concierge what wineries they like and think are the most beautiful, or ask your friends who’ve been to the area. I like going to Duemani, which is in the Riparbella area, and also am a fan of Sassicaia and Ornellaia.Can you come to Tuscany if you don’t drink alcohol? Absolutely. It’s a great place for fitness fanatics; there is both rigorous and gentle hiking and biking there. Also, you can go to olive oil estates to taste oils. It’s also possible to visit farms that produce cheese and have fabulous meals in little restaurants that have been around a long time. If you’re into history, we have historic towns and villages, such as Pisa and Siena, and centuries-old abbeys and convents.Is Tuscany a destination for families? Many of the hotels welcome children, especially along the coast, and offer lots of activities for them. At del Bosco, we have kids’ cooking classes and archery lessons and even get them to crush grapes during the harvest. And kids are welcome at almost any restaurant in Tuscany. Most don’t have children’s menus, but the owners will make your kids anything they want, whether it’s a simple pasta or fried chicken.

      The Ferragamos' Florence    











































T+L





Florence




The Ferragamos' Florence


By
Christopher Petkanas














 




 














             The city's first family of fashion lead the way to their favorite hotels, restaurants, shops, sights—and the best white-truffle panini in town          

One of the most famous photographs in 20th-century fashion depicts Salvatore Ferragamo surrounded by a sea of shoe lasts in a workroom of his Florentine palazzo, the 13th-century Spini Feroni. Written in heavy black ink on the wooden forms are the names of their owners: Greta Garbo, Sophia Loren, Ava Gardner, Lauren Bacall.
Dubbed Shoemaker to the Stars, Ferragamo shod Hollywood royalty on and off the screen, pushing the creative envelope with sandals and stilettos, pumps and platforms, in such innovative materials as woven cellophane and raffia, "invisible" nylon thread, hemp, bark, hummingbird feathers, and exotic skins of toad, water snake, and kangaroo. Born outside Naples and headquartered in the heart of historic Florence from 1927 until his death in 1960, Ferragamo was a charismatic and persuasive (not to mention dashing) ambassador of Tuscan style.
This legacy is a lot to live up to, but his wife, Wanda, five children—Ferruccio, Fulvia, Massimo, Leonardo, and Giovanna—and grandson James fill the role as comfortably as they do their Ferragamos. Asked to name and describe their favorite hotels, restaurants, shops, and sights in Florence, they approached the task as if they were designing a new collection: with almost feral concentration, respect for tradition, and disregard for the obvious.
As the Ferragamo company has grown—embracing complete lines of men's and women's classic ready-to-wear, along with jewelry, leather bags and belts, silk scarves and ties—so too has the responsibility of belonging to what even the corner tripe vendor calls the First Family of Florentine Fashion. Like the two-inch-thick grilled bistecca for which the city is famous, Ferragamo and Florence are inseparable. Brunelleschi's mythic dome for the cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore (the Duomo) is a must-see, but so is the Ferragamo flagship boutique in Palazzo Spini Feroni, which, with its lofty frescoed ceilings, is nothing if not grand.
where to stay
The Ferragamos draw such a sharp line between their fashion and Florentine hotel empires that it's possible to spend a week at the Lungarno, Gallery, or (less perfect) Continental and never know that the family owns them. Following a strict "church and state" policy, nothing at the Hotel Lungarno (14 Borgo San Jacopo; 39-055/27261, fax 39-055/268-437; doubles from $310, including tax and breakfast), not a matchbook nor telephone pad, says "Ferragamo." But the synergy is no less powerful for being unspoken. The giveaway that CEO Ferruccio Ferragamo and company are behind the hotel, which they acquired in 1995, is the high, high style quotient.
The Lungarno stands on the Arno's south bank, steps from the Ponte Vecchio. Its rather anonymous modern building is linked to a 12th-century tower, which houses the most romantic guest rooms. "Other hotels can claim to be on the river," notes Ferruccio, "but ours is the only one that doesn't have a street separating it from the water. Drop a penny from your window and it falls straight into the Arno." Massimo, head of Ferragamo's North American operations, says, "I would stay at the Lungarno even if it were owned by my worst enemy."
The Ferragamos' careful renovation of this much-loved classic yielded 57 rooms and 12 suites, crisply decorated in blue and white with cushioned headboards, avian prints, and pedimented mirrors (not, alas, full-length). Bathrooms are lavishly done in beige Botticino marble. Only the plastic tumblers glare—was glass really a corner worth cutting?Marshaled atop the mini-bars are bottles of Chianti, grappa, and vin santo, and a package of the mother of all biscotti, made by the Matteis in nearby Prato since 1858.
Set just above the river, the restaurant puts diners nearly at eye level with passing boats and, at breakfast time, locals bicycling unhurriedly to work on the opposite quay. Photographs of personalities who have left their mark on the city adorn the walls: Eleonora Duse, Harold Acton, Aldo Gucci, and, of course, Salvatore Ferragamo. The lobby, with its white-slipcovered upholstery and oxblood ginger-jar lamps, is a good place for ordering a morning latte and spreading out a map to plan your day. Service is respectable, though the concierges can seem less than thrilled to be doing their job.
In May the Ferragamos shook up Florence with something it had never known before: a resolutely contemporary boutique hotel. Within whistling distance of the Ponte Vecchio, on the north flank of the Arno, the Gallery Hotel Art (5A Vicolo dell'Oro; 39-055/27263, fax 39-055/268-557; doubles from $280) romances young and worldly customers with an art theme that reaches from the warm taupe-and-gray public spaces (showing Alberto Reggianini's insect watercolors) to the 56 pin-striped guest rooms and nine suites, hung with moody black-and-white studies of Florentine monuments. Rectilinear armchairs are in pigskin and wenge, the furniture wood of the moment. Books in the library, including first editions of English literature classics, were handpicked, title by title.
The Helvetia & Bristol (2 Via dei Pescioni; 39-055/287-814, fax 39-055/288-353; doubles from $403) retains the thick, tufted atmosphere of the 19th-century private palace it was before morphing into a hotel in 1894. In the years after, it became a magnet for composers, artists, and writers such as Stravinsky, Pirandello, and De Chirico, as well as English nobility. Travelers with a taste for the rich textures, dark woods, and murky colors of the fin de siècle will not check out feeling underfed. Most of the H&B's 29 guest rooms and 20 suites have extravagantly high ceilings, Venetian glass chandeliers dripping rosettes, and slipper chairs whose frilly skirts make them look like demoiselles waiting for their dance cards to be filled in. The hotel's dining room is one of the most formal in Florence. As for location, the H&B is perfect for those for whom no walk—even in Europe's most walkable city—is too short: the hotel is just off Florence's main square, Piazza della Repubblica.

Despite the scale of the Torre di Bellosguardo (2 Via Roti Michelozzi; 39-055/229-8145, fax 39-055/229-008; doubles from $244)—the sprawling lobby was once a ballroom—the 16th-century villa turned hotel feels intimate, not intimidating. The 16 guest rooms, with their heavily carved wardrobes and, in some cases, canopy beds, are almost painfully nostalgic, a sentiment underscored by the views. As Massimo says, "There is no better vantage point for surveying Florence than the Bellosguardo." Santa Maria Novella, San Lorenzo, the Palazzo Vecchio, Santo Spirito, the Pitti Palace—all are at your feet. Tucked in the hills just outside the city's periphery, the hotel is a five-minute taxi ride or a beautiful 15-minute walk from town (time spent peeking over garden walls and inhaling the jasmine not included).
A former monastery across the city from the Bellosguardo, the Villa San Michele (4 Via Doccia, Fiesole; 800/237-1236 or 39-055/59451, fax 39-055/567-8250; doubles from $706, including breakfast and one additional meal for two) dates to the same era and has a similar setting, though the resemblance ends there. With a façade attributed to Michelangelo, a chapel (complete with altar) for a lobby, and a spectacular living and dining loggia pitched above a verdant ravine, the San Michele is one of the world's most celebrated hotels. Unfortunately, attitude problems among the staff have also made it notorious, though Maurizio Ammazzini gets gold stars for finding me what no other concierge in Florence could: a tailor to replace the shredded lining of a treasured sports coat. The 38-room, four-suite hotel has the chic to leave its public spaces empty, or nearly so. On the other hand, accommodations in the main building are so tight they could ruin your stay; cut your losses and book into the slicker, costlier annex. "The San Michele," says Giovanna, "is for people who want a very special holiday—and don't mind paying for it."
where to eat
"Florentine food is Tuscan food is simple food," says Ferruccio. "It's healthful, wastes nothing, and makes a direct appeal to the palate. It's the very best Italian cooking."
Though the Venetians and Neapolitans might disagree, and though eating in Florence is not quite as austere as Ferruccio says, it is nevertheless an earthy adventure. Beans, unsalted bread, and olive oil are ingredients that turn up again and again. Wide pasta, grilled meats, and game—wild boar, rabbit, pheasant—crowd the menus. Fresh and aged pecorino, Tuscany's great contribution to the national cheese platter, makes an appearance between the secondo and dolce.
Folded into a 13th-century palazzo with lacy wrought-iron chandeliers, Osteria del Caffè Italiano (11-13R Via Isola delle Stinche; 39-055/289-368; dinner for two $65) has a young vibe unmatched by any restaurant in town. Ferruccio's weakness is for the soups: porcini; potato and artichoke; and ribollita—a bread-thickened bean dish anointed at the table with olive oil to taste. Caffè Italiano also has one of the most extensive and carefully composed wine lists in Florence. Order that super-Tuscan you can never find at home.
The list at Cantinetta Antinori (3R Piazza degli Antinori; 39-055/292-234; dinner for two $80) is made up exclusively of bottles from the Tuscan estates where the Antinoris have been making wine since the 14th century. Even the rarest, most expensive vintages are available by the glass. Of special interest is the Tenuta Belvedere from the new Bolgheri appellation, a red made with Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, and Merlot grapes. "The Cantinetta is a bit more refined than most Florentine restaurants, but not overwhelmingly so," says Leonardo, director of Ferragamo's European and Asian arms, who always has the pappa al pomodoro, another bread-and-olive-oil-bolstered soup, this one with a tomato base. Like the wines, the oil is the Antinoris' own, as are the pecorino and caprino cheeses.
To escape one's fellow tourists (there are easier things to do in Florence), slip into Giacosa (83R Via Tornabuoni; 39-055/239-6226; lunch for two $27), a genteel café-cum-tearoom jammed with well-born locals digging into midday plates of ziti and risotto. "This is where I go on Saturdays when I'm out doing errands with my granddaughters and I want something good but quick," says Giovanna, who oversees women's ready-to-wear. "My little girls love it." Habitués order at the counter and eat standing up, elbow to elbow, after sipping a Negroni, the legendary gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth cocktail that was invented at Giacosa. Vitrines magnificently arranged with fruit tarts, candied chestnuts, and bottles of lemon liqueur are as much of a draw as the crustless sandwiches. Giacosa's sister institution is the Rivoire (5R Piazza della Signoria; 39-055/211-302), where, tomorrow if not today, everyone who is anyone in Florence (including lots of Ferragamos) stops by for an aperitivo or a pudding-rich hot chocolate.
When you just can't face another bowl of pasta, Procacci (64R Via Tornabuoni; 39-055/211-656; lunch for two $25), a wonderfully old-fashioned specialty foods shop and bar with a small menu, is a good, light alternative. No point in starting with anything less than three panini tartufati, the house sandwich, a dainty glazed roll the size and shape of an egg, filled with white-truffle paste. Nurse a spumante while deciding whether to take home a bottle of the best-quality balsamic vinegar or a jar of Sicilian marmalade. With sheaves of lilies scenting the shop, a mosaic floor, and marble tables, Procacci has set the standard for civility in Florence since 1885. Even the paper napkins are luxurious.
Coco Lezzone (26R Via del Parioncino; 39-055/287-178; dinner for two $75) isn't concerned with niceties. If it were not for the tempting bowl of sliced peaches in white wine sitting in the entrance, the scowls of the three hostesses would be enough to send you running. And yet, and yet. "Coco Lezzone has the best bistecca alla fiorentina in the city," says Ferruccio. "And its yellow and white wall tiles make you feel as if you're eating in a kitchen." Everyone from Prince Charles to Pavarotti sits on hard wooden benches at communal tables for the privilege of paying 35,000 lire ($19) for truffles shaved over buttered bow-tie pasta. The thing is, it is a privilege, even as a sign admonishes customers to silence their cell phones. Seems the ringing disturbs the simmering ribollita. (They ring anyway.)
Le Cave di Maiano (16 Via delle Cave, Fiesole; 39-055/59133; lunch for two $65) restores your faith in the guileless, open-armed trattoria—the kind that puts bones aside for your dog, which is what this restaurant does for Ferruccio's Labrador. Fifteen minutes from town among hills swathed in parasol pines and olive trees, Le Cave goes beyond familiar Florentine fare to offer roast pork alla casentino (with fennel, rosemary, and garlic), "chimney-sweep" risotto (with black cabbage and beans), and pollastro al mattone (a small herb-stuffed chicken, grilled under a brick). In warm weather, linden trees form a canopy over tables on a terrace with humbling vistas of Florence.

what to buy
Planning Your Attack The well-organized, energy-conscious shopper in Florence plans his attack by neighborhood, says Giovanna, allotting time for each of the key areas: the Centro Storico, Via Tornabuoni, Centro, and Oltrarno.
Centro Storico The city's ground zero takes in the Duomo, Uffizi Galleries, and Piazzas della Signoria and della Repubblica. Via Calimala and Via Calzaiuoli, the quarter's major shopping streets, are the setting for Florence's most popular passeggiata, the evening stroll that is a defining ritual of daily life.
The Shabby Shop (12RVia del Parione; 39-055/294-826) is where Leonardo finds presents for his wife, Beatrice. Calling the shop "shabby" is the owner's idea of a joke—antique carafes, saltcellars, and champagne buckets do not get any more splendid than this. Ferruccio, who says his wife, Amanda, is "extremely difficult to buy for," swears by the jewelry boutique Ugo Piccini (9-11R Via Por Santa Maria; 39-055/214-511), which has the city's largest selection of classic gold jewelry (bamboo hoop earrings and rope-twist bracelets are staples). Amanda and Ferruccio's twin boys are now 27 years old, but that doesn't stop her from stocking their wardrobes. When her sons need socks, she heads for Principe (21-29R Via Strozzi; 39-055/292-764), a sort of mini-Brooks Brothers. Amanda also recommends BM Bookshop (4R Borgo Ognissanti; 39-055/294-575): "It's the city's best English-language bookstore." American travelers race here when they realize they forgot to pack Faith Heller Willinger's Eating in Italy, the shopping bible Made in Italy by Annie Brody and Patricia Schultz, or Burton Anderson's Pocket Guide to Italian Wines.
Luigi Mazzoni is the second generation of his family to serve Wanda Ferragamo, the company's chairman, at the Mazzoni luxury linens boutique (14R Via Orsanmichele; 39-055/215-153). This is the matriarch's secret source for fine percale sheets, embellished with pinhead stars or snowflakes. Tea towels with jacquard images of the Palazzo Vecchio and Michelangelo's David make amusing souvenirs. Wanda also relies on Mazzoni for the extra-extra-wide—but seamless—damask tablecloths she needs when setting a holiday table for her brood. And it wouldn't be an Italian table of taste without Richard Ginori porcelain (17R Via Rondinelli; 39-055/210-041), prized for its opacity and brilliance.
Via Tornabuoni Bordering the west side of the Centro Storico, Via Tornabuoni is to Florence what Via Montenapoleone is to Milan: the city's most glittering shopping artery. Every Ferragamo woman has in her trousseau a slithery Harlowesque peignoir from Loretta Caponi (4R Piazza Antinori; 39-055/213-668), purveyors of what must be the world's most sumptuous lingerie and linens. Silk crepe de chine bedsheets, anyone?Loretta Caponi also sells classic children's wear, as does Baroni (9R Via Tornabuoni; 39-055/210-562), where Wanda finds Shetland shorts and smocked velvet dresses for her 21 grandchildren.
Other essential stops:  Archimede Seguso (65R Via Tornabuoni; 39-055/283-467), a leading name in Venetian glass, makes muscular bowls and vases. Pineider (76R Via Tornabuoni; 39-055/211-605), across the street, is the place for status stationery—straight- or deckle-edged, satin or textured finish. Most imposing of all the street's boutiques is Ferragamo (16R Via Tornabuoni; 39-055/292-123). A Florentine's first purchase here is a rite of passage.
Centro Fanning out around the Centro Storico in a wedge from the Arno to Via dei Servi, the Centro is home to Ceramiche Ricceri (14R Via dei Conti; 39-055/291-296), a dusky store devoted to terra-cotta tableware made in Impruneta, six miles south of the city. The town's smooth gray clay has a high iron and aluminum content that results in unusually strong platters and pitchers.
While every stratum of Florentine society lays its tables with faïence, the cosmically priced brocades and chiseled velvets from Lisio Tessuti d'Arte (45R Via dei Fossi; 39-055/212-430) are the reserve of families like the Ferragamos. It takes three months to program the perforated cards that set Lisio's handlooms in motion, and eight hours to turn out a 3-by-23-inch morsel of jacquard.
In the same careful, labor-intensive tradition, L'Officina Profumo-Farmaceutica di Santa Maria Novella (16 Via della Scala; 39-055/216-276) is a perfume, beauty, and herbalist's shop housed in the former (but still hushed) chapel of a Renaissance monastery. Intriguing tonics, unguents, digestives, and creams (one with snail oil to fight dry skin) are sold beneath a lofty vault depicting the four corners of the earth. More expected but no less sublime are the eaux de toilette, shampoos, soaps, and famous potpourri. It smells like nothing so much as an Italian church.
Oltrarno Stretched along the south side of the Arno and reaching back to Via della Chiesa, the Oltrarno has Florence's highest concentration of crafts and antiques shops. "A lot of people stay at the Lungarno because of the shopping that's just outside the door," says Leonardo. "Turn right down Borgo San Jacopo and you're in the thick of it."
Every member of the Ferragamo family raves about Paolo Pagliai (41R Borgo San Jacopo; 39-055/282-840), a silver shop in a carriage house. Pagliai's reproductions of 18th-century Florentine trays are cast using molds handmade from octopus cartilage.

Lo Spillo (72R Borgo San Jacopo; 39-055/293-126)—"the pin"—refers both to the size and contents of one of Giovanna's haunts. "The shop is devoted to vintage stickpins, lapel pins, hatpins, and brooches," she says. "The Oltrarno is full of high-end antiques dealers, but this is one spot where you don't have to wring your hands over the prices."
After it crosses Piazza Frescobaldi, Borgo San Jacopo becomes Via di Santo Spirito, where the woodcarvers at Castorina (13-15R; 39-055/212-885) meticulously restore and replicate Palazzo Spini Feroni's pelmets and pedestals. More realistically scaled for the rest of us are Baroque picture frames, marquetry boxes, and faux malachite obelisks.
Reverence for the original article also sets apart the painted furniture made by Ponziani (27 Via Santo Spirito; 39-055/287-958). The search stops here for a copy of the Duchess of Windsor's japanned Queen Anne bureau bookcase or a facsimile of a 17th-century pharmacist's cupboard, perfect for storing pasta.
what to see
Launched in 1995 by Ferruccio and his siblings in homage to their father, the Museo Salvatore Ferragamo (Palazzo Spini Feroni, 2 Via Tornabuoni; 39-055/360-456; by appointment) holds twice-yearly exhibitions that are drawn from an archive of more than 10,000 Ferragamo shoes. The earliest models date to the twenties, when Salvatore first worked in Hollywood and, in pursuit of functional perfection, studied anatomy at UCLA. A benchmark sandal from 1956 has straps of twisted rope in 18-karat gold and a metallic heel engraved with a dragon motif. Beginning in 1960, Ferragamo footwear was designed by Fiamma, the daughter Salvatore designated to succeed him, who died last year. (Today the shoe lines are created by a team under the family's direction.) Fiamma was in futuristic mode in 1968 when she introduced a style with an upper band of crocheted raffia and a strap that threads through a trapezoidal heel to grip the instep.
Commissioned by a Medici wannabe, Luca Pitti, the fortresslike Palazzo Pitti (Piazza dei Pitti; 39-055/294-883) displays a collection of Florentine Renaissance paintings second only to that of the Uffizi (6 Piazzale degli Uffizi; 39-055/294-883). But it is the Galleria del Costume within the Pitti that speaks most directly to the Ferragamos. Thirteen salons host changing exhibitions of dress from the 18th century to 1925. Bags, shawls, fans, gloves, and walking sticks paint a fully accessorized picture of what it meant to get dressed (whew!) in the salad days of the Medici court.
Though in the center of Florence, Piazza Santo Spirito has the slow-motion feel of a provincial square. At the north end sits the Basilica di Santo Spirito (39-055/211-716), "the most overlooked church in Florence and one of the loveliest," says Massimo. Augustinian monks gave up a meal every day for 50 years to help fund Brunelleschi's last—and some say best—work. Many of the 38 chapels retain their original altarpieces and frontals.
Santo Spirito was completed in the 1490's, the same decade a friar named Savonarola lit his famous "bonfire of the vanities" in the Piazza della Signoria, torching furniture, books, and "erotic" paintings in a blazing act of damnation. A porphyry plaque on the square marks the spot. "On a sunny day in November, the Piazza della Signoria is the most enchanting place in Florence," says Ferruccio. "Sitting at a café you see the Duomo cupola on one side, and on the other, the Loggia dei Lanzi, with its parade of Roman statues, including Cellini's Perseus. In front of you is a copy of David right where Michelangelo placed him, before the Palazzo Vecchio, the town hall. Just pray for no traffic."
Leonardo loves Florence's city-country duality. "The proximity of countryside—real countryside—always astonishes me," he says. "Walk five minutes west from Piazza Torquato Tasso, and you find yourself in the kind of cypress-scattered landscape that so pleased Henry James."
One of Florence's great unknown jewels, according to Giovanna, is the Museo Marino Marini (Piazza San Pancrazio; 39-055/219-432), occupying the deconsecrated medieval church of San Pancrazio. "Marini is one of the most important sculptors of this century," she says, "and yet he remains in the shadows." The artist's dominant theme was the horse and rider, a topic he treated in bronze and invested with tender but doomed symbolism. "My father chose Florence because of its charm and tradition of craftsmanship—and also because of museums like this," she continues. "Of course, there's a catch to this city: no matter how many times you visit, you are never satisfied-which explains the large expat community. Everyone leaves longing to return."

according to the ferragamos, you haven't been to florence if you haven't . . . 
. . . worn out your shoe leather at the Mercato delle Cascine (Cascine Park; Tues., 9 a.m.-1 p.m.), the bargain-filled outdoor market that hugs the Arno for a seemingly endless mile. There's a bit of everything for sale, from kitchen utensils to the designer fakes for which Florence is famous (and infamous). But if all you buy is a porchetta sandwich, the morning will not have been lost .
. . . sifted the wheat (marbleized paper items) from the chaff (tourist junk) at the open-air Mercato di San Lorenzo (Piazza San Lorenzo, Tues. - Sat., 8 a.m.-8 p.m.)
. . . lost yourself among the olive oil, sacks of farro, baskets, and food safes at Morganti (3R Piazza Santo Spirito; 39-055/289-230), a grassroots shop blessedly free of tourists .
. . . indulged in a top-of-the-line stainless-steel pasta pot or a pair of cruets standing in a basketwork holder at La Porcellana Bianca (53R Via dei Bardi; 39-055/211-893), a boutique for the knowing cook.
. . . checked out the cutting-edge housewares at Dino Bartolini (30R Via dei Servi; 39-055/211-895), such as pans of semiramis, a stone from northern Italy.
. . . ordered a numbered brass door plaque at Ditta Cosimo Tassinari (2R Piazza Santa Maria Novella; 39-055/287-869), an engraving shop that time forgot.
. . . marveled at the scagliola tables and boxes at Le Scagliole di Bianco Bianchi e Figli (117 Viale Europa; 39-055/686-118)—scagliola is the 16th-century Italian art of using a marblelike mixture of ground gypsum, pigment, and glue as filler for designs incised in slate or marble.
. . . toured the 1874 glass-and-cast-iron stalls of the Mercato Centrale food market (Piazza del Mercato Centrale), the biggest in Florence. After eyeing the Chianini beef and wild salad greens, stop for a bouillon-moistened boiled-beef sandwich at the Nerbone stand (39-055/219-949). Even more Florentine is the warm tripe sold as street food opposite the market's main entrance on Via Sant'Antonino.
. . . grabbed a stool at Enoteca Alessi (27R Via delle Oche; 39-055/214-966), a stately wine bar and shop selling grappa in bottles with flame-shaped stoppers.
. . . savored the chicken-liver crostini at Trattoria Pandemonio (50R Via del Leone; 39-055/224-002), and the lesser-known crostini di milza, with spleen.
. . . experienced the schiacciata con l'uva, a flat dessert bread baked with fall grapes, at Forno Sartoni (34R Via dei Cerchi; 39-055/212-570).
. . . sampled the gelato, sorbetto, and authentic Sicilian granita at Gelateria Carabè (60R Via Ricasoli; 39-055/289-476).
