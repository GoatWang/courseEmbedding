Claudine Prowse on Inotek's Vision


Dr. Jonathan S. Myers, Director of Glaucoma Fellowship, Wills Eye Institute on Glaucoma





At Inotek, we're working to define the future of glaucoma treatment.

Inotek Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies to treat glaucoma and other serious diseases of the eye. 

Use the links above to view videos of our key leaders and contributors discussing Inotek's mission, vision, and the potential therapeutic value of our lead product candidate, trabodenoson. 








A New Class of Glaucoma Therapy

Our most advanced product candidate, trabodenoson, is a highly selective adenosine mimetic and the first potential treatment for glaucoma of its kind.
Adenosine is an important molecule occurring naturally in the body that participates in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes. Inotek’s scientists have deconstructed adenosine’s complex biology to isolate the protective activity of the molecule, and subsequently to build it into novel therapeutics.

Built on Original Research
Inotek Pharmaceuticals (ticker: ITEK), based in Lexington, MA, is a clinical-stage, publicly traded biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies to treat glaucoma and other serious diseases of the eye, based on pioneering research on the protective effects of the molecule adenosine.
The company was founded in 1999 by a group of scientists and clinicians whose original therapeutic focus was acute care medicine and mitigating the cellular damage caused by ischemic-reperfusion injuries. While investigating the cellular signaling pathways that control programmed cell death following these injuries, Inotek scientists discovered that oxidative stress was a part of the process, and that the adenosine pathway plays an important role in protecting the cell.
This work was further supported by concurrent reports in the literature that a specific adenosine subreceptor, the A1 receptor, had effects on the control of intra-ocular pressure as well as neuroprotection. Inotek’s chemists then embarked on a program to create a series of “adenosine mimetics”, molecules that would induce the biological effects associated with specific stimulation of the A1 subreceptor without the undesired biological actions of native adenosine. These efforts led to the discovery of trabodenoson, which is currently in Phase 3 development.

					Full Description



Inotek Pharmaceuticals Corporation, incorporated on July 7, 1999, is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies for glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Its lead product candidate, trabodenoson, is a selective adenosine mimetic that the Company has designed to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) by restoring the eye's natural pressure control mechanism. The Company developed this molecule to selectively stimulate a particular adenosine subreceptor in the eye with the effect of augmenting the intrinsic function of the eye's trabecular meshwork (TM).The Company's product pipeline includes trabodenoson monotherapy delivered in an eye drop formulation, as well as a fixed-dose combination (FDC), of trabodenoson with latanoprost given once-daily (QD). The Company is evaluating the potential of trabodenoson to slow the loss of vision associated with glaucoma and degenerative retinal diseases. The Company has completed Phase II trial of trabodenoson co-administered with latanoprost, a prostaglandin analogue (PGA). It has initiated its Phase III program for trabodenoson monotherapy.The Company competes with Novartis International AG, Pfizer, Inc., Allergan Inc., Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Santen Inc., Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Glaukos Corporation.

Inotek Pharmaceuticals Corp Company Profile

IndustryBiotechnology & Drugs
SectorHealthcare
Employees24
Equity TypeORD


Inotek Pharmaceuticals Corporation is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies for glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Its lead product candidate, trabodenoson, is a selective adenosine mimetic that the Company has designed to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) by restoring the eye's natural pressure control mechanism. The Company developed this molecule to selectively stimulate a particular adenosine subreceptor in the eye with the effect of augmenting the intrinsic function of the eye's trabecular meshwork (TM). Its product pipeline includes trabodenoson monotherapy delivered in an eye drop formulation, as well as a fixed-dose combination (FDC), of trabodenoson with latanoprost given once-daily (QD). The Company is evaluating the potential of trabodenoson to slow the loss of vision associated with glaucoma and degenerative retinal diseases.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion.

Description




Inotek Pharmaceuticals Corporation is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies for glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Its lead product candidate, trabodenoson, is a selective adenosine mimetic that the Company has designed to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) by restoring the eye's natural pressure control mechanism. The Company developed this molecule to selectively stimulate a particular adenosine subreceptor in the eye with the effect of augmenting the intrinsic function of the eye's trabecular meshwork (TM). Its product pipeline includes trabodenoson monotherapy delivered in an eye drop formulation, as well as a fixed-dose combination (FDC), of trabodenoson with latanoprost given once-daily (QD). The Company is evaluating the potential of trabodenoson to slow the loss of vision associated with glaucoma and degenerative retinal diseases.

At Inotek, we're working to define the future of glaucoma treatment.

Inotek Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies to treat glaucoma and other serious diseases of the eye. 

Use the links above to view videos of our key leaders and contributors discussing Inotek's mission, vision, and the potential therapeutic value of our lead product candidate, trabodenoson. 








A New Class of Glaucoma Therapy

Our most advanced product candidate, trabodenoson, is a highly selective adenosine mimetic and the first potential treatment for glaucoma of its kind.
Adenosine is an important molecule occurring naturally in the body that participates in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes. Inotek’s scientists have deconstructed adenosine’s complex biology to isolate the protective activity of the molecule, and subsequently to build it into novel therapeutics.
