Overview



Fishing enthusiasts will spend hours debating the virtues of different rods, reels, lures, and types of bait, but there is a small but hardy group of anglers who have figured out a way to get by without any gear at all. This documentary takes a look at the phenomenon of "noodling," in which a fisherman literally takes a deep breath, ducks under the water, and snatches a fish with his bare hands. Needless to say, it's not a method that works for everyone, and a few noodlers have discovered the hard way that what they thought was a fish turned out to be a snapping turtle or a beaver (which fend off sportsmen by biting back), but the sport has attracted a handful of ardent supporters, and director Bradley Beesley features interviews with several of them, as well as offering footage of a number of veteran noodlers in action. Okie Noodling also features an original musical score by the noted alternative rock band the Flaming Lips.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
