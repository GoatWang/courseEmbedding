Description

COLEMAN, Deborah: Soft Place To Fall (cut-out)
(1999 'Blind Pig')         (43:54/11) Von Jim Gaines produziertes und für meinen Geschmack etwas flach geratenes Rock/Bluesalbum. Durch die heftigen Mainstream-Sounds verliert sie ihre Raffinesse und Eigenständigkeit. Das Album klingt letztlich wie viele x-beliebige Produktionen. Schade / produced by Jim Gaines. Heavy mainstream rock sounds. Nothing special.

Guitarist Deborah Coleman plays blues informed by classic rock, with a deft, melodic hand and a deep, throaty voice that ranges from sobbing sorrow to a tough growl. Stop the Game buy CD music This 2007 release doesn't stray far from her usual MO, but offers the same high-quality playing and singing. Stop the Game songs Highlights include album-closer "Wagon Wheel," a frisky number with a Western swing bounce. Stop the Game CD music contains a single disc with 10 songs. Personnel: Deborah Coleman (vocals, guitar); Deborah Coleman (guitars); Bill Crawford (guitar, acoustic guitar); Billy Crawford (acoustic guitar); Jerome Heitman (bass guitar); Neil Shull (drums). Liner Note Author: John Stedman Stop the Game CD music. Recording information: Master Sound Studio Stop the Game buy CD music. Audio Mixer: Martin Atkinson. Photographer: Brian Smith. Deborah Coleman is one of the hardest working artists in the roots music business-constant touring, promotional work and recording projects, all done with an energy, enthusiasm and gusto that marks her out as a winner. But that would be nothing if she wasn't also seriously talented. As you will hear on this album she is a great songwriter, a unique and distinctive singer and one of the best guitarists on the planet. I remember inviting Deborah to make an album for me nearly 15 years ago now, but that was in the days when there were people in the game who believed there was gold to be mined in this indie blues label game and were splashing the cash about. But what is meant to be happens in the end and here we are with a wonderful album - contemporary, relevant and high energy but also with the 'realness' of the old time stuff. Check out the sheer catchiness of the instrumental Motor City II, the telling personal lyrics to Stop The Game and Zero, the absolute amount of inventiveness of the guitar everywhere, the soulful passion of the singing and the willingness to interweave rock elements with timeless blues and dashes of funk.   ...See Full Description

Decent Effort By Deborah ColemanFor a long time Deborah Coleman has been one of my favorite blues artist. But lately her efforts, in my opinion, doesn't reflex her talents and her ability to play and sing the blues the way she really can. This album is a decent effort but leaves you wanting more.By wjh453 (Chicago,IL)

Deborah Coleman: Livin' On Love
(2001 'Blind Pig')         (43:02/11) Kraftvolles Album der derzeit profiliertesten schwarzen Sängerin/Gitarristin. Von Jim Gaines in Memphis produzierte CD mit teils ausgeprägten Rockblues-Momenten, alles andere als dezent bzw. traditionell. Angenehm im Sound ist dies ein Album, das eher die Rock- als Bluesfreunde begeistern wird, allein schon wegen der rockigen Gitarren. Gut / powerful set delivered by one of today's most prolific female singer/guitarists. Produced by Jim Gaines in Memphis the album contains some heavy rocking blues. Purists won't dig this one. But it's a good one for fans of the harder sounds. Great rocking guitars! Well done.

Memorial Trees by Honoring a Life




    When you choose to have a memorial tree planted for your loved one, you are doing more than simply putting a plant in the ground.
    You are making a long-term commitment to the environment and implanting the memories of your loved one in our planet for countless
    years to come. A memorial tree is a unique tribute which provides global benefits like no other memorial gift could.




        What is a memorial tree?
    



What you receive:

A memorial tree planted in the area of greatest need, according to the planting schedule of the American Forests Organization. 
A memorial card to be sent to your home, or a person of your choosing which demonstrates the gift you have given.
Your name and message listed in this online memorial, and on the honoringalife.org website.



                    In today’s changing world with climate change and environment concerns, “Honoring a Life” allows for 
family and friends to plant a memorial tree in honor of their loved one and friend. The purchase of a tree creates a beautiful permanent record on the Honoring a Life website, www.honoringalife.org. Each tree is planted through the efforts of Forestry Services throughout North America who determine where the greatest needs for reforestation are. Once planted, the geographical location where the tree is planted will be added to the record. A beautiful card is also sent to the family signifying your thoughtful gesture.
