BG MOA Engine Oil Supplement
BG MOA® is the number one engine oil supplement! In a recent survey, dealers chose BG MOA® 6 to 1 over the next aftermarket supplier.
Modern engines run at increasingly higher temperatures. This, combined with the increasing regularity of stop-and-go driving, cause rapid depletion of critical oil additives. Without these protective additives, severe engine oil oxidation occurs. Oxidation reduces oil to heavy, black sludge in the crankcase, oil screens, oil passages, rocker arms and other critical areas of the engine.
