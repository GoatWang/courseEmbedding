HARVEY or HERVEY, WILLIAM (d. 1567), Clarenceux king-of-arms, first became a member of the College of Arms as Hampnes pursuivant-extraordinary, and was appointed Bluemantle pursuivant-in-ordinary 18 June 1536. In the latter capacity he accompanied his patron, William (afterwards Lord) Paget, on his embassy to France. Subsequently he was created Somerset herald, and while holding that office attended the funeral of Catherine, the queen-dowager of Henry VIII, being the only officer of arms who is mentioned in the descriptions of the ceremony. He was sent on official business to the king of Denmark, to the Emperor Charles V, and, with Dr. Wotton, to the Duke of Saxony. By patent, dated 4 Feb. 1549–50, Edward VI created him Norroy king-of-arms. In that capacity he paid seven official visits to Germany. Queen Mary deputed him to go to France to declare war (7 June 1557), Garter and Norroy kings-of-arms proclaiming the war in London. He was created Clarenceux king-of-arms 21 Nov. 1557. He injured his reputation by a disgraceful quarrel at Turvey, Bedfordshire, while at the funeral of Lord Mordaunt, and the earl marshal temporarily prohibited him from visiting his province. Harvey died at Thame, Oxfordshire, on 27 Feb. 1566–7. His portrait has been engraved by C. Hall. There are also engraved portraits of him, from illuminated grants of arms, in Dallaway's ‘Science of Heraldry’ (plate 12), and in Daniell's Supplement to Thane's ‘British Autography,’ 1854.
He collected notes on the churches in the diocese of Norwich. These came into the hands of Sir William Le Neve, who placed them at the disposal of Weever, author of the ‘Funerall Monuments.’ Of the numerous heraldic visitations made by Harvey the following have been printed: 1. ‘Essex’ (1558), Harl. Soc. vol. xiii., London (1878), edited by Walter C. Metcalfe, F.S.A. 2. ‘Suffolk’ (1561), edited by Joseph Jackson Howard, LL.D., F.S.A., 2 vols., Lowestoft, 1866, 8vo; and again by Walter C. Metcalfe, Exeter, 1882, 4to. 3. ‘Norfolk’ (1563), edited by the Rev. G. H. Dashwood, F.S.A., for the Norfolk and Norwich Archæological Society, Norwich, 1878, 8vo. 4. ‘Dorsetshire’ (1565), edited by Walter C. Metcalfe from the Harleian MSS. 888 and 1092, and printed at Exeter (one hundred copies only) in 1887. 5. ‘Oxfordshire’ (1566), Harl. Soc. vol. v., London, 1871, 8vo, edited by W. H. Turner. 6. ‘Bedfordshire’ (1566), edited by Frederic Augustus Blaydes, Harl. Soc. vol. xix., London, 1884, 8vo.

[Athenæum, 4 June 1887, p. 739; Bromley's Cat. of Engraved Portraits, p. 29; Dallaway's Science of Heraldry, plate 11; Evans's Cat. of Engraved Portraits, No. 17122; Gough's British Topography, i. 157, 161, 183, 348, ii. 1, 40, 188, 243, 317, 405; Granger's Biog. Hist. of England, 5th edit. i. 302; Herald and Genealogist, i. 39, 80, 82, 116, 117, 119, 122, ii. 203, 283, 490, 491, 520; Noble's College of Arms, pp. 129, 143, 144, 153, 168; Rymer's Fœdera (Hague edit.), vol. vi. pt. iii. pp. 172, 179, 181, pt. iv. 39, 60; Cal. of State Papers, Dom. 1547–80, pp. 131, 143, 249.]
