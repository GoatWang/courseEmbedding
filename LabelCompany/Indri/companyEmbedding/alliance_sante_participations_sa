Imagine a 360-degree view around your SUV. 
That’s the innovative idea behind the available Multi-view Camera System. It features four cameras that offer a 360-degree view around your Santa Fe. This system includes a forward-view cornering camera mounted on the front grille, two cameras incorporated into the side mirrors, and a rearview camera. When the system is on, the driver initially sees an aerial view of the vehicle, then can select from front, rear and side camera views. All camera views are displayed on the central in-dash navigation screen at low parking speeds, the display then automatically switches back to normal display.

Its advanced V6 engine is smooth as silk—tough as nails.
Quite simply there’s more zip when you need it. Santa Fe offers more standard V6 horsepower than the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Nissan Pathfinder and Mazda CX-9. It gives power-on-demand a whole new meaning.

xClaim based on comparison of specifications on manufacturer websites.














A comfortable space that you can do so much with. 
It starts with standard seats for 7, or 6 that includes available second-row captain’s chairs. Got gear? Santa Fe’s seats can be stowed to make the most of its total interior volume, which is greater than the Toyota Highlander, Dodge Durango and Mazda CX-9.

Experience a more elegant way to park.
Just pull the switch located on the center console near the shifter to set this available feature. When the available Electronic Parking Brake is set, it disengages automatically once the gas pedal is depressed. And there’s an Automatic Vehicle Hold feature that will engage the parking brake automatically after the brake is depressed, without your foot on the pedal.

A bigger standard touchscreen display is a Santa Fe class exclusive.
A new 7-inch color LCD touchscreen and rearview camera are standard on the Santa Fe. This new display controls an audio system with AM/FM/CD/MP3, HD Radio™ technology, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, plus built-in smartphone/USB and auxiliary input jacks.

Drivers get a better view on twisting roads.
A lighting system that moves the headlights in sync with your vehicle is an innovation that makes perfect sense. That’s the idea behind Santa Fe’s available Dynamic Bending Light. It’s designed to turn the headlights with the direction of the curve as you turn the steering wheel.

Access this advanced feature by pressing a button and selecting from three modes: Eco, Normal or Sport to customize your steering effort and feel.

The day's horoscope
for mercredi 26 juillet 2017

Aries
            21 mars - 20 avril
        


Love 
Don't spend too much today trying to impress the person you love; it's time to make the move now.


Work
Today you should check the legal aspects of your enterprise and of the firms you are working with. Don't hesitate to take decisions if necessary.


Money
Today it seems someone is trying to pass on a liability giving you false assurances of quick gains. It would be better to stick to routine activities.


Life/Leisure
A good day for putting everything in order within yourself, in your home, and around you; get rid of everything that has been blocking you until now.

Imagine a 360-degree view around your SUV. 
That’s the innovative idea behind the available Multi-view Camera System. It features four cameras that offer a 360-degree view around your Santa Fe. This system includes a forward-view cornering camera mounted on the front grille, two cameras incorporated into the side mirrors, and a rearview camera. When the system is on, the driver initially sees an aerial view of the vehicle, then can select from front, rear and side camera views. All camera views are displayed on the central in-dash navigation screen at low parking speeds, the display then automatically switches back to normal display.

Its advanced V6 engine is smooth as silk—tough as nails.
Quite simply there’s more zip when you need it. Santa Fe offers more standard V6 horsepower than the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Nissan Pathfinder and Mazda CX-9. It gives power-on-demand a whole new meaning.
Legal
xClaim based on comparison of specifications on manufacturer websites.














A comfortable space that you can do so much with. 
It starts with standard seats for 7, or 6 that includes available second-row captain’s chairs. Got gear? Santa Fe’s seats can be stowed to make the most of its total interior volume, which is greater than the Toyota Highlander, Dodge Durango and Mazda CX-9.

xClaim based on comparison of specifications on manufacturer websites.














Experience a more elegant way to park.
Just pull the switch located on the center console near the shifter to set this available feature. When the available Electronic Parking Brake is set, it disengages automatically once the gas pedal is depressed. And there’s an Automatic Vehicle Hold feature that will engage the parking brake automatically after the brake is depressed, without your foot on the pedal.

xClaim based on comparison of specifications on manufacturer websites.














A bigger standard touchscreen display is a Santa Fe class exclusive.
A new 7-inch color LCD touchscreen and rearview camera are standard on the Santa Fe. This new display controls an audio system with AM/FM/CD/MP3, HD Radio™ technology, SiriusXM Satellite Radio, plus built-in smartphone/USB and auxiliary input jacks.

Drivers get a better view on twisting roads.
A lighting system that moves the headlights in sync with your vehicle is an innovation that makes perfect sense. That’s the idea behind Santa Fe’s available Dynamic Bending Light. It’s designed to turn the headlights with the direction of the curve as you turn the steering wheel.

                         You’ll appreciate everything that’s included.
Santa Fe’s standard Drive Mode Select is not available on any other primary competitor. Access this advanced feature by pressing a button and selecting from three modes: Eco, Normal or Sport to customize your steering effort and feel. Additional high-value standard features and awards are shown below.
