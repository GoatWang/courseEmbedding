In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

ATEL 16, LLC – Investment Loss Investigation




(Last Updated On: May 13, 2016)Have you suffered investment losses in ATEL 16, LLC? If so, the securities attorneys of The White Law Group may be able to help you recover your losses by filing a FINRA Dispute Resolution claim against the brokerage firm that sold you the investment.

According to the prospectus, ATEL 16 was an investment offering to raise capital to purchase a portfolio of leased equipment, equipment financing transactions and other investments leased to major corporations. ATEL intended to use 87% of the capital it raised from the sale of “units” to purchase its portfolio.
Compared to traditional investments, such as stocks, bonds or mutual funds, the purchase of ‘units” in a Limited Liability Company (LLC), like ATEL 16, are considerably more complex and involve a high degree of risk. Unfortunately many investors were not made adequately aware of the risks and liquidity problems associated with the investment.
The risk factors listed on ATEL 16’s prospectus include:

The Fund does not guarantee its distributions or the return of investors’ capital
Most of the Fund’s distributions will be, and most of the prior ATEL programs’ distributions have been, a return of capital and not a return on capital
No market exists for the Units or is expected to develop, the Fund’s Operating Agreement includes significant restrictions on the transferability of Units, and an investor may be unable to sell his Units or able to sell the Units only at a significant discount
The Fund will pay the Manager and its related companies substantial fees
The Manager will be subject to certain conflicts of interest

In addition, some brokers may have downplayed the risks associated with the purchase of LLC units and misled investors into thinking that they were “safe” investments. The 9% sales commission brokers earned for selling ATEL 16 may have provide some brokers with enough incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors.
Broker dealers are required to perform adequate due diligence on any investment they recommend and to ensure that all recommendations are suitable for the investor. Recommendations should be inline with the investor’s age, risk tolerance, net worth, and investment experience.
Broker dealers that fail to adequately disclose risks or make unsuitable investment recommendations can be held liable for investment losses.
If you have invested in ATEL 16 and would like to speak to a securities attorney about the potential to recover your investment losses, please call The White Law Group at 1-888-637-5510 for a free consultation.
The White Law Group, LLC is a national securities fraud, securities arbitration, investor protection, and securities regulation/compliance law firm with offices in Chicago, Illinois and Vero Beach, Florida.

Exhibit 10.1
 
ATEL 16, LLC ESCROW
AGREEMENT
____________, 2013
 

U. S. Bank, National
Association

San Francisco,
California
 

Gentlemen:
 

ATEL 16, LLC, a
California limited liability company (the “Fund”),
proposes to make a public offering through ATEL Securities
Corporation (the “Dealer Manager”) and other registered
broker-dealers (the “Selected Dealers”) of not to
exceed

15,000,000 of its
units of limited liability company member interest (the
“Units”) at $10 per Unit. The offering shall be
conducted on a best-efforts all-or-none basis for the first 120,000
Units and thereafter on a best-efforts basis for the remaining
Units. The offering shall commence at such time as the Fund’s
registration statement on Form S-1 with respect thereto (the
“Registration Statement”) is declared effective by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) which is
currently expected to occur on or about __________,

2013. We are
requesting that you consent to act as Depository in connection with
the offering.
 

U.S. Bank, National
Association (“you” or “Depository”) shall
receive, hold in escrow and disburse subscription funds in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this letter
and in the “Plan of Distribution” section of the
prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as amended or
supplemented (such prospectus in the form first filed with the SEC
pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and any supplement or amendment to such prospectus thereafter so
filed pursuant to such Rule 424 are hereinafter collectively called
the “Prospectus”).
 

Upon request of ATEL
Managing Member LLC (the “Manager”) or the Dealer
Manager, you shall provide reports to the Fund and the Dealer
Manager as to the number and amount of subscriptions received by
you.
 

The terms and
conditions of your engagement as Depository shall be as
follows:
 

1. On or before the
date of commencement of the offering you shall establish an
interest-bearing escrow account which shall be entitled “ATEL
16 Escrow Account” (the “Escrow Account”). The
Dealer Manager will comply with Rule 15c2-4 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as interpreted in NASD Notice to Members
84-64, which requires that during the escrow period checks be
transmitted by the Dealer Manager to you as escrow agent as soon as
practicable, but in any event by noon of the second business day
following receipt by the Dealer Manager. The Dealer Manager and
Selected Dealers shall instruct subscribers to make checks payable
to the order of U.S. Bank, National Association by designating the
payee as “U.S. Bank – ATEL 16 Escrow.” You shall
return any checks received that are made payable to a party other
than the Depository to the Dealer Manager or Selected Dealer who
submitted the check.
 

2. The Dealer Manager
and the Selected Dealers shall promptly deliver all monies received
for the payment of Units to the Depository for deposit in the
Escrow Account. You shall receive and hold deposits of subscription
funds in the amount of $10 per Unit. The minimum subscription shall
be 500 Units ($5,000), subject, however, to such higher minimum
subscriptions as are described in the Prospectus as being
applicable in certain circumstances. Each deposit shall be
accompanied by a Subscription Agreement in the form of that
attached as Exhibit C to the Prospectus identifying by name and
address the subscriber whose funds are deposited and the amount of
the funds deposited by such subscriber.
 

3. Deposits in the
form of checks which fail to clear the bank upon which they are
drawn shall be returned by the Depository to the subscriber,
together with the copy of the Subscription Agreement. You shall
concurrently furnish to the Manager and the Dealer Manager a copy
of any such Subscription Agreement and check so returned. The
Depository shall have no further liability therefor.
 

If the Fund rejects
any subscription for which the Depository has already collected
funds, the Depository shall promptly issue a refund check to the
rejected subscriber. If the Fund rejects any subscription for which
the Depository has not yet collected funds but has submitted the
subscriber’s check for collection, the Depository shall
promptly issue a check in the amount of the subscriber’s
check to the rejected subscriber after the Depository has cleared
such funds. If the Depository has not yet submitted a rejected
subscriber’s check for collection, the Depository shall
promptly remit the subscriber’s check directly to the
subscriber.
 

4. You shall place
funds from the Escrow Account only in the following
interest-bearing accounts and short-term obligations as the Fund
shall direct: short-term United States government securities,
including Treasury bills, securities issued or guaranteed by United
States government agencies, certificates of deposit and time or
demand deposits in banks and savings and loan associations which
are insured by United States government agencies or deposits in
members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System; provided, however,
that you shall not be required to place any such funds in a manner
which is inconsistent with the Prospectus. In the absence of
express instructions, you will invest such funds, to the extent
reasonably practicable, in a U. S. Bank Money Market Account
insured by the FDIC. As Depository you shall not be liable for any
loss of interest in the event funds are withdrawn prior to
maturity. Interest accrued on subscription funds held in the Escrow
Account shall not be an asset of the Fund, but shall either (i) be
paid to the respective subscribers upon return
of subscription proceeds to subscribers pursuant to paragraph 5 of
this Agreement in the event the Minimum Subscriptions (as defined
in paragraph 5) are not received prior to termination of the
offering); or (ii) be paid to the Fund upon release of subscription
proceeds to the Fund for disbursement by the Fund to
subscribers , in either case to be divided among
the subscribers on a pro rata basis according to the respective
numbers of days between the time of deposit of their payments into
the Escrow Account and the release of such payments to the Fund or
the return thereof to the subscribers , and in either case with the
amounts of interest allocated among subscribers to be calculated by
the Manager.

 





 








 




 

During the escrow
period, the proceeds from the Fund’s offering are not subject
to claims by creditors, the Fund, the Fund’s affiliates, you
as the escrow agent, or Selected Dealers unless and until the
proceeds have been released to the Fund pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.
 

5. If and at such time
as amounts in collected funds representing subscriptions for not
less than 120,000 Units shall have been deposited with you under
this Agreement (the “Minimum Subscriptions”), you shall
so notify the Manager and the Dealer Manager and upon receipt of
written instructions from each of the Fund and the Dealer Manager,
you shall disburse to the Fund all subscription funds held by you.
If the offering is terminated prior to receipt of collected funds
representing the Minimum Subscriptions, or if collected funds
representing the Minimum Subscriptions have not been received on or
before the date which is one year from the date that the
Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, you shall
promptly disburse all subscription funds to the subscribers who
transmitted them without deduction, penalty or expense to the
subscriber, and you shall advise the Fund and the Dealer Manager
that you have done so. The subscription funds returned to each
subscriber shall be free and clear of any and all claims of the
Fund or any of its creditors. In any case, all interest earned on
subscription proceeds held by you shall be disbursed to subscribers
as provided in paragraph 4, with the Manager providing the
Depository with the calculation of interest payable to each
subscriber. After all disbursements under this Agreement have been
completed, the escrow shall be terminated; provided, however, that
an agreement with a branch of Depository will be effective upon
escrow holder notifying the branch that the Minimum Subscriptions
have been reached and escrow is closed. The branch will agree to
facilitate transfers of subscription funds to the Fund in the event
subscribers make checks payable to the Depository after the date
Minimum Subscriptions have been received. The branch’s sole
function in such event shall be to endorse any such subscription
checks to the account of the Fund.
 

For purposes of the
foregoing, the term “coll

The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.
