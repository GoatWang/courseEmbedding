Section 2.5. Notice of Breach
. The representations and warranties set forth in Section
2.3 and Section 2.4 shall survive the transfers and
assignments of the Trust Assets to the Trust, the pledge of the
Receivables and the Collateral Certificates to the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to the Indenture, and the issuance of the
Notes. Upon discovery by any Transferor, the Servicer, the
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee of a breach of any of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.3 or
Section 2.4 , the party discovering such breach shall give
prompt written notice to the other parties following such
discovery.

Section 2.6. Transfer of
Ineligible Receivables and Ineligible Collateral
Certificates.

(a) Reassignment of
Collateral . In the event (i) any representation or
warranty contained in subsection 2.4(f) , (g) ,
(h) , (m) , (n) , (o) , (p) ,
(q) or (r) of this Agreement is not true and correct
in any material respect as of the date specified therein with
respect to any Receivable, any Collateral Certificate or the
related Account and such breach has a material adverse effect on
any Noteholders unless cured within 60 days (or such longer period,
not in excess of 120 days, as may be agreed to by the Indenture
Trustee and the Servicer) after the earlier to occur of the
discovery thereof by the Transferor that conveyed such Receivable
or Collateral Certificate to the Trust or receipt by such
Transferor of written notice thereof given by the Indenture
Trustee, the Owner Trustee or the Servicer, or (ii) it is so
provided in subsection 2.9(a) with respect to any
Receivables conveyed to the Trust by such Transferor, then such
Transferor shall accept reassignment of the Ineligible Receivables
or the Ineligible Collateral Certificates on the terms and
conditions set forth in paragraph (b) below.

(b) Procedures for Removal
. When the provisions of subsection 2.6(a) above
require (i) the removal of a Receivable, the applicable Transferor
shall accept reassignment of such Receivable (each such Receivable,
an “ Ineligible Receivable ”) by directing the
Servicer to deduct the principal balance of each such Ineligible
Receivable from the Pool Balance and to decrease the Transferor
Amount by the principal balance of such Ineligible Receivable or
(ii) the removal of a Collateral Certificate, the Indenture Trustee
and the Issuer shall deliver such
 
27


Collateral Certificate (each such Collateral
Certificate, an “ Ineligible Collateral Certificate
”) to the applicable Transferor with a valid assignment in
the name of such Transferor and direct the Servicer to deduct the
Invested Amount of each such Ineligible Collateral Certificate from
the Pool Balance and to decrease the Transferor Amount by the
Invested Amount of each such Ineligible Collateral
Certificate. On and after the date of such removal, the
principal balance of each Ineligible Receivable and the Invested
Amount of each Ineligible Collateral Certificate shall be deducted
from the Pool Balance and the Transferor Amount. In the event
that the exclusion of an Ineligible Receivable or an Ineligible
Collateral Certificate from the calculation of the Transferor
Amount and the Pool Balance would cause the Transferor Amount to be
reduced below the Required Transferor Amount or the Pool Balance to
be reduced below the Required Pool Balance, the Transferor who
conveyed such Ineligible Receivable or Ineligible Collateral
Certificate shall immediately, but in no event later than 1:00
p.m., New York City time, on the first Payment Date following the
Monthly Period in which such reassignment obligation arises, make a
deposit in the Excess Funding Account in immediately available
funds in an amount equal to the greater of the amount by which (x)
the Transferor Amount would be reduced below the Required
Transferor Amount or (y) the Pool Balance would be reduced below
the Required Pool Balance.

Upon reassignment of any Ineligible
Receivable or Ineligible Collateral Certificate, the Indenture
Trustee and the Trust shall automatically and without further
action transfer, assign, set-over and otherwise convey to the
applicable Transferor or its designee, without recourse,
representation or warranty, all the right, title and interest of
the Indenture Trustee and the Trust in and to such Ineligible
Receivable or Ineligible Collateral Certificate, all Recoveries
related thereto, all monies and amounts due or to become due and
all proceeds thereof and such reassigned Ineligible Receivable or
Ineligible Collateral Certificate shall be treated by the Indenture
Trustee and the Trust as collected in full as of the date on which
it was reassigned. The obligation of each Transferor to accept
reassignment of any Ineligible Receivable or Ineligible Collateral
Certificate conveyed to the Trust by such Transferor, and to make
the deposits, if any, required to be made to the Excess Funding
Account as provided in this Section 2.6 , shall constitute
the sole remedy respecting the event giving rise to such obligation
available to the Trust or the Noteholders (or the Indenture Trustee
on behalf of the Noteholders). The Trust shall execute such
documents and instruments of transfer or assignment and take such
other actions as shall reasonably be requested and provided by the
applicable Transferor to effect the conveyance of such Ineligible
Receivable or Ineligible Collateral Certificate pursuant to this
subsection 2.6(b) , but only upon receipt of an
Officer’s Certificate from such Transferor that states that
all conditions set forth in this Section 2.6 have been
satisfied.

Section 2.7. Reassignment of
Trust Assets . (a) In the event any representation or
warranty of a Transferor set forth in subsection 2.3(a) or
(c) or subsection 2.4(a) , (b) , (c) ,
(d) , (e) or (i) of this Agreement is not true
and correct in any material respect and such breach has a material
adverse effect on the Receivables or a particular Collateral
Certificate conveyed to the Trust by such Transferor or the
availability of the proceeds thereof to the Trust then, either the
Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or Noteholders evidencing more
than 50% of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all
Outstanding Notes, by notice then given to the applicable
Transferor, the Administrator and the Servicer (and to the Owner
Trustee and the Indenture Trustee, if given by the Noteholders),
may direct such Transferor to accept a reassignment of the
Receivables and/or any such Collateral Certificate conveyed to the
Trust by such Transferor

pursuant to this Agreement, if such breach and
any material adverse effect caused by such breach is not cured
within 60 days of such notice (or within such longer period as may
be specified in such notice), and upon those conditions such
Transferor shall be obligated to accept such reassignment on the
terms set forth below; provided , however , that the
affected Receivables and the affected Collateral Certificates will
not be reassigned to such Transferor if, on any day during such
applicable period the relevant representation and warranty shall be
true and correct in all material respects as if made on such
day. The applicable Transferor shall deposit the portion of
the Reassignment Amount attributable to the applicable Receivables
and Collateral Certificates in the Collection Account to be treated
(i) in connection with amounts determined under clause (a) of the
definition of “Reassignment Amount,” as Principal
Collections for each Series of Notes and (ii) in connection with
the amounts determined under clause (b) of the definition of
“Reassignment Amount,” as Finance Charge Collections
for each Series of Notes, in either case, in immediately available
funds not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the First
Note Transfer Date following the Monthly Period in which such
reassignment obligation arises, in payment for such
reassignment.

(b) If the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders give notice directing the
applicable Transferor to accept a reassignment of any Receivables
or any Collateral Certificate as provided above, the obligation of
such Transferor to accept such reassignment pursuant to this
Section 2.7 and to make the deposit required to be made to
the Collection Account for each Series of Notes as provided in this
Section 2.7 shall constitute the sole remedy respecting an
event of the type specified above in this Section 2.7
available to the Noteholders (or the Indenture Trustee on behalf of
the Noteholders). Upon reassignment of the affected
Receivables and any affected Collateral Certificate on the First
Note Transfer Date following the Monthly Period in which such
obligation arises, the Indenture Trustee and the Trust shall
automatically and without further action transfer, assign, set-over
and otherwise convey to the applicable Transferor, without
recourse, representation or warranty, all the right, title and
interest of the Indenture Trustee and the Trust in and to the
affected Receivables and affected Collateral Certificates, all
Recoveries allocable thereto, all monies and amounts due or to
become due with respect thereto and all proceeds thereof (and any
costs or expenses incurred by the Indenture Trustee in connection
with such reassignment shall be reimbursed by the applicable
Transferor). The Indenture Trustee and the Trust shall execute
such documents and instruments of transfer or assignment and take
such other actions as shall reasonably be requested by the
applicable Transferor to effect the conveyance of such property
pursuant to this Section 2.7 .

Section 2.8. Additional
Transferors . The Transferor may designate Affiliates of
the Transferor or of any Account Owner to be included as
Transferors (each, an “ Additional Transferor ”)
under this Agreement in an amendment hereto pursuant to
subsection 7.1(a) and, in connection with such
designation, such Transferor shall (i) if the Transferor Interest
is evidenced in uncertificated form, direct the Owner Trustee to
register in the books and records of the Trust such Additional
Transferor’s interest in the Transferor Interest or (ii) if
the Transferor Interest is evidenced in certificated form,
surrender such certificate to the Owner Trustee in exchange for a
newly issued certificate modified to reflect such Additional
Transferor’s interest in the Transferor Interest;
provided , however , that each Additional Transferor
shall agree in such amendment hereto to assume all of the duties
and obligations of a Transferor hereunder; and provided
further that prior to any such designation and exchange, (i)
the Owner Trustee shall have received an Issuer Tax Opinion, (ii)
the Note Rating Agency Condition shall have been
 
29


satisfied, (iii) the Master Trust Trustee shall
have received the Master Trust Tax Opinion, if applicable, and (iv)
any additional conditions to the transfer of a Beneficial Interest
provided in Section 3.02 of the Trust Agreement shall have
been satisfied.

Section 2.9. Covenants of Each
Transferor . Each Transferor hereby severally covenants
that:

(a) Receivables Not To Be
Evidenced by Promissory Notes . Except in connection with
its enforcement or collection of an Account, such Transferor will
take no action to cause any Receivable conveyed by it to the Trust
to be evidenced by any instrument (as defined in the UCC) and, if
any such Receivable is so evidenced as a result of any action taken
by such Transferor, it shall be deemed to be an Ineligible
Receivable in accordance with subsection 2.7(a) and shall be
reassigned to such Transferor in accordance with subsection
2.7(b) .

(b) Security Interests
. Except for the conveyances hereunder, such Transferor will
not sell, pledge, assign or transfer to any other Person, or grant,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (except as
permitted by clause (iv) of the definition of the term
“Eligible Receivable”) on any Receivable or Collateral
Certificate conveyed by it to the Trust whether now existing or
hereafter created, or any interest therein; and such Transferor
shall defend the right, title and interest of the Trust and the
Indenture Trustee in, to and under the Receivables and any
Collateral Certificate, whether now existing or hereafter created,
against all claims of third parties claiming through or under such
Transferor.

(c) Transferor Interest
. Except for (i) the conveyances hereunder, in connection with
any transaction permitted by Section 3.2 and as
provided in Section 2.8 of this Agreement and Section
4.04 of the Trust Agreement or (ii) conveyances with respect to
which the Note Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied
and an Issuer Tax Opinion shall have been delivered to the
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee, such Transferor agrees, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, not to Transfer (as
defined in the Trust Agreement) any interest in the Transferor
Interest and any such attempted Transfer shall be
void. Nothing contained in this subsection 2.9(c) shall
be interpreted to prohibit or in any way limit any
Transferor’s ability to grant to another Person a
participation interest in the Transferor Interest upon the delivery
to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee of an Issuer Tax
Opinion; provided that any transfer by a Transferor of all
or any part of its right, title and interest in and to the
Transferor Interest to Credco will not require delivery of an
Issuer Tax Opinion.

(d) Delivery of Collections or
Recoveries . In the event that such Transferor receives
Collections or Recoveries, such Transferor agrees to pay the
Servicer all such Collections and Recoveries as soon as practicable
after receipt thereof.

(e) Notice of Liens
. Such Transferor shall notify the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee promptly after becoming aware of any Lien (except
as permitted by clause (iv) of the definition of the term
“Eligible Receivable”) on any Receivable or Collateral
Certificate conveyed by it to the Trust other than the conveyances
hereunder and under the Indenture.

(f) Account Agreements and
Guidelines . Each Transferor that is an Account Owner
covenants that it shall comply with and perform its obligations
under the Account
 
30


Agreements relating to the Accounts and the
Account Guidelines and all applicable rules and regulations of such
Transferor except insofar as any failure to comply or perform would
not materially and adversely affect the rights of the Trust or the
Noteholders; provided , however , the applicable
Transferor may change the terms and provisions of the applicable
Account Agreements or the applicable Account Guidelines in any
respect (including the calculation of the amount, or the timing, of
charge-offs and other fees to be assessed thereon) only if such
change (i) would not, in the reasonable belief of such applicable
Transferor, cause an Early Amortization Event or Event of Default
to occur, and (ii) is made applicable to any comparable segment of
the charge accounts owned by such applicable Transferor which have
characteristics the same as, or substantially similar to, the
Accounts that are the subject of such change, except as otherwise
restricted by an endorsement, sponsorship, or other agreement
between such applicable Transferor and an unrelated third party or
by the terms of the Account Agreements.

(g) Separate Corporate
Existence . Each Transferor that is a securitization
special purpose entity shall:

(i) Maintain in full effect its
existence, rights and franchises as a limited liability company
under the laws of the state of its formation or as a corporation
under the laws of the state of its incorporation and will obtain
and preserve its qualification to do business in each jurisdiction
in which such qualification is or shall be necessary to protect the
validity and enforceability of this Agreement and the applicable
Receivables Purchase Agreement and each other instrument or
agreement necessary or appropriate to proper administration hereof
and to permit and effectuate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(ii) Except as provided in this
Agreement, maintain its own deposit, securities and other account
or accounts, separate from those of any Affiliate of such
Transferor, with financial institutions. The funds of such
Transferor will not be diverted to any other Person or for other
than the company use of such Transferor, and, except as may be
expressly permitted by this Agreement or the applicable Receivables
Purchase Agreement, the funds of such Transferor shall not be
commingled with those of any other Person.

(iii) Ensure that, to the extent
that it shares the same officers or other employees as any of its
members or other Affiliates, the salaries of and the expenses
related to providing benefits to such officers and other employees
shall be fairly allocated among such entities, and each such entity
shall bear its fair share of the salary and benefit costs
associated with all such common officers and employees.

(iv) Ensure that, to the extent that
it jointly contracts with any of its members or other Affiliates to
do business with vendors or service providers or to share overhead
expenses, the costs incurred in so doing shall be allocated fairly
among such entities, and each such entity shall bear its fair share
of such costs. To the extent that such Transferor contracts or
does business with vendors or service providers where the goods and
services provided are partially for the benefit of any other
Person, the costs incurred in so doing shall be fairly allocated to
or among such entities for whose benefit the goods and services are
provided, and each such entity shall bear its fair share of such
costs.
 
31



(v) Ensure that all material
transactions between such Transferor and any of its Affiliates
shall be only on an arm’s-length basis and shall not be on
terms more favorable to either party than the terms that would be
found in a similar transaction involving unrelated third
parties.

(vi) Maintain a principal executive
and administrative office through which its business is conducted
and a telephone number separate from those of its members and other
Affiliates. To the extent that such Transferor and any of its
members or other Affiliates have offices in contiguous space, there
shall be fair and appropriate allocation of overhead costs
(including rent) among them, and each such entity shall bear its
fair share of such expenses.

(vii) Conduct its affairs strictly
in accordance with its certificate of formation and limited
liability company agreement or its certificate of incorporation and
bylaws and observe all necessary, appropriate and customary company
formalities, including, but not limited to, holding all regular and
special members’ and directors’ meetings appropriate to
authorize all action, keeping separate and accurate minutes of such
meetings, passing all resolutions or consents necessary to
authorize actions taken or to be taken, and maintaining accurate
and separate books, records and accounts, including, but not
limited to, intercompany transaction accounts. Regular
members’ and directors’ meetings shall be held at least
annually.

(viii) Ensure that its board of
directors shall at all times include at least one Independent
Director (for purposes hereof, “Independent Director”
shall mean any member of the board of directors of such Transferor
that is not and has not at any time been (x) an officer, agent,
advisor, consultant, attorney, accountant, employee, member or
shareholder of any Affiliate of such Transferor which is not a
special purpose entity, (y) a director of any Affiliate of such
Transferor other than an independent director of any Affiliate
which is a special purpose entity or (z) a member of the immediate
family of any of the foregoing).

(ix) Ensure that decisions with
respect to its business and daily operations shall be independently
made by such Transferor (although the officer making any particular
decision may also be an officer or director of an Affiliate of such
Transferor) and shall not be dictated by an Affiliate of such
Transferor.

(x) Act solely in its own company
name and through its own authorized officers and agents, and no
Affiliate of such Transferor shall be appointed to act as agent of
such Transferor. Such Transferor shall at all times use its
own stationery and business forms and describe itself as a separate
legal entity.

(xi) Other than as provided in the
relevant Revolving Credit Agreement, ensure that no Affiliate of
such Transferor shall advance funds or loan money to such
Transferor, and no Affiliate of such Transferor will otherwise
guaranty debts of such Transferor.
 
32



(xii) Other than organizational
expenses and as expressly provided herein, pay all expenses,
indebtedness and other obligations incurred by it using its own
funds.

(xiii) Not enter into any guaranty,
or otherwise become liable, with respect to or hold its assets or
creditworthiness out as being available for the payment of any
obligation of any Affiliate of such Transferor nor shall such
Transferor make any loans to any Person.

(xiv) Ensure that any financial
reports required of such Transferor shall comply with generally
accepted accounting principles and shall be issued separately from,
but may be consolidated with, any reports prepared for any of its
Affiliates so long as such consolidated reports contain footnotes
describing the effect of the transactions between such Transferor
and such Affiliate and also state that the assets of such
Transferor are not available to pay creditors of the
Affiliate.

(xv) Ensure that at all times it is
adequately capitalized to engage in the transactions contemplated
in its certificate of formation and its limited liability company
agreement or in its certificate of incorporation and
bylaws.

(h) Compliance with the FDIC
Rule . Such Transferor shall (i) perform the obligations
of the FDIC Rule applicable to it and (ii) facilitate compliance
with the FDIC Rule by each Account Owner and the Trust.

Section 2.10. Covenants of Each
Transferor With Respect to Any Applicable Receivables Purchase
Agreement . Each Transferor, if such Transferor is a party
to a Receivables Purchase Agreement, in its capacity as purchaser
of Receivables from any Account Owner pursuant to any such
Receivables Purchase Agreement, hereby covenants that such
Transferor will at all times enforce the covenants and agreements
of any Account Owner in such Receivables Purchase Agreement,
including covenants that the Account Owner shall at all times
enforce the covenants and agreements of it, as the case may be, in
any Receivables Purchase Agreement. Each Transferor further
covenants that it will not enter into any amendment to any
Receivables Purchase Agreement to which it is a party, or enter
into a new Receivables Purchase Agreement unless the Note Rating
Agency Condition shall have been satisfied; provided ,
however , that such Transferor may enter into an amendment
to a Receivables Purchase Agreement to which it is a party without
the Note Rating Agency Condition having been satisfied if the
“Note Rating Agency Condition” (as defined in such
Receivables Purchase Agreement) need not be satisfied in connection
with such amendment pursuant to the terms of such Receivables
Purchase Agreement.

Section 2.11. Reinvestment in
Trust Assets . (a) On each First Note Transfer Date,
the Reinvestment Amount for the immediately preceding Monthly
Period shall be applied in the following order of
priority:

(i) if the Trust Assets include one
or more Collateral Certificates, the Transferor, on behalf of the
Issuer, shall specify the amount of the Reinvestment Amount to be
reinvested in each existing Collateral Certificate, which amount
shall be determined by the Transferor, on behalf of the Issuer, in
its own discretion, and no such reinvestment shall be
 
33


required; provided , however ,
that, subject to the restrictions specified in subsection
2.12(c) , the Transferor, on behalf of the Issuer, shall be
required to increase the Invested Amount of an existing Collateral
Certificate if Trust Assets are required to be added pursuant to
subsection 2.13(a) and the Transferor elects to cause to be
increased the Invested Amount of one or more existing Collateral
Certificates as specified in such Section (so long as the
applicable Series Supplement allows such reinvestment and the
transferor or seller for the related Master Trust agrees to such
reinvestment); and

(ii) the remainder of such amounts
shall be paid to the holders of the Transferor Interest;
provided , however , that if (A) the Transferor
Amount is, or as a result of such payment would become, less than
the Required Transferor Amount or (B) the Pool Balance is, or as a
result of such payment would become, less than the Required Pool
Balance (after taking into consideration the application of the
Reinvestment Amount, if any, pursuant to this Section 2.11
), the lesser of (1) such remaining amount and (2) the greater of
the amount by which (x) the Required Transferor Amount is greater
than the Transferor Amount or (y) the Required Pool Balance is
greater than the Pool Balance, shall be deposited by the Servicer
into the Excess Funding Account.

(b) Pursuant to this Agreement, each
Receivable shall be transferred to the Trust and pledged to secure
the Notes on the day that such Receivable arises.

Section 2.12. Increases in the
Invested Amount of an Existing Collateral Certificate
.

(a) In addition to the increases
described in Section 2.11 above, the applicable Transferor
may cause to be increased the Invested Amount of any existing
Collateral Certificate on any Business Day in connection
with:

(i) the issuance of an additional
Series, Class or Tranche of Notes; or

(ii) the increase of the Transferor
Amount.

(b) In connection with any increase
in the Invested Amount of an existing Collateral Certificate, such
increase shall either be funded from the proceeds of the issuance
of an additional Series, Class or Tranche of Notes or be funded by
the applicable Transferor.

(c) Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, with respect to any Monthly Period,
the Invested Amount of an existing Collateral Certificate shall not
be increased, including increases pursuant to Section 2.11
and this Section 2.12 , if (i) an Early Amortization Event
shall have occurred with respect to any Notes as a result of a
failure to add Receivables and/or Collateral Certificates to the
Trust or a failure to increase the Invested Amount of an existing
Collateral Certificate at a time when the Pool Balance for the
prior Monthly Period is less than the Required Pool Balance for
such prior Monthly Period and (ii) increasing the Invested Amount
of or reinvesting in an existing Collateral Certificate would
result in a reduction in the allocation percentage applicable for
principal collections for such existing Collateral
Certificate.
 
34



Section 2.13. Addition of Trust
Assets .

(a) Required Additions
.

(i) If, at the end of any Monthly
Period, (a) the Transferor Amount for such Monthly Period is less
than the Required Transferor Amount for such Monthly Period, (b)
the Pool Balance for such Monthly Period is less than the Required
Pool Balance for such Monthly Period or (c) the Seller’s
Interest Amount for such Monthly Period is less than the Required
Sellers’ Amount, the Transferor shall (1) transfer
Receivables in Aggregate Addition Accounts to the Trust, (2)
transfer one or more Collateral Certificates to the Trust or (3)
cause to be increased the Invested Amount of one or more existing
Collateral Certificates pursuant to Section 2.11 or
Section 2.12 in a sufficient amount such that, after giving
effect to such addition or increase, the Transferor Amount for such
Monthly Period is at least equal to the Required Transferor Amount
for such Monthly Period, the Pool Balance is at least equal to the
Required Pool Balance for such Monthly Period and the
Seller’s Interest Amount is at least equal to the Required
Seller’s Interest Amount for such Monthly Period.

Any transfer of Receivables in any
Aggregate Addition Accounts to the Trust and/or any transfer of
Collateral Certificates to the Trust and/or any increase in the
Invested Amount of one or more existing Collateral Certificates
shall occur on or before the thirtieth calendar day following the
end of such Monthly Period. The failure of the Transferor to
increase the Transferor Amount or the Pool Balance as provided in
this clause (i) solely as a result of the unavailability to the
Transferor of a sufficient amount of Receivables and/or Collateral
Certificates and/or the inability to cause to be increased the
Invested Amount of one or more existing Collateral Certificates
shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement; provided
that any such failure which has not been timely cured (as specified
in the related Indenture Supplement) may nevertheless result in the
occurrence of an Early Amortization Event with respect to each
Series for which, pursuant to the Indenture Supplement therefor, a
failure by the Transferor to convey additional Trust Assets to the
Trust or cause to be increased the Invested Amount of an existing
Collateral Certificate by the day on which it is required to do so
pursuant to this subsection 2.13(a) constitutes an “
Early Amortization Event ” (as defined in such
Indenture Supplement).

(ii) Any Aggregate Addition Accounts
or Collateral Certificates designated to be included as part of the
Trust Assets pursuant to clause (i) above may only be so included
if the applicable conditions specified in subsection (c) below have
been satisfied.

(b) Permitted Aggregate
Additions, Additional Collateral Certificates and Increases in the
Invested Amount of Existing Collateral Certificates . In
addition to its obligation under subsection 2.13(a) , each
Transferor may, but shall not be obligated to, subject to the
conditions in paragraph (c) below, (i) cause to be designated from
time to time Receivables in Aggregate Addition Accounts to be
included as part of the Trust Assets and/or additional Collateral
Certificates to be included as part of the Trust Assets and (ii)
cause to be increased the Invested Amount of an existing Collateral
Certificate. Such additional Trust Assets shall be transferred
to the Trust on the Addition Date or the Increase Date, as
applicable.
 
35



(c) Conditions to Aggregate
Additions and Additional Collateral Certificates . On each
Addition Date with respect to any Aggregate Addition Accounts
and/or additional Collateral Certificates, the applicable
Receivables in Aggregate Addition Accounts (and such Aggregate
Addition Accounts shall be Accounts for purposes of this Agreement)
or the applicable Collateral Certificate shall be designated as
additional Trust Assets, subject to the satisfaction of the
following conditions (which shall not apply with respect to any
increase in the Invested Amount of any existing Collateral
Certificate except as specified in clause (i) below):

Agency written notice (unless such notice requirement is otherwise
waived) that the Receivables in Aggregate Addition Accounts and/or

or an increased Invested Amount of an existing Collateral
Certificate will be included as part of the Trust Assets (the
latter notice requirement shall only apply to increases made
pursuant to subsection 2.13(a) ; provided ,
however , that notice shall be delivered to the Owner
Trustee and the Indenture Trustee in connection with any increase
in the Invested Amount of an existing Collateral Certificate),

aggregate amount of the Principal Receivables to be transferred to
the Trust (y) the Invested Amount of the additional Collateral
Certificates to be transferred to the Trust and (z) the amount by
which the Invested Amount of an existing Collateral Certificate is
to be increased, as well as the applicable Addition Date or
Increase Date and, in connection with the Aggregate Addition
Accounts, the applicable Addition Cut Off Date and Selection
Date;

(ii) the applicable Transferor shall
represent and warrant that, as of the applicable Selection Date,
each Aggregate Addition Account is an Eligible Account;

shall represent and warrant as of the applicable Addition Date,
each additional Collateral Certificate is an Eligible Collateral
Certificate;

(iv) the applicable Transferor shall

list shall be incorporated into and made a part of such Aggregate
Addition Account Assignment and this Agreement;

(ix) on or before the Addition Date
with respect to Collateral Certificates, the applicable Transferor
shall have delivered to the Owner Trustee, on behalf of the Trust,
and the Servicer a written assignment in substantially the form of
Exhibit B (the “ Certificate Assignment
”) and each Collateral Certificate shall be delivered and
registered in the name of the Trust, and the applicable Transferor
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee the schedule required to be delivered pursuant to
Section 2.1 on the date such file or list is required to be
delivered pursuant thereto, which file or list shall be
incorporated into and made a part of such Certificate Assignment
and this Agreement;

(x) the addition to the Trust of the
