Consolidated Water
What We Do



Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. (the “Company”, or “CWCO”) designs, builds, operates, and in some cases finances seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plants and water distribution systems in several Caribbean countries, where the supply of drinking water is scarce and the use of SWRO is economically feasible.
The Company was established in 1973 as a private water utility in Grand Cayman, the largest island in the Cayman Islands group, and obtained its first public utility license in the Cayman Islands in 1979. The Company is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select stock market under the symbol “CWCO”.

Our Goals




Provide complete and competitive potable water and wastewater solutions;
Provide the lowest lifecycle cost of water treatment solutions to our clients;
Forge long-term partnerships with our clients;
Design, build and operate highly efficient plants;
Leverage the experience of our engineering and management teams across all our operations.





Our Strategy



We endeavor to provide water services in areas where the supply of potable water is scarce.  We have focused on such areas as our principal market because they possess characteristics that make them attractive for our business.  Such characteristics include, but are not limited to:

Little or no naturally occurring fresh water
Growing population
High tourism levels

Rosarito			


					Mexico				




























The Rosarito Project represents the most important initiative we have undertaken since the construction of our Blue Hills plant in the Bahamas in 2005. In May 2010, we acquired, through our wholly-owned Netherlands subsidiary, Consolidated Water Cooperatief, U.A., a 50% interest in N.S.C. Agua, S.A. de C.V. (‘‘NSC’’), a development stage Mexican company. Since then we have purchased sufficient shares to raise our ownership interest in NSC to 99.9%. NSC was formed to pursue a project encompassing the construction, operation and ownership of a 100 million gallon per day seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant to be located in northern Baja California, Mexico and an accompanying pipeline to deliver water to the Mexican potable water infrastructure and the U.S. border (the ‘‘Project’’). We believe the Project can be successful due to what we believe is a growing need for a new potable water supply for the areas of northern Baja California, Mexico and Southern California, U.S. NSC owns 20.1 hectares of land on which its proposed plant would be constructed in Rosarito Beach, Baja California, Mexico.
NSC has engaged engineering groups with extensive regional and/or technical experience to prepare preliminary designs and cost estimates for the desalination plant and the proposed pipeline and prepare the environmental impact studies for local, state and federal regulatory agencies. NSC is presently seeking contracts with proposed customers in Mexico and the U.S. for the sale of the desalinated water from the Project. NSC will be required to accomplish various additional steps before it can commence construction of the plant and pipeline including, but not limited to, obtaining approvals and permits from various governmental agencies in Mexico, securing contracts with its proposed customers to sell water in sufficient quantities and at prices that make the project financially viable, and obtaining equity and debt financing for the Project. NSC’s potential customers will also be required to obtain various governmental permits and approvals in order to purchase water from NSC.
In 2012 and 2013, NSC conducted an equipment piloting plant and water data collection program at the proposed feed water source for the Project.  Equipment piloting plant was installed and operated and water quality data was collected from the proposed feed water source site in Rosarito Beach, Baja California, Mexico. NSC is currently conducting additional source water sampling protocols to comply with regulatory requirements in the U.S. and Mexico, and is also coordinating with regulators to assess the need, if any, for further process and equipment piloting.
In November 2012, NSC signed a letter of intent with Otay Water District in Southern California to deliver no less than 20 million and up to 40 million gallons of water per day from the plant to the Otay Water District at the border between Mexico and the U.S. On November 25, 2013 Otay Water District submitted an application to the Department of State of the United States of America for a Presidential Permit authorizing the construction, connection, operation and importation of desalinated seawater at the international boundary between the United States and Mexico in San Diego County, California. We understand that this application is currently being reviewed by the relevant authorities.
In recent months we have seen major positive developments with respect to the Rosarito project.  In January 2015 NSC submitted an expression of interest for its project to the Secretary of Infrastructure and Urban Development of the State of Baja California (“SIDUE”). On January 23, 2015, SIDUE accepted NSC’s expression of interest and requested that we submit a detailed proposal for the project that complies with requirements of the new legislation. In February 2015, NSC received notification from the regulatory authorities in Mexico that its federal environmental impact assessment and mitigation plan for the Rosarito Project’s proposed desalination plant had been approved.
The Company is committed to the success of this project and continues to actively pursue it.

About Bimini


THE BIMINIS, located only 48 miles east of Miami, Florida, are part of an island group in the Commonwealth of The Bahamas. Known for their outstanding sport fishing, the Biminis, in fact, have been dubbed the “Game Fishing Capital of the World.” The Biminis are actually two islands, separated by a narrow channel, and, in addition to sport fishing (popularized by Ernest Hemingway’s affection for angling, as well as his hanging out at a watering hole called “The Compleat Angler”) offer visitors excellent scuba diving and yachting activities. Consolidated Water provides drinking water to the Bimini Sands Resort, a full-service marina and condominium development on South Bimini.


About Nassau


NASSAU, the political, tourist and commercial capital of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, offers visitors amenities ranging from modern resorts and gambling casinos to picturesque Victorian mansions, cathedrals and 18th century fortresses. The world-famous Atlantis Resort on Paradise Island draws tourists to its luxury hotels, casino and expansive beachfront. Consolidated Water (Bahamas) Limited provides drinking water in bulk to the Water and Sewerage Corporation of The Bahamas.

Ltd. develops and operates seawater desalination plants (that utilize reverse osmosis technology) and water distribution systems in areas where naturally occurring supplies of potable water are scarce or non-existent. The Company operates in three segments: retail water operations, bulk water operations and services operations. Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, the Company provides various services to its customers in the Cayman Islands, The Bahamas, Belize, the British Virgin Islands and Indonesia.Retail Water OperationsThe Company's retail water operations segment produces and supplies water to end users, including residential, commercial and government customers. The Company sells water through its retail operations to a range of residential, commercial and government customers through its subsidiary Cayman Water Company Limited (Cayman Water). The Company's retail operations in the Cayman Islands produce potable water at over four reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants in Grand Cayman located at its Abel Castillo Water Works (ACWW), Britannia and West Bay sites. It owns the land for its ACWW and West Bay plants. The production capacity of over two plants located at ACWW is approximately 2.2 million gallons of water per day.

Through its subsidiary, Ocean Conversion (Cayman) Limited (OC-Cayman), the Company provides bulk water on a take-or-pay basis to the Water Authority-Cayman (WAC), a government owned utility and regulatory agency, under various agreements. The WAC in turn distributes that water to properties in the parts of Grand Cayman that are outside of its retail license area. The water it sells to the WAC is produced at approximately three reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants in Grand Cayman that are owned by the WAC but designed, built and operated by OC-Cayman, including the Red Gate, North Sound and North Side Water Works plants, which have production capacities of approximately 1.3 million, over 1.6 million and approximately 2.4 million gallons of water per day. The plants that it operates for the WAC are located on land owned by the WAC. In Belize, the Company sells bulk water through its subsidiary, Consolidated Water (Belize) Limited (CW-Belize).The Company owns the reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant in Belize and leases the land on which its plant is located. The production capacity of the plant is approximately 600,000 gallons of water per day. In Ambergris Caye, Belize the Company provides water to Belize Water Services Ltd. (BWSL), a government controlled entity, which distributes the water through its own pipeline system to residential, commercial and tourist properties. BWSL distributes its water primarily to residential properties, small hotels and businesses that serve the tourist market. The Company sells bulk water in The Bahamas to the Water and Sewerage Corporation of The Bahamas (WSC) and to a private resort on Bimini through its subsidiary, Consolidated Water (Bahamas) Ltd. (CW-Bahamas). It supplies bulk water in The Bahamas from its Windsor, Blue Hills and Bimini plants. The Company supplies water from the Blue Hills plant, its seawater conversion facility with a capacity of over 12.0 million gallons per day. The Bimini plant has a capacity of approximately 115,000 gallons per day and supplies water to a private resort. The high-pressure pumps at its Windsor and Blue Hills plants in the Bahamas are diesel engine-driven. It provides bulk water to the WSC, which distributes the water through its own pipeline system to residential, commercial and tourist properties on the Island of New Providence.Services OperationsThe Company's services operations segment provides engineering and management services, including designing and constructing desalination plants, and managing and operating plants owned by affiliated companies.

Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. to Expand Production Capacity in Cayman Islands


Share: Facebook Twitter Google Plus LinkedIn Consolidated Water Co. Ltd., which develops and operates seawater conversion plants and water distribution systems in areas where natural supplies of drinking (i.e., potable) water are scarce, announced that its contract with the Water Authority -- Cayman in respect to the Lower Valley Plant has been renewed for an additional seven years. The contract was originally scheduled to expire in March 2006. 

Under the terms of the contract renewal agreement, the Water Authority -- Cayman has asked Consolidated to expand the water production capacity of the Lower Valley Plant by approximately 264,000 US gallons per day (USGPD). The Lower Valley Plant is a reverse osmosis facility that converts seawater to potable water for commercial and residential customers on Grand Cayman Island. It is one of six seawater conversion plants operated by the company on the island. 

"We are pleased to announce the renewal of our Lower Valley Plant contract for an additional seven years on similar terms to the present contract," stated Rick McTaggart, CEO of Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. "The expansion of production capacity at the plant, when operational in late December this year, will increase Consolidated's total bulk water production capacity on Grand Cayman Island by approximately 9%, to 3.2 million USGPD. As with all of our contracts, we are able to 'pass through' to customers any increases in the cost of electricity or fuel that is used to operate our plant facilities and adjust our selling prices annually for changes in certain price indices."
