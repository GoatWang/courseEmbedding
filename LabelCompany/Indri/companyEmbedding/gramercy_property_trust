Gramercy Property Trust and TPG Real Estate Form Strategic Office Partners

                            Company Release - 9/12/2016 6:45 AM ET



    NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Gramercy Property Trust (NYSE:GPT) and TPG Real Estate announced today
      that they have partnered to form Strategic Office Partners, a platform
      that will aggregate a diverse portfolio of single-tenant office assets
      in high-growth metropolitan areas in the United States. The platform was
      seeded by the acquisition of six office assets, valued at $187.5
      million, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 3.6 years at
      closing, weighted by square footage. Together, TPG and Gramercy
      committed $400 million and secured a $200 million non-recourse credit
      facility from Morgan Stanley. Strategic Office Partners will seek to
      acquire up to $1 billion in assets over a three-year period.
    

      The portfolio is comprised of high-quality, single-tenant net lease
      office assets totaling approximately 1 million square feet in the Los
      Angeles MSA, San Francisco Bay Area, the San Diego MSA, Nashville and
      Minneapolis. These office assets, which provide tenants with better than
      market amenities, including cafeterias, gyms, and flexible parking, are
      occupied by deeply embedded corporate users. The buildings have an
      average tenant tenure of over 11 years, and half of the assets have been
      occupied by the original tenant since construction.
    

      “We see a compelling investment opportunity in the office net lease
      sector and believe that this portfolio of high-quality assets in strong
      growth markets is poised to benefit from positive fundamental trends,”
      said Avi Banyasz, Partner at TPG and Co-Head of TPG Real Estate. “We
      look forward to working with Gramercy, a best-in-class owner and
      operator, whose extensive experience in the space will prove valuable as
      we work together to manage and expand the platform.”
    

      Ben Harris, President of Gramercy Property Trust, commented, “We are
      excited to partner with TPG Real Estate, which is a best-in-class
      private equity investor. Gramercy will look to leverage its extensive
      asset management experience from managing its own portfolio and the
      portfolios of third party clients to enhance the value of the platform
      over time.”
    

      For inquiries relating to acquisitions, leasing and sales, contact Peter
      M. Tubesing, Managing Director at ptubesing@gptreit.com.

UPDATED July 5, 6:10 p.m.: An affiliate of the New York City-based Gramercy Property Trust paid $18 million for a warehouse in Medley, records show.
The 119,000-square-foot warehouse at 7321 Northwest 75th Street sold for about $151 per square foot.
Property records show the seller, Venevision Studios LLC, an entity of the Coral Gables-based Cisneros Real Estate, paid $10 million for the warehouse in 2005. The seller, also known as Grupo Cisneros, is an international conglomerate of media entertainment, digital media, property investment, tourism development and consumer product companies. It was originally based in Venezuela. Cisneros Real Estate’s portfolio includes some beachfront residences and hotels in the Dominican Republic’s Bay of Samaná, according to its website.
Records show the warehouse sits on 4.4 acres and was built in 1971. The warehouse is next to Cisneros Media Distribution studios, Cisneros’ broadcast arm.
Demand for industrial space in the Airport West submarket is strong, brokers say, due to limited access to land and low vacancy rates. A first quarter report from Colliers International South Florida predicts about 2 million square feet of warehouse space will be delivered in Medley and Doral over the next two years.
Earlier this month, Dallas, Texas-based Lincoln Property Co. added the Miami International Logistics Center to its portfolio for $27.4 million – more than two times its last sale – and a warehouse at 6095 Northwest 72nd Avenue sold to a South Carolina-based trucking company for $8.45 million.
This isn’t the first time Gramercy buys property from a media company.
Last year, Gramercy purchased the building where the South Florida daily newspaper the Sun Sentinel keeps its printing press for $25.5 million. It was sold by Tribune Media, the newspaper’s landlord and former parent company of the Sun Sentinel’s owner, Tribune Publishing.
Correction: A previous version of this story had incorrect sizes for the property.

Gramercy Property Trust


Gramercy Property Trust Inc. (NYSE: GPT), formerly Gramercy Capital Corp. Inc, is a real estate investment trust (REIT) and a commercial real estate specialty finance company. Substantially all of Gramercy's operations are conducted through its general partner, GKK Capital LP. Gramercy focuses on the direct origination and acquisition of whole loans, subordinate interests in whole loans, mezzanine loans, bridge loans, preferred equity, and net lease investments involving commercial properties throughout the United States.
Gramercy has also established a real estate securities business that focuses on the acquisition, trading and financing of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). As of December 31, 2007, the Company held loans, other lending investments, and CMBS of approximately $3.4 billion, net of fees, discounts, and unfunded commitments. It also holds interests in three credit tenant net lease investments investments, two interests in joint ventures and a 100% fee interest in a property.
On April 15, 2013, the company changed its name to Gramercy Property Trust Inc., and its ticker to GPT, from Gramercy Capital Corp. Inc with GKK "to more appropriately reflect the future of the Company as a pure-play net lease equity REIT."[1]

Properties[edit]
In 2004 Bank of America bought FleetBoston and kept the Union Station (Albany, New York) building.[2] The next year, the bank sold Kiernan Plaza to American Financial Realty Trust and leased the building back.[3] In 2008 American Financial Realty Trust was bought out by Gramercy Realty Corp. and in October 2009 Bank of America decided to consolidate its operations at Kiernan Plaza with others in Albany by moving them to a State Street building also owned by Gramercy, with no job losses.[4]
On April 1, 2008, American Financial was bought by Gramercy Capital, which assumed ownership of the 100 North Main Street building. Gramercy then sold the property to the current owner, SL Winston-Salem LLC, on October 23, 2008 for $36 million.[5]

Gramercy Property Trust buys Opa Locka Hialeah Flea Market for $80M, brings in new operator
Investors and new lessees Chris Kallivokas, Rodney Barreto, Michael Fay and Brian May plan to renovate the flea market

Opa Locka Hialeah Flea Market and Chris Kallivokas, Rodney Barreto and Michael Fay
Gramercy Property Trust just paid $80 million for the Opa Locka Hialeah Flea Market and inked a lease with a new operator, a group of Miami investors led by Chris Kallivokas.
The New York City-based real estate investment trust picked up about 72 acres of Opa-Locka land for $1.1 million per acre, according to a press release. The deal includes the 43.8-acre flea market at 12691 and 12705 Northwest 42nd Avenue and the 28.3-ace Insurance Auto Auctions property at 12700 Northwest Le Jeune Road.
The sellers are Bodwin Ltd. and Seabase Florida Corp. Both are entities managed by North Miami Beach attorney Sheldon Zipkin.
The new flea market lessee, RER Outdoor Marketplace, is led by Kallivokas, founder and head of Coral Gables-based RER Ventures, and includes Miami businessman Rodney Barreto, lobbyist Brian May, and Michael T. Fay, principal and managing director of Avison Young in Miami. Fay also arranged the deal.
The flea market is one of the largest in South Florida, with more than 100,000 people attending every week. It has nearly 200 merchants.
Kallivokas and his group plan to renovate the flea market by making significant improvements to parking, paint, canopies and restrooms. RER signed a 27-year lease.
RER will invest “over seven figures” into the flea market, Barreto and Fay said. They have no immediate plans to redevelop the property, although Fay expects there to be development opportunities at some point over the course of the lease. They declined to comment on the terms of the lease.
Barreto called the deal “an alternative retail play,” and cited the property’s size, highway frontage and central location. Amazon recently broke ground on an 800,000-square-foot distribution center nearby at Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport.

Gramercy Property Trust


Gramercy Property Trust Inc. (NYSE: GPT), formerly Gramercy Capital Corp. Inc, is a real estate investment trust (REIT) and a commercial real estate specialty finance company. Substantially all of Gramercy's operations are conducted through its general partner, GKK Capital LP. Gramercy focuses on the direct origination and acquisition of whole loans, subordinate interests in whole loans, mezzanine loans, bridge loans, preferred equity, and net lease investments involving commercial properties throughout the United States.
Gramercy has also established a real estate securities business that focuses on the acquisition, trading and financing of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). As of December 31, 2007, the Company held loans, other lending investments, and CMBS of approximately $3.4 billion, net of fees, discounts, and unfunded commitments. It also holds interests in three credit tenant net lease investments investments, two interests in joint ventures and a 100% fee interest in a property.
On April 15, 2013, the company changed its name to Gramercy Property Trust Inc., and its ticker to GPT, from Gramercy Capital Corp. Inc with GKK "to more appropriately reflect the future of the Company as a pure-play net lease equity REIT."[1]

Properties[edit]
In 2004 Bank of America bought FleetBoston and kept the Union Station (Albany, New York) building.[2] The next year, the bank sold Kiernan Plaza to American Financial Realty Trust and leased the building back.[3] In 2008 American Financial Realty Trust was bought out by Gramercy Realty Corp. and in October 2009 Bank of America decided to consolidate its operations at Kiernan Plaza with others in Albany by moving them to a State Street building also owned by Gramercy, with no job losses.[4]
On April 1, 2008, American Financial was bought by Gramercy Capital, which assumed ownership of the 100 North Main Street building. Gramercy then sold the property to the current owner, SL Winston-Salem LLC, on October 23, 2008 for $36 million.[5]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
