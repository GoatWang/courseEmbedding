We love to help!What are the primary advantages of a C Corporation?The C Corporation structure is very similar to the C Corporation, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that C Corporations are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows C Corporation owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. Are there any restrictions on who can file to form a C Corporation?Outside of some state-specific regulations that require individuals to be 18 to own a business, there are no restrictions on who can form a corporation. However, if a corporation decides to elect for C Corporation status, there are several restrictions placed on who can become part of the organizations ownership. They are as follows:• All C Corporation shareholders must be legal citizens of the United States. • C Corporations are only able to distribute one uniform class of stock. • C Corporation are limited to 100 different shareholders • Subsidiary organizations may not have an ownership interest in a C Corporation; all shareholders must be individuals.  What are the tax implications of a C Corporation?One of the most common reasons that business owners elect to form a C Corporation is that the structure is eligible for pass-through taxation. Under this special tax status, the corporation is never taxed on its income. Instead, each individual owner is taxed on the company's profits and losses, as they are distributed and reflected on their personal income tax returns. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form a C Corporation?Most states only require one director in order to start a C Corporation. However, some states impose a minimum number of directors based on the number of shareholders the company has. This required number is typically never lower than three and there is no maximum limit.

BancFirst Corporation Reports Second Quarter EarningsOKLAHOMA CITY, July 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- BancFirst Corporation (NASDAQ GS:BANF) reported net income of $23.2 million, or $1.42 diluted earnings per share, for the second quarter of 2017 compared to net income of $17.5 million, or $1.10 diluted earnings per share, for the second quarter of 2016.  A lower effective tax rate and the resolution of a problem loan during the second quarter of 2017 added 7 cents per share. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $45.2 million, or $2.78 per share, compared to $34.1 million, or $2.15 per share, for the first half of 2016. Net income for the first half of 2017 included the effects of favorable resolutions of three problem loans which resulted in
principal recovery of $894,000 and unaccrued interest income of $2.7 million. The Company's net interest income for the second quarter of 2017 increased to $56.4 million compared to $50.9 million for the second quarter of 2016. The net interest margin for the quarter was 3.43% compared to 3.28% a year ago. The increase in margin was primarily due to the increase in the federal funds rate and the favorable resolution of an acquired loan, which added 2 basis points.  The provision for loan losses for the second quarter of 2017 decreased to $1.8 million compared to $2.8 million a year ago. The decrease in the provision was due in part to an unusually high provision for a few commercial loans in the prior year.  Net charge-offs were stable at 0.02% of average loans for the second quarter of both 2017 and 2016.  Noninterest income for the quarter totaled $28.0 million, compared to
$26.1 million last year. Noninterest expense for the quarter totaled $49.0 million compared to $47.7 million last year. The increase in noninterest expense was due to salary increases in 2017. The Company's effective tax rate was 31.1% compared to 33.7% for the second quarter of 2016 adding approximately $875,000 to net income. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to a change in accounting standards related to stock based compensation.  At June 30, 2017, the Company's total assets were largely unchanged at $7.0 billion, $27.6 million above the December 31, 2016 total. Securities of $451.4 million were down slightly from December 31, 2016. Loans totaled $4.6 billion, an increase of $177.9 million over December 31, 2016.  Deposits were flat totaling $6.2 billion at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The Company's total stockholders' equity was
$748.5 million, an increase of $37.4 million over December 31, 2016.Asset quality remained strong during the second quarter of 2017.  Nonperforming and restructured assets fell to 0.42% of total assets at June 30, 2017 compared to 0.56% at December 31, 2016. The decrease in nonperforming and restructured assets was largely due to the resolution of the aforementioned problem loans during the first half of 2017. The allowance to total loans was 1.07% compared to 1.10% at year-end 2016. The allowance to nonperforming and restructured loans was 193.1% compared to 137.3% at year-end 2016.Executive Chairman David Rainbolt commented, "With our strong core community deposits we obviously benefit from Fed rate changes. Our task now is to grow earning assets in a modest economic environment."On May 31, 2017, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a
two-for-one stock split of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock. The stock will be payable in the form of a dividend on or about July 31, 2017 to shareholders of record of the outstanding common stock as of the close of business record date of July 17, 2017.  Stockholders will receive one additional share for each share held on that date. This represents the second stock split for BancFirst since going public.

OKC-based BancFirst profit growth sends stock higher

                     David Rainbolt, executive chairman of Oklahoma City-based BancFirst Corp.                                     


BancFirst Corp. on Thursday reported continued profit growth in the second quarter, which sparked a surge in the firm's stock price.
Boosted in part by a lower tax rate and the resolution of a problem loan, the Oklahoma City firm reported that it booked net income of $23.2 million, or $1.42 per share, in the March-through-June period. That compares to a profit of $17.5 million, or $1.10 per share, in the same period last year.
BancFirst is Oklahoma's largest state-chartered bank with 100 banking locations in 53 communities across the state.
Shares of the banking company jumped nearly 6 percent Thursday after the earnings report, topping $105 a share for the first time ever before closing at $104.85.
Net income for the first half of 2017 totaled $45.2 million, and included the effects of favorable resolutions of three problem loans which resulted in principal recovery of $894,000 and interest income of $2.7 million, BancFirst said.
Executive Chairman David Rainbolt said monetary policy also is helping the bank.
“With our strong core community deposits we obviously benefit from Fed rate changes," Rainbolt said in a statement. "Our task now is to grow earning assets in a modest economic environment.”
At June 30, the company's total assets were largely unchanged at $7 billion, $27.6 million above the Dec. 31, 2016, total.
BancFirst is scheduled to split its stock two-for-one at the end of this month. Shareholders as of July 17 will receive one additional share for each share held on that date.
It will be the second stock split for BancFirst since going public.

We love to help!What are the primary advantages of a C Corporation?The C Corporation structure is very similar to the C Corporation, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that C Corporations are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows C Corporation owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. Are there any restrictions on who can file to form a C Corporation?Outside of some state-specific regulations that require individuals to be 18 to own a business, there are no restrictions on who can form a corporation. However, if a corporation decides to elect for C Corporation status, there are several restrictions placed on who can become part of the organizations ownership. They are as follows:• All C Corporation shareholders must be legal citizens of the United States. • C Corporations are only able to distribute one uniform class of stock. • C Corporation are limited to 100 different shareholders • Subsidiary organizations may not have an ownership interest in a C Corporation; all shareholders must be individuals.  What are the tax implications of a C Corporation?One of the most common reasons that business owners elect to form a C Corporation is that the structure is eligible for pass-through taxation. Under this special tax status, the corporation is never taxed on its income. Instead, each individual owner is taxed on the company's profits and losses, as they are distributed and reflected on their personal income tax returns. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form a C Corporation?Most states only require one director in order to start a C Corporation. However, some states impose a minimum number of directors based on the number of shareholders the company has. This required number is typically never lower than three and there is no maximum limit.
