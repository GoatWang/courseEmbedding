Flight Simulators[edit]




Full flight simulators at the CAE centre in Brussels


CAE sells flight simulators and training devices to airlines, aircraft manufacturers and training centres. It licenses its simulation software to various market segments and has a professional services division.
The simulators include basic training devices CAE 400XR and CAE 500XR, and full-motion products such as the CAE 3000, CAE 5000 and CAE 7000XR. These simulators are available for commercial use. In 2016, the company sold 53 Full-Flight Simulators.[2]
In 2001, CAE Inc. acquired BAE Systems's Flight Simulation and Training division, formerly known as Reflectone Inc,[3] a publicly listed company founded in 1939, and based in Tampa, Florida. Reflectone sold flight simulators to the military and provided pilot training on its premises.[4]
Pilot training[edit]
CAE conducts airline pilot training and business jet pilot training in its 50 aviation training centres worldwide.[5]
In the United States, the firm is a supplier of initial and recurrency training for airlines such as JetBlue[6] and non-airline based companies, including charter and cargo operators. In December 2001 the firm acquired Simuflite training centers in Dallas, Texas and Morristown, New Jersey, which are now called CAE SimuFlite.[7] The facility at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport is the largest business aviation training facility in the world at 426,000 sq ft (39,600 m2), with 34 simulators and approximately 450 employees.[citation needed]
In February 2016, CAE Inc. acquired one of its competitors, Lockheed Martin Commercial Flight Training, formerly known as Sim-Industries.
CAE also operates the CAE Oxford Aviation Academy, the largest ab initio flight training network in the world, with a fleet of over 220 aircraft and seven campuses worldwide.[8]
Academies include:

Brussels (Sabena Flight Academy), Belgium
Gondia, India
Melbourne, Australia
Oxford, United Kingdom
Perth, Australia
CAE Global Academy Phoenix, United States
Rae Bareli, India

Healthcare[edit]
In 2011, CAE decided to leverage its experience in aviation and simulation-based training to enter a new emerging market: simulation-based medical education.
CAE purchased Medical Education Technologies Inc. (METI), a Sarasota-based company renowned notably for its innovative patient simulator, the HPS.[9] This acquisition brought a direct sales force in the U.S., close customer relationships and a worldwide distributor network. Today, CAE's healthcare simulation solutions business unit is a global leader in medical simulation training technology to improve patient safety in clinical settings.
Corporate governance[edit]
The CEO, Marc Parent, was named in this role in October 2009. He has more than 25 years of experience in the aerospace industry. Born in Montreal, Mr. Parent is a graduate of Mechanical Engineering from Montreal’s École Polytechnique and of the Harvard Business School’s Advanced Management Program.[10]
In October 2008, CAE was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[11]

In December 2001 the firm acquired Simuflite training centers in Dallas, Texas and Morristown, New Jersey, which are now called CAE SimuFlite.[7] The facility at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport is the largest business aviation training facility in the world at 426,000 sq ft (39,600 m2), with 34 simulators and approximately 450 employees.[citation needed]
In February 2016, CAE Inc. acquired one of its competitors, Lockheed Martin Commercial Flight Training, formerly known as Sim-Industries.
CAE also operates the CAE Oxford Aviation Academy, the largest ab initio flight training network in the world, with a fleet of over 220 aircraft and seven campuses worldwide.[8]
Academies include:

Brussels (Sabena Flight Academy), Belgium
Gondia, India
Melbourne, Australia
Oxford, United Kingdom
Perth, Australia
CAE Global Academy Phoenix, United States
Rae Bareli, India

Healthcare[edit]
In 2011, CAE decided to leverage its experience in aviation and simulation-based training to enter a new emerging market: simulation-based medical education.
CAE purchased Medical Education Technologies Inc. (METI), a Sarasota-based company renowned notably for its innovative patient simulator, the HPS.[9] This acquisition brought a direct sales force in the U.S., close customer relationships and a worldwide distributor network. Today, CAE's healthcare simulation solutions business unit is a global leader in medical simulation training technology to improve patient safety in clinical settings.
Corporate governance[edit]
The CEO, Marc Parent, was named in this role in October 2009. He has more than 25 years of experience in the aerospace industry. Born in Montreal, Mr. Parent is a graduate of Mechanical Engineering from Montreal’s École Polytechnique and of the Harvard Business School’s Advanced Management Program.[10]
In October 2008, CAE was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[11]

Flight Simulators[edit]




Full flight simulators at the CAE centre in Brussels


CAE sells flight simulators and training devices to airlines, aircraft manufacturers and training centres. It licenses its simulation software to various market segments and has a professional services division.
The simulators include basic training devices CAE 400XR and CAE 500XR, and full-motion products such as the CAE 3000, CAE 5000 and CAE 7000XR. These simulators are available for commercial use. In 2016, the company sold 53 Full-Flight Simulators.[2]
In 2001, CAE Inc. acquired BAE Systems's Flight Simulation and Training division, formerly known as Reflectone Inc,[3] a publicly listed company founded in 1939, and based in Tampa, Florida. Reflectone sold flight simulators to the military and provided pilot training on its premises.[4]
Pilot training[edit]
CAE conducts airline pilot training and business jet pilot training in its 50 aviation training centres worldwide.[5]
In the United States, the firm is a supplier of initial and recurrency training for airlines such as JetBlue[6] and non-airline based companies, including charter and cargo operators. In December 2001 the firm acquired Simuflite training centers in Dallas, Texas and Morristown, New Jersey, which are now called CAE SimuFlite.[7] The facility at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport is the largest business aviation training facility in the world at 426,000 sq ft (39,600 m2), with 34 simulators and approximately 450 employees.[citation needed]
In February 2016, CAE Inc. acquired one of its competitors, Lockheed Martin Commercial Flight Training, formerly known as Sim-Industries.
CAE also operates the CAE Oxford Aviation Academy, the largest ab initio flight training network in the world, with a fleet of over 220 aircraft and seven campuses worldwide.[8]
