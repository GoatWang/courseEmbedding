innovative Dining Programs
Every day, we deliver engaging, nutrition-focused dining programs to patients around the world.


READ MORE








In today’s healthcare environment, patients have many choices for where they receive their care. We also understand that engaging, quality dining services can improve patient satisfaction and, in turn, drive reimbursement. Fortunately, we’ve spent nearly 50 years partnering with hospitals and healthcare systems across the globe, providing innovative patient dining and clinical nutrition services that meet the strict dietary needs of hundreds of thousands of patients. 
Patient Insights
Each year, we invest significant resources to understand the needs and desires of our patients. Our ability to respond to patient needs, and deliver the nutritious food choices that they want, is what makes us an industry leader. 
Through focus group discussions, close examination of global and local food trends and site-specific research on your patients’ unique food preferences, we’re able to create engaging patient dining experiences that meet their unique dietary needs while also considering the quality and financial goals of the hospitals or health systems we serve. 
Innovative, Engaging Dining Concepts
Armed with those insights, we design and develop innovative programs based on the following:

Quality of food
Menu choice and variety
Quality of service
Nutrition education to support lifestyle change
Patient engagement

















We’re constantly creating new dining concepts and programs to increase patient satisfaction, including:

A high-performance team of specialists that use Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics standards to develop nutritionally sound meal options
Great-tasting, healthier choices that meet dietary needs based on age, regional taste, condition and individual patient preference
Increased room service delivery options, including adding Just For You® state-of-the-art customized nutritional menus to our restaurant-style Room Service Program.
Tray management programs
Hospitality platforms, such as our adopt-a-floor nurse manager rounding program and PatientConnect patient rounding program
Engaging nutrition education to support lifestyle change supported by 750 dietitians

We understand healthcare is a dynamic industry. And it’s for that very reason we put so much emphasis on turning patient insights into everyday innovations. That way, as healthcare evolves, our patient dining services evolve with it.

Patient Engagement
Our employees foster a comforting healthcare environment through everyday patient interactions.


READ MORE








Research has shown that during a three-day hospital stay, patients can encounter as many as 75 different faces. Combine that with an already unfamiliar environment and it can produce a great deal of stress and anxiety. That makes it all the more important to create comforting, engaging patient dining experiences filled with nutritious, satisfying meals. In our experience, these personal touches not only improve health, but can also boost morale. 
Giving Patients What They Want
As with anything we do, we begin with research, by understanding patients through in-depth studies into their behaviors, desires and trends. For example, data shows that patients consider their food choices to be one of the only elements of their hospital stay under their control. So we work with culinary experts to create menus that are full of rich, nutritious choices that improve patient satisfaction.
Bedside Manner
We also know that engaging patients at the bedside helps patients feel more comfortable. Investing in patient- and caregiver-focused customer service programs helps our team understand the nuances of patient interaction, tray accuracy, tray delivery and pickup, diet needs and nutrition intake, among other components. 
Improved Satisfaction
We’re proud to say that nearly 60% of our room service accounts are in the top quartile of patient satisfaction. What’s more, thanks to more efficient operations, we’re able to achieve this satisfaction and financial success without adding additional costs for our healthcare clients.

Clinical Nutrition Services
With over 750 dietitians on staff and a renowned Dietetic Internship Program, we invest in the next generation of clinicians.


READ MORE








Every day, our dietitians deliver superior outcomes by influencing patients to make healthy lifestyle choices and collaborating with caregivers to treat and prevent disease through the use of evidence based practice standards.  As the largest employer of registered dietitians in the United States, we have built a clinical nutrition practice that boasts over 750 dietitians.
Much of our company’s professional development and programmatic strategies are aligned with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. We support dietitians’ performance with state-of-the art tools, programs, and extensive networking opportunities. We incorporate Academy activities into our Clinical Ladders Program and encourage our dietitians’ involvement in the Academy’s Dietetic Practice Groups (DPGs). To help make it easy for them to become involved, we underwrite Academy membership dues, state licensure and certification, and annual Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) fees. We also pay enrollment fees for DPG membership.
Clinical Ladders
Clinical Ladders are recognized levels of achievement within Aramark designed to provide a respected professional growth path for clinicians providing direct patient care. Our Clinical Ladders are in place for entry level through experienced professionals to assist with career growth by recognizing advanced degrees and clinical specialties, advanced practice skills, leadership skills, and research activities. Clinicians follow incremental steps to advance their careers and their professional development. Our Clinical Ladders Program focuses on core component requirements and then asks our clinical dietitians to commit to leadership responsibilities.
Dietetic Internship Program
We live our commitment to clinical professionals through our Dietetic Internship Program. Our program is accredited by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics’ Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics Education (CADE), which makes us a certified trainer for registered dietitians. Currently, our Dietetic Internship program is conducted at 22 client sites across the country, with a total enrollment of 30 dietitians each year.  In place for 20 years, the program has graduated 584 dietitians.

                                    Across the hospital and healthcare systems we serve, our employees interact with patients, physicians, nursing staff and caregivers several times on a daily basis. Understanding our opportunity to drive physician, caregiver, and patient satisfaction, we identified a way to accelerate communication among our own employees and the patients and staff we engage with every single day. 
                                

See our innovation




Innovation

                                    With that in mind, we created PatientConnect, our proprietary technology platform that enables our operations teams to assess and understand the satisfaction levels of multiple stakeholders and respond immediately to address concerns. This tablet-based app replaces the typical paper-based process for staff to survey patients. The program allows us to improve service, food quality, cleanliness and other critical indicators before the patient leaves the hospital. 

                                

                                        The platform includes a robust data analytics component to measure patient satisfaction scores and interview responses by the type of patient care unit, patient diet type, duration of stay and other variables.

                                    By combining this level of patient engagement with our people-based approach to hospitality services, we were able to improve patient satisfaction significantly. In the 190 locations where PatientConnect is in place, we have seen a 5 percent increase in patient satisfaction, as measured by Press Ganey, a leading provider of third-party patient satisfaction measurement and monitoring.

Environmental Hygiene
A comprehensive approach to environmental cleaning helps ensure your staff can clean with confidence.


READ MORE








In every healthcare organization we serve, we’ve made it our mission to help safeguard the health and well-being of patients, physicians, staff and visitors. At the forefront of that effort is environmental hygiene and infection prevention. With our environmental cleaning products and services, we can help you reduce the risk of healthcare associated infections, while making your organization more efficient and easier to manage.
Scientific Wash Process
Our unique science-based washing process combines the latest scientific advancements with laundering best practices to maintain the durability and the integrity of our microfiber products.
Microfiber Cleaning and ATP Monitoring
Another way we’re enhancing your infection prevention program is with our integrated line of microfiber dusters, towels and mops. These products help eliminate cross-contamination risk from ceiling to floor and are designed for optimal soil and microorganism removal. 
We employ a multistep process called MicroVantage™ to help preserve the effectiveness of our microfiber products and provide you with a comprehensive approach to environmental cleaning, including ATP Monitoring.


Research shows frequently touched surfaces, like bed rails, IV poles and tray tables may still be contaminated after standard cleaning processes. ATP, or Adenosine Triphosphate, is present in all living or once living organisms. Using a luminometer, we’re able to detect ATP on frequently touched surfaces and identify areas where new contaminants could multiply and grow. Doing so may help improve your cleaning practices to reduce risk and provide a safer, healthier patient environment. With our unique ATP monitoring program, we help prevent the spread of these lingering contaminants and ensure a cleaner clean.

Research and Insights
Insights gathered from your physicians, staff and visitors guide all our healthcare dining programs.


READ MORE








Visitors and caregivers are often pressed for time. Our focus on visitor and caregiver insights allows us to create convenient, compelling programs that your customers are asking for, keeping visitors and caregivers engaged and on campus.
The Insights That Matter
Knowing what caregivers and visitors want out of their dining experience helps us identify what is being done well and what opportunities we have to innovate going forward. We continue to conduct rigorous research into what the staff and visitors at your specific healthcare organization are looking for, and then we turn those insights into exciting innovations. We look at sales data, growing trends and gather information directly from the people who move in and out of your healthcare site every day. 
Feedback and Response
With our proprietary satisfaction survey process, Your Voice Counts, we’re able to respond to visitors and staff needs in real time. The program enables our customers to tell us exactly what they liked and what they’re looking for in their retail dining experience. Then, based on the feedback we get, alerts are automatically distributed to our managers in real time so that they can immediately make changes and applaud service excellence. 
Fostering this open communication—truly listening and responding to ideas, thoughts, and feedback—makes Aramark better, and ensures staff and visitors are engaged and satisfied with their dining experience. We are able to respond to customer needs in a timely fashion, make informed improvements and help increase satisfaction and revenue at hospitals and health systems around the country.

Health and Wellness
Satisfying, nutritious dining services help your healthcare organization promote healthier choices.


READ MORE








Patients and communities look to hospitals and health systems to create a culture focused on wellness and healthy living. The dining options they provide are an important extension of that effort. So we’ve introduced our health and wellness platform, Healthy for Life™, at all the healthcare organizations we serve as part of our commitment to creating healthy environments, building healthier communities and supporting healthy lifestyles.
Healthy Choices
Healthy For Life™ makes healthier choices readily available and positively impacts the healthcare environment. It includes a wide variety of easy-to-find solutions that work together to encourage customers to select the lower-calorie, lower-fat, wholegrain, and vegetarian or vegan choices that best fit their lifestyles. 
Our team of talented chefs and dietitians design menus that are great-tasting, healthy and accommodate a wide variety of unique clinical and nutritional needs, filling the retail-dining environment with an abundance of wholesome, fresh and nutritious foods. 
Through ongoing partnerships with leading healthcare institutions, health advocacy organizations, and industry and community groups, we are working hard every day to make the best menu choices and nutrition information available to your physicians, caregivers, staff and visitors. 
Education and Awareness
Using our own research, as well as in-depth analysis of global health trends, we educate and promote healthier lifestyle choices to care teams, visitors and patients. Through a broad selection of satisfying, healthier recipes, alongside easy-to-understand nutrition and wellness information, we take the mystery out of healthy living. 
We continuously engage and educate customers with activities like on-site health fairs, food sampling events, cooking demonstrations by our chefs, and wellness workshops with our dietitians.

Insight

                                    As a global healthcare support services provider, our approach has always been grounded in insights gathered from our patients, hospital staff and visitors. So our team was in need of a system that not only gathered these insights, but would also help us improve our services on a day-to-day basis. 
                                

See our innovation




Innovation

                                    Our answer was MarketConnect—a unique approach to gathering, analyzing and applying customer insights from all the hospitals and health systems we serve. Drawing on our depth of experience, we integrate the quantitative and qualitative data we gather from the program into our daily operations. We then use the data we collect to develop exciting retail dining concepts, which delight customers and build loyalty. 

                                

                                        Not only that, but MarketConnect takes you through every step of the process, from insight discovery, to creating innovative solutions, to design and construction, to success measurement.

Impact

                                    MarketConnect has been a great success for our clients. It’s helped us create and implement tailored solutions that focus on specific community needs. This drives participation in your onsite dining options and increased profitability for these outlets. In addition, we’re able to gauge satisfaction through our Voice of the Consumer program, so that we can make improvements quickly. 
                                

                                        Our goal has always been to improve physician, caregiver, staff and visitor satisfaction while meeting our clients’ financial, quality and operational goals. This innovative program helps us do both.
