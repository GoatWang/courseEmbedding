How the BuildZoom Score works

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Washington:













Does Alexander, Brian Patrick carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that impacts the value of real estate in Washington, requires a licensed contractor.
Alexander, Brian Patrick currently holds license ALEXABP895KU , which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Washington?



The Washington State Department of Labor & Industries requires licensees to maintain a bond and liability insurance for the protection of consumers.











Your liability risk when hiring Alexander, Brian Patrick



Licensed contractors in Washington are required to maintain general liability coverage that includes a $50,000 property damage policy and $200,000 public liability policy; or $250,000 combined single limit policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Alexander, Brian Patrick



Licensed general contractors in Washington are required to maintain a $12,000 bond and specialty contractors are required to maintain a $6,000 bond. This provides consumers with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The standard board recommendation is to get at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Brian Alexander




Brian Alexander describes himself as an observationalist. “I spend a lot of time getting to know the behaviors of everything,” he says. Alexander is so fascinated by people’s behavior that he’s been compiling an owner’s manual for humans since the late 1980s. “It began by watching a traffic jam in a food service line,” he says. “I was intrigued with the way people negotiated and mimicked the person in front without even knowing it.”  He adds to the manual frequently—and draws upon it for every project he does.

One example is the intuitive height adjustment switch on the Renew sit-to-stand table. After noting how people interact with other switches, he designed a new control that encompasses both our basic intuitions about direction and our bodies' need to change positions throughout the day. “It’s like shaking hands with a flower petal,” he says. “I try to slip people little affirmations through my designs, things they can identify or connect with on a very basic level. You can see it in their faces, the reactions they have when something flows with them rather than against them.”

To Alexander, getting a design right is more about perfecting human interaction than aesthetics. “If something is done right, it’s complete with the minimum amount of bits, but at the same time, it leaves itself open to growth—like a plant.

While Alexander often works on physical projects, he also specializes in identifying discord in existing processes and suggesting new ways to bring them into harmony. “Most of the time, there’s some subtlety in our deeper wiring that reframes the whole problem,” he says. “If you get that square up front, you can aspire to something more specific.”
