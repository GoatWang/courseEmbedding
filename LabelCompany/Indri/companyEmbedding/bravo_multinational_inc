Company Overview




Bravo Multinational Incorporated (OTCQB: BRVO) is a casino equipment distributor and operator with business holdings and practices in Central and South America. Currently, Bravo has casino gaming business interests in three countries in Latin America -Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Columbia, and intends further expansion in all 3 countries. Bravo’s growth strategy, driven by partnerships, acquisitions, and new ventures, should result in a financially viable and profitable casino gaming business.




Value Proposition




BRVO has the potential to generate significant sales over the next several years. The Company operates a casino gaming business in Nicaragua. As a travel destination, Nicaragua is regarded as the “next Costa Rica,” and the country’s tourism industry is expected to grow 8.8% annually over next decade. In terms of jobs, the tourism industry is expected to support 92,000 jobs directly and 280,000 jobs indirectly by the end of 2024. BRVO is selling slot machines and video poker machines which are being placed in hundreds of restaurants and bars throughout Nicaragua. All machines are to be operated and managed under a long-term country-wide national license valid until 2033. In addition to the Nicaragua gaming operations, BRVO actively seeks to secure licensing for betting house gambling in El Salvador. With current operations and anticipated expansions into multiple locations throughout Central America and South America, BRVO in 2017 expects to have robust casino gaming operations. Investors have this unique opportunity to be involved in a growing casino business, operating throughout an emerging and exciting tourist destination, Latin America.
