Company Profile
MabVax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of human monoclonal antibody products and vaccines for the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of cancers. The Company has discovered a pipeline of human monoclonal antibody products based on the protective immune responses generated by patients who have been immunized against targeted cancers. The Company’s lead antibody candidate, 5B1, is being developed as a therapeutic product and as a diagnostic imaging product. The antibody targets carbohydrate antigen sialyl Lewisa (sLea), which is expressed on tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, including pancreatic, colon and stomach cancers, as well as ovarian, breast and small cell lung cancers. The Company is also developing the 5B1 antibody conjugated to a radiolabel as a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent to assist in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.

Form 13G is used when the filer owns between 5% and 20% of the company and plans to hold it only as a passive investor. If the filler intend to exert control and if the stake’s size exceeds 20%, then a 13D must be filed. Therefore, activist investors and practices such as: hostile takeovers, company breakups, and other “change of control” events, are not permitted by 13G filers.
