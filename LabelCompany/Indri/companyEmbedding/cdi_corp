ABOUT US
Founded in 1997, CDI Corp. has been a company dedicated to all aspects surrounding the customer experience ever since its humble beginnings in the basement of a small home in the suburbs of Chicago. Fast forward more than 20 years later to CDI’s 16,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility located in the heart of the Old Irving neighborhood of Chicago’s Northwest Side. Operating multiple brands within numerous markets, the company builds and ships millions of automotive decals each year, along with a wide variety of other automotive accessories and custom gift products. Employing more than 45 workers from surrounding communities, CDI Corp. takes great pride in creating all of its products in-house using only American-made raw materials.
Though the company’s rapid growth and sustained success is attributed to many things, there is one common theme that holds true: Great People, Great Service, Great Products. There’s a family culture that can be felt as soon as you walk through the facility’s doors. Additionally, CDI Corp. operates The Urban School Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that helps the surrounding community schools in many ways. From annual food drives, summer cookouts, and many other initiatives designed to impact not only its employees but also the communities in which they reside, CDI Corp. is committed to making a difference.

“It’s simple. Take good care of your people and build a quality product. I believe we do a very good job at both.”
– Bob Tucker, President & CEO, CDI Corp.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
