History[edit]
In October 1994, Donald E. Brown founded the startup company Interactive Intelligence in Indianapolis, Indiana. He became the company's President and chief executive officer in 1995 and developed communication systems integration with informational technology. By 1997, Interactive Intelligence was the first to market an all-in-one customer engagement software suite.[1] The company held its initial public offering (IPO) in October 1999 and expected to earn more than $29 million.[11] During this time, Interactive Intelligence had strategic partnerships with other telecommunications companies, such as HP, IBM, Microsoft, Polycom and Salesforce.com. By 2009, the company had developed communications-as-a-service (CaaS) and cloud solutions for contact centers.[12]
Interactive Intelligence acquired AcroSoft Corp., a provider of insurance content management solutions, in 2009.[13] In 2010, the company purchased Latitude Software, a debt collection software and services provider.[14] Interactive Intelligence acquired both Agori Communications, a German-based reseller of its multichannel contact center solutions, and CallTime, an Australian-based reseller, in 2011.[15] In August 2012, Interactive Intelligence acquired Bay Bridge Decision Technologies, a developer of capacity planning and strategic analysis technology.[16] Interactive Intelligence acquired OrgSpan, a software development company focused on social and business communication, in 2014.[17]
During the summer of 2016, the company's stock prices rose as it was reported that Interactive Intelligence was exploring a potential sale.[18] In August 2016, it was announced that the customer experience company, Genesys, was set to acquire Interactive Intelligence for $1.4 billion.[19][20] The acquisition was completed in December 2016 and all Interactive Intelligence products and services integrated with Genesys.[21]
Products[edit]
The company's core product offering was the Interaction Center Platform, which centralized multi-channel business interactions and business processes. This platform could be delivered as either a premises or hosted (communications-as-a-service) offering. In addition to its software, Interactive Intelligence also provided add-on professional services, support, and education for its product line.[22]
Genesys developed a customer experience platform portfolio from Interactive Intelligence technology. PureCloud is a contact center as a service (CCaaS) cloud platform that managed customer communication with comprehensive features.[8] PureConnect is a customer interaction center (CIC) that integrates customer engagement functionality in one application.[9] PureEngage is an omnichannel customer engagement for large organizations.[10]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2010, Interactive Intelligence announced its non-profit corporation, Interactive Intelligence Foundation, to assist at-risk youth. The Foundation raised funds to promote technology education for youth in Indiana and outside the United States.[23] It hosted an annual gala and silent auction as part of its fundraising activities.[24]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Interactive Intelligence was recognized as a "market leader" by industry analyst firms such as Datamonitor,[25] Frost & Sullivan,[26] and Gartner.[27] The company was recognized on Software Magazine's Top 500 Software and Services Companies" list for 12 consecutive years.[28] It was also ranked #8 on Forbes 2011 list of "America's 100 Best Small Companies."[29] Interactive Intelligence's acquisition by Genesys was recognized as "largest tech-company acquisition" since 2013.[30]

History[edit]
In October 1994, Donald E. Brown founded the startup company Interactive Intelligence in Indianapolis, Indiana. He became the company's President and chief executive officer in 1995 and developed communication systems integration with informational technology. By 1997, Interactive Intelligence was the first to market an all-in-one customer engagement software suite.[1] The company held its initial public offering (IPO) in October 1999 and expected to earn more than $29 million.[11] During this time, Interactive Intelligence had strategic partnerships with other telecommunications companies, such as HP, IBM, Microsoft, Polycom and Salesforce.com. By 2009, the company had developed communications-as-a-service (CaaS) and cloud solutions for contact centers.[12]
Interactive Intelligence acquired AcroSoft Corp., a provider of insurance content management solutions, in 2009.[13] In 2010, the company purchased Latitude Software, a debt collection software and services provider.[14] Interactive Intelligence acquired both Agori Communications, a German-based reseller of its multichannel contact center solutions, and CallTime, an Australian-based reseller, in 2011.[15] In August 2012, Interactive Intelligence acquired Bay Bridge Decision Technologies, a developer of capacity planning and strategic analysis technology.[16] Interactive Intelligence acquired OrgSpan, a software development company focused on social and business communication, in 2014.[17]
During the summer of 2016, the company's stock prices rose as it was reported that Interactive Intelligence was exploring a potential sale.[18] In August 2016, it was announced that the customer experience company, Genesys, was set to acquire Interactive Intelligence for $1.4 billion.[19][20] The acquisition was completed in December 2016 and all Interactive Intelligence products and services integrated with Genesys.[21]
Products[edit]
The company's core product offering was the Interaction Center Platform, which centralized multi-channel business interactions and business processes. This platform could be delivered as either a premises or hosted (communications-as-a-service) offering. In addition to its software, Interactive Intelligence also provided add-on professional services, support, and education for its product line.[22]
Genesys developed a customer experience platform portfolio from Interactive Intelligence technology. PureCloud is a contact center as a service (CCaaS) cloud platform that managed customer communication with comprehensive features.[8] PureConnect is a customer interaction center (CIC) that integrates customer engagement functionality in one application.[9] PureEngage is an omnichannel customer engagement for large organizations.[10]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2010, Interactive Intelligence announced its non-profit corporation, Interactive Intelligence Foundation, to assist at-risk youth. The Foundation raised funds to promote technology education for youth in Indiana and outside the United States.[23] It hosted an annual gala and silent auction as part of its fundraising activities.[24]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Interactive Intelligence was recognized as a "market leader" by industry analyst firms such as Datamonitor,[25] Frost & Sullivan,[26] and Gartner.[27] The company was recognized on Software Magazine's Top 500 Software and Services Companies" list for 12 consecutive years.[28] It was also ranked #8 on Forbes 2011 list of "America's 100 Best Small Companies."[29] Interactive Intelligence's acquisition by Genesys was recognized as "largest tech-company acquisition" since 2013.[30]

        Tested Microsoft Patches

      The following search engine allows you to check the status of Microsoft updates. Updates marked as tested have been installed in the Testlab and appear to be compatible with the most recent releases of our software. The Testlab makes a best-effort pass of validating Microsoft updates. Testlab cannot guarantee complete compatibility and will not identify the impact of Microsoft updates on out-of-support products, or supported versions that are not updated to the most recent CIC patches/updates. We do not validate Limited Distribution Release updates, generally labeled "hotfixes". We rate the risk of loading generally-available updates from Microsoft as acceptable. However, best practice dictates that customers test all Microsoft updates before deploying them in a production environment.

Thought is was great, but didn't see issues as the company grew. Unless you were an engineer, worked in development, or were one of the "favorite first few", you did not feel valued. Slow (if ever) to keep up with longer term employee's salary adjustment. The company should have sold years before it did.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Interactive Intelligence Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Interactive Intelligence 2017-06-01 08:22 PDT May 5, 2017 Helpful (5)"individual contributor"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Indianapolis, INFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Indianapolis, INDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookNo opinion of CEOI worked at Interactive Intelligence full-timeProsPrior to 2014, ININ was a wonderful place to work. I truly enjoyed my job, loved the people and the energy of the company. It was a place to be innovative, work in a fun environment and build great products. The company grew from "guidelines" vs. hard structured policies which allowed us to have an open environment where new ideas were implemented. Leadership also really cared about their teams and let them test their wings.ConsAfter 2014, some high level positions were filled with people because of who they knew (or worked with prior) vs. the knowledge and experience to do the job. Having strong innovative people work under policy driven" leaders" ( I use that word lightly) who ran from conflict or anything that forced some unwanted action is what started to sink this ship.Too many times, those in VP or Director roles would engage with and promote only those they liked vs those that were proven performers. Communication outside that favored group was nonexistent. The lack of backbone these people brought to the table was at times, amusing. We paid a global director a 6 figure salary to not have any global responsibilities. Also had a number of VP's who were rarely visible or accessible. The layer of Directors and managers in place for one organization was thick and cumbersome thus no support, feedback or opportunity to enhance your professional development was available.I saw great people that had built great things for this company be escorted out the door like criminals because they didn't fit in the the favored group or immature managers decided it was time for them to go. Perhaps giving people the real reason for being removed might have helped, but that would mean facing conflict which again, is not an attribute ININ's leaders were hired on. It's amazing and sad what bad "leaders" can do to a group of solid performing employees.Advice to ManagementPutting people who have no idea what the attributes of a true leader are (or don't want to learn) into high level positions was a huge mistake. Incorporating a 360 performance review is a must for any company if you want to know the real truth about what your employees are facing.

Great HR, good ideas, good culture, etc. I left for a different job in a different state and kind a regretted having to leave at the time. However, I have stayed in the loop of what has gone on the past year or two and it is just so sad to see how far the company has fallen. Please buyer or potential employee of Genesys (who absorbed ININ) beware. See comments below in the Cons section.ConsRecently, it appears the CEO lost interest in who they put in charge of departments at ININ. That is the polite way of looking at it. How else does one account for people in positions of power (and stay in power) who operate in an underhanded ways. People doing jobs that they have no idea (and literally no professional experience) doing. Not to mentioned all the dishonesty involved. Wouldn't an interested CEO be involved enough to know when this is going on? Nearly whole teams have abandoned ship to avoid the downfall. That is prior and in addition to the problems of merger with the new company Genesys. Usually acquisitions, "mergers", involve layoffs, but obviously they don't even care about their employees enough to provide meaningful severance (employees who have worked for the company for many years with only a token gesture of compensation). And how layoffs are determined is apparently by whoever is the manger's favorite person (not who has the most experience and value to the company). It stinks of inexperienced, unprofessional, narcisstic managers who can't see beyond their own warped image of themselves and their ambition. I'm sure that will lead the company in the right directionAdvice to ManagementInvestigate and cut off the diseased mid-upper managersShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (9) Interactive Intelligence Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Interactive Intelligence 2017-02-02 17:57 PST Dec 6, 2016 Helpful (14)"It's much different than when I started."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Indianapolis, INCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Indianapolis, INDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Interactive Intelligence full-time (More than a year)ProsWhen I first started the culture was awesome.

Many opportunities and directions to go based on your strengths and interests. Market leader. Enough process to execute well and not let people mess things up, but not more than what is needed. Smart designs and good security especially with the CaaS cloud offerings.ConsChange is the name of the game. The market shifts and new technologies emerge rapidly. You have to be able to change and learn new things. Often it means you need to trust that the leadership and visionaries in the company have perspectives that allow them chart a course in the right direction into the future and thay sometimes they will be wrong, but we will learn from it and get to the right place faster. Recent 'bet the farm' type investments into the cloud seem like bigger shifts than in the past, but that is likely going to be one of the most important pivots the company has ever made. You can always 2nd guess if it was too soon, too much, or not enough, but you cannot say ININ was indecisive, too afraid to change, or didn't have the right people to make it happen.Advice to ManagementDo what it takes to keep ININ full of the best people. That means having the right incentives to keep the top talent. You have to keep the people everyone loves working with, the people everyone says are the reason they stay at ININ. That also means dropping low performers. Do not let the good people feel like they need to carry deadweight. Lastly, keep listening and facilitation discussion (especially the cross team collaboration). Getting to know leaders in different departments really builds bridges that pay dividends in ways you just cannot predict. Most of all it prevents silos, which have historically resulted in some internal "us" and "them", which mostly arises from ignorance due to not knowing each other and not having those connections between trusted influencers.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Interactive Intelligence Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Interactive Intelligence 2016-11-25 06:48 PST Nov 4, 2016 Helpful (3)"Great Camaraderie, Long hours, so so benefits"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Software Engineer in Indianapolis, INFormer Employee - Software Engineer in Indianapolis, INRecommendsNegative OutlookI worked at Interactive Intelligence full-time (More than a year)Prosonsite cafeteria is very convenient.Medium-sized gym in the basement of HQ1great friendly coworkers who are on the younger side so the work environment is very lively and outgoing.As a software engineer you will learn very much and will gain new skill sets if you work hard and get your hands dirty implementing code around the main sdks and systems that the company deploys.

History[edit]
In October 1994, Donald E. Brown founded the startup company Interactive Intelligence in Indianapolis, Indiana. He became the company's President and chief executive officer in 1995 and developed communication systems integration with informational technology. By 1997, Interactive Intelligence was the first to market an all-in-one customer engagement software suite.[1] The company held its initial public offering (IPO) in October 1999 and expected to earn more than $29 million.[11] During this time, Interactive Intelligence had strategic partnerships with other telecommunications companies, such as HP, IBM, Microsoft, Polycom and Salesforce.com. By 2009, the company had developed communications-as-a-service (CaaS) and cloud solutions for contact centers.[12]
Interactive Intelligence acquired AcroSoft Corp., a provider of insurance content management solutions, in 2009.[13] In 2010, the company purchased Latitude Software, a debt collection software and services provider.[14] Interactive Intelligence acquired both Agori Communications, a German-based reseller of its multichannel contact center solutions, and CallTime, an Australian-based reseller, in 2011.[15] In August 2012, Interactive Intelligence acquired Bay Bridge Decision Technologies, a developer of capacity planning and strategic analysis technology.[16] Interactive Intelligence acquired OrgSpan, a software development company focused on social and business communication, in 2014.[17]
During the summer of 2016, the company's stock prices rose as it was reported that Interactive Intelligence was exploring a potential sale.[18] In August 2016, it was announced that the customer experience company, Genesys, was set to acquire Interactive Intelligence for $1.4 billion.[19][20] The acquisition was completed in December 2016 and all Interactive Intelligence products and services integrated with Genesys.[21]
Products[edit]
The company's core product offering was the Interaction Center Platform, which centralized multi-channel business interactions and business processes. This platform could be delivered as either a premises or hosted (communications-as-a-service) offering. In addition to its software, Interactive Intelligence also provided add-on professional services, support, and education for its product line.[22]
Genesys developed a customer experience platform portfolio from Interactive Intelligence technology. PureCloud is a contact center as a service (CCaaS) cloud platform that managed customer communication with comprehensive features.[8] PureConnect is a customer interaction center (CIC) that integrates customer engagement functionality in one application.[9] PureEngage is an omnichannel customer engagement for large organizations.[10]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2010, Interactive Intelligence announced its non-profit corporation, Interactive Intelligence Foundation, to assist at-risk youth. The Foundation raised funds to promote technology education for youth in Indiana and outside the United States.[23] It hosted an annual gala and silent auction as part of its fundraising activities.[24]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Interactive Intelligence was recognized as a "market leader" by industry analyst firms such as Datamonitor,[25] Frost & Sullivan,[26] and Gartner.[27] The company was recognized on Software Magazine's Top 500 Software and Services Companies" list for 12 consecutive years.[28] It was also ranked #8 on Forbes 2011 list of "America's 100 Best Small Companies."[29] Interactive Intelligence's acquisition by Genesys was recognized as "largest tech-company acquisition" since 2013.[30]

By 1997, Interactive Intelligence was the first to market an all-in-one customer engagement software suite.[1] The company held its initial public offering (IPO) in October 1999 and expected to earn more than $29 million.[11] During this time, Interactive Intelligence had strategic partnerships with other telecommunications companies, such as HP, IBM, Microsoft, Polycom and Salesforce.com. By 2009, the company had developed communications-as-a-service (CaaS) and cloud solutions for contact centers.[12]
Interactive Intelligence acquired AcroSoft Corp., a provider of insurance content management solutions, in 2009.[13] In 2010, the company purchased Latitude Software, a debt collection software and services provider.[14] Interactive Intelligence acquired both Agori Communications, a German-based reseller of its multichannel contact center solutions, and CallTime, an Australian-based reseller, in 2011.[15] In August 2012, Interactive Intelligence acquired Bay Bridge Decision Technologies, a developer of capacity planning and strategic analysis technology.[16] Interactive Intelligence acquired OrgSpan, a software development company focused on social and business communication, in 2014.[17]
During the summer of 2016, the company's stock prices rose as it was reported that Interactive Intelligence was exploring a potential sale.[18] In August 2016, it was announced that the customer experience company, Genesys, was set to acquire Interactive Intelligence for $1.4 billion.[19][20] The acquisition was completed in December 2016 and all Interactive Intelligence products and services integrated with Genesys.[21]
Products[edit]
The company's core product offering was the Interaction Center Platform, which centralized multi-channel business interactions and business processes. This platform could be delivered as either a premises or hosted (communications-as-a-service) offering. In addition to its software, Interactive Intelligence also provided add-on professional services, support, and education for its product line.[22]
Genesys developed a customer experience platform portfolio from Interactive Intelligence technology. PureCloud is a contact center as a service (CCaaS) cloud platform that managed customer communication with comprehensive features.[8] PureConnect is a customer interaction center (CIC) that integrates customer engagement functionality in one application.[9] PureEngage is an omnichannel customer engagement for large organizations.[10]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2010, Interactive Intelligence announced its non-profit corporation, Interactive Intelligence Foundation, to assist at-risk youth. The Foundation raised funds to promote technology education for youth in Indiana and outside the United States.[23] It hosted an annual gala and silent auction as part of its fundraising activities.[24]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Interactive Intelligence was recognized as a "market leader" by industry analyst firms such as Datamonitor,[25] Frost & Sullivan,[26] and Gartner.[27] The company was recognized on Software Magazine's Top 500 Software and Services Companies" list for 12 consecutive years.[28] It was also ranked #8 on Forbes 2011 list of "America's 100 Best Small Companies."[29] Interactive Intelligence's acquisition by Genesys was recognized as "largest tech-company acquisition" since 2013.[30]

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
