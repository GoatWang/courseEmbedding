Buy Bitcoin with your IRA • Bitcoin IRA







































    





Copyright © 2017 Bitcoin IRA. All Rights Reserved 




Buy Bitcoin using your IRA or 401k




Bitcoin is in a temporary dip and yet is still up over 200% in 2017 alone. Invest your IRA in Bitcoin before Bitcoin's next massive price rise.


This is an IRS approved program with no penalties to move your retirement funds.


Complete this form to get started and to receive your free Bitcoin Guide.

“Bitcoin: It’s a red-hot asset that’s now being used as a retirement investment.”




“The world’s hottest asset is the newest way to invest for retirement.”

How It Works | BitcoinIRA.com


























































 



























 






 















How Bitcoin IRA Works














Bitcoin IRA is a one-of-a-kind investment opportunity.
 We are a full-service company that ensures a safe transfer of your retirement account into an IRS-approved account for Bitcoin and Ethereum.







  

















Step 1
Complete Your IRA Application



We will send you an application to set up a new Bitcoin IRA account with our custodian to get started.















  











Step 2
Rollover Your IRA or 401k Funds



Once your account is set up, we request a transfer of your funds from your existing retirement account into your new Bitcoin IRA.





















  

















Step 3
Buy Your Bitcoins



After your funds arrive we’ll schedule a phone call with you to perform a live trade and buy your Bitcoins.















  











Step 4
Access Your Exclusive Bitgo™ “Cold Storage” Wallet



Your Bitcoins are stored securely in our exclusive digital wallet with Bitgo, the leader in multi-signature encryption technology. 





















  
















We Ensure The Highest Security
We created a multi-layer system to provide maximum security for your Bitcoin IRA.















Your Digital Wallet
Your Bitcoins are stored with BitGo, the leader in multi-signature encryption and digital security with over $1 Billion in transactions per month. Learn more about Bitgo.




Your Security Keys
Three unique keys are generated to ensure maximum security. These are kept with:
✓ Your digital wallet, BitGo
✓ Your Bitcoin IRA custodian, Kingdom Trust
✓ Your backup key provider, Keytern.al




ID + Voice Verification
Unlike cash Bitcoin transactions, we require additional layers of security including ID verification and voice confirmation when we perform your live trade. This ensures maximum security for your transfer and purchase.














  









 
Multiple keys protects your Bitcoin IRA funds against single machine compromise or single key losses.
A multi-signature wallet is one where multiple private keys are required to move the bitcoins instead of a single key. These private keys are spread across multiple machines, essentially eliminating the opportunity of theft from malware or hackers since they are unlikely to simultaneously compromise your laptop, desktop and smartphone.


















Getting started is easy. Let us help.




Take advantage of one of the fastest growing investments in 2017.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Fulfill important philanthropic commitments

Implement your plan

Grayscale to Launch Ethereum Classic Trust, Modeled After Bitcoin Investment Trust 





Grayscale Investments is gearing up to launch a new investment product for Ethereum Classic (ETC) in the first quarter of this year. This will be the second investment product for the company; the first was the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT). Bitcoin.com caught up with Grayscale CEO and founder, Barry Silbert, to find out more about this new product.

From BIT to ETC Trust
It has been over three years since Grayscale launched its first product, the BIT, on September 25, 2013, when the price of Bitcoin was roughly $127.7 and the market cap was only about $1.469 billion. Modeled on the SPDR® Gold Shares ETF, the Trust was created for investors looking for Bitcoin exposure. By the end of last year, it had $164.21 million in assets under management. The BIT has always been a private placement for accredited investors, trading over-the-counter. Now, the company, waiting to be listed on the NYSE Arca, has ceased all private offerings but continues to trade on OTCQX under the symbol GBTC.
As the BIT begins its journey away from being a private vehicle for only accredited investors, Grayscale is introducing another private investment vehicle called the ‘Ethereum (ETC) Investment Trust‘ (EIT). It allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum Classic without actually owning any ETC.
The ETC Investment Trust
According to Silbert, the new product is modeled after the BIT. “It will be an open-ended trust that holds ETC,” he described. As such, the Trust can issue and redeem shares at any time. Regarding the decision to launch this new Trust, Silbert told Bitcoin.com:

We’re excited about the potential for Ethereum Classic and the underlying token (ETC) and believe there is demand from investors that would like to invest in a vehicle that enables them to participate in the price movement via a titled security.

ETC is the newer of the two Ethereum cryptocurrencies resulting from the July 2016 hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain. It is “a continuation of the original Ethereum blockchain – the classic version preserving untampered history; free from external interference and subjective tampering of transactions,” its website describes. While ETC is the original protocol and has fewer modifications than the other Ethereum cryptocurrency (ETH), many of the developers and the community behind Ethereum have moved on to ETH.
ETC now trades on several exchanges including Bitfinex and Poloniex. At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading at US$1.40, approximately half of its all-time-high price from immediately after the split, with a market cap of around $124.6 million.
For Accredited Investors
Silbert confirmed that the EIT “will be launched as a private vehicle open to accredited investor.” The Grayscale website now describes its new product just as it did with the BIT, stating that:

The EIT is not registered with the SEC and the EIT’s shares are being offered in a private placement pursuant to Rule 506(c) under Regulation D.

The Securities Act of 1933 mandates all companies to register any securities with the SEC that they are offering or selling. However, there are some exemptions such as one provided by Regulation D (Reg D) which allows a company to sell its securities to accredited investors without registering with the Commission by filing Form D, ‘Notice of Exempt Offering of Securities’.
There are many ways to qualify as an accredited investor. For example, anyone with a net worth exceeding $1 million or with an income of more than $200,000 in the two most recent years and reasonably expects the same for the current year, is qualified.
While there is much to do before launching the EIT, Silbert said the company is “Planning to launch in Q1,” adding that they are “waiting for the monetary policy (supply cap) to get finalized.”
What do you think of the ETC Trust? Let us know in the comments section below.

etc  it is based on china miners POW it is one the main reason why the push for that coin is happenning and Vitalik is on the way to go POS with ethereum…POW i dont think they can maintain that for a long term sill …so etc is on lets middle term for investement like in a 8 to 12 months range … it will climb on the chart and after that it may be different i invest in etc as a speculative coin … you cant buy nothin cant do nadda with that just see it go wild and crazy on the chart…ok happy trade…

Let’s say I constructed a bridge “modeled after” the Golden Gate.   Everything is the same, except instead of finding nice solid rock bedrock on the sea floor, there is just mud, with thicker mud below.   But I’ve completed the bridge, and it seems sturdy enough to us.  Above the waterline my bridge looks identical to the Golden Gate.
Would you drive across it?   How about during a storm when there is a pretty good wind?
Bitcoin is protected with 3.3 Eh/s (3,300,000 Th/s), or the equivalent of ~300,000 Antminer T9s.   To get that amount of hashrate to perform a 51% attack (for the purpose of double spending)  you’ld need to control about $350M worth of SHA256 ASIC hardware.   But there isn’t $350M worth of hardware for sale and these are not used with any other coin, so the true cost of a 51% attack against bitcoin is even higher.
Ethereum Classic hashrate is 1.0 Th/s (Scypt).  This is about the equivalent of 40,000 high-end GPUs.  To get the amount of hashrate to perform a 51% attack (for the purposeof double spending) you’ld need to control about $10M worth of GPU hardware.   This exists in the supply chain (new GPUs), or could be redirected from other altcoins, where as many  as 20X this number of CPUs are already in use for other altcoins.  For instance, Ethereum has about $80M worth of the same GPUs.   So if just 1/8th of Ethereum miners were to decide to temporarily re-assign their hardware, contributing the hashes to a 51% attack on Ethereum-Classic, that attack would be succesful.  1 out of 8!!!   (Incidentally, ZCash also has about as many GPUs as Ethereum, so this attack might need participation from only 1 out of 16 ZCash miners plus 1 out of 16 Ethereum miners. 
Ethereum Classic is the suspension bridge built atop a mud base.  It’s using Bitcoin’s stable proof-of-work design that was built for a different condition …. i.e., benefiting from having the vast majority of hashrate for its hardware class. )
Anyone pushing $ETC as being a suitable alternative to $BTC needs to be questioned, and their motives understood.






vatten



Don’t understand the logic of investing in an insecure cryptocurrency that have much less hash power than ETH, thus can be 51% attacked any time by the major ETH hash power.
Imagine that you deposit 50K ETC to an exchange, exchange them to bitcoin and withdraw, then do a 51% attack to wipe out that transaction, this is totally feasible with today’s ETH hash power, thus any exchange supporting ETC trading would have to establish lots of transaction limit to protect them from this attack, thus make ETC extremely low liquidity

Rothschild Investment Corporation Becomes Bitcoin Stakeholder 





A major mainstream investment company, Rothschild Investment Corporation, has embraced cryptocurrency by investing in bitcoin. The company recently filed a holdings report that solidified this investment move. They bought shares of the GBTC, or the bitcoin investment trust, which acts as a share that tacks its value to bitcoin’s price.

The Econotimes covered the facts: “According to the details provided, Rothschild Investment Corporation has acquired shares of Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) for $210,000.”

The Bitcoin Investment Trust
The Bitcoin investment trust is a U.S. based securities exchange. For clarity, some people have misinterpreted Rothschild Investment Corporation as directly buying and storing bitcoin. In reality, they merely purchased shares of the trust, which holds “bitcoin on paper” in the traditional fashion, as publicly quoted securities. This allows investors to keep and hold the value of bitcoin without having to purchase the currency and hold it in a wallet.
The Econotimes provided an explanation:

Sponsored by Grayscale Investments, the Bitcoin Investment Trust is an open-ended grantor trust based in the U.S. Its shares are publicly quoted securities solely invested in and deriving value from the price of bitcoin. The publicly traded shares officially started trading under the ticker GBTC in 2015.

Bitcoin shares began public trading via Bitcoin Investment trust on March of 2015. This move by Rothschild Investment Company represents a major mainstream player hedging bets on the future value of bitcoin.
Rothschild Investment Corporation and an Illuminati Conspiracy
There were also rumors that Rothschild Investment Corporation was related to the Rothschild family. In various social media posts, people thought there was some kind of conspiracy or deal that Rothchild himself made for gaining shares of bitcoin. The conspiracy theorists believe the Illuminati and lizard rulers may be colluding to sabotage bitcoin.
This turned out to be false, as the company has no relationship to the Rothschild family other than possessing its namesake. The tweets below should say “Rothschild Investment Corporation,” and not just Rothschild the person. The reason for confusion is clear, because the name is relatively common. Looks like the Illuminati are still waiting for their chance to enter the market.

Eh, no they didn’t invest in Bitcoin, they invested in a fund tied to Bitcoin.
They could in effect be shorting it too.

Bitcoin Investment Trust Could IPO by October 





Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) wants to be listed on NYSE Arca, according to a registration statement filed Friday with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This is the second proposed Bitcoin investment trust listing on the exchange. The first, Solidx Bitcoin Trust, has yet to be approved by the SEC. Using Solidx as a model, it could take the Commission until October to make a decision whether to approve or disapprove BIT’s listing.
Also read: SEC Delays Decision on SolidX Bitcoin Trust 
As Donald Trump prepared to be inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States on January 20, Barry Silbert filed a registration statement with the SEC seeking an initial public offering (IPO) for his flagship fund BIT. BIT’s shares are to be listed under the symbol GBTC on the NYSE Arca.
The IPO
“This is an initial public offering of the Trust’s Shares,” BIT’s registration statement reads. The shares “are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in Bitcoin.” Grayscale Investments, LLC is the sponsor of the Trust, Delaware Trust Company is the trustee, the Bank of New York Mellon is the transfer agent, as well as the administrator, and Xapo Inc. is the custodian. The annual fee for investors will remain at 2 percent. The proposed maximum offering is $500 million of the Trust’s shares.
Silbert’s Grayscale Investments, LLC simultaneously announced that it “has ceased its ongoing private placement and will no longer issue shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust through its previous 506(c) private placement.” However, BIT’s shares will continue to be quoted in the secondary market over-the-counter on OTCQX under the symbol GBTC while the registration with the SEC is pending approval. GBTC currently has assets under management of $164.21 million as of the end of December 2016.
Possible Time Frame
A possible time frame for the SEC to either approve or disapprove BIT’s listing on the NYSE Arca can be estimated using Solidx Bitcoin Trust as an example. Solidx originally filed with the Commission to list on the NYSE Arca on July 11, 2016.
After the company’s initial filing, the next step will be for the exchange to file with the SEC “a proposed rule change to list and trade shares” under NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.201. For Solidx, the NYSE Arca filed with the SEC on July 13, 2016, which was two days after Solidx filed. Given that BIT’s filing was on a Friday, the NYSE Arca could file with the SEC early next week.
Then the proposed rule change would be published for comments in the Federal Register. This usually happens between two to three weeks after a filing with the SEC. For Solidx, it was published on August 2, 2016, approximately three weeks after filing. That means the proposed rule change for BIT should be published in the Federal Register sometime in the second or third week of February.
After publishing in the Federal Register, the Commission has 180 days to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change. However, it can also extend that period by a maximum of 60 days if necessary, which is a total of 240 days from the publication in the Federal Register. For Solidx, the SEC has already chosen to extend the consideration period as long as it could to March 30, 2017.
For BIT, 180 days from a likely date of publication in the Federal Register would be early August and 60 days after that would be early October.
Likelihood of Approval
The SEC has a habit of delaying making decisions on Bitcoin investment funds as seen by the delay for Solidx, taking the maximum time allowed by the Securities Exchange Act. Recently, Needham & Company, which provides investment coverage of BIT, suggested that the chance of the SEC approving Bitcoin ETFs is very low, at less than 25 percent.
President Trump
According to Needham, there is no more extension available for the Commission after the 60 days. The firm also suggested that the Commission may not make a decision by the deadline, in which case “the proposed rule change is automatically approved,” Needham’s report reads. The firm believes this will increase the likelihood of an ETF being approved. Then, there’s the ‘Trump factor.’
The new administration may be more Bitcoin friendly than the previous administration. “We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers,” President Trump recently said.
Do you think the SEC will approve BIT’s listing by October? Let us know in the comments section below.

Buy Bitcoin with your IRA • Bitcoin IRA







































    





Copyright © 2017 Bitcoin IRA. All Rights Reserved 




Buy Bitcoin using your IRA or 401k




Bitcoin is in a temporary dip and yet is still up over 200% in 2017 alone. Invest your IRA in Bitcoin before Bitcoin's next massive price rise.


This is an IRS approved program with no penalties to move your retirement funds.


Complete this form to get started and to receive your free Bitcoin Guide.

“Bitcoin: It’s a red-hot asset that’s now being used as a retirement investment.”




“The world’s hottest asset is the newest way to invest for retirement.”




“This is the first Bitcoin IRA approved by the IRS.”

How It Works | BitcoinIRA.com


























































 



























 






 















How Bitcoin IRA Works














Bitcoin IRA is a one-of-a-kind investment opportunity.
 We are a full-service company that ensures a safe transfer of your retirement account into an IRS-approved account for Bitcoin and Ethereum.







  

















Step 1
Complete Your IRA Application



We will send you an application to set up a new Bitcoin IRA account with our custodian to get started.















  











Step 2
Rollover Your IRA or 401k Funds



Once your account is set up, we request a transfer of your funds from your existing retirement account into your new Bitcoin IRA.





















  

















Step 3
Buy Your Bitcoins



After your funds arrive we’ll schedule a phone call with you to perform a live trade and buy your Bitcoins.















  











Step 4
Access Your Exclusive Bitgo™ “Cold Storage” Wallet



Your Bitcoins are stored securely in our exclusive digital wallet with Bitgo, the leader in multi-signature encryption technology. 





















  
















We Ensure The Highest Security
We created a multi-layer system to provide maximum security for your Bitcoin IRA.















Your Digital Wallet
Your Bitcoins are stored with BitGo, the leader in multi-signature encryption and digital security with over $1 Billion in transactions per month. Learn more about Bitgo.




Your Security Keys
Three unique keys are generated to ensure maximum security. These are kept with:
✓ Your digital wallet, BitGo
✓ Your Bitcoin IRA custodian, Kingdom Trust
✓ Your backup key provider, Keytern.al




ID + Voice Verification
Unlike cash Bitcoin transactions, we require additional layers of security including ID verification and voice confirmation when we perform your live trade. This ensures maximum security for your transfer and purchase.














  









 
Multiple keys protects your Bitcoin IRA funds against single machine compromise or single key losses.
A multi-signature wallet is one where multiple private keys are required to move the bitcoins instead of a single key. These private keys are spread across multiple machines, essentially eliminating the opportunity of theft from malware or hackers since they are unlikely to simultaneously compromise your laptop, desktop and smartphone.


















Getting started is easy. Let us help.




Take advantage of one of the fastest growing investments in 2017.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Just do some research on where to invest bitcoins and you should find out that eBitInvest is the only good option and soon you'll realize that it's the very best site on the entire internet.

As bitcoin prices dominate headlines, you might be wondering whether you should invest in the popular cryptocurrency.

Probably not: It's just too volatile. The virtual currency is known for wild fluctuations in price. The value of one bitcoin—which was created in 2008 by an anonymous programmer or group of programmers—reached its all-time high of $1,165.89 in November 2013 before taking a major dive, according to CoinDesk data.

Since then, prices have more or less inched up, and at the turn of the year, they started to approach record highs. On Thursday, the value of a bitcoin reached $1,153.02. However, later Thursday morning, prices suddenly fell by about $200.

"Liquidity dried up—no shorts, no sellers, which means a volatile little bubble formed quickly," Peter Smith, chief executive of bitcoin wallet Blockchain, told CNBC.

Those sudden ups and downs would be bad news for your portfolio. Although bitcoin had a more than 100% return on investment in 2016, it's also five times more volatile than the S&P 500, said Campbell Harvey, a professor of finance at Duke University, who described bitcoin as "an extremely risky investment."

Even if you were to buy bitcoin low and sell high, you still might not see the big payday you're hoping for. "You try to sell it, and by the time the order goes through, the price may have dropped," said Matthew Elbeck, a professor of marketing at Troy University. "It's really, really not worth it for the ordinary consumer."

If you do choose to take the plunge and buy a bitcoin, make sure it's a very small part of your diversified portfolio—and that you can afford to lose your investment. "I would never recommend this on a stand-alone basis," Harvey said.

Still, for some people living internationally—like Venezuelans plagued with a shortage of cash and those in China, where the government has restricted movement of capital outside of the country—bitcoin presents an attractive option to get ahold of cash, Harvey said. Its rising popularity in these countries are part of the reason behind bitcoin's recent surge.

Regardless of bitcoin's ups and downs, the technology behind it—particularly the blockchain, the common ledger that the virtual currency uses—could have a long-lasting impact as a medium of exchange. As Harvey told MONEY's Taylor Tepper in 2015:

Should You Invest In Bitcoin?
That’s a decision you’ll have to make on your own, but what you should consider are the fact that Bitcoin still remains one of the most watched and speculated currencies of all time.  Here are a few very interesting fact regarding bitcoin, and something to think about when pondering if this coin will rise to astronomic heights, or shrivel and fade away.

It’s had it’s fair share major setbacks such as the Silk Road scandal, Mt Gox collapsing, which was one of the worlds biggest Bitcoin Exchanges, and a host of other problems.  Yet it remains a new method of payment solution for a quickly growing number of large companies around the world.
There are only so many Bitcoins available in the world.  We cannot create more bitcoins, like we do with money, which only services to deflate the actual value of paper currencies.  Once all the Bitcoins are released into the systems, they will actually go UP in value do to supply and demand.  If bitcoin is adopted on a mass scale, it’s value WILL in fact go up.  Just how much no one knows.
Bitcoins work as a payment solution like Paypal, Payza or those types of sites.  It eliminates the need for the typical banking transaction fees associated with large volume transfers of money.  With Bitcoin, any two parties can do business without borders, and without fees.  The general public still doesn’t understand this fact.
Bitcoin is now processing more transactions than Paypal, and is less than 1/10th of it’s age.

Deciding on whether to invest in Bitcoins or not, should not be based on it’s USD-Bitcoin pricing valuation at the moment.  That number is no where near it’s real mark.
Research Bitcoin, what it is used for, what it would do for society, and if you believe it’s going to be adopted, then invest in it.  Never purchase what you cannot afford to lose, and don’t take more risk than you are comfortable with.
Decide how you want to invest in bitcoin as there are many ways to acquire it.  You can and ride it’s price value then sell it.  Many currency traders use  to handle their trades for them automatically.  You can buy a select amount of coins, and hold onto them.  You can try your hand at  and generate them that way.
No matter what you do, Bitcoin is sure a fun and interesting thing to watch!  We hope you like this information and come back to visits soon.

Bitcoin: Virtual money or risky investment?
By Claes Bell • Bankrate.com

In an age when most of our money is little more than electrons in our banks' computers, it may feel like bitcoins and other virtual currencies aren't that different from the dollars you directly deposit into your account each week or the 401(k) account that holds your nest egg.

But bitcoins are different. It is an online currency that can be transferred through a computer or smartphone without an intermediate financial institution.

While it's true that many investors these days experience their portfolios primarily as numbers on a computer screen, owning a stock means you have a small piece of something that's at least partially tangible. That is, the company has offices, factories and other assets. Similarly, all those blips in your checking account can be withdrawn as cash and carried around in your wallet, and that cash is backed by the financial -- and literal -- firepower of the U.S. government.

On the other hand, bitcoins exist almost exclusively as entries on a giant virtual ledger stored on computers worldwide.

While the purely digital nature of bitcoins may make some uncomfortable, it does have a major upside: A user's bitcoins can't be frozen by an angry government, and the movement of bitcoins in and out of a country can't be prevented, says Jelena Mirkovic, a computer scientist and assistant professor at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute.

Bitcoins are created or issued by a central bank. They are created by "miners," who solve one of a series of increasingly complex math problems through a combination of computing power and luck, Mirkovic says.

A miner who solves the problem gets to put his name next to a predetermined number of bitcoins on a ledger, which records all bitcoin transactions and is constantly shared and updated by a peer-to-peer network similar to the original version of the music-sharing service Napster. The number of bitcoins and the speed at which they can be created is mathematically limited, with successful mining that earns fewer and fewer bitcoins over time until the number reaches a little less than 21 million. That's when it stops.

"You're trying lots of different combinations to find the solution," Mirkovic says. "There is not a way to solve this quickly, so you have to just do a lot of trials in order to find the answer, and that's what controls the market. That's what guarantees that you can't just manufacture lots of coins."
An unconventional currency

When it comes to actually making day-to-day transactions, bitcoins aren't yet as useful as conventional currency, Mirkovic says. At the moment, only a handful of businesses, mostly online, accept bitcoins as payment, including blogging site WordPress and Reddit.

You know how if someone steals your debit card information and makes a bunch of purchases, you can report the theft and get your money back? That doesn't happen with bitcoins, which puts the onus for security squarely on users.

In order to make a bitcoin transaction, you need a "private key" that corresponds to the bitcoin address where your coins are held. That key consists of a code consisting of a long string of numbers and letters, which bitcoin users can keep on a slip of paper or in a file on their computer. Programs called "wallets" also can be used to keep track of a user's private keys.

Without that key, it's pretty much impossible for a thief to steal a user's bitcoins, Mirkovic says. But should someone manage to gain access to a bitcoin owner's hard drive though malware or other means and steal their private keys, they could use it to transfer that owner's bitcoins to themselves. Once done, such transactions, like all bitcoin transactions, are permanent and irreversible.

To prevent that, bitcoin users should consider storing their private keys on a separate computer than the one they use for day-to-day transactions and browsing so that they're out of reach of hackers, Mirkovic says.

Compared to more conventional investments such as stocks or bonds, the market for bitcoins is still in its infancy.

In this article, we’ll talk about Investing in bitcoin, and if it’s a smart play or not.  There’s a few factors at play other than the price of bitcoin that you should be aware of before making your decision.  We’ll also cover a few ways to invest in the digital currency.
Bitcoin has been one of the most amazing currencies to watch in the history of mankind.
First of all, the value of Bitcoin is only as strong as the trust that the Bitcoin community places in it, which means it holds an intrinsic value and not a real value such as gold, silver or land.  Those commodities will always hold value, and can be traded no matter what happens in the world.  If someone were to pull the plug on our power grid, bitcoin would literally become absolutely worthless in an instant.  So would paper currencies however, so their existence has actually provided precedence for the creation of the new digital currency.
So while the faith we maintain as a society in our technological advancement grows, it also paves the way for this new phenomenon of Bitcoins and all other alt-coins.
The value of a single bitcoin rose quickly in 2013 to a record $1200 per bitcoin.  This was mainly due to a large number of quick profit opportunists jumping on the new gold rush.  It’s value has since fallen to less than half of it’s high, while the world still tries to figure out what exactly is bitcoin, and how it will become useful to the general public.
However the speed at which the currency is being adopted by huge corporations is staggering. 

Address
A Bitcoin address is similar to a physical address or an email. It is the only information you need to provide for someone to pay you with Bitcoin. An important difference, however, is that each address should only be used for a single transaction.
Bit
Bit is a common unit used to designate a sub-unit of a bitcoin - 1,000,000 bits is equal to 1 bitcoin (BTC or B?). This unit is usually more convenient for pricing tips, goods and services.
Bitcoin
Bitcoin - with capitalization, is used when describing the concept of Bitcoin, or the entire network itself. e.g. "I was learning about the Bitcoin protocol today."bitcoin - without capitalization, is used to describe bitcoins as a unit of account. e.g. "I sent ten bitcoins today."; it is also often abbreviated BTC or XBT.
Block
A block is a record in the block chain that contains and confirms many waiting transactions. Roughly every 10 minutes, on average, a new block including transactions is appended to the through mining.

Block Chain
The block chain is a public record of Bitcoin transactions in chronological order. The block chain is shared between all Bitcoin users. It is used to verify the permanence of Bitcoin transactions and to prevent double spending.
BTC
BTC is a common unit used to designate one bitcoin (B?).
Confirmation
Confirmation means that a transaction has been processed by the network and is highly unlikely to be reversed. Transactions receive a confirmation when they are included in a and for each subsequent block. Even a single confirmation can be considered secure for low value transactions, although for larger amounts like 1000 US$, it makes sense to wait for 6 confirmations or more. Each confirmation exponentially decreases the risk of a reversed transaction.
Cryptography
Cryptography is the branch of mathematics that lets us create mathematical proofs that provide high levels of security. Online commerce and banking already uses cryptography. In the case of Bitcoin, cryptography is used to make it impossible for anybody to spend funds from another user's wallet or to corrupt the block chain. It can also be used to encrypt a wallet, so that it cannot be used without a password.
Double Spend
If a malicious user tries to spend their bitcoins to two different recipients at the same time, this is double spending. Bitcoin mining and the block chain are there to create a consensus on the network about which of the two transactions will confirm and be considered valid.
Hash Rate
The hash rate is the measuring unit of the processing power of the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin network must make intensive mathematical operations for security purposes. When the network reached a hash rate of 10 Th/s, it meant it could make 10 trillion calculations per second.
Mining
Bitcoin mining is the process of making computer hardware do mathematical calculations for the Bitcoin network to confirm transactions and increase security. As a reward for their services, Bitcoin miners can collect transaction fees for the transactions they confirm, along with newly created bitcoins. Mining is a specialized and competitive market where the rewards are divided up according to how much calculation is done. Not all Bitcoin users do Bitcoin mining, and it is not an easy way to make money.
P2P
Peer-to-peer refers to systems that work like an organized collective by allowing each individual to interact directly with the others. In the case of Bitcoin, the network is built in such a way that each user is broadcasting the transactions of other users. And, crucially, no bank is required as a third party.
Private Key
A private key is a secret piece of data that proves your right to spend bitcoins from a specific wallet through a cryptographic  Your private key(s) are stored in your computer if you use a software wallet; they are stored on some remote servers if you use a web wallet. Private keys must never be revealed as they allow you to spend bitcoins for their respective Bitcoin wallet.
Signature
A cryptographic signature is a mathematical mechanism that allows someone to prove ownership. In the case of Bitcoin, a Bitcoin wallet and its  are linked by some mathematical magic. When your Bitcoin software signs a transaction with the appropriate private key, the whole network can see that the signature matches the bitcoins being spent. However, there is no way for the world to guess your private key to steal your hard-earned bitcoins.
Wallet
A Bitcoin wallet is loosely the equivalent of a physical wallet on the Bitcoin network. The wallet actually contains your  which allow you to spend the bitcoins allocated to it in the block chain. Each Bitcoin wallet can show you the total balance of all bitcoins it controls and lets you pay a specific amount to a specific person, just like a real wallet. This is different to credit cards where you are charged by the merchant.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
