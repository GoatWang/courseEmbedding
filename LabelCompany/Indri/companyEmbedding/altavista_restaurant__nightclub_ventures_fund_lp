Testimonials

 

FUNDED $100,000
“Atlantis Capital provided great service and overall it was a wonderful experience. Their concept of cash flow management is unique and outstanding. My funding specialist was courteous and prompt, and made sure I was really comfortable with the terms & conditions. They made getting a loan so incredibly easy, fast and simple-I knew I was making the right decision. I highly recommend Atlantis Capital to business owners who are searching for financing-the process couldn't have been smoother.”
Michael K.President, Winter Ventures Inc, Pennsylvania


FUNDED $25,000
“In these tough economic times it is even tougher for restaurants to get a straightforward loans from banks & credit unions. After exchanging dozens of phone calls & emails from other lenders I was recommended to Mr. Alan Rahman through a friend. From the first conversation I had with Mr. Alan, I knew I was talking to someone who knows how to thread the needle in terms of unsecured loan. It was a very smooth professional reciprocation from Mr. Alan & the whole process took about 5 to 7 business days .Everything was upfront & As per the conversation. I would highly recommend all restaurant owners to call Mr. Alan Rahman of Atlantis Capital ,You will be glad you did.”
Raza W.Owner, Diba foods LLC, Rhode Island.


FUNDED $10,000
“Thank you for your help. It definitely pushed us forward! We are definitely happy that we made the decision to use your funding to help our company grow.”
Karina L.Owner, Hay Now Colorado LLC, Colorado


FUNDED $185,000
My business is to import and wholesale T-shirts. I have been in this business for over four years and I was looking for working capital for short period of time. But unfortunately, I didn't get any reliable source to get funds as working capital. However, I have been introduced to Atlantis Capital through one of my friends. I was amazed to know that they were ready to fund me without any collateral or personal guarantee up to $5 million dollars depending on my monthly bank deposits! My account executive was very helpful & professional and guided me to get the desired funds within days. He answered all my phone calls and replied all my emails regarding this cash advance. The most important aspect of this company is that they really can lend “big amounts” as unsecured cash advance. It’s always hard for a small business to get bank loans. Atlantis Capital provided me with the support I needed just when I needed it.
Sarder H.CEO, Big Apple International Inc, New Jersey


FUNDED $22,000
“Being an owner of a HVAC repair and installation business in Florida, I always need working capital during slow and pick seasons of my business. Till today, I have taken three cash advances from Atlantis Capital , LLC. There are lots of business financing companies out there, but I feel comfortable working with this company. They are very helpful, informative and above all , honest. They never charge any upfront fee and they always keep their commitments. I always wish them success !”
Jorge R.Owner, Fast Cooling Corp, Florida

Safely Enable SaaS Applications with Aperture
 The adoption of SaaS applications continues to grow at an exponential pace. You do not want to clamp down on these applications because they are valuable tools for many of your employees. However, because the data and usage of these SaaS applications is invisible to IT administrators, they do expose your organization to potentially disastrous security and data theft risks. Join us for a live webinar where you will learn how your organization can enable safe usage of SaaS applications and: • Gain visibility and granular, context-based control of SaaS applications. • Protect corporate data from malicious and inadvertent exposure after it has left the traditional corporate perimeter. • Protect against new insertion and distribution points for malware. • Satisfy compliance requirements while still maintaining the benefits of SaaS based application services. The challenges of SaaS applications are already here whether they are enabled by IT or end users themselves. Find out how to take back control and safely enable their use.

Nightclub Sample Business Plan Sample

If you are looking into starting a nightclub then this sample business plan is a great guide. Use this example to compile your own.
1Executive Summary
The Nightclub will be the premier, high-energy, themed dance and nightclub in Waldport, Your State. Our goal is to remain a step ahead of our competition through an exemplary service provision. We expect our guests to have more fun during their leisure time. We will provide more video and electronic technology per square footage than anyone else in the region.



A simple, yet unique, themed menu and atmosphere will create a sense of ‘belonging’ for locals and tourists alike. Our operating credo is: “happy enthusiastic employees create happy enthusiastic guests.”
Download: Free Business Plan Template Download
The main objectives of the development of this new venue are:
Capitalise on excellent location opportunity with swift commitment to the new Town Square development.
To launch the venue with a highly publicised grand opening event in the summer of Year 1.
To maintain tight control of costs, operations, and cash flow through diligent management and automated computer control.
To maintain a food cost below 33% of food revenue.
To maintain a total beverage cost below 25% of beverage revenue.
To exceed $3 million in annual sales by the fourth year of plan implementation.
The keys to success in achieving our goals are:
Provide exceptional service that leaves an impression.
Consistent entertainment atmosphere and product quality.
Managing our internal finances and cash flow to enable upward capital growth.
Strict control of all costs, at all times, without exception.
2Company Summary

The key elements of The Nightclub’s concept are as follows:
Entertainment and dance based themes – The company will focus on themes that have mass appeal.
Distinctive design features – The Nightclub will be characterised by the elaborate dance club situated in a spectator setting which comfortably accommodates 350 guests. The area will also offer three private sky boxes which can be combined for use in a conference or private party setting. This room is intended for special events and daily use. The adjoining dining room and bar would present an inviting and relaxing atmosphere, which displays a collection of musical and dance memorabilia. A live dj will coordinate the events and entertain the patrons with music and games during music breaks and off-times.
Location, location, location – One of the major advantages that The Nightclub will have over its competition will be its location in the new, high-profile Your Town Centre.
Gaming – The Nightclub will provide several interactive style video games and pool tables to provide for both additional entertainment and revenue.
Quality food – All would be lost without special attention being paid to the level of food quality. A simple menu offering foods similar to those found at a premier venue. Traditional ‘bar’ appetizers will be on hand for people craving nachos, wings, or quesadillas while they drink and enjoy themselves.
Exceptional service – In order to reach and maintain a unique image of quality, the Nightclub will provide attentive and friendly service through a high ratio of service personnel to customers, and will also invest in the training and supervision of its employees. We estimate nearly one service staff member for every 35 guests.
2.1 Start-up Summary
The company is seeking a loan for start-up purposes for a new entertainment venue in Waldport. Funds needed to accomplish goal referenced above will be $x.x million. The applicant will require the entire $x.x million to finish project build-out. We will utilise the anticipated loans in the amount of $x.x million to build out the approximate 10,000 square foot space and purchase equipment necessary for the start-up of a new nightclub venue. The following tables and charts illustrate the capital requirements.
2.2 Company Ownership
The Nightclub is a privately-held LLC, the details of which have not been solidified as of the date of this publication. The LLC consists of three principals DD, HK, BK. D D holds a BS in business administration from the The State University. He has held restaurant management positions for the PepsiCo Corporation.
He successfully opened and managed two nightclubs, and went on to open other operations including a sports bar. He is currently in his fifth year in the hotel industry, where he manages a successful sales department. HK holds a BA in Industrial Media Management, with a concentration in marketing.
She has held a financial analyst position with Lockheed Martin and L3 Communications for two years. BK has been managing a staff for eight years. He is currently in his fifth year in the automotive industry, where he is a successful finance manager.

3Services

The emergence of the Main Street area of Waldport represents a unique opportunity for a high-energy, dance-themed venue. The development’s central location, demographics, and lack of direct competition are major advantages to this project.
The proposed venue will provide a local solution to the lack of social atmosphere and live sports venues geared primarily toward the 21-35 age group in the Waldport area and will help keep late night entertainment expenditures within the localised region.
The new venue will specialise in high-energy themes, a quality video and gaming area, and will offer beer, wine and an array of liquors and mixed drinks. In addition, the venue will sell non-alcoholic beverages such as soft drinks, juices and bottled water.
A “casual” food menu consisting mostly of appetizers and small entrees ranging in cost from six to nine dollars will also be available. The initial hours of operation will be 11:00 P.M. to 2:00 A.M., four nights a week. The establishment will draw primarily from the Waldport market while attracting guests from the area’s other surrounding cities and towns.

4Market Analysis Summary

The concept and management of the Nightclub has been well received, and has been offered key placement at the centre of Waldport’s new First & Main Town Centre development. This commercial centre spans 138 acres and promises an immediate primary trade population of 332,000 people with a secondary population of 164,000 people.
The Boulevard at the Avenue average daily traffic counts are currently 53,000, and will increase to 72,000 by 2003 following the Boulevard’s connection northward to I-25 in 2001. At the centre of the complex will be a 16-screen Cinemark and IMAX theatre opening March, 2000.
The Centre’s planners having met the Nightclub’s management and have reviewed the concept. They have indicated that the Nightclub is “exactly” what they were looking for and wish to place it directly in front of the theatre. The annual projected traffic for what Cinemark is calling their ‘flagship’ location is 1.4 million people, which exceeds their current Tinseltown location at the arena.
The Nightclub will be a 10,000 square foot unit, which will also house the company’s corporate business office. The dance club and bar will accommodate 750 people. With Waldport’s rapidly growing population, the variety of the Nightclub from across the country would create mass appeal for all of the Nightclub’s customers. The store will be equipped with state-of-the-art audio and video systems like none other found in Your City.
It will serve the need for a true nightclub in Waldport. The general appearance will be clean, open, and pleasing to the customer. The demographics are favourable, with minimal competition from other dance-themed venues and bars.
Related: How To Create A Marketing Strategy
4.1 Market Segmentation
We see The Nightclub as appealing to three major market segments. Fortunately, the long, late night hours of operation help The Nightclub lend itself to multiple segment appeal. Our market segmentation scheme allows some room for estimates and nonspecific definitions.
Childless Young Professionals – Due to our proximity to the IMAX and Cinemark theatres, we must appeal to single adults and young couples. Whether it is a group of friends or a couple out to see a movie together, these people need a place to eat/drink either before and/or after their movie.
These customers will range in age from 27 to 40. The Nightclub will appeal to this category by switching the tempo and entertainment to be more appealing to adults as it gets later into the evening. We also anticipate a 15% annual growth rate in tandem with the growth rate of Waldport and through increased popularity.
College Students – By creating an environment that is appealing to college students, we secure a natural progression between the high school student and the young professional. Through word of mouth, the Nightclub expects realise an increase of five percent annually from this segment.
Tourists and Business Travelers – More and more business and travelers and tourists are finding themselves in Waldport every year as is made evident by the increased demand and subsequent expansion of the local airport. We plan to reach these people through direct marketing to local hotel patrons. We anticipate a 20% annual growth rate in this segment. As our relationships grow with the local hotels, so too will the word of mouth recommendations from the hotel staff as well as the patronizing of our restaurant by their families. Our future plan is to publish a simple website in order to create awareness to any traveler who wants to take an advanced look at the club before their visit.
4.2 Target Market Segment Strategy
Our strategy is based on serving our niche markets exceptionally well. The nightclub enthusiast, the tourist and business traveler, the local nightclub crowd, the local service industry as well as groups going out together, can all enjoy The Nightclub experience.
The marketing strategy is essential to the main strategy:
Emphasise exceptional service.
Create awareness of The Nightclub’s unique features.
Focus on our target markets.
We must charge appropriately for the high-end, high-quality service and food that we offer. Our revenue structure has to match our cost structure, so the wages we pay and the training we provide to assure superior quality and service must be balanced by the fees we charge.
Part of the superior experience we offer is the simplicity o the menu items. While being unique, they are relatively inexpensive and easy to prepare. While a premium is appropriate for the experience, the pricing has to be balanced in accordance with what we are serving.
All menu items will be moderately priced. We expect an average guest expenditure of $12.50 for beverages and $7.50 for the percentage of our guests who choose to take advantage of our food menu. Our target customer spends more than the industry average for moderately priced establishments. This is due to our creating an atmosphere that encourages longer stays and more spending, while still allowing adequate table turns due to extended hours of appeal.
4.3 Service Business Analysis
High energy and dance themed venues have significantly impacted cities from coast to coast in the nineties. Los Angeles’ Hollywood, New York’s Times Square, and Seattle’s Pioneer Square are just a few examples. Entrancing their audiences with high-powered lights, sound, music, and interactive entertainment, these venues are still one of the highest cash flow businesses in the world.
Our localised studies have shown that the average person will spend three to four hours per weekend in this type of an environment and will spend an average of twenty to fifty dollars in that time frame. As we approach the new millennium, this trend shows no signs of declining.
The typical venue of our style is open from 8:00 P.M. to 2:00 A.M., and within this time frame, the venue can achieve gross revenues anywhere from $3,500 to $25,000, nightly. The primary sources of revenue in a venue of this type are high volume traffic, coupled with comparably nominal spending. In addition to alcohol revenues, we will also generate substantial revenues from food sales that can typically range from seven to ten dollars per person, and admission fees that range between five and ten dollars per admit.
Entertainment venues in the late 1980’s and 1990’s focused on high-energy light and sound, multiple source video screens, and participative events. This relatively simple concept is still quite popular today. However, these concepts have greatly evolved with society. In recent years this industry has become more sophisticated with the availability of new technology. Larger metropolitan areas have taken this technology to new heights with sound, lighting, video and interactive designs that create an exciting and memorable experience. Fortunately, no one in Your State area has been a pioneer in this specific segment of the industry as of the date of this report.
Additionally, the nightclub and bar industry is shifting towards a more entertainment-oriented concept. Guests of these venues are not only offered a dynamic place to gather and mingle, but also a place to participate in the entertainment through interactive contests, theme nights, and other events. We intend to heavily utilise entertainment-oriented marketing in an effort to withstand the perpetual shift in trends and cater to as large a client base as possible.
Nightclubs and other drinking establishments rely heavily on their primary suppliers. The primary suppliers are the various beverage distributors that provide the establishment with both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. The alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, and liquor) are the primary sources of income in this industry. Other beverage suppliers also play a crucial role by providing non-alcoholic beverages. These are either served alone or mixed with alcohol.
In the area, all major brands of alcoholic beverages are available, in addition to several regional brands of beer. Initial research shows that the major distributors in the market have a high rating in both product availability and delivery.
4.3.1 Main Competitors
The Nightclub competition lies mainly with other casual facilities and less with conventional and chain entertainment establishments. We need to effectively compete with the widely held idea that you can’t get good service anymore, while maintaining the idea that being out can be a lot of fun. Our polling has indicated that consumers think of atmosphere, price, and quality respectively. Additionally, price was frequently mentioned by pointing out that if the former concerns are present then they are willing to pay more for the experience.
Our review of the market concludes that there are four entertainment venues that can be considered direct competition to the proposed new venue. We do realise that the proposed venue will also compete indirectly for every entertainment dollar spent in the Waldport area.

4.3.2 Business Participants
The Nightclub will be part of the restaurant and bar industry, which includes several kinds of businesses:
Locally Operated Bars and Nightclubs – This genre usually appeals to the local neighbourhood clientele. This same client base dictates that the average price structure be drastically scaled down in order to create “regulars.”
Nightclub Entertainment Complexes – This type of complex represents the concept we will most closely compete with. They are typically placed in high traffic locations and are normally treated as destination entertainment. An admission charge is usually in place and the associated price structure is also most like our proposed structure. Thankfully there is not an abundance if this type of entertainment within our region.
Conventional Dining – Primarily owned by large national chains, usually less than 10,000 square feet, focused on serving good quality food in a reasonable amount of time in a dining room setting. The service and food quality are superior to that of a fast food establishment. People go there to eat and leave when they’re done eating since there’s rarely a reason to stay.
Formal Dining – Similar to conventional dining yet offering a higher quality of food and service for the added expense. As with the conventional dining facilities, there is little interaction and when people are done eating, they leave.
Casual Dining – Commonly building upon conventional dining with the addition of a bar, playing of music and sporting events on numerous televisions. Some establishments offer their own brand of beer made on the premises. The food quality and service are at best, similar to that found in a conventional dining experience.
Chain Entertainment – Typically manifested in each market through the Hard Rock Cafes, the Planet Hollywoods, etc. We expect to create an atmosphere that thrives on its trendy feel. These chain entertainment venues can not hope to draw the same “hip” clientele.
