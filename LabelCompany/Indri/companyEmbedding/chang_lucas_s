Jeff Humpert uses  Lucas Fuel Treatment in 1998 GMC Jimmy 4X4



I bought some of the Lucas fuel treatment after using the Transmission Fix and having good results. My Jimmy had been losing fuel economy and my onboard computer showed I was averaging less than 17.5 MPG and the fuel gauge was also showing that. I ran 2 bottles in back to back tank fulls and at first I didnt think it was working then amazingly one day I noticed the fuel gauge was staying fuller so I checked the computer and it was showing that I went from 17.3 MPG to starting to show aroound 17.8 and continues to climb. When I last checked it this morning I am now showing I am averaging 19.8 MPG and the fuel gauge is definetely showing the increased fuel economy. I have never gotten more then 18.5 MPG and I have had the Jimmy for 2 years now. Lucas Products are the best products I have used and I am sold and will continue to purchase your products anytime I need something that you have a product available for the application I am needing.
