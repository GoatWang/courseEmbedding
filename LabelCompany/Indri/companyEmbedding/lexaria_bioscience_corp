Active lifestyles make higher-level demands for nutrition and performance, and Lexaria Energy hemp oil-infused products help fill that need.






We are a food sciences company focused on the delivery of hemp oil ingredients through gourmet foods based upon our proprietary technologies. 






Tea is Healthy
“THE MANY BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS IN TEA APPEAR TO IMPACT VIRTUALLY EVERY CELL IN THE BODY TO HELP IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES.”
(JEFFREY BLUMBERG, PHD, Professor of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts
University)










welcome to
Lexaria

Lexaria Bioscience Corp. is a food biosciences company with a proprietary technology for improved delivery of bioactive compounds. The Company’s lipophilic enhancement technology has been shown to enhance the bioavailability of orally ingested cannabinoids, while also masking taste. Cannabinoids are poorly absorbed by the body’s gastrointestinal tract and consumers often default to alternate routes of administration like smoking to achieve higher effectiveness. 




Food Products
Lexaria has two distinct consumer product brands: ViPovaTM and Lexaria Energy.

Both brands use patent pending technology to infuse hemp oil ingredients within lipids in popular foods. Other companies selling hemp oil drops or products....




Investors
Lexaria has been graced with the best shareholders on the planet! Our transition to become a leading Food Sciences company was made with you in mind: find out more of our public company information here.




Education
Lexaria delivers hemp oil ingredients through a patent pending process within gourmet food products. Our best customers are well-informed about healthy eating choices and what hemp oil is. Let us help you in your quest for knowledge.




Who We Are
Lexaria Corp. was founded by determined people who have always worked hard to build value both for shareholders and for customers. We have grown to become a revenue-generating biosciences company focused....










Intellectual Property
We live in an age where technology touches our lives constantly. When it works well we don't notice the tech - we only notice the benefits. Most of us have forgotten that anti-lock brakes on our cars used to be "hi-tech". Or that "wireless internet"was once considered almost a miracle.
We know that delivering balanced nutrition in a single package to the human body can be challenging. Lexaria has already taken a giant first step in a process we believe makes us unique in the entire marketplace.
We actually have a patent-pending method by which we infuse the healthy cocktail of molecules in our organically sourced hemp oil INSIDE the molecules of other ingredients. We work with lipids because the human endocannabinoid system is itself lipid based. We believe this is a more efficient way of delivering hemp oil ingredients to your body. Said another way, a little hemp seed oil within one of our products might be similar to a LOT of hemp oil ingested without our proprietary technology!

In The Lab
From June 2015 to August 2015, Lexaria commissioned an independent, third party laboratory to test our technology under carefully monitored in vitro conditions. Specifically, we wanted to gain scientific evidence of two hypothesis. As it turned out, we learned that and more.

First, does our technological process yield an improvement in intestinal absorption? The answer was YES. Second, does our lipid formulation yield an improvement in intestinal absorption? The answer was also YES. In addition, we also learned that our processed, lipid infused tea was absorbed at higher levels in the presence of “gastric juices” than in a more sterile environment without any “gastric juices”, suggesting though certainly not proving that our technology and formulation may be more effective in an actual gastrointestinal system than in an in vitro simulation.

Lexaria has two distinct consumer product brands: ViPovaTM and Lexaria Energy. Both brands use patented technology to infuse hemp oil ingredients within lipids in popular foods. Other companies selling hemp Seed oil products and hemp seed oil drops usually just mix hemp oil with other ingredients and sell you the resulting product. That is NOT what we do!
We actually have a patented method by which we infuse our organically sourced high purity hemp oil INSIDE the molecules of other ingredients. We work with lipids because the human endocannabinoid system is itself lipid based. We believe this is a more efficient way of delivering hemp oil to your body and that a little hemp seed oil within one of our products might be similar to a LOT of hemp oil ingested without our proprietary technology.
 
VIPOVATM
We introduced ViPovaTM black tea infused with hemp oil in January, 2015. This is a delicious Chinese black tea from the province of Yunnan, and is hemp oil-infused within dried evaporated non-fat milk. We delivered several flavors and varieties, including herbal decaf versions, and sell VipovaTM teas in convenient consumer package sizes just like you would find in the grocery store. ViPovaTM tea is available for sale today at www.vipova.com and ships nationwide.
We envision ViPovaTM to be more than just tea, however. Our vision is that ViPovaTM will represent the true “coffee-house” experience: various types of coffees, teas, and related goods. So, in 2016 we launched VipovaTM coffee and also hot chocolate: and for those who are used to “unusual” tasting hemp oil cannabinoid products, we challenge you to detect it after our patented technology has been applied.

Lexaria Energy is working to deliver a line of food products that are nutritious, responsibly produced, often gluten-free, and always infused with hemp oil so that YOU don’t have to compromise between convenience and healthy eating.
Everything we do has common elements: products and ideas that bring you comfort. We use patented technology but we also work with Mother Nature. Brought together, our goal is to help you achieve HARMONY in your very special life.

				In The Lab                
			
		

From June 2015 to August 2015, Lexaria commissioned an independent, third party laboratory to test our technology under carefully monitored in vitro conditions. Specifically, we wanted to gain scientific evidence of two hypothesis. As it turned out, we learned that and more.
First, does our technological process yield an improvement in intestinal absorption? The answer was YES. Second, does our lipid formulation yield an improvement in intestinal absorption? The answer was also YES. In addition, we also learned that our processed, lipid infused tea was absorbed at higher levels in the presence of “gastric juices” than in a more sterile environment without any “gastric juices”, suggesting though certainly not proving that our technology and formulation may be more effective in an actual gastrointestinal system than in an in vitro simulation.
Below, we explore why bioavailability is such an important consideration, and how it affects more than you might at first imagine. There are a number of important considerations to contemplate before making changes to your diet or consumption habits but one vital fact outweighs all the others: the vast majority of the cannabidiol (CBD) or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) that is consumed – via ANY method – ends up in your toilet.
Explore how cannabinoids are ingested and absorbed; different delivery mechanisms; recent technological advances in bio absorption; and, how those advances offer users an alternative to smoking.
We need to understand what bioavailability is and how it differs from absorption. They are related and similar – but different: absorption is just one component of bioavailability. To truly understand bioavailability we have to speak briefly about how the human body digests food. The object of digestion is to transform large food particles into smaller molecules, which can more easily be absorbed into your water-soluble blood plasma. That is how you get nutrients and energy.
Very little digestion actually occurs in your stomach which is designed, in part, to kill pathogens and foreign substances that should not be ingested. In fact, roughly 95% of all digestion happens in your small intestine. Digestive enzymes intermingle with your food during the roughly 2 hour journey to arrive at your small intestine, breaking down the food and preparing it for absorption. Unfortunately hydrochloric acid in your stomach is also quite capable of destroying many nutritious, fragile molecules before they can ever be absorbed.
There are dozens of different cannabinoid molecules, and most of them share similar molecular characteristics. In general, cannabinoids do not tolerate acidic environments. Studies have shown poor recoveries or even 0% recoveries of cannabinoids in acidic environments. (Detection And Quantification Of 17 Synthetic Cannabinoids And One Metabolite (JWH-018- COOH) In Blood And Urine, J Sobhani Sefy.)
The mouth and throat are a roughly neutral environment, with a pH of roughly 6.8. Stomach pH can be anywhere in the 1.0 – 3.0 range which is highly acidic. In contrast, the small intestine has a highly alkaline environment conducive to molecular absorption, about 8.5. Normal water is neutral or slightly alkaline and has a pH of 6.2 – 7.0. For scale, a pH of 8.0 is ten times more alkaline than a pH of 7.0; and a pH of 3.0 is 10,000 times more acidic than a pH of 7.0.
For these and other reasons, digestion/absorption/bioavailability of cannabinoids in their unprocessed form, is very low. The molecules typically do not survive their passage through the stomach undamaged and are not free to be absorbed in the alkaline environment of the small intestine.
Finally, your liver has a major role to play in that it regulates what molecules are allowed to reach your general circulation after ingestion, absorption through your small intestine, and finally passage through the liver’s filtration systems. It often wraps up what it identifies as dangerous molecules in water-soluble chemicals that are identified for ejection through urine.
The topic of cannabinoid absorption is well understood and has been repeatedly studied. Bioavailability of CBD (or of THC) varies greatly by delivery method. Smoking typically delivers cannabinoids at an average bioavailability rate of 30% (Huestis (2007) Chem. Biodivers. 4:1770–1804; McGilveray (2005) Pain Res. Manag. 10 Suppl. A:15A – 22A).  Cannabinoids that are absorbed through the mucous membranes in the mouth (buccomucosal application) have bioavailabilities of around 13% (Karschner et al. (2011)  Clin. Chem. 57:66–75). By comparison, orally consumed cannabis edibles typically deliver cannabinoids at an average bioavailability rate of only 5% (Karschner et al. (2011) Clin. Chem. 57:66–75).
Bioavailability from both vaping and sublingual drops fall inside the range established at the high and low ends, by smoking and edible ingestion respectively. Absorption of cannabinoids through smoking (burning is an oxidizing process) is relatively high because the molecules are not required to pass through the hostile stomach environment, and instead are absorbed into the bloodstream through the lungs. Although smoking is a relatively efficient and quick acting process, it is also a well-known health hazard. Of the one billion people around the world who smoke, roughly six million people die each year from diseases caused directly by smoking. More on that later.
This is a good place to summarize what we know so far:

In order to improve absorption levels via edible ingestion, the cannabinoid molecule has to be protected for at least two hours while it passes through the acidic stomach environment.
Final bioabsorption rates are comprised of several operations, including survival of a given molecule through the GI system; absorption through the walls of the small intestine; a selective filtering process by the liver; and even more processes are required to put that molecule to useful work within your body.
Because of the above, historically, smoking has been the most effective way to absorb cannabinoids into the body. Roughly 30% of cannabinoids are absorbed via smoking, compared to only a 5% rate via edible ingestion.
Smoking is a serious health hazard, and many non-users find it objectionable.

The goals of higher bioavailability of cannabinoids are thus threefold: to mollify objections to its smoking from non-cannabis users ; to reduce unhealthy hazards of smoking; and to more consistently deliver a higher proportion of useful molecules comprised from lower overall dosages that place less of a load on the liver. The challenges associated with efficient delivery of cannabinoids and the benefits to be experienced both by consumers and society through overcoming those challenges are now well understood.
Lexaria has focused on discovering new technologies that can more efficiently deliver cannabinoids to the bloodstream where they can have their desired effect. Our pointedly focused research is devoted to understanding of the human endocannabinoid system and how it can function at a higher level through the efficient and healthy ingestion of cannabinoids. To this end, our recent in vitro lab experiments have greatly expanded our understanding of the most efficient ways to deliver cannabinoids through ingestion.
In order to succeed in delivering a higher percentage of ingested cannabinoids into the human bloodstream, we first need to figure out how to protect the cannabinoid molecule on its journey through the gastrointestinal system.
It is well known that ingesting fats (the terms “fats” and “lipids” can often, though not always, be used synonymously) while simultaneously ingesting other focused-upon substances can often lead to higher absorption levels of those key substances.“The US FDA recommended high fat meals for food-effect studies because such fatty meals (800–1000 cal, 50%–65% fat, 25%–30% carbohydrates and 15%–20% proteins) affect GI physiology and maximize drug transfer into the systemic circulation.” (Food and Drug Administration, Guidance for industry: food-effect bioavailability and fed bioequivalence studies, food and drug administration. www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/5194fnl.htm).
The reasons for this increased absorption have, in part, been previously discussed. Fats are emulsified by gallbladder secretions, breaking it down into more easily absorbed particles in the small intestine. And some types of fats take a different path into the human bloodstream than most other nutrients: they bypass the portal vein that otherwise goes straight from the intestine to the liver for filtering before nutrients are generally allowed to reach the majority of the body. Instead, the body re-assembles certain fats and shuttles them to the lymphatic and circulatory systems where they enter the general bloodstream without passage through the liver. Many fats bypass the portal vein “freeway” to the liver, whereas smaller fatty acids that are more water soluble do indeed go to the liver first.
As well, in order to prepare cannabinoids for higher bioavailability, the cannabinoid molecules can be manipulated in certain ways to connect them at a molecular level with various foods. Lexaria’s technology “shuttles” the cannabinoid molecules “within” other food molecules, even unrelated to lipids. Foods that we select have certain characteristics that work synergistically with cannabinoids, such as black tea. Then lipids such as sunflower oil and milk powder and others can be added due to their well known properties within the human GI system.
In the summer of 2015, the US laboratory we commissioned performed some of the first tests ever known to be conducted, on cannabidiol absorption into human intestinal cells. The results were astonishing. Utilizing a mixture of hemp oil, black tea and select lipids, and processed with a patented technological method, resulted in intestinal tissue CBD permeability 325% higher than CBD mixed with black tea and water. And when that same mixture of hemp oil, black tea and select lipids, and processed with the patented technological method is compared to the absorption of CBD and water alone, the absorption levels into the human intestinal cells rose to a 499% improvement.
This sort of vital scientific research adds to our cumulative understanding that cannabinoids can indeed be ingested with bioabsorption levels that approach or perhaps even surpass those achieved from smoking. However much remains to be learned. For example we do not know what ratio of cannabinoids might be delivered to the liver for filtration via the portal vein as compared to delivery straight to the lymphatic and circulatory systems for higher bioavailability. And, additional laboratory testing with different individual lipids will have to be undertaken to determine which might perform best.
Live animal tests, or even human testing, may be required to learn more about how the newest forms of technology are able to manipulate cannabinoid molecules along with certain food molecules to deliver such dramatic changes in absorption. Once the processes are more thoroughly researched we will begin to have a more complete understanding of the most efficient ways to deliver cannabinoids to humans.
Since all cannabinoid molecules are so closely related, it is reasonable to believe that the processes that work for higher bioavailability rates in CBD will also work for THC and other cannabinoid molecules. One potential outcome is that in pursuing more efficient delivery methods for any of these molecules, it may be possible to lower overall dosages for all of them.
The benefits are obvious: a person requiring 10mg of a substance in order to achieve a desired outcome would have to consume 200mg of that substance, if the bioavailability is only 5%. But raise the bioavailability rate to say, 30%, and consumption drops to just 33mg. This is a massive reduction in intake with a lower risk of over-dosage, and leads to a potentially lighter workload on the liver accompanied by certain reductions in waste and consumer cost.
Until recently, smoking was the most effective way to ingest cannabinoids, provided one was willing to overlook the unhealthy side effects and the social stigma. This creates a deadly paradox: “some cannabinoids are good for me, but smoking is not”.
Smoking is an increasingly unacceptable activity in large segments of society. The death and misery toll from disease caused by smoking is unarguable. There is a large segment of society which reasonably argues that the act of smoking marijuana impacts non-smokers. The moment a smoker impacts a non-smoker, either through odor or second hand smoke, smoking is no longer a personal decision, even though it may deliver beneficial molecules such as cannabidiol.
Now, because our understanding of bioavailability has increased, and the new and exciting advances in technology, it is possible to deliver comparable bioavailability as smoking, but without the negative side effects. It is actually possible that one day, using disruptive, absorption enhancing technologies, foods will be reasonably able to replace smoking as the most effective delivery mechanism for cannabinoids.
A word of caution: lab testing is not the same as human clinical trials or even animal testing. Unexpected things can happen as simplified in vitro tests are expanded into the complexity of living beings – meaning it is possible that the positive results achieved in vitro will not be reproduced in animals or humans. It is just too early to know that for sure.
Bioavailability matters… a lot. Improved bioavailability can lead to reduced social pressures associated with what are currently more common delivery methods such as smoking or vaping. Reducing smoking can lead to fewer societal objections for both cigarette and cannabis smoking. Positive community health outcomes are likely to be associated with lowered rates of smoking. And, higher bioavailability could be associated with lower overall dosages of certain molecules which can itself be associated with reduced stress on the liver and other organs, as well as financial cost savings for consumers.

Hemp CBD Products, Hemp Tea Benefits and You.
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a molecule found in plant species such as agricultural (or industrial) hemp, echinacea, cannabis sativa, kale, and other plants. CBD is one of over 450 distinct compounds within hemp: it is clear that cannabis and CBD are two entirely different things. Cannabidiol is a phytocannabinoid (plant based), it is not psychoactive and has anti-psychotic effects.
Due to decades of old laws throughout most of the western world banning the cultivation or use of marijuana, clinical research into CBD and the human endocannabinoid regulatory system is not as advanced as might be expected. In fact, it might not be wrong to say that the endocannabinoid system has a leading role in one of the last great mysteries of how the human body works.
Michelle Reillo, Ph. D and co-founder of ViPovaTM has written that, “The human endocannabinoid system is responsible for memory networks in the brain, both excitatory and inhibitory, including the neurogenesis of hippocampal granule cells, which regulate the timing of the endocannabinoids in accordance with the brain’s needs, pain perception, mood, synaptic plasticity, motor learning, appetite and taste regulation, and metabolic function, which regulates the storage of energy and transport of cellular nutrition. CB1 receptors are located in the central and peripheral nervous systems as well as the lungs, kidneys, and liver. CB2 receptors are predominantly expressed in the immune system and hematopoietic cells.”

There is a vast amount of research required to unlock the knowledge of precisely how CBD interacts with the endocannabinoid system; and how these influence or affect human health. But already, early indications are astonishing to many observers. Documented research has implicated the endocannabinoid system and/or cannabidiol to each of the following conditions:


Alzheimer’s disease and dementia
Anxiety and Depression
Appetite
Asthma
Cancer
Cardiovascular function
Digestion
Epilespsy
Fibromyalgia
Glaucoma
Headache and migraine
Huntington’s disease
Immune function
Inflammation
Irritable bowel disease
Liver disease
Memory




Metabolism and energy homeostasis
Multiple Sclerosis
Nausea and vomiting
Neural development
Neuropathic pain or chronic pain
Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis
Osteoporosis
Post-traumatic stress disorder
Parkinson’s disease
Psychiatric disease
Psychomotor behavior
Schizophrenia and psychosis
Spinal cord injury and disease
Stress and emotional state regulation
Tourette’s Syndrome
Wake/sleep cycles
Wasting syndrome in AIDS and cancer patients


The list is so comprehensive it is staggering. No claim has been made and no claim is being made that CBD “cures” any of these conditions or diseases. However, thousands of researches, usually working independently of each other, have discovered links or associations of some kind, between CBD or the endocannabinoid system, and each of these diseases or conditions.
It seems clear that, with links or effects to such a widely varied group of conditions, the endocannabinoid system plays a central role in human health, even if that role is currently poorly understood.
Perversely, much of the research to date has been conducted on cannabis the plant, not necessarily with regard to which of the +450 compounds within the cannabis might be responsible for noted outcomes. The majority of such studies temper potential beneficial outcomes with remarks of the negative psychotropic effects that are often associated with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).
It is always important to remember that THC, cannabis, and CBD are distinctly different things. As well, the interrelationships between the hundreds of various molecules that together make up the cannabis plant are poorly understood and require much more research before science understands them more clearly.
Much of the research conducted to date has been with animals or is laboratory research and is not based on human clinical studies. Pre-clinical animal studies may have predictive value but may not translate accurately from an animal species to humans. In humans, there is also always the possibility of placebo effect, though that is not likely possible in animal studies.
Lexaria’s patented technology formulates its products to infuse CBD within lipids in order to provide a potentially more comforting and bioavailable delivery to the human digestive system. It will take the collective work and research of thousands of highly trained professionals to determine whether there are actually any health benefits associated with ingesting CBD, and if so, how best to optimize CBD delivery. We do not know the answers today.

July 20, 2017



Lexaria Bioscience Corp. (CSE: LXX) (OTCQB: LXRP) this morning announced the start of laboratory work under its collaborative research project with the National Research Council of Canada (“NRC”). “We are delighted to have commenced formulation development and characterization work together with the NRC,” John Docherty, president of Lexaria Bioscience, stated in the news release. “The NRC team has extensive knowledge and experience in the field of lipid based delivery systems relating to pharmaceutical products, natural health products and functional foods. This collaboration will significantly assist Lexaria in further developing and characterizing its IP portfolio.” Moving forward, several studies will be initiated in an effort to optimize Lexaria’s patented technology enabling delivery of lipophilic active agents within foods, beverages, capsules and other ingestible formats. Per this morning’s update, practical applications of this work could include further broadening or strengthening of Lexaria’s intellectual property portfolio and may also provide the foundation for new commercial arrangements.

QualityStocksNewsBreaks – Lexaria Bioscience Corp. (CSE: LXX) (OTCQB: LXRP) Commences Lab Work with National Research Council of Canada
July 20, 2017



Lexaria Bioscience Corp. (CSE: LXX) (OTCQB: LXRP) this morning announced the start of laboratory work under its collaborative research project with the National Research Council of Canada (“NRC”). “We are delighted to have commenced formulation development and characterization work together with the NRC,” John Docherty, president of Lexaria Bioscience, stated in the news release. “The NRC team has extensive knowledge and experience in the field of lipid based delivery systems relating to pharmaceutical products, natural health products and functional foods. This collaboration will significantly assist Lexaria in further developing and characterizing its IP portfolio.” Moving forward, several studies will be initiated in an effort to optimize Lexaria’s patented technology enabling delivery of lipophilic active agents within foods, beverages, capsules and other ingestible formats. Per this morning’s update, practical applications of this work could include further broadening or strengthening of Lexaria’s intellectual property portfolio and may also provide the foundation for new commercial arrangements.

Lexaria Bioscience Awarded Australian Patent For Cannabinoid Infused Edibles


KELOWNA, BC--(Marketwired - July 18, 2017) -  Lexaria Bioscience Corp. (OTCQB: LXRP) (CSE: LXX) (the "Company" or "Lexaria") is pleased to announce that the Australian Patent Office has granted patent #2015274698 which protects Lexaria's method of improving absorption, speed of onset, and taste of cannabinoid active agents in edible products. The term of the patent is 20 years from June 10, 2015.The issuance of this patent guards Lexaria's intellectual property for the edible delivery of all non-psychoactive cannabinoids, including those that are incidental but contributory to cannabis oils used in psychoactive cannabinoid edibles. A wide variety of foods and beverage formats are covered, including but not limited to: tea, coffee, cocoa powder, fresh foods and meats, dairy products, pastas, breads, seeds, nuts, spices, herbs, candies, flavourings and more.One of Lexaria's core strategies is to develop and solidify key IP applicable to different economic sectors within specific market jurisdictions domestically and abroad, as a pre-requisite to developing revenue-producing business operations linked thereto."We are very pleased to have received this patent which effectively covers all cannabis oil extract formulated edibles utilizing our technology in Australia," states Lexaria CEO Chris Bunka. "This patent award allows us to confidently enter the recently legalized Australian cannabis marketplace where we will seek additional licensing and product distribution partnering opportunities."A patent granting the same set of claims was granted in the USA in October, 2016. Lexaria expects additional progress on its extensive patent portfolio through the balance of 2017 and in 2018.Separately, the Company announces it has received US$6,250.75 from the exercise of 27,500 stock options previously granted with an exercise price of US$0.2273. These options were exercised by a third party who is neither an officer nor director of the Company.No commissions or placement fees have been paid related to the funds received from this option exercise. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The securities referred to herein will not be or have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.About LexariaLexaria Bioscience Corp. has developed and out-licenses its disruptive technology that promotes healthier ingestion methods, lower overall dosing and higher effectiveness of lipophilic active molecules. Lexaria has multiple patents pending in over 40 countries around the world and was granted its first patents in the USA and in Australia related to edible forms of cannabinoids. Lexaria's technology provides increases in intestinal absorption rates; more rapid delivery to the bloodstream; and important taste-masking benefits, for orally administered bioactive molecules including cannabinoids, vitamins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), nicotine and other molecules.www.lexariabioscience.comFor regular updates, connect with Lexaria on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Lexaria-Corp-106280556370600/) and Twitter (https://twitter.com/lexariacorp)FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis release includes forward-looking statements.

	Dear Vitacost.com Customer:
We regret to inform you that Burt’s Bees, which is owned by parent company Clorox, has decided to stop selling their products through Vitacost.com. Neither Clorox nor Burt’s Bees offered an explanation for this change, other than saying that selling through our website is not “consistent” with their current strategy.
	We find it unfortunate that you will no longer be able to benefit from the convenience of online delivery of this product, as well as Vitacost.com’s competitive pricing.

	Dear Vitacost.com Customer:
We regret to inform you that Burt’s Bees, which is owned by parent company Clorox, has decided to stop selling their products through Vitacost.com. Neither Clorox nor Burt’s Bees offered an explanation for this change, other than saying that selling through our website is not “consistent” with their current strategy.
	We find it unfortunate that you will no longer be able to benefit from the convenience of online delivery of this product, as well as Vitacost.com’s competitive pricing.
