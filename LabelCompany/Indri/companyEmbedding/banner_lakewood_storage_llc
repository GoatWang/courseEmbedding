    What Businesses Are Saying

                    






        "CubeSmart has made my business more efficient by reducing my rental costs from using warehouses. Also, I can depend on deliveries being made without 
        fail. Since I work alone and cannot be available on site all the time, this is a big advantage. I have rented a unit for seven years here, and 
        am very satisfied with the property."
    

Doug K., Owner, Strongsville, OH

Banner Storage Group LLC, a subsidiary of Banner Apartments LLC, which buys, builds, finances and sells self-storage properties, received unanimous approval from the Lakewood Planning Commission to develop a mixed-use property that will include self-storage in Lakewood, Colo. The project at 9300 W. Colfax Ave. will feature 103,000 square feet of climate-controlled space on a 2-acre site. It will also include 10,000 square feet of retail space with the potential for a drive-through window. The $10.5 million project is expected to open in the fall of 2016, according to a company press release. 





 








Banner is currently developing several self-storage projects, including a seven-story facility in downtown Miami and a 70,384-square-foot property in the city’s Little Haiti neighborhood. The company also has a development proposal under review in Mount Greenwood, Ill. 
Banner Storage Group was formed in July 2013 to diversify Banner Apartments’ real estate holdings. The subsidiary is led by Gary Delaney, president, and John Nikolich, executive vice president, who have more than 35 years of combined experience in the acquisition, development, disposition and financing of self-storage properties, portfolios and operating companies.

Banner Storage Group was formed in 2013 to diversify the company’s real estate holdings outside of Banner’s multifamily focus.
While Banner studied a number of real estate asset classes to invest in, it was attracted to self-storage by the compelling industry fundamentals, coupled with the synergies between multifamily and self-storage properties. 








Storage Development Strategy

Develop institutional-grade, urban-infill, climate controlled properties in premier locations nationwide
Partner with established, best-in-class national management platforms to maximize leasing, operational and economic performance
Target locations with high population density, as well as good visibility and high traffic counts, where competitive supply will remain less than the submarket's equilibrium
Leverage in-house expertise to smoothly navigate the zoning, approval and design processes and ensure projects are completed as scheduled and budgeted
Maximize long-term value creation, while opportunistically accessing the sale market to enhance Banner’s pipeline and development relationships

Banner Storage Group Buys Self-Storage Development Site in Chicago

Self-Storage developer Banner Storage Group LLC has purchased a 22,224-square-foot development site at 1807 W. Devon Ave. in the Edgewater neighborhood of Chicago. The company plans to build a six-story, 118,000-square-foot self-storage facility on the property. 





 








The facility will comprise more than 1,200 climate-controlled units ranging from stacked 4-by-4-foot lockers to 10-by-30-foot spaces. The company also plans to include an interior loading area for customers, video monitoring, motion sensors, free WiFi, a customer center and retail office.
The facility will be designed by architecture firm Loebl, Schlossman & Hackl. It is scheduled to break ground in July and expected to open next spring, company officials said in a press release.
The Edgewater property is the second storage property purchased by Banner since the company was created last year. In April, the company purchased the 106,000-square-foot, seven-story Bain Moving & Storage building in Lynn, Mass. Built in 1906 and expanded in 1912, the building was advertised in a 1924 newspaper article as the first “fireproof warehouse for the storage of household goods and general merchandise” in the United States. A portion of the original terra-cotta-walled, individual storage units with steel, fireproof doors will be retained and renovated to maintain the structure’s historical significance, Banner officials said.
The remainder of the Bain building will be fully renovated with the addition of climate-controlled, steel-partitioned storage units, roll-up doors, sprinklers, an interior loading area, and security features. Construction is expected to be completed this fall, with a grand opening scheduled for November.
“Both of these developments represent Banner’s commitment to locate and develop a premium self-storage product in dense, urban in-fill areas of growing major metropolitan markets for today’s sophisticated self-storage customer,” said Gary Delaney, president. “These are the first two of 10 planned developments this year, and we look forward to successfully completing these developments, experiencing strong lease-up given the compelling supply/demand fundamentals of each project, producing strong investment returns and continuing to expand our self-storage platform.” 
Formed in July 2013, Banner Storage Group is a subsidiary of Banner Apartments LLC, a real estate investment management business. The self-storage group is led by Delaney and John Nikolich, executive vice president. Both are industry veterans with more than 35 years of combined experience in the development, acquisition, disposition and financing of self-storage properties and real estate operating companies.

    What Businesses Are Saying

                    






        "CubeSmart has made my business more efficient by reducing my rental costs from using warehouses. Also, I can depend on deliveries being made without 
        fail. Since I work alone and cannot be available on site all the time, this is a big advantage. I have rented a unit for seven years here, and 
        am very satisfied with the property."
    

Doug K., Owner, Strongsville, OH
