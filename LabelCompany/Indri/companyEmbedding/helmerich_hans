Leaving On A High Note: 10 O&G Execs Who Departed Just Before The Downturn





1 of 10







            Hans Helmerich: Helmerich & Payne
        











Since June, oil prices are down more than 50%.  The industry has gone from some of its best years (a period marked by high and stable oil prices) to one of its most uncertain years ever.  Managing companies over the past few years hasn't been easy - booms have their own set of challenges.  But managing companies in this new environment is gut wrenching and incredibly challenging.  Most executive decisions in this market have to do with downsizing, and these tough choices will be second guessed by employees, analysts and observers. 
In the following slides, you'll meet 10 O&G executives who walked away at the top, before the market turned down.  To be clear, while these execs exited as the market reached its peak, their departures weren't a function of fleeing the downturn - no one saw this one coming.  Most of these departures were planned years in advance, and came after many years of service.  In some cases, these executives are still involved with the companies they led or other companies in the industry.  But these gentlemen sure do look wise for their timing, and it must have crossed their minds over the past few months how close they came to being in the hot seat for one of the biggest shakedowns the industry has ever seen.

In March 2014, Hans Helmerich retired as CEO of leading US land driller Helmerich & Payne after 25 years of service. He continued on as chairman of the board.  Helmerich turned the reins over to John Lindsay, marking the first time a non-family member has led the company since its founding nearly a century ago. Lindsay started working for H&P as an oil-field roughneck in 1987. He has been president since 2006. 
From a very young age, Helmerich cultivated an admiration for the company his grandfather founded. Employing the lessons he learned in his early days, Hans elevated H&P from a company with a $500mn market cap to a  $10.5Bn company that is a leader in US shale plays.
