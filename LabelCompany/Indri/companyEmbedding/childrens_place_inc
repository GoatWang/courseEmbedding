Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Children's Place, Inc. (The) (NASDAQ:PLCE) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 8 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $125.00 (21.71% upside)

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Children's Place appoints president global product

    	
        By Emily Bader,
    	May 18, 2017 at 10:57 AM



The Children’s Place Inc., a Secaucus-based children’s specialty apparel retailer, announced it has appointed Pamela B. Wallack to the newly created position of President Global Product, effective immediately.
She will be responsible for global merchandising, design, sourcing and production.
"Pam Wallack is one of the most talented childrenswear executives in the country. Her success as President of Gap Kids & Baby, coupled with her years of product development and merchandising experience at Kids R Us and Babies R Us, makes her ideally suited to lead these key product functions at The Children's Place,” Jane Elfers, CEO and president, said.
“As we look to the future, developing and implementing a best in class Personalized Customer Contact Strategy is our single biggest opportunity. Given the ongoing shift to digital commerce, our digitally savvy millennial Mom, our consistently strong operating results, and the changes in competitor dynamics, we have made the decision to significantly accelerate the development and implementation of this substantial opportunity. With Pam’s arrival, I can now devote significantly more time to delivering the financial benefits associated with our Personalized Customer Contact Strategy,” Elfers said.
"I have watched the remarkable transformation of The Children's Place over the past several years and I am excited to partner with Jane, and the best in class management team she has assembled, to continue to build upon the company's impressive track record,” Wallack said.
Wallack has held senior positions at major retailers, including David’s Bridal Inc., where she was CEO and president, and Gap Inc., where she was executive vice president of Gap Global Creative Center.

Gymboree bankruptcy raises Fitch U.S. retail loan default rate to 2.7%
Gymboree's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing lifts the Fitch U.S. retail sector 12-month loan default rate to 2.7% from 1.7%, the ratings agency said Monday. Gymboree has had a high level of indebtedness since a 2010 leveraged buyout transaction, and the children's retailer faced $1 billion in debt maturities over the next 22 months, as of March 14. Fitch expects Gymboree to emerge from bankruptcy as a smaller company after store closures, but facing competition from companies like Children's Place Inc.  and department stores. "Fitch is forecasting the [U.S. retail sector default] rate to rise to 9% by year end 2017, which would include a filing by heavily indebted Sears Holdings Corp. ($2.5 billion of term loans outstanding) that swings the rate by about 4%," the Fitch note said. "Fitch's expectation of increasing retail defaults stems from increased discounter (including off-price and fast-fashion apparel) and online penetration, along with shifts in consumer spending toward services and experiences. These factors have created a highly competitive retail environment and accelerated adverse trends in mall-based shopping." Other retailers on Fitch's list of Loans of Concern or Bonds of Concern are Claire's Stores Inc., Nine West Holdings Inc. and True Religion Apparel Inc. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF  is down nearly 7% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index  is up 8.4% for the period.

Children's Place stock surges into record territory about profit and sales beat
Shares of Children's Place Inc.  soared 11% toward record territory in premarket trade Thursday, after the children's apparel retailer reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results. The stock traded at $124 ahead of the open, above the May 10 record close of $122.55, but still below Monday's all-time intraday high of $125.30. The company said earlier that net earnings per share rose 48% from a year to $1.97, while the adjusted EPS of $1.95 was well above the FactSet consensus of $1.64. Revenue rose 4.1% to $436.7 million, above the FactSet consensus of $422.5 million, and same-store sales growth of 6.1% beat expectations of a 2.2% increase. The company said it now expects fiscal 2017 EPS of $7.10 to $7.20, which includes a 89-cent benefit from new accounting rules, compared with a previous outlook of $6.50 to $6.65, which includes a 45-cent accounting benefit. The stock has run up 10.6% year to date through Wednesday, while the SPDR S&P Retail  has lost 7.2% and the S&P 500  has gained 5.3%.
