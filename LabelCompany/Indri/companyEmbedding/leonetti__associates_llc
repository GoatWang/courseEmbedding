A Tradition
Of Putting People First
Since our founding in 1982, most of our clients have been recommended by other clients. We have been told that “people at Leonetti treat every client as though he or she was their only client.”
Michael Leonetti co-founded and served as the third president of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA). He was a pioneer in the fee-only movement, in which financial planners began serving clients for a set fee rather than earning commission payments on the products they sold.
Our company is a leader in the comprehensive financial planning field. We created the Secure Future Solution, a three-step process designed to develop comprehensive financial plans that integrate your personal and financial goals to fulfill your personal vision.
Our company provides investment management and financial planning services to individuals, families, professionals, and business owners across the country. We help them secure their financial future by matching advice and services to individual goals and circumstances.
We have grown to include 15 employees, including 4 Certified Financial Planners and 2 Paraplanners.

Leonetti & Associates LLC


                  Leonetti & Associates uses both passive and active investing strategies to create highly integrated and customized investment services, based on clients' unique investment objectives and risk tolerance. The firm invests in both U.S. and international stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded vehicles, and alternative investments, when appropriate.Leonetti & Associates builds fixed-income allocations by reviewing various economic factors such as interest rates, economic expectations, and inflation, and then chooses among various categories such as TIPS, government bonds, corporate bonds, municipals, international holdings, and high-yield investment vehicles. Individual corporate bonds are selected based on stable and proven business models, significant market capitalization, sufficient cash flow generation, and manageable debt turnover requirements. Individual municipal securities selections are based on their ability to generate cash to meet ongoing needs and ongoing budget requirements. Exchange-traded products and bond mutual funds are used to take advantage of market situations in which individual securities do not provide enough liquidity or safety to use.Leonetti & Associates builds equity allocations by choosing among various asset classes and sub-classes, including U.S. domestic equities of various capitalization size and style, international holdings, and alternative investments. The equity portion of the portfolio is constructed using a combination of fundamental and technical analysis. This approach is used to identify the state of the markets, measuring the strength of the economy and the individual holdings that will comprise the portfolio.

Wine Access Client Rave: 116 5-stars Ratings
In Paris, the sommeliers at Michelin-starred Le George V, Le Bristol, Le Pré Catelan, and Le Royal Monceau have adopted Diebolt-Vallois’ Blanc des Blancs Brut NV as their own. In New York City, this blew away the competition at Daniel, Marea, and Le Bernardin, earning a place on the list of each. The Diebolt-Vallois Blanc de Blancs NV, drawn from Grand Cru Chardonnay hillsides above the storied Grand Cru villages of Cuis, Chouilly, and Cramant. It is crafted with precision and exquisite refinement in what many believe to be the one of the Côte des Blancs’ most extraordinary cellars. Awarding it 93 points, Wine & Spirits praised its “supple” texture, while Wine Spectator chimed in with 92 points. But Wine Access clients spoke the loudest: so far 116 have rated it a perfect 5 stars.
A quick peek into the estate’s history reveals how an impeccable pedigree of experience has helped us all arrive at the near-unanimous consensus — delicious — on the Diebolt-Vallois Blanc de Blancs. The Vallois half of the family has been cultivating vines in the Côtes des Blancs since the 15th century. The Diebolts arrived in the 19th century. Jacques, the current patriarch, started working the vineyards with his grandfather in the late 1950s. The Diebolts were farmers, but under Jacques’ vision, they ultimately started making their own wines in the auspiciously spectacular 1978 vintage.
We’ve been drinking Diebolt-Vallois Blanc de Blancs as our “anytime” Champagne for years, so we’re just pleased that we’ve found more to offer to our clients, and that so many people seem to agree with our assessment of this sparkler’s stellar quality and value.








Tasting Notes


NV Diebolt-Vallois Blanc de Blancs Brut
 Wine Access
The Diebolt-Vallois Blanc de Blancs is pale gold-green in hue. Tiny bubbles of great persistence. Precise nose of citrus, orange pith, ripe green apple, and freshly baked brioche. Taut, tightly wound, and complex on the attack, with a chalk-infused core of apple, pear and ripe lemon, finishing with terrific tension and vibrancy.
93 Points Wine & Spirits
The texture is supple, the flavors succulent and appetite inducing.
92 Points Wine Spectator
This is fresh and floral on the nose, with a chalky mousse and clean-cut acidity framing flavors of poached pear and white cherry fruit, clover honey and slivered almond on the palate. Lasting, zesty finish of grated ginger and ground spice. Drink now through 2019.

                                The 2014 Teeter-Totter Cabernet boasts the fingerprints of a master craftsman. Bold and dark ruby/purple in the glass, bursting with classic Cabernet notes of blackcurrant, mocha, anise, and subtle toasty notes framed by new wood cedar. Full bodied, boasting silky black fruit, alluring earthy notes and purple florals, a rich and lingering finish is braced by fine-grained tannins. Enjoy now for its opulent, youthful, black-fruited purity, or cellar for at least a decade.

Grape Varietals




Of the many factors that determine the characteristics of a given wine, the grape varietal is perhaps the most important. Although there are over 10,000 different documented varietals within the species Vitis Vinifera (regarded as the "true" wine grapes), the grapes listed on this page are the ones most commonly cultivated for fine wines.
Each grape varietal has differing aroma and flavor characteristics when it is made into wine. But wines made from individual varietals will also vary in character depending on where in the world the grapes are grown: for example, vineyards in New World growing regions will produce wines with different flavors and aromas than vineyards from Old World growing regions, even when the wines are made from the exact same grape varietal.
Use the links below to find top-rated wines for each of the varietals and learn about what makes each varietal unique.
