                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

	**************************************************************************


	Investors are urged to read the final prospectus supplement relating
	to these securities because it contains important information regarding the offering that is not included herein. The issuer, any
	underwriter or any dealer participating in the offering will arrange to send you the final prospectus supplement if you request
	it by calling toll-free 1-800-211-1037.


	 


	The asset-backed securities referred to in these materials, and the
	asset pool backing them, are subject to modification or revision (including the possibility that one or more classes of securities
	may be split, combined or eliminated at any time prior to issuance or availability of a final prospectus) and are offered on a
	"when, as and if issued" basis. You understand that, when you are considering the purchase of these securities, a contract
	of sale will come into being no sooner than the date on which the relevant class has been priced and we have confirmed the allocation
	of securities to be made to you; any "indications of interest" expressed by you, and any "soft circles" generated
	by us, will not create binding contractual obligations for you or us.


	 


	 


	Because the asset-backed securities are being offered on a "when,
	as and if issued" basis, any such contract will terminate, by its terms, without any further obligation or liability between
	us, if the securities themselves, or the particular class to which the contract relates, are not issued. Because the asset-backed
	securities are subject to modification or revision, any such contract also is conditioned upon the understanding that no material
	change will occur with respect to the relevant class of securities prior to the closing date. If a material change does occur with
	respect to such class, our contract will terminate, by its terms, without any further obligation or liability between us (the "Automatic
	Termination"). If an Automatic Termination occurs, we will provide you with revised offering materials reflecting the material
	change and give you an opportunity to purchase such class. To indicate your interest in purchasing the class, you must communicate
	to us your desire to do so within such timeframe as may be designated in connection with your receipt of the revised offering materials.


	 


	The information contained in these materials may be based on assumptions
	regarding market conditions and other matters as reflected herein. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and the other underwriters
	make no representation regarding the reasonableness of such assumptions or the likelihood that any such assumptions will coincide
	with actual market conditions or events, and these materials should not be relied upon for such purposes. The underwriters and
	their respective affiliates, officers, directors, partners and employees, including persons involved in the preparation or issuance
	of these materials, may, from time to time, have long or short positions in, and buy and sell, the securities mentioned herein
	or derivatives thereof (including options). Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and the other underwriters may have an investment
	or commercial banking relationship with the issuer.


	 


	Information in these materials is current as of the date appearing
	on the material only. This free writing prospectus is not required to contain all information that is required to be included in
	the base prospectus and the prospectus supplement. The information in this free writing prospectus is preliminary and subject to
	change. Information in these materials regarding any securities discussed herein supersedes all prior information regarding such
	securities. These materials are not to be construed as an offer to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy any security in
	any jurisdiction where such an offer or solicitation would be illegal. You should consult your own counsel, accountant and other
	advisors as to the legal, tax, business, financial and related aspects of a purchase of these securities.


	 


	The issuer has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus)
	with the SEC (registration statement file no. 333-199921) for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest,
	you should read the prospectus in that registration statement and other documents the issuer has filed with the SEC for more complete
	information about the issuer and this offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov.
	Alternatively, the issuer, any underwriter or any dealer participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus
	if you request it by calling toll-free 1-800-211-1037. The securities may not be suitable for all investors.


	 


	 


	ANY DISCLAIMERS OR OTHER NOTICES THAT MAY APPEAR BELOW ARE NOT APPLICABLE
	TO THIS COMMUNICATION AND SHOULD BE DISREGARDED. SUCH DISCLAIMERS OR OTHER NOTICES WERE AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED AS A RESULT OF

Commercial real estate financing



   Commercial mortgages at competitive rates  




Financing to help you fund your future — provided by Business Real Estate Financing Apply for financing of up to $750,000 to purchase, refinance, or leverage the equity in commercial property that is either owner-occupied or investment. Take advantage of our competitive rates on loans and lines of credit with low closing costs, secured by commercial property valued up to $5 million.  No application fee and no appraisal fee Low 1% origination fee, maximum $5,000 due at closing Fixed-rate and Prime-based loans with a variety of terms  Feel confident that you are getting the most competitive offer. We’ll match or beat a competing offer (rate and fee combination) when a competitor’s formal written approval is provided to us — or pay you $200.


  Questions? Ready to apply? Call 1-877-322-4648, Monday – Friday, 6:00 am – 6:00 pm, Pacific Time.   Financing from $50,000 to $750,000 for purchase and refinance loans in first lien position; $50,000 to $500,000 for lines of credit, equity loans, and refinance loans in second lien position. Maximum $500,000 for cash-out. All financing is subject to credit approval.  Low closing costs and competitive rates are based upon analysis of application, appraisal and origination fees, and interest rates, for competing U.S. lenders as compiled by an independent third-party research firm on a quarterly basis, beginning April 2016.  You will need to pay a deposit of up to $1,000 when accepting the terms of any loan or line of credit. The deposit is nonrefundable, unless the loan closes; in that case, the unused portion of the deposit (if any) will be returned or credited after closing in the same form as your original deposit. If environmental insurance is required, you will be responsible for this one-time fee of $1,866. You will also be responsible for the cost of any mortgage or deed of trust filing fee imposed by a state or other taxing authority. In states that require attorney closings, you will be responsible for title-related costs and attorney title work that exceeds $375. For purchase loans, you will be responsible for title and escrow fees. In addition, for purchase loans you will need to provide proof of funds for any required down payment. All financing is subject to credit approval.  Prepayment or early closure fees may apply. Contact your banker for details.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
