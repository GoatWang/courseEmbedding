TVKelly Ripa Explains Why the Search for a Live! Co-Host Needed to Begin Right AwayBy Kate Coyne and Lindsay Kimble•@lekimblePosted on May 11, 2016 at 11:30am EDT 
ShareTweetEmail 





 



Kelly Ripa is opening up in this exclusive interview on how she really feels about Michael Strahan’s departure from Live! – and what’s next for her. Subscribe now for her side of the story, only in PEOPLE!
Kelly Ripa‘s search for a new Live! co-host is starting four months earlier than previously announced – and for a reason.  
Ripa’s morning talk show costar Michael Strahan will end his nearly four years on Live! this Friday, despite initial plans for him to stay on through September before beginning a new role at Good Morning America.  
The 45-year-old tells PEOPLE in this week’s cover story that she and Live! staff members – whom she affectionately refers to as “family” – served as the impetus behind the decision to speed-up Strahan’s departure.
Kelly RipaDouglas Friedman“What we’ve explained to them is, ‘Well, if you had asked us, we would have told you, Guys, we need to start looking, because we have summer hiatus, we have vacation time. We need to find people. If we’re going to have this list narrowed down at least to a manageable size by the fall, we need to start now,’ ” Ripa explains, noting, “nobody consulted us initially.”  
• To read the full interview with Kelly Ripa, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday
Kelly Ripa on the cover of PEOPLENews of Strahan’s plans to leave the long-running ABC show broke publicly in mid-April – the same day the Ripa, herself, found out. Despite the immediate fallout, Strahan and Ripa continued on, side-by-side, just a week later, with the star calling the situation a prime example of why workplace communication is crucial.  
The Story Behind the Story: Kelly Ripa Opens Up About What Really Happened with Michael Strahan
Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan on Live! With Kelly and MichaelNow, the task at hand is finding a replacement for Strahan, 44, that matches the pair’s “chemistry and camaraderie.” Numerous stars have had their hats thrown in the ring, with a source previously telling PEOPLE that Ripa would “love” for pal Anderson Cooper to join her behind the Live! desk.  
Cooper, 48, has insisted that he’s “very happy at CNN,” but Ripa sheepishly grinned while telling PEOPLE of getting the star on board: “Stay tuned … ”   

“We just keep doing it one show at a time,” she says of the keeping the show afloat amid the hunt. “We always try to remind ourselves it’s never as good as we think it is and it’s never as bad as we think it is. We just keep marching forward. That’s what we’ve done for years. It’s not a formula I invented. This is a formula that Regis [Philbin] created, and we’re sticking to it.”  
Until a decision is made, Live! already has several interim co-hosts signed on. First up to the plate? Jimmy Kimmel, who will join Ripa for the show on Monday.  
Live! With Kelly and Michael airs weekdays (check local listings).

Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan, co-hosts of ABC’s “Live With Kelly and Michael.” Ms. Ripa was caught off guard by the news of Mr. Strahan’s departure for “Good Morning America.”

It seemed like an innocent enough announcement: Michael Strahan, the former football player turned television personality, was shifting assignments on ABC’s morning lineup, the network said Tuesday. He would leave “Live With Kelly and Michael” in September to become a co-anchor on “Good Morning America.”But there was rancor behind the scenes. Mr. Strahan’s co-host, Kelly Ripa, was told of the move just minutes before the announcement, and felt blindsided, said a person who has spoken to her about ABC’s decision. And she made little attempt to conceal her displeasure, skipping Wednesday’s edition on “Live.” ABC said she would not appear on the show for the rest of the week and would be replaced by Erin Andrews.Ms. Ripa’s absence Wednesday forced Mr. Strahan into the awkward position of addressing the news of his departure with a guest host, Ana Gasteyer, a former “Saturday Night Live” cast member.After Mr. Strahan and Ms. Gasteyer danced their way to the hosts’ desk on the “Live” set, Mr. Strahan said, “I’ve been in the news lately,” before formally announcing that he was leaving.

For ABC, what was supposed to be a boost to its morning lineup is instead developing into a giant headache with one of its most prominent stars. Ms. Ripa, who joined the show in 2001, replacing Kathy Lee Gifford, has developed a loyal following of her own. Continue reading the main story

In addition to Ms. Ripa’s apparent displeasure, “Good Morning America” is also presenting the network with cause for concern. Though it remains the most-watched morning show, it’s down 10 percent in total viewers and 18 percent in the 25-to-54-year-old demographic important to advertisers. It is second in that age bracket to NBC’s “Today,” a show that experienced its own ratings difficulties four years ago when it botched Ann Curry’s departure.When Mr. Strahan does join “Good Morning America” in a full-time role in September, he will be accustomed to the surroundings. He began as an on-air correspondent for “Good Morning America” two years ago, a decision that Ms. Ripa expressed concerns about at the time, according to the person. Ms. Ripa was worried it would distract him from “Live” but was reassured it would only be a temporary position.Mr. Strahan continued to appear on the morning show, and ABC executives recently decided that bringing him into the “Good Morning America” lineup could help stem the ratings drop.After “Live” ended on Tuesday morning, Ms. Ripa was called to a meeting along with the show’s longtime producer, Michael Gelman, and the WABC general manager, Dave Davis (the show is produced by WABC, and it is distributed by ABC and Disney’s syndication group). She did not know the purpose of the meeting.After a 20-minute wait, Mr. Strahan entered the room and broke the news that he was leaving. It wasn’t long before tensions flared.

“Didn’t I tell you this was going to happen?” Ms. Ripa said to Mr. Davis at the meeting, according to the person. “I told you two years ago this was going to happen.”A few minutes after the meeting ended, ABC publicly announced Mr. Strahan’s departure. Ms. Ripa later let the network know she would not appear on Wednesday.Ms. Ripa was angry, this person said, because she perceived that “Good Morning America” was being given priority over “Live.” Ms. Ripa declined to comment.

Ms. Ripa was similarly caught off guard in 2011 when Regis Philbin informed her 20 minutes before show time that he was going to announce his departure on that edition of “Live.”After Mr. Philbin left the show, “Live” began an open casting call to replace him, cycling in more than a dozen potential co-hosts to sit beside Ms. Ripa. After 10 months, ABC selected Mr. Strahan, who is also a commentator on Fox’s N.F.L. pregame show.In a statement, an ABC spokeswoman said: “‘Live’ continues to be a vibrant and enduring franchise under our lead host, the extraordinarily talented Kelly Ripa. ‘Live’ has successfully transitioned co-hosts twice before and will do so again. Together with Kelly, ABC and the ‘Live’ team will begin a new search to find a replacement for Michael.”It appears that Ms. Ripa’s absence will be an extended one: “Live” is not scheduled to shoot on Friday and she had already arranged to take Monday off for a long weekend to celebrate her 20thwedding anniversary, the person said.Friday’s show will be taped on Thursday, so Ms. Andrews will appear for the next two editions of “Live.” Ms. Ripa will be replaced by the “Pretty Little Liars” actress Shay Mitchell on Monday, an ABC spokeswoman said.

 Correction: April 25, 2016  
An article on Thursday about rancor at ABC over the move of the morning-show host Michael Strahan to “Good Morning America” rendered the name of his current show incorrectly. It is “Live With Kelly and Michael,” not “Live: Kelly and Michael.” The error also appeared in an article on Wednesday announcing the shift.

At 43, Kelly Ripa always looks incredibly fresh-faced and perky for her early morning TV appearances. And the host, who is known to be very candid about her beauty regime, chatted to Watch What Happens Live host Andy Cohen about her love of face-freezing wonder treatment Botox. The diminutive talk show host looked stunning in a vibrant floral dress which showed off her toned limbs as she headed to the Bravo studios in New York on Tuesday.Scroll down for video 






Bloomin' lovely: Kelly Ripa wowed in a floral dress as she headed to the Bravo studios in New York on TuesdayKelly sat down alongside TV journalist Anderson Cooper and the pair tackled questions from fans with lighthearted banter ensuing. When asked by Andy what her must-have beauty product is, Kelly responded: 'Botox. And that's pretty much it.'Botox has changed my life. It's cut my getting ready time in half.'When
 pressed by Andy for more detail she explained humorously: 'Because 
suddenly my eyelids are no longer resting on my eyelashes!' 






Youthful: 43-year-old Kelly calls her beauty regime 'minimalist' and is a huge advocate of Botox, happily chatting about her love for the injections to Watch What Happens Live host Andy Cohen 






Great shape: The petite TV star looked chic in the dress which showed off her super toned arms and legs 






All smiles: Kelly was happy to pose in her chic frock as she left the studios after her interview
 The star has previously been up front about her habits when it comes to maintaining her youthful looks. She told Elle magazine in February 2013 that not only does she get the injections in her eyes every seven months but she also injects her armpits to avoid sweating.Later in the show, Andy's guests also got a surprise phone call from Cher. Although the legendary diva disguised her voice, Anderson guessed right away that it was the star and the pair could hardly contain their excitement.Kelly's 
frock featured a racer back top in shades of pink with bursts of green 
floral motifs and fit snug around her tiny waist before flaring into a 
purple-hued miniskirt.She
 carried a black satin clutch which matched the sheen of her dress and 
donned a pair of white heeled pumps to add some height to her 5ft 3in 
frame. 






Banter: The trio appeared to have a blast on-set talking about beauty, reality stars and Cher
  






Photo op: Kelly shared a selfie with Anderson Cooper on the set of the show on Tuesday 






Adorable: The star gave her husband Mark Consuelos a big kiss on the cheek when they reunited after filming 






Too cute: Kelly gazes lovingly at her hubby as he grins widely for the cameras
 
 Her blonde shoulder-length locks were styled into a straight and chic bob. The
 petite beauty was also still looking very bronzed from her holiday in 
Greece last month with husband Mark Consuelos and friends Jessica and 
Jerry Seinfeld. She updated fans regularly on her activities as she island hopped on her Mediterranean getaway. 






Early bird: Kelly can be seen on weekday mornings hosting Live With Kelly And Michael. Seen here on Wednesday morning with guests Zach Braff and Anderson Cooper
 Along with happy snaps with her famous 
pals, the star posted a number of shots of husband Mark and their three 
gorgeous children - Michael, 17, Lola, 13, and 11-year-old Joaquin.The photos were mostly 
taken in Santorini, while it also appeared that they did some 
sightseeing in Sounion as they paid a visit to the Temple Of Poseidon.Watch
 What Happens Live is on Sunday to Thursday evenings on Bravo and Kelly can 
be seen co-hosting alongside Michael Strahan on ABC's Live With Kelly And Michael 
on weekday mornings.

THE MICHAEL KELLY MOD SHOP










EQUIPPED WITH




Seymour Duncan Pickups
Probably the best known pickup company in the world, Seymour Duncan is a leader. They earn that position daily with great pickups. We have enjoyed
teaming with them to find just the right Duncans for our model.










Mod Shop 55 Ebony Duncan

The Custom Collection 55 Striped Ebony features a striking striped ebony top, real flame maple binding and a great modernized design. It’s pickup configuration and Great 8 electronics mod have helped it stand out sonically. With the Mod Shop version we deliver something new thanks to a collaboration with Seymour Duncan pickups. For the Duncan Mod Shop 55 we chose pickups that provide a tremendous amount of versatility and pure vintage inspired tones. Our goal was to make this guitar a true “swiss army knife” to handle virtually any style of music. The only guitar you’d need for your gig. 

Stag Mag Bridge pickup
The Stag Mag is a high output bridge pickup designed specifically to give players a true classic “double-cut” single coil tone when switched into split mode which is part of our Great 8 wiring mod (details below). The Stag Mag has alnico 2 rod magnets with a traditional single-coil pole stagger, and a specially designed high output coil wind so the sound is bouncy and bright when coil split. When both coils are active in full humbucker mode, the tone is fat and smooth. Hand built in Santa Barbara, CA, the Stag Mag has a nickel silver bottom plate, and is vacuum wax potted for squeal-free performance.

Seymourized Mini Humbucker Neck pickup
The Seymourized Mini Humbucker has been described as Seymour’s favorite pickup. The neck model in the Mod Shop 55 is designed so that each coil contains a high-carbon steel blade coupled to the bottom-loaded alnico 5 bar magnet. The tone has more midrange and clarity, and provides nice, even sounding chords with just a hint of snarl. Clean tones have a clear, snappiness, and distorted tones have a nice midrange growl. Hand made in Santa Barbara, CA and is vacuum wax potted for squeal free operation.


Boutique Electronics Mod: Great 8 
The Great 8 wiring mod allows either (or both) humbucking pickups to be coil split via 2 push/pull switches included on the master volume and tone control knobs. This combined with the 3-way pickup selector switch provides the player with 8 distinctive tonal options for covering a variety of musical styles

MODERN-C

Comfort without sacrifice, that is how you might describe our Modern-C shape. The size is what many
would call medium to medium-thin and the shape is a really smooth and comfortable round shape. The thin profile
makes it faster than the typical vintage neck, while the carefully contoured C-shape makes it comfortable for
extended playing.

			The Cold War may be over, but it’s going to...
					







Talk show frenemies Michael Strahan and Kelly Ripa are taking their fight outside — to a retail store near you.
As Strahan moves to ABC’s “Good Morning America” from “Live With Kelly and Michael” and the two get to see how well they fare apart, both will also be competing for shoppers’ dollars.
Ripa on April 20 unveiled a line of Kelly Ripa branded bedding, rugs and couches at Macy’s. A Ripa Ampton sectional will run you about $7,300.
Strahan, who has had his Collection by Michael Strahan line of affordable suits and separates at JCPenney since the fall, on Thursday announced the addition of a line of activewear.
That will debut on May 21.
MSX by Michael Strahan — including T-shirts, polos and jogger pants from $12.99 to $25.99 — promises that it will be “changing the rules” on what you can wear and where you can wear it.
Some items will feature “auto-locking zippers” — which may or may not be a good thing.
Already, Strahan seems to be winning the retail battle — although neither appeared to be ringing the cash registers too loudly.
On Penney’s website on Thursday, Strahan’s $260 suit jackets and $120 pants were marked down 50 percent.
But Ripa’s 10-piece comforter sets were on sale and marked down 55 percent.
