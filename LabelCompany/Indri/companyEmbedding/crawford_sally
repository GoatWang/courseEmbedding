Editorial Reviews▼▲
The final installment in the Harwood House series is a gripping adventure yarn and a poignant, satisfying against-all-odds romance. The authors breathe vibrant life into a lesser-known period of colonial history, presenting memorable, engaging characters...
I have really LOVED this entire series! This is the third book and I highly recommend reading the first two books. By the third book, you have fully invested in the characters and are very interested in every aspect of their stories!
Out of the three Daughters of Harwood House books, Lily's Plight is my favorite.Laity and Crawford address the dangers of battle and how families in the early settlements needed to work together to succeed. The struggle with faith, love, and family are woven throughout the novel. It was a beautiful conclusion to the Harwood family.
This was a satisfying conclusion to an enjoyable trilogy set in the early days of Colonial settlement. An avid history buff, I thoroughly enjoyed the inclusion of the American militia’s struggle against invading French and Indians, the tense action between the Indians and homesteaders and the struggles our early colonists faced.  I most enjoyed the deep emotional battles that Lily and John faced on an almost daily basis. They feel guilt, pain, reaffirmation of faith, and a myriad of other emotions. The authors have done an excellent job in writing a gripping historical page turner, filled with anxious moments and, ultimately, the peace and love that two people can find with God’s grace.

            I have read and reviewed the other two books in this series. The first book, Rose's Pledge, was very good and I enjoyed the story. The second book, Mariah's Quest, was not so good and I would not read it again. I was hoping that this third book would get back to the likes of the first book for me. Well it was not as bad as the second but still not a favorite of mine. I have this book 4/5 stars. I though the characters were well portrayed but sometimes their personalities conflicted with what they actually did. I just could not fall in love with them and that makes it hard to read about their lives! I would recommend you read the others in the series first but it is not a necessity. I would recommend this book as a descent Christian Historical Fiction book to read.


I would like to thank the publisher for the copy of this book I enjoyed reading. I gave an honest review based on my opinion of what I read.

            It was good to read about the third sister in this series. This series was really good and I learned a lot about indentured servants. I had no idea this took place. From the way the book was written, you could visualize the settings and feel what they were going through. I read this book in two nights because I couldn't wait to see what was next. Thanks for a great read!!

            Lily's Plight, the third and final installment of The Harwood House trilogy written by Sally Laity and Dianna Crawford and published by Barbour Press, closes the stories of three British sisters who, for their own individual reasons, sold themselves into indenturement in America. Lily Harwood, the youngest of the sisters, served the Waldon family willingly and with joy for the four years of her indenturement. She cared for Susan Waldon, the beloved and terminally ill wife and mother, as well as mothering the four young Waldon children placed in her care. The only dark spots in her life are the constant threat of Indian attacks on the wilderness settlement and her burgeoning love for the Waldon family patriarch, John.


With John often gone from the homestead serving in the colonial militia, the burdens of farming, homemaking, and warrior-life fell to Lily. When her chance comes to leave the homestead, Lily must decide where she truly wants to be - with John and his children or with her now-wealthy sister, Mariah, enjoying a life of ease more suited to her upbringing.


I was thrilled to be given the opportunity to review Lily's Plight. I truly enjoyed Laity and Crawford's earlier series, Freedom's Holy Light, and knew that this newest series would carry the rich historical detail, genuine characters, and well-paced plot that I was accustomed to from their earlier work. I did not have a chance to read the first two books in The Harwood House series, Rose's Pledge and Mariah's Quest, but I didn't find that this hindered my reading of Lily's Plight.


The historical detail was a very accurate. In some ways, I wished Laity and Crawford would have softened the emotions of the settlers toward the raiding Indians, just to make it a little easier to read. However, their characterizations of both the Indians and the Colonials as pawns in the war between the French and British was spot-on. I think a little modernism may have been added when treating the possible romantic entanglements for Lily. It seemed to me that the young men were quite forward in both speech and mannerisms, but then again, life on the frontier did not have the ultra-civilized, restrained atmosphere of a colonial city.


The romantic tensions between Lily and John were well-played out through the whole story. Thankfully, as expected, Laity and Crawford did not leave that tension as the only one. Family disputes, Indian attacks, military fiascoes, and spiritual growth all work together to move the story of Lily along at a moderate pace. No break-neck racing toward the finish line of this story, but neither does the book bog down at any point.


I am very interested in picking up a copy of both Rose's Pledge and Mariah's Quest to find out these sisters' stories. I give Lily's Plight 5 stars.

            Sally Laity & Dianna Crawford in their new book, "Lily's Plight", Book Three in the Daughters Of Harwood House series published by Barbour Publishing, Inc. brings us into the life of Lily Harwood in the turbulent 1757.


From the back cover: Their greatest challenge is yet to come.


Lily Harwood always considered herself a good Christian lass. But after years of serving the Waldon family, and despite the fact that she loves them dearly, her life has grown increasingly difficult and frightening. Daily she watches Susan Waldon's health deteriorate, and with John Waldon away with the militia, protecting them from attack by the French and Indians, Lily is responsible for the entire farmstead.


Ever since John's last child was born over four year's ago, he's had to watch helplessly as his beloved wife suffers with a mysterious and debilitating illness. And because of the drawn-out conflict, he's torn between wanting to be with his family and knowing that thwarting the enemy on the frontier is the best way to protect them.


But when he returns home on a short furlough, both John and Lily face a deeper more profound plight. They find themselves falling in love. Caught between passion and sorrow in harrowing times, their only hope lies in the promises of God...


The Dictionary defines "Plight" as, "a solemnly given", or, "an unfortunate, difficult, or precarious situation". Lily Harwood lives up to both definitions. She gave her solemnity or promise to serve in the Waldon household and her situation is proving difficult as she is now in love with a married man. Can you imagine selling yourself into servant-hood to pay off your father's debt? Lily's sister Rose thought so and the three sisters came from England to America to do so. Rose and Mariah's stories were told in the previous two books, now it is Lily's turn. I like history and "Lily's Plight" is loaded with it. It is set against the background of the French And Indian War and Lily is an indentured servant trying to hold together a family that is seemingly falling apart. Lily has come to love this family however she has come to love John more and this is dangerous because he is married to Susan. Can she remain pure while the war happens around her and her own emotions threaten to overwhelm her? I won't give it all away except to say that the thrill ride that this story turns out to be has some real surprises before we find out that answer. "Lily's Plight" is a great read, filled with drama, romance, history and suspense. I recommend this book highly. I am sorry to see this series end but I am looking forward to more from these very talented authors.

I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."

About average fare

                This review was written for Lily's Plight, Harwood House Series #3 -eBook.
            
 
            This novel is a last in a trilogy, though the first I have read by these authors, so I was not familiar with the background of the story or the characters or with their writing style. Reading it also represented something of a new experience for me, as I generally opt for books of this genre set in Europe or in the medieval period. I am British, and a medievalist in training, so I prefer these and I am not really familiar with American history, the period when this story is set in general


This said, I have to say I was not greatly impressed by this story. I have read quite a few Historical romances in my time, and this one seemed about the average, run of the mill type of story in this genre. It was enjoyable enough, but I would say nothing special. Even the hint of Ã¢â¬Ëforbidden love' in the sense of Lily falling for her master in spite of herself when she knows she shouldn't and him doing the same has been Ã¢â¬Ëdone before', and felt perhaps felt a little clichÃÂ©d.


So Lily and John's love story is sweet, but rather predictable. In spite of both parties trying to suppress and quash their feelings for one another, in spite of them being separated by war and hardship, in spite of everything was almost inevitable that they would eventually get their happy ending.


The religious content seemed to be woven into the story well, and there was nothing that seemed objectionable or questionable in a theological sense. Without intending to be irreverent or disrespectful, I would say the theme and subject matter was about standard fare for inspirational historical novels of this kind. Not that I suggest or expect that Christian authors should change the Christian content or write anything Ã¢â¬Ënew' to pander to readers, the point as that this, like the novel is just about the same as a lot of others of this type.


The one aspect that did stand out for me was the question of why God does not always seem to answer prayer and sometimes seems to let bad things happen. If felt this was addressed sensitively, decisively and rather well.


Another aspect which seemed to be a reflection of the time period was the depiction of the Native Americans as barbarian savages. People now might find this objectionable, but I did not personally as it seemed a plausible enough presentation of the way that people living in the environment and circumstances of the characters might have viewed them. If the only contact they had with Native Americans was when they saw or heard of them raiding and burning settlements, killing people, or kidnapping their children, it did not seem surprising that they would view them in such a way.


Then there was the setting itself. It seemed to me a very idealised and romanticised version of good old fashioned rural American life, with characters who could have stepped off the set of Little House on the Prairie. The honest, decent, robust, hard workin' folk of Beaver Cove might have been pleasant enough, but they seemed to lack depth and be a little too perfect and sweet to be real.


Yes they faced hardships but they all muscled in together to help each other out, and everythin' came alright in the end. Not like wealthy them city who are almost all presented as living in luxury and as being too concerned with trivial things like clothes and balls and their social status or elegant wives to worry about much else that is important.


The British almost universally seemed to be depicted as cowards, weaklings or bungling fools whose Commanders could or would not defend the their territory or help each other, and seemed to do little except sit in their fortresses and surrender at the first hint of an attack, and who literally had to be forced to take any kind of decisive action in the war. It was of course the tough rugged Ã¢â¬Ëcolonials' in other words the Americans who did most of the real fighting and the ones who seemed to make the real difference.


The stereotyping went further when the Brits (like the city folk) were almost all depicted as genteel types from rich or affluent backgrounds who never did much tough physical labour like the Waldons of Beaver cove. Lily is presented as having been thus before she came to America and adopted the good life. Eye - roll inducing stereotyping once again where I had hoped the depiction of non-American people might be more informed or objective.


Then there were the accents. As stated before, I am not American, I am British, so I am not familiar with the nuances of regional American accents. Yet I could not help questioning whether there really would have been such a pronounced difference between the accents of Americans and British people at this time as there was in the story. Somehow, the accents of the American characters seemed a little too modern, and their use of some anachronistic terms and phrases which did not exist in the mid-1700s seemed to confirm this. The only two major non-American characters, as stated before were Lily, and Scotsman, who served as the preacher or pastor in Beaver Cove, he spoke with what seemed to be a ridiculously exaggerated accent, and Lily's was little better.


Overall, this novel was enjoyable enough, but it was really not my proverbial Ã¢â¬Ëcup of tea'. There did not seem to be anything much to set it apart from other novels in this genre, but it is passable enough a light, clean and moderately enjoyable read. I am interested in perhaps reading the preceding two novels, though I don't think I would buy them. If you like these authors, and novels set in this period, it might be for you.


Thanks to Netgalley and Barbour for providing me with a free electronic copy of this book to read and review. I was not required to write a positive one, and all opinions expressed here are my own.

Product Description▼▲
To save their father from debtor's prison, three gently bred daughters sell themselves into servitude in America. Rose Harwood, auctioned off to the highest bidder in Virginia, is now the bondswoman of a grubby trader. Will she survive the trek deep into Indian Territory? Footloose frontiersman Nate Kinyon is eager to possess this rather thorny Rose. But is he willing to sacrifice his wealth and freedom to win her heart? When Rose's situation goes from bad to worse, she wonders if God has forsaken her after all. Is the disarming but godless Nate her only hope?

Publisher's Description▼▲
Step back into the early days of America, where Rose Harwood and her sisters become indentured to the highest bidders. When Rose’s new owner takes her deep into Indian Territory, a young frontiersman named Nate Kinyon tags along, hoping to save Rose from the machinations of a grubby trader and the appraising looks of young braves. How much is he willing to pay—in dollars and sense—to redeem the woman he loves? And how much is Rose willing to sacrifice for his protection? 


Author Bio▼▲
Dianna Crawford is a California native. She has been published since the early 1990s and writes full-time. Her first inspirational novel was the premier of a six-book series for Tyndale that she coauthored with Sally Laity. Dianna is married and has four daughters and seven grandkids. 
Sally Laity considers it a joy to know that the Lord can touch other hearts through her stories. She has written both historical and contemporary novels, including a co-authored series for Tyndale House and another for Barbour Publishing, nine Heartsong Romances, and twelve Barbour novellas. Her favorite pastimes include quilting for her church’s Prayer Quilt Ministry and scrapbooking. She makes her home in the beautiful Tehachapi Mountains of southern California with her husband of fifty years and enjoys being a grandma and great-grandma.

            It was very entertaining...very comfortable read, and lots of really fun parts...most of all I thought it brought to our minds a sometimes forgotten people...the American Indians...and their need for the Lord...

            Storyline is for young teen girls. Did not finish this book, and will not order the next in this series.

            This was a great read! I wasn't aware of the history of debtors prison and servitude. The author kept you wanting to read more. It was hard to put the book down. I'm glad this was book one. I'm anxious to read the stories of the other sisters.

            Rose's Pledge is written by Dianna Crawford and Sally Laity and published by Barbour Publishing, Inc.


Rose Harwood can not believe she is on her way to a trading post out west when only weeks ago she was selling all her family owned in England to help keep her father out of debt prison. Coming from England to America by boat and being auctioned off was not all she had hoped it would be. She and her two sisters are now separated and not sure when they will be together again. So far meeting a young man named Nate has been the only positive part of her trip! Nate is attracted to Rose and decides to go on the journey to the trading post with the fur trader and Rose.


I liked the descriptive writing in this story. It was not overdone and really helped me picture the people and settings talked about. The whole story moved quickly and entertained me as well. I enjoyed the writers' style and thought this was one of the best western fiction books I have read. This is an excellent Christian fiction book to escape into!


I would like to thank NetGalley and the publisher for the copy of this book I enjoyed reading. I gave an honest review based on my opinion of what I read.

                This review was written for Rose's Pledge, Harwood House Series #1.
            
 
            Rose is the oldest Harwood Daughter. Her mother died when she was only 13 years of age. She became the mother figure for her younger siblings. She has sacrificed her courting years to take care of her family. Now she's an old spinster.


When her father is in debt and is threatened to go to debt prison, Rose comes up with a plan to get money to pay her father's debt. That plan included selling herself as bond servant to the colonies.


A dirty old man named Smith bought Rose to become his cook. The man is a fur trader and lives on a trading post in Indian territory. While traveling the 30 miles to that post she meets Nate, a handsome frontiersman, who wants to free her from Smith. But Smith doesn't want to sell his cook. Nate travels with Smith and Rose to the trading post and starts to have feelings for Rose.


Rose is a dedicated Christian and Nate isn't. So she's trying to guard her heart, but is attracted to him nevertheless.


It took me a while to get into the story, but once I did I really liked the story. I loved reading about the untamed wilderness, how they traveled and crossed rivers, always on guard for enemy Indians and Frenchmen. Also interesting to read was how the fur trading was done. I liked to read how Rose adapted to life in the wilderness, how she learned the fur trade and became a tough lady.


For the lover of historical fiction, especially frontiers settings, this book is a must read.


*I received a copy of this book from NetGalley and was not required to write a positive review.*

How do I choose a lawyer?
Consider the following: 
Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?

Ark of Civilization
Refugee Scholars and Oxford University, 1930-1945
Edited by Sally Crawford, Katharina Ulmschneider, and Jaś Elsner



Description



In the opening decades of the twentieth century, Germany was at the cutting edge of arts and humanities scholarship across Europe. However, when many of its key thinkers--leaders in their fields in classics, philosophy, archaeology, art history, and oriental studies--were forced to flee to England following the rise of the Nazi regime, Germany's loss became Oxford's gain. From the mid-1930s onwards, Oxford could accurately be described as an "ark of knowledge" of western civilization: a place where ideas about art, culture, and history could be rescued, developed, and disseminated freely. The city's history as a place of refuge for scientists who were victims of Nazi oppression is by now familiar, but the story of its role as a sanctuary for cultural heritage, though no less important, has received much less attention. In this volume, the impact of Oxford as a shelter, a meeting point, and a center of thought in the arts and humanities specifically is addressed, by looking both at those who sought refuge there and stayed, and those whose lives intersected with Oxford at crucial moments before and during the war. Although not every great refugee can be discussed in detail in this volume, this study offers an introduction to the unique conjunction of place, people, and time that shaped Western intellectual history, exploring how the meeting of minds enabled by libraries, publishing houses, and the University allowed Oxford's refugee scholars to have a profound and lasting impact on the development of British culture. Drawing on oral histories, previously unpublished letters, and archives, it illuminates and interweaves both personal and global histories to demonstrate how, for a short period during the war, Oxford brought together some of the greatest minds of the age to become the custodians of a great European civilization.

                        For those of you that know Lori she is again fighting Luekemia. She would never set one of these up for herself but chemo drugs and gas for doctors appointments have taken a toll on her families food,bills and frankly life in general at this time. So if you are a good friend or aquiantences or just want to help Lori through this very tough time. Please donate. Lori has always helped when other people were in need and this is when we can pay her back for her friendship and loyalty, thank you from myself and of course Lori's family.  Anything is appreciated.
