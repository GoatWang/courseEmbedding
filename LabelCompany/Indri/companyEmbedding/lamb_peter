What People Are Saying
"The Tai Chi for Arthritis DVD is like having Dr. Lam as your personal instructor with no distractions from others. His teaching is easy to learn especially when he breaks down a movement into smaller parts. I love the front-on and back-on demonstrations so you can follow along. I've tried learning from other DVD's but got sooooo confused. There is no confusion with Dr. Lam. Just take the break down of a movement one at a time and practice, practice, practice." - Bob Parsons - Tulsa, Oklahoma

Best Tai Chi programmes ever






			Posted by Carol R on 15th Mar 2016
		
Once again Dr Lam has produced a wonderful gentle yet effective programme for those of us who have older bodies and joints and cannot always complete more vigorous forms. It always amazes me that the benefits are so great....without doing hard workouts, but the proof is in how you feel. Better core strength and better balance are the main things I have found with all of Dr Lam's programmes




A learning curve






			Posted by Bruce Males on 18th Nov 2015
		
The attention to detail is exceptional and I would most definitely apply this method if and when I start a new class of beginners, regardless of their age.




Tai Chi for Older Adults






			Posted by Dahlis on 11th May 2012
		

I must admit I passed up this one at first because, approaching 60, I am too 'young' to be an 'older adult.'

Our Public Library recently got it so of course, I had a look.

I love this video! This is a gentle introduction to Yang Style Tai Chi. The testimonials and spirits of the students are heartwarming.

The form is easily followed and learned. This is just what I need to gently lead students into Yang Style after TCA. This video can be a transition, a bridge, into Long Form.

Thank you for you excellent ideas, knowledge, and teaching methods.

Benwick  By Bonnie S. Benwick   Deputy Food editor/Recipe editor September 25, 2015  Follow @bonniebenwick         Peter Chang’s Cumin Lamb. (Renee Comet/For the Washington Post; styling by Bonnie S. Benwick)  P eter Chang’s cumin lamb is fast and fierce, as much of the daily wok cooking goes at his newest restaurants in Arlington and Rockville. In the old days in China, he says via business partner Gen Lee, meat for the dish was seasoned and roasted whole, for hours.   The restaurateurs decided to use thin lamb chops instead, marinated briefly, stir-fried on the bone for more flavor, then vibrantly spiced with a last-minute hit of numbing Sichuan pepper and toasted ground cumin. Crisp-tender vegetables, dried chili peppers and cilantro complete the heap served sizzling hot. That, and Chang’s deft bamboo fish, have remained the most-ordered dishes on the menu.   The trick to keeping the lamb so tender? A few pre-marinade whacks with a meat pounder. Chang expects his diners to use the bones as handles, for easy eating.  Serve with steamed rice. Shaoxing cooking wine, light (thin) soy sauce, Maggi Seasoning sauce and Sichuan peppercorns are available at large Asian markets. MAKE AHEAD: The lamb chops need to marinate for at least 15 minutes and up to 30 minutes.  CUMIN LAMB   4 servings   Ingredients  8 lamb rib chops (about 1 1/4 pounds total) 2 tablespoons Shaoxing cooking wine (see headnote) 2 tablespoons light soy sauce (see headnote) 1 tablespoon oyster sauce 1 teaspoon Maggi Seasoning sauce (see headnote) Freshly ground white pepper   1 /2  teaspoon ground Sichuan peppercorns (see headnote) 1 teaspoon cumin seed Vegetable oil 6 to 8 scallions 1 medium carrot, trimmed, scrubbed well and cut into very thin matchsticks (julienne) 1 medium white onion, cut into thin matchsticks or half-moons 6 to 8 small dried red chili peppers (unseeded) 1 handful small sprigs of cilantro, plus more for garnish  Directions  Place the lamb chops between two large pieces of plastic wrap. Pound just enough to flatten the meat to half its original thickness; it should remain attached to the bone. Transfer to a zip-top bag along with the Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, oyster sauce, Maggi Seasoning, several grinds of white pepper and   1 /4  teaspoon of the ground Sichuan peppercorns. Seal and massage to coat. Cover and marinate for 15 to 30 minutes. Toast the cumin seed in a dry wok or skillet over medium heat until fragrant and lightly browned, shaking the pan to avoid scorching. Cool, then grind in a dedicated spice grinder. Transfer to a small bowl. Heat just enough oil to thinly coat a wok or high-sided skillet; place over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the scallions (1 bunch; to taste); cook undisturbed for 1 or 2 minutes, just until lightly browned, then discard the scallions, leaving as much oil in the pan as possible. Add to the bowl with marinating lamb chops the julienned carrot and onion, the dried chili peppers (to taste) and a small handful of short cilantro sprigs, tossing to coat. Add the mixture to the hot scallion oil; increase the heat to medium-high. Stir-fry vigorously for 3 to 5 minutes, making sure the meat gets evenly seared but is not overcooked. Season the stir-fried lamb chops with the toasted, ground cumin and the remaining   1 /4  teaspoon ground Sichuan peppercorns; stir-fry for 1 minute, until the spices are fragrant and well distributed. Serve right away, garnished with a few more cilantro sprigs.   Adapted from chef-restaurateur Peter Chang.    Tested by Bonnie S. Benwick.

Sheep By-Products






This fact sheet was developed by students enrolled in Purdue's ANSC 442 Sheep Management course in Spring 2000, as a semester project. These fact sheets provide useful information on various topics related to sheep. View the list of fact sheets.


Sheep
By-Products: The Hidden Resource 

When most people think of
sheep products, two items come to mind: meat and wool.  Granted, these two
products account for the majority of the income for sheep producers; however,
there are numerous possibilities to use all parts of the sheep.  In using
the carcass to the full extent, everybody, from the producer to the consumer,
benefits.  The major benefits come from both economical and environmental
aspects.  By using all parts of the carcass, it becomes more valuable to
the processor and as a result, the lamb becomes more valuable, meaning that the
producer benefits economically.  Most importantly, the consumer saves
money in two ways from the processor using the entire lamb.  First, the
price of lamb meat is reduced because the processor's income increases by using
the entire carcass.  Second, since sheep byproducts can be sold at a low price,
the products that they go into can also be sold at a lower cost.  From an environmental
standpoint, in using the entire carcass, less waste is accumulated.  By
producing less waste that needs to be disposed of, everyone benefits from a
cleaner environment. 
  
Although by-products provide a
great opportunity for everyone in the sheep industry to profit, few in the
industry are actually reaping the benefits.  It is only through educating
those integrally involved in the industry that the full resources of this opportunity
may come into fruition.  The purpose of this web site is to explore and
educate on the many by-product of sheep. 
  
To begin with, let's divide
the parts of a sheep carcass that can be used for by-products and describe how
these products can be extracted. 
�        
From the
Intestines
�        
From the
Horns, Hooves, & Bone
�        
From
Manure
�        
From Fats
& Fatty Acids
�        
From Wool
�        
From Hide

From the Intestines 
In most cases after the intestines are eviscerated, they would be
disposed of.  However, they can be converted to many valuable
products.  Once cleaned, the intestines can be used as natural casings for
foods such as sausages and frankfurters.  This type of casing provides an
economical and safe packing material for these popular foods.  A high
value by-product of the intestines are instrument strings.  Though labor
intensive, this product can be sold at a high price.  Sheep intestines
provide a critical product for the veterinary field.  Once processed, the
intestines are made into suture material.  By using natural sutures from
sheep, veterinarians avoid complications such as immune responses, that arise
from synthetic sutures.  Also, these sutures are less invasive because the
body reabsorbs them over time. 
  
From Horns, Hooves, & Bone 
The horns, hooves, and bones are rich sources of keratin and
collagen among other things.  These two proteins are important due to
their binding ability and strength.  The properties of these proteins
allow the horns, hooves and bones of sheep to be used for a wide variety of
products.  These products include: bone charcoal for high grade steel,
shampoo and conditioner, bone china, collagen and bone for plastic surgery,
horn and bone handles, bone meal, bone jewelry, adhesive tape, gelatin
capsules, bone charcoal pencils, marshmallows, piano keys, gelatin desserts
(ice cream, yogart, and jello), film, and shepard crooks. 
  
From Manure 
One of the last places that one would look for a usable by-product
is sheep manure.  However, due to the ruminant digestive action of sheep,
many valuable minerals are found in the manure.  The manure contains
nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium carbonate, and lower levels of various
minerals.  Since manure contains these minerals, it is a valuable part of
such products as fertilizer and potash. 
  
  
  
  
  
From Fats & Fatty Acids

Although ill regarded and of little per unit value, fats and fatty
acids can add to the value of the carcass.  Due to the high quantities available on the carcass, once fats and fatty acids are further
processed, uses can be found for these otherwise worthless attributes of the
carcass.  Sheep fat and fatty acids can be added to dog and chicken feeds
with relatively little further processing.  They provide an inexpensive
source of energy to fill the needs of the diet.  Through further
processing, fats and fatty acids can be used as components in wax
products.  Examples of these products are: paraffin, crayons, candles, and
floor wax.  Also, fats and fatty acids play an integral role in chemicals;
glycol is found in brake fluid and glycerol is the ingredient that makes
asphalt stick together. To top things off, most people don't realize that
products they use on themselves everyday, such as: makeup, cosmetics, tanning
lotion, shaving cream, and hand cream, contain sheep fat and fatty acids.

  
From Wool 
Wool itself is a common product of the sheep industry, and like
all other sheep products there is waste material generated that can be
converted into profitable items.  These products include: lanolin, artists
brushes, insulation, and rug pads.  Without wool by-products there would
be no baseball because: the ball is stuffed with wool, it is sewn with wool
thread, its rubber lining is made from stearic acid, and the cork center
contains processed blood. 
  
  
  
From Hide 
As an alternative to expensive
leather from beef hides, sheep hides can be used as an economical alternative.
Once removed and processed, the hides can be used in the making of sporting
goods such as baseballs, footballs, tennis balls, and basketballs.  Also,
the leather from sheep hide can replace virtually all leather products made
from the leather of beef hide such as footwear and drum heads. 
  
  
  
In Conclusion 
Hopefuly this site has shown the
potential of sheep by-products to benefit all those involved in the
industry.  From the producer to the consumer, everyone can enjoy lower
prices and a better environment through the use of the many by-products
described here.  The knowledge of sheep by-products is the key that opens
the door to both profits and a better environment for all those in the sheep
industry.

Historicist: Sticky Business


                    The Peter R. Lamb and Co. glue factory generates a big stink.                
By 
                    David Wencer

The Peter R. Lamb and Co. glue factory after a fire on May 20, 1888.  City of Toronto Archives, Fonds 1246, Item 10.
“The offensive odours which are wafted into the Necropolis from Lamb’s glue factory are so powerful that they drive people out of the graveyard.” So claimed an item that ran in the Globe on June 21, 1880, typical of the increasing public complaints about the factory. The factory in question was the Peter R. Lamb and Co. glue and blacking manufactory, which for 40 years stood at the eastern end of Amelia Street, directly north of the Toronto Necropolis cemetery, near the Don River. While it provided employment and various necessary industrial products to the city, Lamb’s glue factory was one of the city’s most fragrant, and thus unpopular, industries.

An article by E. Louise Boyd in the York Pioneer suggests that Peter Lamb tried other businesses in the United States before coming to Toronto in 1835. Boyd writes that his earlier ventures included managing a shoe company, which he left upon discovering that the factory employed slave labour.
A description of Lamb’s business in the W.C. Chewett & Co. city directory for 1867/1868 claims the factory first opened in 1837, although other sources suggest it may have started a few years earlier. Sources also disagree about the factory’s earliest locations. Boyd writes that Lamb first set up business at Yonge and Temperance, whereas early Toronto historian John Ross Robertson notes an 1840s site of Lamb’s factory on Front Street, west of the Don. In 1924, an anonymous writer contributed childhood memories of Toronto to the Globe, and claimed that the Lamb factory was initially located at Church and Carlton.
Sketch of Front Street, showing what is believed to be an earlier site of the Lamb factory in the late 1840s, at “12.”  Robertson’s Landmarks of Toronto: A Collection of Historical Sketches of the Old Town of York from 1792 until 1833 and of Toronto from 1834 to 1895 (J. Ross Robertson, 1896: Toronto).
In 1848, Peter Lamb established a new factory at Amelia and Sumach, where it would remain until 1888. Lamb’s factory was the first major industrial site in the immediate vicinity, which was at this time a sparsely populated area on the fringes of Toronto. The move to this location was in line with a then-growing movement to establish heavier industries along the lower portion of the Don River, spurred by cheap, available land and convenient shipping access.
The location also put Lamb in close proximity to industries farther south along the Don, many of which supplied him with necessary materials, or which used Lamb’s glue or other products. In Reclaiming the Don, Jennifer Bonnell asserts that the industrial growth along the lower Don at this time created “constellations of mutually supportive operations. Soapworks in the lower valley, for example, took advantage of local supplies of tallow from nearby animal processing plants, while tanneries produced leather belts used for power transmission in early factories and mills.”

In the days before synthetic adhesives, most glues were made by subjecting hides, bone, hooves, fish, and other animal parts to high heat. These animal parts were usually supplied to glue manufacturers by tanners, meatpackers, and other industries whose processes produced small scraps that would otherwise go to waste. In an 1855 Globe advertisement for Peter R. Lamb and Co., the company directly appealed to other Toronto industries for materials using the line, “Tanners, save your glue pieces! Cash paid for tanners’ size pieces, cattle tails, and horns.”
(Right: Advertisement for Peter R. Lamb and Co.  The Globe, August 27, 1855.)
Getting high-grade waste products could prove challenging for glue manufacturers; in a 1929 publication on glue manufacturing, Paul I. Smith lamented that “most tanners simply ‘dump’ their hide and skin waste in a convenient spot and leave it until the glue-maker sends his compliments.” Smith observed that such practices reduce the quality of the glue that could be obtained, and advocates turning over the scrap heaps at least once a day to keep them fresh and thus maintain their quality: “By keeping his hide and skin offal in sweet condition, the tanner not only ensures a better market, but also eliminates some of the bad smells with which a tanyard is usually associated as well as facilitating the entire process of glue production.”
In addition to glue, the Lamb factory also produced a variety of other industrial products derived from animal sources. Advertisements indicate the company also produced “neat’s foot oil” [sic], a substance derived from cattle bones and often used in the preservation of leather. The factory was also well known for its blacking polish derived from animal charcoal, and its bone-based fertilizer, which was often referred to as “manure” in company promotional material. Lamb also produced gelatine; a review of Lamb products in the 1859 Globe observes that “perhaps some of our lady readers do not know that the delicate jelly which they receive from the confectioner for evening parties is made of the same material as the dark sticky glue which they may have chanced to see in a carpenter’s pot.”

Despite producing an array of products, glue appears to have been the product with which Peter R. Lamb and Co. was mostly publicly associated. Advertisements reveal that the company had a variety of types on offer, likely derived from different sources and intended for various purposes. One 1862 advertisement boasts that Lamb made glue “adapted to the use of piano-forte, carriage cabinet, and paper hanging manufacturers, rock oil refiners, printers, bookbinders, etc.” Lamb’s glue was not marketed for home use but for other industrial purposes, and was likely purchased by other Toronto companies, although advertisements suggest that some of the final products were shipped to other parts of the British Empire.
Early descriptions of Lamb’s factory and its products in the Toronto newspapers are positive. A February 1863 Globe article reports recent improvements and expansion on the site, and indicates that Lamb has received several patents for manufacturing techniques and design. In reviewing the company’s products, the same article notes that, “in the manufacture of glue, the greatest difficulty has been to get tanners to save in good state their cuttings or pieces, but gradually they are seeing the importance of properly preserving them, as a much better rate is realized therefore. Mr. Lamb’s glue is well known to the trade [on] account of its good quality.” After the factory was destroyed by a fire a few months later, a Globe editorial rejoiced at the news that it would be rebuilt, writing, “Mr. Lamb has done a great good in making use of the refuse of our kitchens—converting it into a most valuable manure, and also in supplying two very necessary articles of domestic economy, for which we were before obliged to send abroad.  We are glad to hear that he is soon to be at work again.”

Peter Lamb died in 1864, and control of the glue factory passed to his son Daniel, then only 22 years old. While Lamb products, particularly the fertilizers, continued to receive positive reviews, the factory soon came under close scrutiny in the Toronto press.

Turning animal parts into glue over high heat produces an intensely strong smell. In her 2010 thesis Imagined Futures and Unintended Consequences, Jennifer Bonnell writes that “the stench of dead animals and boiling flesh would have been palpable to residents as the area south and west of the factory became increasingly built up in the 1870s and ’80s.” In addition to the nearby Necropolis Cemetery and Toronto General Hospital (which was then located near Gerrard and Sumach), residential development had populated the area, some of it housing designed specifically for local factory workers. 
A notice in the Globe on July 3, 1878, described the smell coming as a “nuisance,” adding that “every window in [Toronto General] Hospital had to be closed by reason of it Monday night.” Responding to this allusion to the Lamb factory, A.T. McCord, one of the trustees of the Necropolis Cemetery, wrote to the Globe decrying the stench from the glue factory. “It is at times intolerable,” McCord wrote, “and drives away those who desire to visit the remains of the dead….Glue factories are an insufferable nuisance, and should never be permitted within the limits of any city or town.” The City of Toronto was also in the process of establishing what would become Riverdale Park, which McCord claimed “will be comparatively useless if this factory is permitted to remain.”
The Globe sympathized with McCord: “The line has been passed where what in former years was practically inoffensive, owing to a small population in the neighbourhood, becomes a serious grievance to a portion of the city now well populated.” The company responded to the complaints with letters in several of the Toronto dailies, noting that they had taken action to reduce odours after previous complaints, and claiming that this recent incident was an isolated one, brought on by being shut down over a long weekend. Lamb also mentioned the jobs it supplied to the area, and claimed that, despite concerns about the pollution, “there has been not one case of sickness attributed to our works, and in all the epidemics of cholera, small-pox, typhoid fever, etc. there has never been in a case in our immediate neighbourhood.”

Lamb’s letters prompted several rebuttals from the public. One letter to the Globe took issue with the claim that the recent incident was an isolated one, claiming, “not only is it necessary for the Hospital to close its windows, but also evening after evening this spring and summer, and for many springs and summers past, every house in the locality…has been almost hermetically sealed to prevent the disgusting odour from permeating them through and through.”
Another intense round of letters deploring the factory came in the summer of 1887. Again, Daniel Lamb wrote to the newspapers to defend the glue factory, this time suggesting that his factory was being unfairly blamed for smells emanating from other sources. In response, a letter in the Telegram noted that “we know the peculiar sickening odour of his factory too well to mistake any smell arising from a scavenger dump for it.” A Globe editorial concluded that “it appears quite evident that there never was a more favourable time in which to take action for the removal of the nuisance,” and suggested that the complainants “appoint a committee to confer with Messrs. Lamb as to the best means of procuring the removal.” Some meetings did indeed take place, but it appears that no action was taken.
The problem was effectively solved next spring. On May 20, 1888, a police patrolman noticed flames coming from the factory’s main five-storey building. A small crowd gathered to watch the fire, but scattered for safety when it learned that a magazine containing 30,000 pounds of gunpowder used by local industries was a mere 50 yards from the rear of the factory. Firefighters were able to keep the flames from reaching the magazine but were otherwise hampered in their efforts, as only one hydrant existed in the immediate area, and the majority of the works were lost. The Globe noted that the heat from the fire was “so great at times that three of the firemen had their rubber coats melted on their backs.” Also of note, the Telegram reported that “the horses about the factory were turned loose, but a pet bear on the premise had to be dragged out by a rope to a place of safety.”

Despite some early claims by Lamb that he would rebuild his glue works, the City resumed negotiations for the purchase of the site. Although the land was not acquired until several years later, the matter appears to have been effectively settled by the end of the 1888, when the Globe noted that Alderman (and future mayor) R.J. Fleming had been instrumental “in having the Lamb glue factory nuisance abolished.” The factory was not rebuilt, and a 1987 Toronto Star article indicates that bricks from the old glue factory building were used in the construction of houses on Hillcrest Park.
For Daniel Lamb, the fire proved somewhat convenient. Public pressure to remove the factory likely would have escalated, as efforts were already underway to tackle pollution and health concerns in the area by straightening the lower section of the Don River. Only in his 40s, Lamb retired from the glue business; having briefly served as an alderman a few years earlier, he soon returned to city politics, serving again as an alderman from 1892 to 1902. He is best known today, however, for helping to establish and advocating for the Riverdale Zoo, the immediate predecessor of the Toronto Zoo. When Daniel Lamb died in 1920, his obituaries hailed him as a dedicated politician and as the father of Toronto’s zoo; only passing mention was made of the notorious glue factory he once ran.
