Cancer is not something to be afraid of, it's something to attack...  If you get the right doctors and the right treatments, you can whip it."

Jack, Prostate Cancer Survivor








"When they mention Cancer, you are scared to death, but the first thing the doctor told me was that many men have cancer before they die, but very seldom do they die of prostate cancer."
Jack was treated at 21st Century Oncology with brachytherapy for prostate cancer.

Radiation Oncology
Radiation therapy is one of the most common treatments for cancer. It uses special equipment to aim high doses of radiation at cancer cells. This damages the cancer cells and causes them to die. It can be given alone or used with other treatments, such as surgery or chemotherapy.
Radiation therapy is usually a local treatment, targeting only the tumor. The goal of radiation treatment is to damage as many cancer cells as possible, with little harm to nearby healthy tissue.

Medical Oncology 
Medical Oncology uses chemotherapy, biological agents or other medications, such as targeted therapies and oral (in pill form), to treat cancer.
Chemotherapy can be used alone or as part of a cancer treatment plan that may also include radiation therapy, surgery, hormonal, or biological therapies. It may be used in an effort to cure the cancer, or to treat unpleasant symptoms the cancer is causing, such as pain or bleeding.
Depending on the type of treatment used, patients may receive treatment in a single day, several consecutive days, or continuously in an outpatient or inpatient setting. Your treatment could last minutes, hours, or days, depending on the specific cancer treatment plan.

From the beginning all through to the end, I felt like I mattered to all of them. They were so caring, I would have thought I was the only person they were treating."

Joyce, Breast Cancer Survivor







"From the beginning all through to the end, I felt like I mattered to all of them. They were so caring, I would have thought I was the only person they were treating.
We'd sit and joke... It was no longer like I was going there for radiation. It helped me get through, and the days went by."
Joyce was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) after an annual mammogram she almost put off revealed calcifications on her left breast. A biopsy revealed DCIS. Her cancer was so small, the surgeon was able to remove it during the biopsy procedure. After surgery, she opted for 35 courses of radiation over seven weeks to help reduce her risk of developing more invasive breast cancer in the future.

            In re 21st Century Oncology Holdings, Inc., Case No. 17-22770 (RDD) Jointly Administered
            United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (http://www.nysb.uscourts.gov )
        


Case Management Order: Please review the Final Order (I) Establishing Certain Notice, Case Management, and Administrative Procedures and (II) Granting Related Relief  [Docket No. 125] prior to filing documents in the 21st Century Oncology Holdings, Inc. bankruptcy.
    


General Information: 


On May 25, 2017, each of the 61 Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"). The cases (collectively, the “Bankruptcy Cases”) are jointly administered under Case No. 17-22770 before the Honorable Robert D. Drain in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court").            
Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code (specifically including, but not limited to, 11 U.S.C. § 362), a debtor is afforded certain protection against its creditors; the Bankruptcy Code prohibits creditors from taking certain actions related to debts that may have been owing prior to the commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases. If you believe that you might be a creditor of the Debtors based upon debts arising prior to May 25, 2017 and you are considering taking action based upon your status as a creditor, you may wish to seek legal advice. The staff of the Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court and the staff of Kurtzman Carson Consultants LLC are not permitted to give legal advice.For additional information, you may visit http://21co.restructuringinfo.com  or contact the 21st Century Oncology Holdings toll-free information line at (888) 251-2679 or, if calling from outside the United States or Canada, at (310) 751-2609.
