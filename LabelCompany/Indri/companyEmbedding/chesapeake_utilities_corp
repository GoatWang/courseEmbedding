View Program



The Chesapeake Cares program is an ongoing, monthly gathering that allows employees to relax and enjoy camaraderie with one another. Each month, Chesapeake hosts a fun “themed” event like outdoor games or summer BBQ, along with a planned activity ranging from rock wall climbing to a chili cook-off. We also take this time to acknowledge and celebrate important milestones such as birthdays, service anniversaries, promotions, educational advancements, retirement and other important developments in the lives of our employees and our Company.



We care about our employees’ well being. That’s why, in addition to a top-tier health care plan, we provide the Chesapeake Wellness program—including free screenings, brown-bag lunches, walking groups, weight-loss programs and more perks to help our employees achieve a balanced lifestyle.
