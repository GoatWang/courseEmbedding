Dear Calvin Darden,
Target’s new policy of allowing men to use women’s bathrooms and fitting rooms puts women and children at risk. It also violates individual privacy rights. Target has traded the “safety and privacy” of 99.7% of its customers for the “rights” of 0.3% of the population that self identifies as transgender persons. In doing so, you have also failed to protect the interests of your shareholders by inviting this boycott. My family will no longer shop at a store that puts “political correctness” ahead of the interests of the vast majority of its customers and shareholders.

Catch Him if You Can

AT the celebrity-packed wedding of Star Jones Reynolds, the television talk show host, last November, Calvin R. Darden Jr. seemed on top of his game. With his flashing smile and his perpetually trilling cellphones, Mr. Darden, a 30-year-old stockbroker, worked the reception area at the Waldorf-Astoria -- huddling with Dave Winfield, the former baseball star, bantering with Samuel L. Jackson, the actor, and introducing the actress Angela Bassett, a former client, to a friend of his.For Mr. Darden, who knew the groom, Al Scales Reynolds, from their early days as Merrill Lynch brokers, it was the same heady blend of celebrity glitz and Wall Street money that had fueled his rapid career ascent.But a month later, his fantasylike world of fast cars, basketball stars and high-stakes finance would shatter when the Manhattan district attorney announced his indictment, accusing him of stealing $4.1 million from some of his previous firms -- Smith Barney, Wachovia and AIC Ltd., one of Canada's largest mutual fund companies -- as well as an 87-year-old woman.According to the indictment, Mr. Darden used the money from the elderly investor to splurge on a multimillion-dollar home in Glen Cove, N.Y., to which he then added a $210,000 aquarium stocked with sharks and a movie theater that cost at least that much. If convicted, Mr. Darden, whose father is a top executive at United Parcel Service, could serve up to 50 years in state prison.

As if that were not enough, Mr. Darden is facing the possibility of two other lawsuits. One would be from Nelly, the hip-hop star, who invested $950,000 with Mr. Darden in 2003 that remains unaccounted for, according to people who have been briefed on the case. The other would be from Latrell Sprewell, the N.B.A. star, who says he gave Mr. Darden $300,000 to invest last fall after a chance meeting, six months after Mr. Darden had been fired from his last job. That sum, too, has not been returned, according to Mr. Sprewell's representative. Continue reading the main story

The story of Calvin Ramarro Darden Jr. seems outsized in nearly every way, from the accusations leveled to the personalities involved. In a civil case that preceded the indictment last year, Wachovia and AIC contended that Mr. Darden had forged documents and promised -- yet failed to deliver -- a client roster that included Shaquille O'Neal, Mr. Sprewell, Ms. Bassett and Mr. Jackson, as well as more than 21 senior U.P.S. executives. (According to Mrs. Reynolds, neither she nor her husband, who remains at Merrill, ever had financial relationships with Mr. Darden.)Mr. Darden, who turned himself in to the authorities and is free on $1 million bail -- put up by his father -- declined to comment for this article. His next scheduled court appearance is on Feb. 1, but he could be summoned to court as soon as this week, a person familiar with the case said. He is trying to replace his original lawyer with a higher-profile criminal attorney; among those he has spoken with is Benjamin Brafman, who has represented P. Diddy and Michael Jackson. "I don't see in Calvin a young man who woke up one morning and decided to be a criminal," said Mr. Brafman, who emphasized that he has yet to accept the case.NO one disputes that Mr. Darden started out with the best intentions to be a successful broker. But as his string of deceptions grew, people involved in the investigation say, Mr. Darden's actions took on the quality of a Ponzi scheme.As his business career began to fail, these people say, he would take money from one investor to pay off the next until the whole enterprise eventually collapsed. These people say that a $3 million loan from AIC, for example, went to pay off Cheryl James, another onetime client of Mr. Darden's and a member of the rap duo Salt-n-Pepa, and that the $300,000 from Mr. Sprewell went to the 87-year-old investor.Equally astonishing, though, is how large financial institutions could lend Mr. Darden, a broker with less that six years of experience and a below-average production record, $3.7 million in six months without closely examining his finances, his career history or whether the celebrities were actually his clients.Wall Street firms have been desperate to diversify their overwhelmingly white ranks and to tap into the lucrative niche of African-American entertainers. To that end, firms have engaged in bidding wars for brokers with ties to these celebrities.Mr. Darden was clearly caught up in the swirl: he was ambitious and savvy enough to drop a name like Shaq and take the millions thrown at him in return, but unable to cement enduring financial relationships.

Many aspects of the case remain unexplained. While the civil suit against Mr. Darden states that he never delivered his list of famous clients, Nelly and Mr. Sprewell gave him $1.25 million to invest that has not been returned.But the fallout has been brutal, reinforcing pernicious racial stereotypes, former associates say."Some people are so enthralled with celebrity they will do anything to get a piece of it," said Marvet Britto, a publicist who represents Mr. Sprewell and has represented Mrs. Reynolds and Ms. Bassett. "You can have enormous talent, but at some point your integrity needs to step in," Ms. Britto said. "Unfortunately, as African-Americans, there is always a microscope on what we do. Something like this sets us back."Mr. Darden stands a strapping 6-foot-3. His baby face and eager-to-please demeanor give him the quality of a high school valedictorian. An avid churchgoer, he prays each morning and night, his friends say, adding that he has donated more than $500,000 to charities.Still, his love for the high life is undisguised: besides his $2.85 million mansion, he owns a Lamborghini Murciélago, a Mercedes-Benz 600 and a Porsche Turbo.Those familiar with Mr. Darden's case liken him to Stephen Glass, the writer for The New Republic whose string of artfully conceived, yet mostly made-up, magazine articles resulted in a successful career as a journalist before his employers discovered his deceptions. Like Mr. Glass, they say, Mr. Darden has an almost desperate quality to tell people what they want to hear -- whether they are his parents, his employers or the homeless person on the street to whom he gave $500 in cash late last year.Mr. Darden's friends say that he was courted aggressively by financial firms since his days as a student at Morehouse College. He seemed an ideal candidate in many ways. His father, who had started as a loader at U.P.S. and had risen to senior vice president of its United States operations, had become one of the most well-regarded African-Americans in corporate America. (His father will retire this spring and is expected to step down from the U.P.S. board as well; he remains a director at Target and Coca-Cola Enterprises.)In 1998, after a year at Salomon Brothers, the junior Mr. Darden joined Merrill Lynch and aced the training program there, his friends say. But he had an unexceptional career at Merrill Lynch, those familiar with his employment there say, with the bulk of his business deriving from his father.Mr. Darden's career at Merrill shifted into overdrive when U.P.S. went public in November 1999. Suddenly, his father and his fellow executives, many of whom the younger Mr. Darden had known for years, became millionaires, raising his profile both inside and outside the firm. Recruiters saw in him a promising young broker with rich corporate and celebrity relationships, who could also lend a much-needed dash of racial diversity. They wined and dined him at New York's best restaurants and strip clubs.

ACCORDING to associates of Mr. Darden, the one name he mentioned more than others was Shaquille O'Neal. Such relationships gave him instant credibility in pitching his services as a money manager to African-American entertainers in fields from sports to music; among the clients he claimed to represent were the Neptunes, the hip-hop production team that represents Snoop Dogg.But people familiar with the case say he never had a business relationship with Mr. O'Neal. "Shaq was the carrot," said Ms. Britto, who said she met Mr. Darden through one of her clients, Cuttino Mobley, the N.B.A. player. "Cuttino said, 'this guy is amazing; he made Shaq millions of dollars.' Plus, Calvin was instantly legitimized by his father's name. That got him in the door."Mr. O'Neal's agent did not return calls asking for comment.Smith Barney won the derby, and Mr. Darden joined it in 2001, receiving what would be his first so-called sign-on bonus: a loan of $344,000. Such loans are common practice within the industry, used as bait to poach brokers from one firm to another. The sums are in effect a leveraged bonus: when the broker hits his agreed-upon production number, the loan is forgiven.This loan, according to people familiar with the case, would represent the first of Mr. Darden's deceptions. The indictment says that he misrepresented his production figures at Merrill when he secured the bonus.

In many recruiting situations, all a broker needs to do is show his suitor a piece of paper listing his client assets and annual commissions, and, because the firm is so eager to bring him on, it will make the loan after a perfunctory background check. That is exactly what Mr. Darden did in late 2002, when Wachovia Financial Services, the independent broker arm of Wachovia Securities, came knocking.Mr. Darden's career at Smith Barney had not taken off. Although his father signed up as an investor, Mr. Darden was less successful in persuading other U.P.S. executives to follow suit.A Smith Barney executive testified that Mr. Darden never managed more than $15 million in assets or produced more than $78,000 in commissions; his numbers put him in the lowest tier of Smith Barney's brokers.According to testimony by Wachovia executives, however, Mr. Darden submitted a printout from Smith Barney stating that he controlled more than $120 million in assets and generated commissions of close to $1 million a year, figures that would have put him in the top percentile of the firm's brokers based in New York. On the basis of that sheet, Mr. Darden was hired in April 2003 and given a $632,000 loan.But at Wachovia, as at Smith Barney, Mr. Darden made no immediate impact. His father followed him as a client, but that was about it. According to court papers, Mr. Darden generated $423 in commissions from April to September 2003, a far cry from the commission target of $1.2 million he was expected to meet in order to have his $632,000 loan forgiven.

Again, Mr. Darden's U.P.S. connections and ties with celebrities helped solve his problems. In the summer of 2003, Michael Lee-Chin, the founder of AIC, the Canadian mutual fund company, was looking to get into the high-net-worth market in the United States, with a specific focus on athletes and entertainers. According to Forbes magazine, Mr. Lee-Chin is worth more than $2 billion, making him one of the wealthiest African-Americans in North America.Running into Mr. Darden in New York, Mr. Lee-Chin, who knew of his father, embarked on a campaign to hire him. He invited him to his company's headquarters in Toronto, flying him to lunch in his personal Sikorsky helicopter.Well aware of Mr. Darden's passion for sports cars, he took him for a spin in his bright red Enzo Ferrari, a rare car that costs more than $1 million for those lucky enough to get a chance to buy one, according to friends of Mr. Darden.Mr. Darden was in awe of it all, according to his friends.He was also bowled over by Mr. Lee-Chin's rags-to-riches story and entrepreneurialism. Born poor in Jamaica, Mr. Lee-Chin emigrated to Ontario, where he worked as a bouncer before he began selling mutual funds in the 1970's, working out of a BMW that he could not afford. By the mid-1980s, he had bought AIC, and after that became one of Canada's richest men.There is a term in the hip-hop community that Mr. Darden's friends say aptly describes the attraction the two men had for each other: game recognizes game, meaning that each man saw a little bit of himself in the other.During this time, Mr. Darden formed his own independent company, called Black Umbrella, with the aim of investing in small enterprises, including a minority-owned condom company.And Mr. Darden did not undersell himself. According to court papers, he showed AIC the same position sheet from Smith Barney that he had submitted to Wachovia. This time, though, the sheet showed his assets under management to be $734 million. Again, according to court papers, he promised to deliver clients like Nelly, Mr. Sprewell, Mr. O'Neal and others. He also asked for a bigger sign-on loan -- $3.1 million -- which AIC wired to him on Oct. 17, 2003.Mr. Darden began to spend copious amounts of money. On Oct. 6, he closed on the expansive home in the wealthy community of Glen Cove. According to his real estate lawyer, he took out two separate mortgages for more than $2 million and put down $285,000 as a down payment. Two days later, he wired $1.1 million to his father, according to court papers.

As he was throwing around money, his debtors were gathering. In November, Wachovia sent him a letter asking him to repay in full the $632,000 or face legal action.And at AIC, as at Wachovia, the clients whom Mr. Darden had promised did not materialize. Nor did any executives from U.P.S., save for his father. Friends of Mr. Darden say AIC did not provide the necessary logistical support he needed to persuade his corporate clients to move their accounts to AIC.AIC's patience quickly wore thin: In January 2004, Mr. Lee-Chin asked Mr. Darden why he had not brought in any accounts, and Mr. Darden explained that his assistant had lost the transfer papers, court papers say. In March, with AIC demanding results, Mr. Darden flew to Toronto and promised to deliver 27 clients by the end of the month.AIC declined to wait. On March 23, Mr. Lee-Chin sent a letter to Mr. Darden terminating him and demanding repayment of the $3.1 million. Court documents show that Mr. Darden never shirked his debtors; he just told them that he could not pay.STILL, his mounting legal problems did not put a crimp in his spendthrift ways. In March, his travels took him from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where he made a $50,000 down payment on a 5,600-gallon saltwater aquarium, 22 feet long and 5 feet high. He also dropped $80,000 at an art gallery in New York.The aquarium was delivered in April and stocked with $50,000 worth of tropical fish and four black tip reef sharks, each three feet long and costing $2,500. The sharks, however, made quick work of the fish. It cost Mr. Darden $3,200 a month to service the tank and feed the sharks their prescribed diet of salmon and flounder filets.For a few months, Mr. Darden could enjoy the giant aquarium in his living room. People who know him say that amid all the stresses, it soothed him to be able to come home, collapse on one of his white leather couches and take in the aquatic spectacle. Throughout it all, he spoke to his mother and father twice a day, these people say.In June 2004, however, when a judge attached his assets, Mr. Darden found it increasingly hard to maintain his lifestyle. "I will suffer extreme personal and financial hardship if this attachment is granted," he said in an affidavit.But the court disagreed. Within months, Mr. Darden had to cut his expenses; among other things, he stopped paying the service that fed the fish and cleaned the tank. When two of his sharks died in October, Mr. Darden made a frantic phone call to the service, promising to pay them if they came to his house and removed the rotting sharks.

"They were lying there dead on the bottom and other fish were eating them," said Joseph Caparatta, the president of New York Aquarium Service, who came in to do the job. "It was just cartilage and fins -- they looked as if they were stripped by seagulls." Continue reading the main story
