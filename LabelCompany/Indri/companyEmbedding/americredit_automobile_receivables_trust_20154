                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Rates AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2015-4 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2015-4
    





November 12, 2015 11:55 AM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings and ratings Outlooks to 
      AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2015-4 (AMCAR 2015-4):
    

      --$175,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$100,000,000 class A-2A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$235,000,000 class A-2B notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$202,170,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$76,720,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$95,240,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$93,651,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22,219,000 class E notes 'NR'.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: The 2015-4 pool displays consistent credit 
      quality relative to recent pools based on the weight average (WA) Fair 
      Isaac Corp. (FICO) score and internal credit scores. Extended term 
      contracts (over 60-month loan terms) continue to account for the 
      majority of the pool at 93%. New vehicles total 51% of the pool, 
      consistent with recent AMCAR transactions.
    

      Consistent Credit Enhancement: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is 
      consistent with recent transactions. The reserve is 2.00% (nondeclining) 
      and initial overcollateralization (OC) is 5.50% growing to a target of 
      14.50% of the outstanding pool balance (less the required reserve amount 
      for the distributing period). Excess spread has decreased to approx. 
      8.00% per annum down from 8.23% in 2015-3.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on GM Financial's 
      managed portfolio and securitizations are stable and relatively low, 
      supported by the gradual economic recovery and stable used vehicle 
      values. The cumulative base case loss proxy for this pool is 11.30%.
    

      Solid Corporate Health: Fitch rates GM and GM Financial Company Inc. 
      'BBB-' with a Stable Rating Outlook. The recent corporate upgrade 
      reflects the ongoing fundamental improvement in the company's core 
      business over the past several years.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AFSI demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer as evidenced 
      by historical portfolio and securitization performance. Fitch deems AFSI 
      capable of adequately servicing 2015-4.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of GM Financial would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in Fitch taking negative rating actions 
      on the notes.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to AmeriCredit 
      Automobile Receivables Trust 2015-4 to increased credit losses over the 
      life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction 
      displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses. This 
      shows a potential downgrade of one or two categories under Fitch's 
      moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario, especially for the subordinate 
      bonds. The notes could experience downgrades of three or more rating 
      categories, potentially leading to distressed ratings (below 'Bsf') or 
      possibly default, under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deloitte and Touche, LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to 200 loans 
      from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its 
      analysis and the findings did not have an impact on our 
      analysis/conclusions. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received 
      by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained through the 
      link contained on the bottom of this rating action commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in the reports titled 'AmeriCredit Automobile 
      Receivables Trust 2015-4 -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those 
      of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions' dated June 12, 2015.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com' 
      or by clicking on the link.

Print



      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings and ratings Outlooks to 
      AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2015-4 (AMCAR 2015-4):
    

      --$175,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$100,000,000 class A-2A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$235,000,000 class A-2B notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$202,170,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$76,720,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$95,240,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$93,651,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22,219,000 class E notes 'NR'.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: The 2015-4 pool displays consistent credit 
      quality relative to recent pools based on the weight average (WA) Fair 
      Isaac Corp. (FICO) score and internal credit scores. Extended term 
      contracts (over 60-month loan terms) continue to account for the 
      majority of the pool at 93%. New vehicles total 51% of the pool, 
      consistent with recent AMCAR transactions.
    

      Consistent Credit Enhancement: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is 
      consistent with recent transactions. The reserve is 2.00% (nondeclining) 
      and initial overcollateralization (OC) is 5.50% growing to a target of 
      14.50% of the outstanding pool balance (less the required reserve amount 
      for the distributing period). Excess spread has decreased to approx. 
      8.00% per annum down from 8.23% in 2015-3.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on GM Financial's 
      managed portfolio and securitizations are stable and relatively low, 
      supported by the gradual economic recovery and stable used vehicle 
      values. The cumulative base case loss proxy for this pool is 11.30%.
    

      Solid Corporate Health: Fitch rates GM and GM Financial Company Inc. 
      'BBB-' with a Stable Rating Outlook. The recent corporate upgrade 
      reflects the ongoing fundamental improvement in the company's core 
      business over the past several years.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AFSI demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer as evidenced 
      by historical portfolio and securitization performance. Fitch deems AFSI 
      capable of adequately servicing 2015-4.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of GM Financial would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in Fitch taking negative rating actions 
      on the notes.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to AmeriCredit 
      Automobile Receivables Trust 2015-4 to increased credit losses over the 
      life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction 
      displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses. This 
      shows a potential downgrade of one or two categories under Fitch's 
      moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario, especially for the subordinate 
      bonds. The notes could experience downgrades of three or more rating 
      categories, potentially leading to distressed ratings (below 'Bsf') or 
      possibly default, under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deloitte and Touche, LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to 200 loans 
      from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its 
      analysis and the findings did not have an impact on our 
      analysis/conclusions. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received 
      by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained through the 
      link contained on the bottom of this rating action commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in the reports titled 'AmeriCredit Automobile 
      Receivables Trust 2015-4 -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those 
      of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions' dated June 12, 2015.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com'

      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to AmeriCredit Automobile 
      Receivables Trust 2015-3 (2015-3):
    

      --$230,000,000 Class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$199,740,000 Class A-2-A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$199,730,000 Class A-2-B notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$225,130,000 Class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$92,070,000 Class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$114,280,000 Class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$112,390,000 Class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: The 2015-3 pool displays consistent credit 
      quality relative to recent pools based on the weighted average (WA) Fair 
      Isaac Corp. (FICO) score and internal credit tiers. Extended term 
      contracts (over 60-month loan terms) continue to account for the 
      majority of the pool at 92%. New vehicles total 48% of the pool, 
      consistent with prior AMCAR transactions.
    

      Consistent Credit Enhancement (CE): The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard CE is consistent with recent 
      transactions. The reserve is 2.00% (nondeclining), and initial 
      overcollateralization (OC) is 5.50% growing to 14.50% target of the 
      outstanding pool balance (less the required reserve amount for the 
      distributing period). Excess spread has decreased to approximately 8% 
      per annum.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on GM Financial's 
      managed portfolio and securitizations are stable and relatively low, 
      supported by the gradual economic recovery and stable used vehicle 
      values. The cumulative base case loss proxy for this pool is 11.10%.
    

      Solid Corporate Health: Fitch rates GM and GM Financial Company Inc., 
      'BBB-'/Outlook Stable. The recent corporate upgrade reflects the ongoing 
      fundamental improvement in the company's core business over the past 
      several years.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AFSI demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization performance. Fitch 
      deems AFSI capable of adequately servicing 2015-3.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of GM Financial would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to each class of 
      AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2015-3 to increased losses over 
      the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that each class of 
      notes displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, with 
      some classes showing potential downgrades of up to one rating categories 
      under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. Some classes of 
      notes could experience downgrades of more than two rating categories 
      under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deliotte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence provided was on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation with respect to 200 sample loan contracts all selected 
      randomly and 20 automobile loan characteristics. Fitch considered this 
      information in its analysis and the findings did not have any impact on 
      our analysis. A copy of the ASB Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch 
      in connection with this transaction may be obtained through the link 
      contained on the bottom of the related rating action commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 
      2015-3 -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for 
      the asset class as detailed in Fitch's June 12, 2015 special report, 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions'.
