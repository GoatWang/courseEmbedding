Matthew Klein's interview on

Matthew Klein`s interview on

Awakening the Divine Radio.

















Discovery is the Father of change. Healing is a change that occurs through understanding in action. Understanding is willingness to see all things as yourself.
"You cannot solve a problem from the same consciousness that created it. You must learn to see the world anew."-Albert Einstein.
Peace and health of Mind and body are the natural Divine order.
"All illness begins in the Mind. Take care of the Mind first, by tracing and eliminating all wrong ideas and emotions... and think no more of it. With the removal of the cause the effect is bound to depart.  Man becomes what he believes himself to be."- Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj
Your body is intelligence in motion, vitality and love in action. Your cells are in a constant dialogue with one another as well as your Mind and its thoughts and your heart and its feelings. When a cell believes one thing and the heart another, a conflict is created.  
"An illness is a situation resulting from the maintenance of a conflict."  The Universe is an unlimited cycle of cause and effect.
Your Mind is your Universe. Your body is but a reflection of your Mind. To change your physical reality you must first learn to change your Mind.You are beyond your Mind.

TESTIMONIALS  .POSTURAL ASSESSMENT  
"Matthew has extensive knowledge of alignment and anatomy and was able to help me correct a painful sciatic problem (which 3 months of physical therapy did nothing for) in only a few minutes." 

L. K., Psychotherapist, NYC 
"I have gone to chiropractors, osteopaths, acupuncturists, and traditional western doctors for a variety of ailments from my back, neck, and most recently for knee pain. None of these other practitioners have been able to give me the relief that Matthew has achieved. Matthew does care about my recovery.  He is truly a gifted medical intuitive and mentor. That is a new and pleasant change from the other health practitioners I have gone to."

T.R., Long Beach, CA
.ENERGETIC BODY SCAN
"Matthew was able to quickly assess that the pain in my knee is due to bone fragments and improper posture.  He recognized that I walk off balance at my hip in order not to put too much weight on my knee.  This imbalance squashes my intestines giving me digestive problems that doctors could not diagnose.  He was right on target with everything-he spent 45 minutes hitting one "bull's-eye" after another.  And this is all without seeing any medical records or asking me any questions."Professor D. Seif, Brooklyn, NY

 By initialing this disclaimer I agree that I understand completely that "Menachem Matthew Klein" and "Absolute Present" healing make no claims to cure, treat or diagnose any Medical or Psychological conditions. The nature of Menachem's treatment is Spiritual and Energetic and is therefore not  a substitute for Medical Treatment.  I understand that by addressing the Spiritual and Mental nature of an issue, physical relief can be a byproduct, but is by no means guaranteed.  I understand that in the course of spiritual healing with Menachem any symptoms that may worsen cannot be attributed to Menachem's treatment.

Learn LiangongLIANGONG 
Banish or Dramatically improve long term injuries, chronic pain and postural dysfunctions.



Learn to realign and fortify your body mind and spirit.



 



Liangong is a comprehensive system of 54 movements that was designed and tested in in a clinical setting in China by Taoist Master and Chinese Physician Dr. Zhuang Yuanming.



 



Dynamic postures that encourage vertical, whole body symmetry are  combined with subtle internal motions that create centrifugal and centripital force, stretching and pulling out adhesions and scar tissue while at the same time strengthening using gravity.  



 



"As a student and teacher of Gong Fu, with over 32 years experience, I am still in awe of the precision and results experienced from the practice of Liangong. You will literally learn to adjust and align your body at will. Chronic conditions can sometimes be relieved in minutes using the right series of motions."

Klein products now locally available and supported from Brazil April 2, 2013 (Lincolnshire, IL) – Klein Tools http://www.kleintools.com, for professionals since 1857, has acquired Civitella & Cia Ltda (http://www.civitella.com.br), a privately-held tool and equipment manufacturer in Brazil. Civitella’s manufacturing and distribution center is based in São Paulo and serves customers throughout Brazil. Together, Klein Tools and Civitella can provide a full range of high-quality products for the electrical, construction, oil & gas and telecommunications industries. Klein Tools initiated its global expansion strategy with the establishment of a Mexican subsidiary, Herramientas Klein, S.A. De C.V. and subsequently acquired Australia-based Mumme Products. The Civitella acquisition builds on Klein Tools’ expansion plans. Brazil is the sixth-largest economy in the world. With its rapidly increasing middle class and already announced major infrastructure investments, Brazil provides a tremendous growth opportunity. By partnering with Civitella, South America’s largest premium grip manufacturer, Klein Tools will further its reach internationally.  “With common core values and business cultures emphasizing high-quality manufacturing as well as strong customer service, Civitella and Klein Tools are natural partners,” said Matthew Thomason, director of corporate development for Klein Tools. “The integration of these two companies creates a winning combination of global reach and national expertise, backed by a commitment to superior products and service.”  “With the upcoming Olympics and World Cup events, there is an enormous amount of infrastructure construction in Brazil,” states Giuliano Civitella, marketing director of Civitella & Cia. “We feel our customers will appreciate and benefit from the expanded product offering and industry knowledge that comes from partnering with North America's leading premium hand tool manufacturer.” “To successfully expand into Brazil, Klein Tools needs to have a physical presence in the country,” commented Tom Klein, president of Klein Tools.  “The acquisition of Civitella provides Klein Tools with a business operation in Brazil and demonstrates a long-term commitment to the Brazilian market. Civitella is an outstanding company with premium products, excellent service and well established clients that we are proud to join.” # # #About Civitella:  Founded in 1959, CIVITELLA & CIA LTDA is a family-operated Brazilian company originally focused on the development and manufacturing of tools and equipment for the telecommunications industry. Today, its primary market is in electric transmission with secondary markets in electric distribution, oil & gas, and telecommunications. For more information, visit www.civitella.com.br.About Klein Tools: Since 1857 Klein Tools, a family-owned and operated company, has been designing, developing and manufacturing premium-quality, professional-grade hand tools. The majority of Klein tools are manufactured in seven plants throughout the United States and are the number one choice among professional electricians and other tradespeople.
