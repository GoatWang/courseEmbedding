CLEARFIELD – Joseph B. Bower Jr., president and chief executive officer of CNB Financial Corp./CNB Bank, has been elected to the Pennsylvania Bankers Association (PA Bankers) Board of Directors.

The board of directors, which includes the association’s officers, policy committee chairs, group and deposit representatives, and at-large members will meet at least quarterly to determine the policies and administration of the Association. Members of the board are CEOs and senior level officers of its member banks.
“I am honored to join an organization that has been at the forefront for community banks and consumers in the state of Pennsylvania for such a long time,” said Bower.
“To be a part of the process that ensures that banks, businesses, consumers and government continue to work for the betterment of all involved, is a challenge that I am looking forward to.”
In this role as second vice chairman, Bower will serve on the PA Bankers’ personnel committee, audit budget and finance committee, attend banking industry and State Bankers Association meetings throughout the United States and represent the association at various events as called upon.
“We are excited and honored that Joe will be serving as an officer of the association and key member of our leadership team,” Duncan Campbell, PA Bankers president and CEO.
“Joe’s service and dedication to his country, community and bank will be a great asset to the Pennsylvania Bankers Association and our members.  Joe brings a wealth of experience and knowledge that will benefit the banking industry for years to come.”
Bower will serve a one-year term as second vice chairman. Afterward he will serve a one-year term as first vice chairman.
Bower joined CNB in 1997 as senior vice president and chief financial officer of the bank and treasurer of CNB Financial Corp. In 2003, Bower was promoted to executive vice president and chief operating officer of CNB Bank and secretary of CNB Financial Corp.
And, on Dec. 31, 2009, he was named president and CEO of CNB Bank and CNB Financial Corp.
Prior to his career in banking, Bower worked as a certified public accountant for the predecessor of ParenteBeard in Williamsport.
A native of Elimsport, Bower graduated from Montgomery Area High School in 1981. After graduation, he enlisted in the army, where he served for two-and-a-half years before he received an ROTC scholarship to become an officer.




He later graduated magna cum laude from Lycoming College with a Bachelor’s degree in accounting.  He then graduated from the U.S. Army Ordinance School Officer Basic Course.
Bower lives in Clearfield, with his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Kayleigh.  He also has three grown children, Britney Farren of Austin, Texas, Mindy Bower of Raleigh, NC and Ryan Bower with the U.S. Marines.
The Pennsylvania Bankers Association, located in Harrisburg, is the state’s leading banking trade association representing an expansive and diverse membership. The association offers extensive continuing education programs, government relations’ representation on behalf of the industry and provides numerous products and services for banks and their employees.

“I am honored to join an organization that has been at the forefront for community banks and consumers in the state of Pennsylvania for such a long time,” said Bower. “To be a part of the process that ensures that banks, businesses, consumers and government continue to work for the betterment of all involved is a challenge that I am looking forward to.”

“We are excited and honored that Joe will be serving as an officer of the association and key member of our leadership team,” said Duncan Campbell, PA Bankers president and CEO. “Joe’s service and dedication to his country, community and bank will be a great asset to the Pennsylvania Bankers Association and our members. Joe brings a wealth of experience and knowledge that will benefit the banking industry for years to come.”
