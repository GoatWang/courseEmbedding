For the XR 16 Driver, we worked with experts at Boeing to redefine what’s possible with club speed and aerodynamics. We created our most forgiving shape ever and Boeing made it fast with a re-engineered Speed Step.

We worked with aerodynamics experts at Boeing to reach a completely new threshold of club speed. We made this a high head speed design with low drag, and we did it by pinpointing the size and placement of our re-engineered Speed Step to save weight and add more speed. That’s how XR 16 sets the standard in aerodynamics for fast speed and more distance.

This driver is extremely forgiving, and that’s what happens when you develop a larger shape for MOI with a bigger footprint, and put in a Center of Gravity that’s lower and deeper. All this forgiveness leads to more speed at every impact location, which can add more distance for all golfers.


[mk_padding_divider size=”90″][mk_padding_divider size=”80″][mk_fancy_title color=”#218dca” size=”20″ font_weight=”bold” txt_transform=”uppercase” letter_spacing=”1″ margin_bottom=”0″ font_family=”none” align=”center”]Even More Ball Speed With A Faster Face[/mk_fancy_title]
	

We’ve stepped up our game with next generation R•MOTO Face Technology that’s up to 19% thinner and the body is lighter too, which leads to more ball speed across the face. We’ve taken this saved weight and redistributed it in the clubhead for even more MOI. When you combine the faster face with the extreme forgiveness in this driver, you can pick up a lot of ball speed, whether you hit it dead center, off the heel, or off the toe. Doesn’t matter.

For the XR 16 Fairway Wood, we’ve made huge leaps in our industry-leading technology that’s helped us become the #1 Fairway Wood in Golf. And we came away with a design that’s bigger, hotter, and more forgiving with our lightest crown for even more ball speed and distance.

The head shape is bigger, and we’ve built in an awesome combination of our highest MOI, low Center of Gravity, and highest COR in a fairway wood. The forgiveness from our lightest crown ever allows us to move the weight where we want it. This fairway wood looks easy to hit because it IS easy hit, and it’s highly versatile with a cambered sole for the shots that you want to play. It’s longer and more playable from all lies.

We’ve taken our industry-leading Forged Hyper Speed Face Cup and made it hotter and thinner for even more speed and a large sweet spot. Is that something you might be interested in? We thought so.


[mk_padding_divider size=”80″][mk_fancy_title color=”#218dca” size=”20″ font_weight=”bold” txt_transform=”uppercase” letter_spacing=”1″ margin_bottom=”0″ font_family=”none” align=”center”]An Aerodynamic Head Shape For Even More Speed [/mk_fancy_title]
	

We’ve improved the aerodynamics on this head shape to create even more head speed for you to go along with all that ball speed. By now you probably get that this fairway wood is designed for ultimate ball speed.

VIDEO: Watch GolfTEC’s exclusive tour of Callaway Headquarters with Amanda Balionis 
By Jon Levy
(via Callaway Golf)
From dud to stud.
Not that Callaway Golf was ever a dud, but the brand-defining Sir Isaac Newton caricature of their early years didn’t push a vibe as the cool kid on the block, either.
Fact was, however, it served as a great example of irony because the makers of the original Big Bertha driver of the early 1990s – the single product that all but changed the golf industry forever – were about as cool as it could get.
Still, the image of Ely Callaway Jr.’s brainchild had remained mostly unchanged from an image standpoint since 1982, even amid continued growth as a key industry trend-setter into the new century.  That was, until new SVP of Marketing, Harry Arnett, arrived in 2012.


A shift in strategy, a shift in perception
Arnett’s arrival came with no shortage of ideas to change the public’s perception of Callaway. Big ideas.
The company’s new strategy – to unofficially paraphrase – was going all in on using Callaway’s powerful voice to generate appealing content that taps into the passion golfers have for the game.
This was combined with a focus on attracting a younger, more diverse audience that reshaped how people saw Callaway product to understand that – to unofficially paraphrase again – “these aren’t your grandpa’s Callaways.”
It worked.
Armed with some incredible product to back up the new shift in marketing, Callaway became the No. 1 selling iron in 2015 and continues growing in a stagnant golf market as the world’s largest maker of golf clubs.
All or nothing
It’s likely Arnett and the top minds at Callaway knew that if they were going to dive into uncharted waters for an OEM, they’d have to have to go all in for their marketing-forward approach to work.
Considering unprecedented ideas like Callaway Live, Callaway Talks and other video multimedia series, as well as out-in-left-field ideas like the Links at PETCO Park (where Callaway turned an MLB stadium into a 9-hole golf course), is safe to say they’ve wholeheartedly done so.

Our behind-the-scenes look at Callaway Headquarters!

GolfTEC’s Dave Pauley and I recently received an exclusive, behind-the-scenes tour at Callaway Golf Headquarters in Carlsbad, Calif.
But not just any tour – we were escorted by Callaway Media Correspondent and freelance TV reporter, Amanda Balionis, who served as the consummate guide and host for our trip into the heart of the world’s largest golf club manufacturer.
So, what did we see?
Check out the fun video of our INCREDIBLE day below, and see just why Callaway Golf continues growing not only as the world’s largest golf OEM, but as the coolest kid of them all.

Runners and bikers can get their exercise in and around their neighborhood, but sometimes the weather doesn't cooperate. That's why having your own equipment makes it possible for you to exercise anytime day or night without worry about getting too hot or too cold. When buying exercise equipment, there are some things to know before making these big-ticket purchases. Treadmills One of the main considerations regarding a treadmill is how much space it takes up. A typical treadmill is about 6.5 feet long and 3 feet wide. For those with limited space, a treadmill that folds up is ideal, and some can fold up so thin that they fit under a bed when not in use. Another consider is stride length. Some treadmills have a long deck area that is dedicated to running while some have design cues that limit the running space. Treadmills should have a high degree of adjustability to be the most useful to you. This includes speeds that should range between 0 and 10 to 12 miles per hour and incline grades of around 10 to 15 percent. Some upgrades to look for on treadmills includes a dock for iPods or MP3 players, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity and USB ports. elliptical Trainers For a complete workout, consider an elliptical trainer. Similar to a treadmill, an elliptical trainer takes up a decent amount of space. Ellipticals usually run about 6 feet long but can be 7 feet long and between 2.5 and 4 feet wide. Because of the stepping action that is part of using an elliptical, you should know that elliptical trainers have step-up heights of between 6 and 25 inches above the floor. Having adjustable cushioned handgrips is a nice addition, making sure the user is comfortable, and allowing users of different heights to use it. For multi-taskers, you want to look for certain high-tech features for the equipment to have, such as USB ports, Web access, Bluetooth connectivity and the ability to link to a mobile device. The elliptical trainer should offer several programs to keep your workout interesting, such as hill climbing, long-distance climbs and one that targets a specific heart rate. Exercise Bikes Comfort is probably the most important consideration when choosing an exercise (or stationary) bicycle. The saddle should be padded and designed in a manner of your choosing. Some users like a wide saddle and some like a long, narrow saddle. Adjustable handlebars are features that also add to a user's comfort. Weight capacity is another consideration as some lightweight bikes only hold up to 250 pounds while some can hold users of 350 pounds or more. These bikes can be either belt-driven or chain-driven models and should be quiet when operating. Like elliptical machines and treadmills, stationary bikes have built-in programs that allow users to vary their workouts and keep them from becoming tedious. You also want to look for bikes that have heart-rate monitors, computer screens that display your statistics as you ride and adjustable tension levels. Rowing Machines Rowing machines come in four different styles: air, hydraulic, magnetic and water. All simulate the rowing action of a canoe or kayak in the water. Air rowing machines use flywheels (similar to elliptical machines) to create resistance. Hydraulic machines use cylinders filled with oil to create resistance. Magnets provide the resistance in magnetic rowing machines, and water pressure provides the resistance in water rowing machines. The seat should be comfortable and can either be a saddle or have a back connected to it. Some rowing machines are fixed while some are foldable, which is a consideration for those with limited space. One thing to note is that fixed machines tend to be more durable for frequent home use than folding rowers. Home Gyms Home gyms make it possible for users to perform many different weight resistance exercises all with one machine in a small space. Some home gyms use free weights   purchased separately   to provide resistance while others come with the weights attached to the gym. An adjustable bench that detaches is useful for doing several different exercises either seated or lying down. Some gyms that come preloaded with weights have the ability to add more, making them useful to people looking to increase their strength levels. There should be a number of accessories as well, such as a pull-down bar, lat bar, dumbbell and leg lift.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147332935, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Some outdoor sports, like climbing, only require a few items for you to grab before you begin partaking in them, while others, such as fishing or snow skiing, require some supplies for success. Whatever your outdoor passion is, you can find the item you need to enjoy yourself to the fullest. Save money at the same time by taking advantage of our Every Day Low Prices.CampingTo have a successful camping trip, there are certain pieces of equipment that are must-have items, and these include tents, sleeping bags, cooking equipment, lights, coolers and emergency preparedness items you'll want to pick up. Depending on how many people are camping, you can choose tents that sleep one to two people or ones that sleep seven or more people. Many of these tents only have an entrance and space to sleep on the ground, while some of the larger tents have enough room for you to stand up inside and even use cots instead of sleeping on the ground, sleeping bags keep you warm on cold nights especially if there's no fire and you're sleeping on the ground. Many have extra padding for comfort and zip up completely to keep you pest-free as you sleep.For overnight trips or longer, you definitely want to have a cooler or two for cold beverages and to keep fish fresh   if fishing was on your agenda. Whether you're eating what you brought or what you caught, some staples for camping cooking equipment include a portable gas or charcoal grill, cookware like cast-iron skillets or Dutch ovens and utensils like tongs and spatulas. You'll also want things to eat on and with, and you can buy camping dish packs or paper and plastic items that are biodegradable and easy to pack home with you. The most important emergency preparedness items you can have on hand include a flashlight or lantern, first aid kit and some basic tools, including a knife or multitool.FishingIf you're using live or cut bait, all you really need to go fishing is a rod and reel, some fishing line, some hooks and some weights and bobbers. Otherwise, you can get even more detailed and load up a tackle box with artificial baits, lures, spoons and attractants to bring in those fish. Rods vary in lengths; shorter rods are better for boat and pier fishing, and long poles are better suited for surf fishing. You can choose from spincast reels, which are basic reels for beginners; spinning reels, which are common for most kinds of fishing; and baitcasting reels, which are more advanced reels that work for bigger game fish. If you're doing your fishing on a party boat or other offshore vehicle and you're trolling for fish, a trolling reel is your best option.Fishing line is differentiated by type and the weight of fish it can hold. Monofilament line is the most common fishing line; it's made of nylon and has a single strand. Braided fishing line is similar to monofilament line, only it has two lines that are braided together to create more strength. Less common fishing lines include fluorocarbon, which is virtually invisible underwater; wire fishing line, which anglers use to catch mackerel, tuna and other fish with strong teeth; and fly fishing line, which is exclusively used for fly fishing and very lightweight. A basic bait or circle hook   which is a more curved version of a bait hook   will catch most fish, but there are others that work with certain types of fish. If you're fishing on the top of the water, you want to use bobbers to keep the bait near the top; weights work when you want to do bottom fishing for species like halibut.Other outdoor sportsCamping and fishing are two of the most popular outdoor activities, but they're nowhere near exhaustive when it comes to all the fun you can have with outside sports.Winter sports   The two most popular winter sports are skiing and snowboarding. Most of the things you need to do both are the same, such as the clothing and accessories like goggles, jackets and hats. Many people prefer snowboarding to skiing because you can do more tricks and the initial costs to get into the sport are much less than skiing. Another popular winter sport is ice skating, especially in locations with ponds and lakes that freeze over or have indoor skating rinks. All you really need is a pair of good-fitting ice skates and the motivation to get back up again as you're learning.Climbing and mountaineering   If you like climbing and aren't tackling steep rock wall faces, the basic equipment you need includes paracord (or rope), carabiners (both locking and non-locking), a harness, hand protection (like gloves), boots and a helmet. Paracord is rated by weight, so if you have three people climbing on the same rope, or two heavier people, you want to have paracord that's rated for 500 pounds or higher. The carabiners allow you to move up and down the rope as you climb without getting snagged. The harness is a safety device that can keep you from falling if you slip.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863632, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
