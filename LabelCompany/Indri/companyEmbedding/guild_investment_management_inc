Here are some of the reasons behind our recommendations:   The U.S. labor market is gaining some traction. Job creation is slowly turning up. We aren’t getting overexcited because once again the government is playing loose with statistics by failing to count those who have been unemployed for longer periods and classifying them as so-called “discouraged”. If we were to speak with those discouraged folks, we’re sure they would likely classify themselves as unemployed.   These individuals should be counted among the unemployed, and not...Read More →  Digital Currency “ICOs” and the Regulators/Date14 Jul 2017/Posted ByTim Shirata/Comment0/CategoriesBitcoinDigital Currency “ICOs” and the Regulators Two weeks ago, we wrote an introduction to digital currencies in which we pointed out how fast these new instruments have proliferated.

Bitcoin is in the news, once again driven by a price spike that makes speculators and would-be speculators start counting their unhatched chickens.  This time, the granddaddy digital currency has competitors — “altcoins” — which are also attracting attention.  Ripple, ether, dash, monero, and hundreds of other currencies have sprung up (as of this writing, a total of 888, with a combined market capitalization of about $115 billion).  Some promise technical refinements and improvements to the bitcoin system; others offer institutionally friendly features that leverage bitcoin-derived technologies for...Read More →  Chip Wars and the Race for Artificial Intelligence/Date16 Jun 2017/Posted ByTim Shirata/Comment0/CategoriesTechnologyChip Wars and the Race for Artificial Intelligence Radical transformation is coming in many fields of human culture and endeavor.  No, this is not just boilerplate praise of ongoing incremental technological innovation.  The only way to grasp the magnitude and significance of these incipient changes is to imagine yourself living during the time when steam and then electricity opened continents, shrank the world, destroyed and rebuilt entire societies and ways of life.  With that imaginative endeavor we can at least get a glimpse of the transformation that has already begun, but has not yet become fully apparent.

Saudi Arabia has troubles.  Our regular readers have heard us discuss them often, especially in the wake of the dramatic decline in the price of oil between mid-2014 and the beginning of 2016. Countries whose economy relies predominantly on oil and other hydrocarbons are often said to suffer from “the resource curse” — a tendency for that reliance to stunt the development of other productive sectors of the economy.  This leads to an economy which is highly vulnerable to price shocks in the commodity on which it depends.  It also tends to...Read More →  Social Commerce, Live Streaming, and Virtual Goods:  Chinese E-Commerce Innovation Pulls Ahead/Date02 Jun 2017/Posted ByTim Shirata/Comment0/CategoriesAsia, China, TechnologySocial Commerce, Live Streaming, and Virtual Goods: Chinese E-Commerce Innovation Pulls Ahead Since its economy began to be opened in earnest in the 1990s, China has undergone a transformation so radical that it defies easy description — one we’ve often written about in these pages. From many perspectives, the Chinese achievement is astonishing: China’s embrace of major elements of market-based economics has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, even though it has been accompanied by a political regime that shuns Western notions of democratic governance.

Have these events caused the buying opportunity that investors have wanted?  Within three days, the first phase of the French elections will have occurred; the final round will conclude on May 7.  The U.K. has scheduled an election, but they have already agreed on Brexit, and this...Read More →  India Makes Progress Under Modi’s Steady Hand/Date13 Apr 2017/Posted ByTim Shirata/Comment0/CategoriesChina, IndiaIndia Makes Progress Under Modi’s Steady Hand Back in September, we gave readers a rundown of the big digital strategy of India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi — an effort which will be critical in the unleashing of Indian economic growth and India’s rise on the world economic stage in coming years.   It is difficult to describe the depth and intractability of the problems Modi is confronting.  Though India and China are both developing Asian economies with powerful economic growth trends, they are completely different beasts.  One major difference is the nature of central power.

The change that is underway in U.S. markets is no run-of-the-mill, short-term shift.  This is a sea-change — not business as usual.  We’re referring to the end of a thirty-year period during which interest rates were falling — a thirty-year bull market for bonds.  We believe that looking back, we’ll see that long-term U.S. government bonds peaked in July, 2016 — the end of an epic rally.

The Great Recession was not a standard textbook economic contraction, and the recovery has not been an ordinary recovery — neither in its structure, nor in its strength, nor in its length. The recovery has been weak and prolonged, partly because the downturn was driven by a severe financial crisis rather than the dynamics of a typical economic cycle; and partly because the policy response to the crisis put significant additional tax and regulatory burdens...Read More →  March 02, 2017/Date02 Mar 2017/Posted ByTim Shirata/Comment0/CategoriesGlobal EconomyGlobal Stocks Stocks are attractive in the U.S. and several other countries, driven by improvements in economic performance.

The Oroville Dam is, in a sense, a crowning achievement of California’s 20th-century growth and the politicians and hydrological engineers who made it possible. The years after World War 2 saw a boom in California’s economy and its urban population, and by the 1950s, plans were being made to construct a system of dams, levees, and aqueducts that would control devastating...Read More →  February 16, 2017/Date16 Feb 2017/Posted ByTim Shirata/Comment0/CategoriesThe U.S.Looking Back on 2017 Let’s take a step back and imagine that 2017 is almost over — and that we’re looking back from a standpoint in late December.

Background Information:


Guild Investment Management, Inc. »
Guild Investment Management is a global value manager. The firm seeks to identify opportunities for capital appreciation and income through investments in: the stocks of US and non-US companies; ETFs and index shares of US markets and commodities;  foreign currency deposits or forwards; and other foreign currency denominated securities including bonds, cash equivalents, index shares or derivatives instruments.Guild examines the global markets to identify macroeconomic and sociopolitical or demographic changes or trends that provide opportunities in countries, sectors, industries and companies. Once they have identified these opportunities, Guild employs bottom-up, fundamental research on target companies to determine their potential for appreciation.  The firm prefers to invest in the stocks of undervalued companies that are operating in growing industries. They look for companies that are trading at p/e ratios below their expected percentage rate of earnings growth. Guild looks for companies that have fallen in price or are under appreciated due to a stock market decline that leaves the stock of a growing company cheaper, on a statistical basis, than its mean valuation over the past 10 years. They also look for an industry group or sector-related decline in price due to cyclical reasons or due to market perceptions about a specific industry that they believe may be temporary.Guild provides active portfolio management. The firm does not believe that portfolios must be fully invested in stocks at all times. They look for opportunities with favorable reward/risk parameters. The firm employs an opportunistic style that is responsive to changes in the markets. Guild continuously reevaluates the asset allocations and positions in their portfolios. When opportunities arise, Guild utilizes foreign currencies and foreign currency denominated cash equivalents to earn income and to capture appreciation from foreign exchange trends. The firm also looks for investments that offer the potential to appreciate 50% in 12 months and that have a perceived reward/risk potential of 3 to 1.
