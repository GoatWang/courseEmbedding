Life and career[edit]
Korologos was born in Chatham, New Jersey,[1] the daughter of Marie (née Koellhoffer) and Edward Joseph Lauenstein, a manufacturer representative for a wartime ammunitions company.[2] She was educated at Saint Patrick School, the Academy of Saint Elizabeth, Marymount College, Tarrytown of Fordham University, where she spent a year studying abroad at the University of London, and earned an EMBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1988.
She has received honorary degrees from Marymount, the University of Rhode Island, the New England School of Law, the College of Saint Elizabeth, and Tri-State University.
Before becoming the Labor Secretary, she had served as the Under Secretary of the Department of the Interior and as Under Secretary of the Department of the Treasury.
From 1990 to 1995, she was head of the Federal City Council, a group of business, civic, education, and other leaders interested in economic development in Washington, D.C.[3] From 1996 to 2000, she was the chair of the Aspen Institute. From 2000 to 2006, she was on the board of directors of Microsoft, from which she resigned due to "increasing demands on her time from other professional and personal commitments".[4]
In 2008, she was on the District of Columbia Republican presidential primary ballot as a John McCain delegate.
She currently serves as a member of the board of directors of several companies, including Fannie Mae, Vulcan Materials Company, and the Kellogg Company, and from 2004-2009 served as chairman of the RAND Corporation board of trustees.[5]
Previously, her married name was Dore, and in 1975 she married the political commentator and former Jesuit priest John McLaughlin, after having served as his campaign manager in his 1970 failed challenge against Senator John Orlando Pastore for his Rhode Island seat in the United States Senate. They divorced in 1992.
She now is married to Tom C. Korologos, former U.S. Ambassador to Belgium.
Ann Korologos Gallery[edit]
Korologos is an avid art collector, and in 2007 she purchased the Basalt Gallery, of Basalt, Colorado. In June 2009, the gallery outgrew its old location and moved to a larger space downtown. She changed the name to the Ann Korologos Gallery at the same time. The gallery exhibits art of the American West, and artists influenced by the West, including Veryl Goodnight, Gordon Gund, Michael Kessler (artist), Tom Korologos, Tomas Lasansky (son of famed artist Mauricio Lasansky), Dean Mitchell, Dan Namingha, Lloyd Schermer, Peggy Judy and Dan Young.

Korologos to Retire From Microsoft Board


August 25, 2006

			|				







REDMOND, Wash. — Aug. 25, 2006 — Microsoft Corp. today announced that Ann McLaughlin Korologos, chairman of the RAND Corp. board of trustees, has decided not to seek re-election to Microsoft’s board of directors at the company’s 2006 shareholder meeting. 
Korologos’ decision was prompted by increasing demands on her time from other professional and personal commitments. She is completing her seventh year on the Microsoft board, having joined the group in January 2000. 
“Ann has been an outstanding member of the Microsoft board,” said Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer at Microsoft. “Her contributions and guidance have been invaluable, and we appreciate her seven years of service.”
“I have thoroughly enjoyed my tenure on the board of this worldwide, highly respected company; however, new responsibilities and opportunities force me reluctantly not to seek re-election,” Korologos said.
Other members of the Microsoft board of directors are Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft; Ballmer; James I. Cash Jr., Ph.D., former James E. Robison professor at the Harvard Business School; Dina Dublon, former chief financial officer of JPMorgan Chase; Raymond V. Gilmartin, former chairman, president and chief executive officer of Merck & Co. Inc.; David F. Marquardt, general partner at August Capital; Charles H. Noski, former vice chairman of AT&T Corp.; Dr. Helmut Panke, chairman of the board of management at BMW AG; and Jon Shirley, former president and chief operating officer of Microsoft. 
Founded in 1975, Microsoft (Nasdaq “MSFT”) is the worldwide leader in software, services and solutions that help people and businesses realize their full potential.
