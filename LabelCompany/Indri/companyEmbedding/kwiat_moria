KWIAT FINE CERAMIC JEWELRY
At Kwiat, our promise is to continually re-imagine all that can be done with diamonds. In keeping with this rich tradition of innovation, we introduce our first jewelry designs made by combining two of the most enduring materials: diamonds and fine ceramic.
Much like diamonds, fine ceramic made from zirconia is exceptionally durable. Kwiat fine ceramic is the highest quality available and achieves a superior luster that never fades. Smooth, sensual and exquisite – this material is as pleasing to the hand as it is to the eye.

We design distinct cell products to target a variety of indications, and anticipate that a pipeline of differentiated products and indications will allow us to target large global markets. We explore new partnerships to advance our clinical development programs, while maintaining our strong commitment to current corporate, academic and government collaborations.
