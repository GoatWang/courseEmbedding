ABO-101 for MPS III B and ABO-102 for MPS III A (Sanfilippo syndrome)
Abeona is developing next generation adeno-associated viral (AAV)-based gene therapies for MPS III (Sanfilippo syndrome), which involves a one-time delivery of a normal copy of the defective gene to cells of the central nervous system with the aim of reversing the effects of the genetic errors that cause the disease.
After a single dose in Sanfilippo preclinical models, ABO-101 and ABO-102 induced cells in the CNS and peripheral organs to produce the missing enzymes and help repair damage caused to the cells. Preclinical in vivo efficacy studies in Sanfilippo syndrome have demonstrated functional benefits that remain for months after treatment. A single dose of AB0-101 or AB0-102 significantly restored normal cell and organ function, corrected cognitive defects that remained months after drug administration, increased neuromuscular control and increased the lifespan of animals with MPS III over 100% one year after treatment compared to untreated control animals. These results are consistent with studies from several laboratories suggesting AAV treatment could potentially benefit patients with for Sanfilippo Syndrome Type A and B, respectively. In addition, safety studies conducted in animal models of Sanfilippo syndromes have demonstrated that delivery of AB0-101 or AB0-102 are well tolerated with minimal side effects.
ABO-201 for Juvenile Batten Disease (JBD)
ABO-201 (scAAV9 CLN3) is an AAV-based gene therapy which has shown promising preclinical efficacy in delivery of a normal copy of the defective CLN3 gene to cells of the central nervous system with the aim of reversing the effects of the genetic errors that cause juvenile Batten disease.
Juvenile Batten disease (JBD) is a rare, fatal, autosomal recessive (inherited) disorder of the nervous system that typically begins in children between 4 and 8 years of age. Often the first noticeable sign of JBD is vision impairment, which tends to progress rapidly and eventually result in blindness. As the disease progresses, children experience the loss of previously acquired skills (developmental regression). This progression usually begins with the loss of the ability to speak in complete sentences. Children then lose motor skills, such as the ability to walk or sit. They also develop movement abnormalities that include rigidity or stiffness, slow or diminished movements (hypokinesia), and stooped posture. Beginning in mid- to late childhood, affected children may have recurrent seizures (epilepsy), heart problems, behavioral problems, and difficulty sleeping. Life expectancy is greatly reduced. Most people with juvenile Batten disease live into their twenties or thirties. As yet, no specific treatment is known that can halt or reverse the symptoms of juvenile Batten disease.
ABO-301 for Fanconi Anemia (FA)
ABO-301 (AAV LK19 FANCC) is an AAV-based gene therapy which has shown promising preclinical efficacy in delivery of a normal copy of the defective gene to cells of the hematopoietic or blood system with the aim of reversing the effects of the genetic errors that cause Fanconi anemia. 
The major function of bone marrow is to produce new blood cells. In FA, a DNA mutation renders the FANCC gene nonfunctional. Loss of FANCC causes patient skeletal abnormalities and leads to bone marrow failure. Fanconi Anemia patients also have much higher rates of hematological diseases, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or tumors of the head, neck, skin, gastrointestinal system, or genital tract. The likelihood of developing one of these cancers in people with Fanconi anemia is between 10 and 30 percent. Aside from bone marrow transplantation (BMT) there are no specific treatments known that can halt or reverse the symptoms of FA. Reparing fibroblast cells in FA patients with a functional FANCC gene is the focus of our AAV-based gene therapy approach.
Using a novel CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 (CRISPR associated protein 9) system, researchers used a protein-RNA complex composed of an enzyme known as Cas9 bound to a guide RNA molecule that has been designed to recognize a particular DNA sequence. The RNA molecules guide the Cas9 complex to the location in the genome that requires repair. CRISPR-Cas9 uniquely enables surgically efficient knock-out, knock-down or selective editing of defective genes in the context of their natural promoters, unlocking the potential to treat both recessive and dominant forms of genetic diseases. Most importantly, this approach has the potential to allow safer, more precise gene modification for a wide range of rare blood diseases.
EB-101 for RDEB (Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa)EB-101 is an ex vivo gene therapy for the treatment of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) that has demonstrated promising Phase 1 results in adult RDEB patients.  EB-201 for EB (Epidermolysis Bullosa) EB-201 (AAV DJ Col7A1) pre-clinical candidate uses a novel (homologous recombination), targeted AAV-meditated gene editing and delivery approach to correct gene mutations in skin cells (Keratinocytes).  The AAV DJ delivers native COL7A1 gene fragment into effected cells and induces homologous recombination to fix genomic copy of mutated gene.  This novel approach possess relatively high recombination frequency and low off-target changes, and doesn’t require introduction of bacterial proteins (like Cas9) to stimulate recombination so potentially can be used for gene editing in vivo PLASMA THERAPIES

About Abeona Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: ABEO) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases.    Developing therapies for rare disease requires new approaches and strong collaboration between researchers, industry, regulators and patient groups.  Abeona was forged from the company’s close collaborations with key stakeholders all dedicated to transforming new biotechnology insights into breakthrough treatments for rare diseases.
 Our MissionAdvancing treatments for rare diseases…Working together to find a cure.
A rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States.  There are nearly 7,000 rare diseases, which may involve chronic illness, disability, and often, premature death.  More than 25 million Americans and 30 million Europeans have one.
While rare diseases can affect any age group, about 50% of people affected are children (15 million); and rare diseases account for 35% of deaths in the first year of life.
These rare diseases are often poorly diagnosed, very complex, and have no treatment or not very effective treatment—over 95% of rare diseases do not have a single FDA or EMA approved drug treatment.  However, most rare diseases are often caused by changes in genes—80% are genetic in origin and can present at any stage of life.
We believe emerging insights in genetics and advances in biotechnology, as well as new approaches and collaboration between researchers, industry, regulators and patient groups, provide significant opportunities to develop breakthrough treatments for rare diseases.
 Product PipelineAbeona Therapeutics is working on a number of exciting technologies and products aimed at curing various rare diseases. Find out what we’re working on and what we have planned.

I was attracted to pediatric neurology when I was a medical student and realized that I had an intellectual interest in the brain but enjoyed the challenges and rewards of caring for children. As a movement disorders specialist, I care for children with a variety of conditions that impair voluntary movements, cause involuntary movements, or both. Such conditions include dystonia, chorea, tics, myoclonus, tremor, stereotypies, parkinsonism, and combinations of these such as may occur in conditions like cerebral palsy. In addition to movement disorders, neurodegenerative diseases are also a focus of my clinical practice.
 My research has been focused on understanding brain mechanisms involved in the control of movement or where disorders cause involuntary movements. The research involves neurophysiology, direct measurement of movement abnormalities, rating scales, and longitudinal assessments over the course of development and disease. More recently my work as included clinical trials and studies of factors that impact the function of children with movement disorders.
 In addition to my clinical practice and research, I direct the Child Neurology residency at the University of Rochester. I serve on a number of advisory boards including the Tourette Syndrome Association, the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation, the Batten Disease Support and Research Association, the NINDS Board of Scientific Counselors, and the Pediatric Advisory Committee of the FDA.

Abeona Therapeutics Receives Guidance from FDA to Commence Pivotal Phase 3 for EB-101 Gene Therapy for Patients with Epidermolysis Bullosa




















July 18, 2017 08:05 ET

 Pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial is planned to commence in early 2018 EB-101 gene therapy for patients with Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) has demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial EB-101 has received Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations in the USA and Orphan Drug Designation in the EU NEW YORK and CLEVELAND, July  18, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq:ABEO), a leading clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel gene therapies for life-threatening rare diseases, announced today guidance from a recent Type-C meeting with the FDA which has recommended accelerating the EB-101 program into a pivotal Phase 3 trial.  The Company continues to engage the FDA on the final Phase 3 clinical trial design, planned to commence early 2018, and will provide an update on the program in the coming months. “The FDA guidance is an important milestone in our clinical development plan for EB-101, and we are pleased to be moving forward into a registrational Phase 3 clinical study in 2018. Abeona is committed to advancing innovative gene therapies that address the unmet needs of patients suffering with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, a devastating rare skin disease.  We are grateful that the FDA has recognized EB-101 as a rare disease product that addresses the underlying disease pathology to offer significant therapeutic benefit for RDEB patients, and we look forward to the collective work ahead in advancing this therapy,” stated Timothy J. Miller, Ph.D., President and CEO of Abeona Therapeutics Inc. Abeona’s EB-101 product is an autologous, ex-vivo gene therapy in which the COL7A1 gene is inserted into a patient’s own skin cells (keratinocytes) for the treatment of the underlying disease in Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa. The EB-101 program has been granted Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Orphan Drug Designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). “EB Research Partnership (EBRP), along with EB Medical Research Foundation, are honored to have helped support EB-101 development by the dedicated researchers at Stanford University. Their tireless efforts in combination with Abeona’s leadership is driving real progress in the RDEB patient community.  EBRP is encouraged by clinical results to date and looks forward to realizing the promise of EB-101 in addressing the devastating effects on RDEB patients’ quality of life and disease burden,” stated Alexander Silver, co-founder and chairman EB Research Partnership. About EB-101 Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial:In the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, EB-101 was administered to non-healing chronic wounds on each subject which were assessed for wound healing at predefined time points up to several years to date. The primary endpoints of the clinical trial assessed safety and evaluated wound healing after EB-101 administration compared to control untreated wounds. Secondary endpoints included expression of collagen C7 and restoration of anchoring fibrils at three and six months post-administration. Clinical data were presented at the Society of Investigative Dermatology (SID) conference by Stanford collaborators, and demonstrated that EB-101 treated wounds were significantly healed >50% for more than two years post-administration. The data included:  Wound healing, defined as >50% closure after EB-101 administration, was observed in: -- 100% (36/36 treated wounds, n=6 subjects) at 3 months;-- 89% (32/36 treated wounds, n=6 subjects) at 6 months;-- 83% (20/24 treated wounds, n=4 subjects) at 12 months;-- 88% (21/24 treated wounds, n=4 subjects) at 24 months;-- 100% (6/6 treated wounds, n=1 subject) at 36 months post-administration. Collagen VII (C7) expression: C7 and morphologically normal NC2 reactive anchoring fibrils were observed in EB-101 treated wounds up to two years post-administration.  Importantly, data from a supportive natural history study of 1,436 wounds from 128 patients with RDEB, established by Stanford and EBCare Registry, were also presented at the conference and to the FDA. Notably, 13 RDEB patients with a total of 15 chronic wounds were treated with an allograft product, including Apligraf® and Dermagraft®. Of these wounds treated with allografts, only 7% (1/15 treated wounds) remained healed after 12 weeks, and 0% (0/15 treated wounds) remained healed after 24 weeks. This is a meaningful finding of the natural history study, as there are no approved therapies for RDEB patients that demonstrate significant wound closure after two months post-application. About Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) and Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB): EB is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body. The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, pseudosyndactyly and a shortened life span. Typically, wounds on patients with RDEB, also known as "butterfly skin" syndrome, can remain unhealed for months to years due to the inability of the skin to stay attached to the underlying dermis and can cover a large percentage of the body.  Patients with RDEB lack functional type VII collagen owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that produces C7 collagen and is the main component of anchoring fibrils, the “velcro” that helps stabilize the skin on the basement membrane. EB patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms. Along with the life-threatening infectious complications associated with this disorder, many individuals often develop an aggressive form of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). About EB Research Partnership (EBRP): EBRP is the largest 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to funding research aimed at treating and ultimately curing Epidermolysis Bullosa, a group of devastating and life-threatening skin disorders that affect children from birth. EBRP uses a sustainable philanthropic model via venture philanthropy for all of its research commitments. To learn more, please visit www.ebresearch.org.

ABO-101 for MPS III B and ABO-102 for MPS III A (Sanfilippo syndrome)
Abeona is developing next generation adeno-associated viral (AAV)-based gene therapies for MPS III (Sanfilippo syndrome), which involves a one-time delivery of a normal copy of the defective gene to cells of the central nervous system with the aim of reversing the effects of the genetic errors that cause the disease.
After a single dose in Sanfilippo preclinical models, ABO-101 and ABO-102 induced cells in the CNS and peripheral organs to produce the missing enzymes and help repair damage caused to the cells. Preclinical in vivo efficacy studies in Sanfilippo syndrome have demonstrated functional benefits that remain for months after treatment. A single dose of AB0-101 or AB0-102 significantly restored normal cell and organ function, corrected cognitive defects that remained months after drug administration, increased neuromuscular control and increased the lifespan of animals with MPS III over 100% one year after treatment compared to untreated control animals. These results are consistent with studies from several laboratories suggesting AAV treatment could potentially benefit patients with for Sanfilippo Syndrome Type A and B, respectively. In addition, safety studies conducted in animal models of Sanfilippo syndromes have demonstrated that delivery of AB0-101 or AB0-102 are well tolerated with minimal side effects.
ABO-201 for Juvenile Batten Disease (JBD)
ABO-201 (scAAV9 CLN3) is an AAV-based gene therapy which has shown promising preclinical efficacy in delivery of a normal copy of the defective CLN3 gene to cells of the central nervous system with the aim of reversing the effects of the genetic errors that cause juvenile Batten disease.
Juvenile Batten disease (JBD) is a rare, fatal, autosomal recessive (inherited) disorder of the nervous system that typically begins in children between 4 and 8 years of age. Often the first noticeable sign of JBD is vision impairment, which tends to progress rapidly and eventually result in blindness. As the disease progresses, children experience the loss of previously acquired skills (developmental regression). This progression usually begins with the loss of the ability to speak in complete sentences. Children then lose motor skills, such as the ability to walk or sit. They also develop movement abnormalities that include rigidity or stiffness, slow or diminished movements (hypokinesia), and stooped posture. Beginning in mid- to late childhood, affected children may have recurrent seizures (epilepsy), heart problems, behavioral problems, and difficulty sleeping. Life expectancy is greatly reduced. Most people with juvenile Batten disease live into their twenties or thirties. As yet, no specific treatment is known that can halt or reverse the symptoms of juvenile Batten disease.
ABO-301 for Fanconi Anemia (FA)
ABO-301 (AAV LK19 FANCC) is an AAV-based gene therapy which has shown promising preclinical efficacy in delivery of a normal copy of the defective gene to cells of the hematopoietic or blood system with the aim of reversing the effects of the genetic errors that cause Fanconi anemia. 
The major function of bone marrow is to produce new blood cells. In FA, a DNA mutation renders the FANCC gene nonfunctional. Loss of FANCC causes patient skeletal abnormalities and leads to bone marrow failure. Fanconi Anemia patients also have much higher rates of hematological diseases, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or tumors of the head, neck, skin, gastrointestinal system, or genital tract. The likelihood of developing one of these cancers in people with Fanconi anemia is between 10 and 30 percent. Aside from bone marrow transplantation (BMT) there are no specific treatments known that can halt or reverse the symptoms of FA. Reparing fibroblast cells in FA patients with a functional FANCC gene is the focus of our AAV-based gene therapy approach.
Using a novel CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 (CRISPR associated protein 9) system, researchers used a protein-RNA complex composed of an enzyme known as Cas9 bound to a guide RNA molecule that has been designed to recognize a particular DNA sequence. The RNA molecules guide the Cas9 complex to the location in the genome that requires repair. CRISPR-Cas9 uniquely enables surgically efficient knock-out, knock-down or selective editing of defective genes in the context of their natural promoters, unlocking the potential to treat both recessive and dominant forms of genetic diseases. Most importantly, this approach has the potential to allow safer, more precise gene modification for a wide range of rare blood diseases.
EB-101 for RDEB (Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa)EB-101 is an ex vivo gene therapy for the treatment of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) that has demonstrated promising Phase 1 results in adult RDEB patients.  EB-201 for EB (Epidermolysis Bullosa) EB-201 (AAV DJ Col7A1) pre-clinical candidate uses a novel (homologous recombination), targeted AAV-meditated gene editing and delivery approach to correct gene mutations in skin cells (Keratinocytes).  The AAV DJ delivers native COL7A1 gene fragment into effected cells and induces homologous recombination to fix genomic copy of mutated gene.  This novel approach possess relatively high recombination frequency and low off-target changes, and doesn’t require introduction of bacterial proteins (like Cas9) to stimulate recombination so potentially can be used for gene editing in vivo PLASMA THERAPIES

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Abeona Therapeutics Receives FDA Orphan Drug Designation for EB-101 Gene Therapy Product for Patients with Epidermolysis Bullosa




















May 25, 2017 08:05 ET

 | Source: Abeona Therapeutics Inc






Abeona’s Third Gene Therapy Program to Receive FDA Orphan Designation EB-101 Gene Therapy for Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) has Demonstrated Promising Efficacy and Safety in Ongoing Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial  NEW YORK and CLEVELAND, May  25, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq:ABEO), a leading clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel gene therapies for life-threatening rare diseases, announced today that the FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for Abeona’s EB-101 gene therapy program for patients with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), including recessive dystrophic epidermolysis  bullosa (RDEB), which are life-threatening genetic skin disorders characterized by skin blisters and erosions that cover the body. “Abeona is committed to advancing innovative gene therapies that address the unmet needs of patients suffering with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, a devastating rare skin disease.  We are grateful that the FDA has recognized EB-101 as a rare disease product that may offer a significant therapeutic benefit for patients with dystrophic forms of epidermolysis bullosa, including RDEB.  EB-101 is Abeona’s third gene therapy program to be granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA, an important value driver for the program as it provides seven years of market exclusivity from similar medicines for similar indications,” stated Timothy J. Miller, Ph.D., President & CEO of Abeona Therapeutics Inc. Typically, wounds on patients with RDEB, also known as "butterfly skin" syndrome, can remain unhealed for months to years due to the inability of the skin to stay attached to the underlying dermis and can cover a large percentage of the body.  In the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, EB-101 was administered to non-healing chronic wounds on each subject and assessed for wound healing at predefined time points over years. The primary endpoints of the clinical trial assess safety and evaluate wound healing after EB-101 administration compared to control untreated wounds. Secondary endpoints include expression of collagen C7 and restoration of anchoring fibrils at three and six months post-administration. Clinical data were recently presented at the Society of Investigative Dermatology (SID) conference by Stanford collaborators, and demonstrated that EB-101 treated wounds were significantly healed >50% for more than 2 years post-administration. The data showed: Wound healing, defined as >50% closure after EB-101 administration, was observed in:--100% (36/36 treated wounds, n=6 subjects) at 3 months, --89% (32/36 treated wounds, n=6 subjects) at 6 months,--83% (20/24 treated wounds, n=4 subjects) at 12 months, --88% (21/24 treated wounds, n=4 subjects) at 24 months,--100% (6/6 treated wounds, n=1 subject) at 36 months post-administration. Collagen VII (C7) expression: C7 and morphologically normal NC2 reactive anchoring fibrils – the “zipper” that holds skin onto the underlying tissue and the primary deficit in RDEB patients – were observed in EB-101 treated wounds up to two years post administration. Importantly, data from a supportive natural history study of 1,436 wounds from 128 patients with RDEB, established by Stanford and EBCare Registry, were also presented at the conference. Notably, in the natural history study, 13 RDEB patients with a total of 15 chronic wounds were treated with an allograft product, including Apligraf® and Dermagraft®. Of these wounds treated with allografts, only 7% (1/15 treated wounds) remained healed after 12 weeks, and 0% (0/15 treated wounds) remained healed after 24 weeks. This is a meaningful finding of the natural history study, as there are no approved therapies for RDEB patients that demonstrate significant wound closure after two months post-application. About Orphan Drug Designation: Under the FDA’s Orphan Drug Designation program, orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA to novel drugs or biologics that treat rare diseases or conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S. The designation allows the drug developer to be eligible for a seven-year period of U.S. marketing exclusivity upon approval of the drug, as well as tax credits for clinical research costs, the ability to apply for annual grant funding, clinical trial design assistance, and the waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) filing fees. About EB-101: EB-101 is an autologous, ex-vivo gene therapy in which COL7A1 is transduced into autologous keratinocytes for the treatment of Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB). RDEB is a subtype of an inherited genetic skin disorder characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with RDEB lack functional type VII collagen owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils, which stabilize the dermal-epidermal basement membrane. Investigators at Stanford University are enrolling patients in the ongoing Phase 2 portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT01263379). The EB-101 program has also been granted orphan drug designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). About Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB): EB is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body. The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with RDEB lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis. EB patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms. Along with the life-threatening infectious complications associated with this disorder, many individuals often develop an aggressive form of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). About Abeona: Abeona Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases. Abeona's lead programs include ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH), an adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) and EB-101 (gene-corrected skin grafts) for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB).  Abeona is also developing ABO-101 (AAV-NAGLU) for Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB), ABO-201 (AAV-CLN3) gene therapy for juvenile Batten disease (JNCL), ABO-202 (AAV-CLN1) for treatment of infantile Batten disease (INCL), EB-201 for epidermolysis bullosa (EB), ABO-301 (AAV-FANCC) for Fanconi anemia (FA) disorder and ABO-302 using a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing approach to gene therapy for rare blood diseases. In addition, Abeona has a plasma-based protein therapy pipeline, including SDF Alpha™ (alpha-1 protease inhibitor) for inherited COPD, using its proprietary SDF™ (Salt Diafiltration) ethanol-free process.

Abeona Therapeutics Inc. Receives Guidance from FDA to Commence Phase III Epidermolysis Bullosa Trial
Jul 18 17
Abeona Therapeutics Inc. has announced guidance from a recent type-C meeting with the FDA which has recommended accelerating the EB-101 program into a pivotal Phase III trial. EB-101 gene therapy for patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). The company continues to engage the FDA on the final Phase III clinical trial design, planned to commence early 2018, and will provide an update on the program in the coming months. Abeona's EB-101 product is an autologous, ex-vivo gene therapy in which the COL7A1 gene is inserted into a patient's own skin cells (keratinocytes) for the treatment of the underlying disease in Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa. The EB-101 program has been granted Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations from the FDA and Orphan Drug Designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Abeona Therapeutics Inc. announced that the FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for Abeona’s ABO-201 program (AAV-CLN3), the AAV-based single intravenous gene therapy program for juvenile Batten disease, a fatal lysosomal storage disease of the nervous system caused by autosomal-recessive mutations in the CLN3 gene.


Abeona Therapeutics Inc. Receives Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for EB-101
May 30 17
Abeona Therapeutics Inc. announced that the FDA has granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for Abeona’s EB-101 gene therapy program for patients with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), including recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), which are life-threatening genetic skin disorders characterized by skin blisters and erosions that cover the body. Typically, wounds on patients with RDEB, also known as "butterfly skin" syndrome, can remain unhealed for months to years due to the inability of the skin to stay to the underlying dermis and can cover a large percentage of the body. In the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial, EB-101 was administered to non-healing chronic wounds on each subject and assessed for wound healing at predefined time points over years. The primary endpoints of the clinical trial assess safety and evaluate wound healing after EB-101 administration compared to control untreated wounds. Secondary endpoints include expression of collagen C7 and restoration of anchoring fibrils at three and six months post-administration. EB-101 Gene Therapy Program: clinical data were recently presented at the Society of Investigative Dermatology (SID) conference by the company’s Stanford University collaborators, and demonstrated that EB-101 treated wounds were significantly healed >50% for more than 2 years post-administration. EB-101 demonstrated significant wound healing (defined as greater than 50% healed) in 100% of treated wounds (36/36) at 3 months; 89% (32/36) at 6 months, 83% (20/24) at 12 months, 88% (21/24) at 24 months and 100% (6/6) at 36 months post-administration. Collagen VII (C7) expression: C7 and morphologically normal NC2 reactive anchoring fibrils " the “zipper” that holds skin onto the underlying tissue and the primary deficit in RDEB patients " were observed in EB-101 treated wounds up to two years post administration. Supportive Natural History Study: A natural history study of 1,436 wounds from 128 patients with RDEB, established by Stanford and EBCare Registry, were also presented at the conference. Notably, in the natural history study, 13 RDEB patients with a total of 15 chronic wounds were treated with an allograft product, including Apligraf® and Dermagraft®. Of these wounds treated with allografts, only 7% (1/15 treated wounds) remained healed after 12 weeks, and 0% (0/15 treated wounds) remained healed after 24 weeks. This is a meaningful finding of the natural history study, as there are no approved therapies for RDEB patients that demonstrate significant wound closure after two months post-application. The EB-101 program has also been granted orphan drug designation from FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Abeona's Third Gene Therapy Program to Receive FDA Orphan Designation


EB-101 Gene Therapy for Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) has Demonstrated Promising Efficacy and Safety in Ongoing Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial 

NEW YORK and CLEVELAND, May  25, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abeona Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq:ABEO), a leading clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel gene therapies for life-threatening rare diseases, announced today that the FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for Abeona's EB-101 gene therapy program for patients with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), including recessive dystrophic epidermolysis  bullosa (RDEB), which are life-threatening genetic skin disorders characterized by skin blisters and erosions that cover the body.
"Abeona is committed to advancing innovative gene therapies that address the unmet needs of patients suffering with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, a devastating rare skin disease.  We are grateful that the FDA has recognized EB-101 as a rare disease product that may offer a significant therapeutic benefit for patients with dystrophic forms of epidermolysis bullosa, including RDEB.  EB-101 is Abeona's third gene therapy program to be granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA, an important value driver for the program as it provides seven years of market exclusivity from similar medicines for similar indications," stated Timothy J. Miller, Ph.D., President & CEO of Abeona Therapeutics Inc.
Typically, wounds on patients with RDEB, also known as "butterfly skin" syndrome, can remain unhealed for months to years due to the inability of the skin to stay attached to the underlying dermis and can cover a large percentage of the body.  In the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, EB-101 was administered to non-healing chronic wounds on each subject and assessed for wound healing at predefined time points over years. The primary endpoints of the clinical trial assess safety and evaluate wound healing after EB-101 administration compared to control untreated wounds. Secondary endpoints include expression of collagen C7 and restoration of anchoring fibrils at three and six months post-administration.
Clinical data were recently presented at the Society of Investigative Dermatology (SID) conference by Stanford collaborators, and demonstrated that EB-101 treated wounds were significantly healed >50% for more than 2 years post-administration. The data showed:

Wound healing, defined as >50% closure after EB-101 administration, was observed in:

        --100% (36/36 treated wounds, n=6 subjects) at 3 months, --89% (32/36 treated wounds, n=6 subjects) at 6 months,--83% (20/24 treated wounds, n=4 subjects) at 12 months, --88% (21/24 treated wounds, n=4 subjects) at 24 months,--100% (6/6 treated wounds, n=1 subject) at 36 months post-administration.

Collagen VII (C7) expression: C7 and morphologically normal NC2 reactive anchoring fibrils - the "zipper" that holds skin onto the underlying tissue and the primary deficit in RDEB patients - were observed in EB-101 treated wounds up to two years post administration.
Importantly, data from a supportive natural history study of 1,436 wounds from 128 patients with RDEB, established by Stanford and EBCare Registry, were also presented at the conference. Notably, in the natural history study, 13 RDEB patients with a total of 15 chronic wounds were treated with an allograft product, including Apligraf® and Dermagraft®. Of these wounds treated with allografts, only 7% (1/15 treated wounds) remained healed after 12 weeks, and 0% (0/15 treated wounds) remained healed after 24 weeks. This is a meaningful finding of the natural history study, as there are no approved therapies for RDEB patients that demonstrate significant wound closure after two months post-application.
About Orphan Drug Designation: Under the FDA's Orphan Drug Designation program, orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA to novel drugs or biologics that treat rare diseases or conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S. The designation allows the drug developer to be eligible for a seven-year period of U.S. marketing exclusivity upon approval of the drug, as well as tax credits for clinical research costs, the ability to apply for annual grant funding, clinical trial design assistance, and the waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) filing fees.
About EB-101: EB-101 is an autologous, ex-vivo gene therapy in which COL7A1 is transduced into autologous keratinocytes for the treatment of Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB). RDEB is a subtype of an inherited genetic skin disorder characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with RDEB lack functional type VII collagen owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils, which stabilize the dermal-epidermal basement membrane. Investigators at Stanford University are enrolling patients in the ongoing Phase 2 portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT01263379). The EB-101 program has also been granted orphan drug designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
About Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB): EB is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body. The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with RDEB lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis. EB patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms. Along with the life-threatening infectious complications associated with this disorder, many individuals often develop an aggressive form of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
About Abeona: Abeona Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases. Abeona's lead programs include ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH), an adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) and EB-101 (gene-corrected skin grafts) for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB).  Abeona is also developing ABO-101 (AAV-NAGLU) for Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB), ABO-201 (AAV-CLN3) gene therapy for juvenile Batten disease (JNCL), ABO-202 (AAV-CLN1) for treatment of infantile Batten disease (INCL), EB-201 for epidermolysis bullosa (EB), ABO-301 (AAV-FANCC) for Fanconi anemia (FA) disorder and ABO-302 using a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing approach to gene therapy for rare blood diseases. In addition, Abeona has a plasma-based protein therapy pipeline, including SDF Alpha™ (alpha-1 protease inhibitor) for inherited COPD, using its proprietary SDF™ (Salt Diafiltration) ethanol-free process.
