360 Sports, Inc.For Athletes -  By Athletes
We understand that today, more than ever, professional athletes face a variety of challenges both on and off the field, the court, and the ice. We also know that professional athletes who have retired, as well as former college athletes, often have a strong, heartfelt need to stay connected with sports but finding opportunities, especially careers in the business of sports, are simply scarce. 
360 Sports, Inc. is attempting to change the playing field for all professional athletes by providing the products and services that will meet their unique needs during their athletic career. 
Following their professional, or collegiate, athletic careers, 360 Sports, Inc. offers retired pros and post-college athletes opportunities to mentor our up-and-coming athlete members, and, or become a 360 Sports Agency franchise owner, team owner, agent, consultant, or employee.
360 Sports, Inc. was founded by athletes, will succeed and scale by athletes, all for the purpose of helping athletes develop, and the shared love of sports.















Agency
360 Sports Agency plans to launch local sports franchises strategically throughout the US.
Each agency will be staffed by retired pro athletes, and licensed sports agents, who will market the services of the pro athletes, who will offer free mentoring programs to youth and amateurs in return. Both athletes and agents earn revenue from the sales of 360 Sports products and services sold within their agency.






Leagues & Events
360 Sports Leagues are made up of independently owned 360 Sports sports clubs with a league for each age group in more than ten different sports per location.
The cost for playing in 3 leagues per year is approximately the same as playing on 1 travel team per year.
In order to facilitate scaling our leagues, we are in the process of raising capital to build multi-sports complexes, nationwide.






Real Estate
The leadership team of 360 Sports, Inc. has extensive experience in real estate development and construction.
360 Sports Real Estate Division was created to acquire, capitalize, and develop our agencies and future sports complexes as well as provide investment opportunities for our athletes.

The Company is engaged in the amateur sports administration market in which
there are many competitors. Some competitors focus on the top of the pyramid,
for example; sports federations, leagues and clubs providing data storage and
manipulation for the league and club management. Other competitors focus on
providing more specific services at the lower end of the pyramid to amateur
sports teams. These services typically include player sign up, scheduling and
communications, data collection, storage and data manipulation. The services
are typically provided using downloadable native applications. There are some
companies that address both markets the leagues and providing federations,
leagues and clubs and teams.

The most significant competitors are Teamsnap and Sportsngn. They are both well
funded organization competing in the same marketplace. Their products are well
designed and popular in the market place. However, from a user’s prospective,
their services are not as easy to identify. We intend to compete by making our
products easy to use and understand. Our prices and services are clearly listed
on the website. They do not have to search and go through a series of hoops to
find out the actual cost of our services. Our main competitors have large
marketing budgets and will be difficult to compete with Competitors to a lesser
extent are Eteamz and Sportslogic. Their product is equally concentrated on
larger sports organizations leagues and clubs versus teams. These companies also
provide a mix of applications that are similar to ours. They are also well
capitalized with large marketing budgets and will be difficult to compete with.

Other competitors. There is a myriad of small companies that provide some or all
or more of the services we provide.

Overall there is a barrier to entry to this market due to the amount of time and
effort required to develop a robust software platform and design and create
native applications.

Team 360 Sports Inc technology was designed and developed in house. The founders
have previously designed, developed and operated a SaaS company (Software as a
Service) that provided sports administration services to leagues with over
250,000 players. That previous experience provides the company with a
competitive advantage. The current technology is a cloud based web application.
The Company is in the process of further improving developing IOS and Android
Native applications for smart devices. We are located on the Internet at
www.team360apps.com.

   2016. Its customers were some of the largest leagues and clubs in North
   America representing over 300,000 players.
 
3. Maximizing profits by selling services online. The company plans to make the
   entire sales funnel automated and online therefore maximizing profit margins.
 
4. Maintaining low overhead costs. The company plans to outsource certain front
   end design, and coding/programming services overseen by the company CTO. An 
   offshore call center will be used for customer service.
           
5. Effective Marketing. We have an outstanding product and to "tell" the
   amateur sports world about it we will utilize, print, media, content, and
   online marketing.
 
6. E web and mobile applications with powerful time saving tools. In amateur 
   sports, volunteers are coaches and administrators who make up the backbone of
   the organization. The biggest challenge facing them is the time commitments 
   required to do their job effectively while maintaining regular jobs, family

360 Sports Leagues & Events Are you tired of the high cost and low quality of participating in youth and amateur sports leagues?  We are too. Our goal is to launch sports leagues for athletes of all ages, nationwide.  In order to do this we plan to build 200 sports complexes where everyone is welcome to practice and compete. 

                                                Learn more

Our mission is to be the global leader in athlete development
Our system is designed to provide free mentoring, marketing and advisement services to athletes of all ages by creating income streams for active and retired athletes who mentor youth and amateurs.














360 Sports, Inc.For Athletes -  By Athletes
We understand that today, more than ever, professional athletes face a variety of challenges both on and off the field, the court, and the ice. We also know that professional athletes who have retired, as well as former college athletes, often have a strong, heartfelt need to stay connected with sports but finding opportunities, especially careers in the business of sports, are simply scarce. 
360 Sports, Inc. is attempting to change the playing field for all professional athletes by providing the products and services that will meet their unique needs during their athletic career. 
Following their professional, or collegiate, athletic careers, 360 Sports, Inc. offers retired pros and post-college athletes opportunities to mentor our up-and-coming athlete members, and, or become a 360 Sports Agency franchise owner, team owner, agent, consultant, or employee.
360 Sports, Inc. was founded by athletes, will succeed and scale by athletes, all for the purpose of helping athletes develop, and the shared love of sports.















Agency
360 Sports Agency plans to launch local sports franchises strategically throughout the US.
Each agency will be staffed by retired pro athletes, and licensed sports agents, who will market the services of the pro athletes, who will offer free mentoring programs to youth and amateurs in return. Both athletes and agents earn revenue from the sales of 360 Sports products and services sold within their agency.






Leagues & Events
360 Sports Leagues are made up of independently owned 360 Sports sports clubs with a league for each age group in more than ten different sports per location.
The cost for playing in 3 leagues per year is approximately the same as playing on 1 travel team per year.
In order to facilitate scaling our leagues, we are in the process of raising capital to build multi-sports complexes, nationwide.






Real Estate
The leadership team of 360 Sports, Inc. has extensive experience in real estate development and construction.
360 Sports Real Estate Division was created to acquire, capitalize, and develop our agencies and future sports complexes as well as provide investment opportunities for our athletes.






Wealth Management
360 Sports Wealth Division is solving many problems associated with professional athletes and sports organizations.
We are planning to launch a financial advisory and insurance division using the latest technology and at the lowest costs for athletes.
