Article
2 Comments


Gary J. Gruber has been promoted president and chief operating officer of Great American Insurance Co., effective January 1, 2017.  Gruber will become the seventeenth president in Great American’s 145-year history, assuming this title from Donald D. Larson, who recently announced that he will retire effective March 10, 2017, after more than 43 years of service to the company.
Larson has held the position of president and chief operating officer for the past seven years, and was the senior reporting officer within Great American’s P&C Group for the past 18 years.
Gruber has served as executive vice president for the Great American Property and Casualty Insurance Group since 2010. He currently serves as a member of Great American’s board of directors and recently served on the board of directors of National Interstate Corp., prior to its merger with Great American Insurance Co. last year.
Donald Larson
Gary Gruber
Gruber started his career with Great American Insurance Co. in 1977, and served in both financial and operational roles within the organization. He held various positions including vice president of Accounting, controller, and senior vice president  and treasurer. In 1995, Gruber moved into an operational reporting officer role. While in this role, he worked directly with the majority of the group’s specialty property and casualty businesses as well as and with other units including Reinsurance and Predictive Analytics.

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."
