Pros:  I really like the way that it works with Salesforce.  I just click on any number and it will dail it immediately!
Cons:  Sometimes the system needs to be reset by restarting the services.  I'm not sure why this happens but my IT guys take care of it.
Overall:  Integration with Salesforce!

Customer Support








Comments:  While reading Dale Carnegie's "How to Win Friends and Influence People" I took away two important lessons.
1. You should talk in terms of the other person's interest. 
2. Make them feel important, and do it sincerely.
Callinize allows me to do just that with every customer that calls. As soon as my phone rings I know exactly who is calling and what interactions have recently taken place. This affords me the ability to greet them with the sweetest word in their vocabulary, their name. I can hear the smile on my customer's face when I greet them with a "Good morning John!" and immediately pick up where we left off.
Callinize is a must have for anyone that wants to give their customers the VIP experience!

Comments:  One of the biggest challenges in using any CRM is the manual effort and mental discipline required to log calls. By integrating Callinize with the CRM, we no longer have to think about it. Calls are automatically associated with accounts of record or the opportunity to create a new account is provided. This functionality is going to become second nature, just like using voice mail or e-mail!

Comments:  Operating in a fast paced sales environment, we are constantly looking for ways to become more efficient. Callinize has allowed us to do just that with increased call volume, faster navigation through SalesForce, improved customer service through better task management, and increased quality of note taking on calls. Our sales reps are able to identify clients in our data base much quicker as they call in using the Callinize pop-up window. Reps now call through a higher volume prospects utilizing the click to dial feature and can simultaneously log the call activity while setting a follow up task which saves us lots of time. In an industry where time is your enemy, this application is priceless. The Callinize customer service is very responsive which is hard to come by these days. I would recommend this solution to anyone looking to improve efficiency and increase productivity.

Comments:  Callinize should be an automatic add-on when purchasing Salesforce. IHG being the largest franchise hotel company on the plant depends on my team to support 4,800+ hotels globally. We needed a more effective way to recognize/identify our callers, and efficient way to pre-populate case screens. 
Callinize has been a great solution and their team has worked diligently with us to ensure our needs are met. The administrator website it straightforward and simple to use. Callinize provides better in-depth analytics than even our current Avaya phone system. The statistics are tied directly into Salesforce, so I¿m able to create customized call reports around the Callinize data easily via standard Salesforce Reporting.
I would highly recommend Callinize for your company.

Comments:  Our inside sales team was difficult to track and wasting tons of time manually dialing phone numbers. With Callinize, now they click to call on any phone numbers inside of Salesforce and are instantly connected to the prospects they want to talk to. Since all of their calls are logged and Callinize provides awesome reporting functionality, I can always go in to my dashboard and see how my sales team is doing on any given day. Anyone interested in closing more deals and getting better call reporting in place needs to get Callinize up and running!
