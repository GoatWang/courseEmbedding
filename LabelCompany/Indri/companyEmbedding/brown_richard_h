GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREA Poetic For Sociology: Toward A Logic Of Discovery For The Human Sciencesby Brown, Richard H.For too long, argues Richard Harvey Brown, social scientists have felt forced to choose between imitating science's empirical methodology and impersonating a romantic notion of art, the methods of which are seen as primarily a matter of intuition, interpretation, and opinion. Developing the idea of a &quot;cognitive aesthetic,&quot; Brown shows how both science and art as well as the human studies that stand between them'depend on metaphoric thinking as their &quot;logic of discovery&quot; and may be assessed in terms of such aesthetic criteria of adequacy as economy, elegance, originality, scope, congruence, and form.By recognizing this &quot;aesthetic&quot; common ground between science and art, Brown demonstrates that a fusion can be achieved within the human sciences of these two principal ideals of knowledge the scientific or positivist one and the artistic or intuitive one. A path, then, is opened for creating a knowledge of ourselves and society which is at once objectiveand subjective, at once valid scientifically and significantly humane.MethodologyCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
