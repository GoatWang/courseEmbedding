Bio









Biography of Governor James “Jim” S. Gilmore, III
Jim Gilmore served as the 68th governor of Virginia from 1998 to 2002. Gilmore gained national prominence during his campaign and governorship by advocating conservative policies that directly addressed the daily concerns of working men and women in every Virginia community.
Gilmore’s legacy of nearly two decades of public service is highlighted by significant policy work on the major issues of taxation, homeland security and by a determined focus to bring people together from different beliefs and backgrounds.
Lifelong Call to Public Service
Born and raised in Richmond, Gilmore first won elected office as a local prosecutor in Henrico County, Virginia in 1987. He then went on to win statewide elected office in 1993 as Attorney General of Virginia. Then-Attorney General Gilmore led a nationwide effort to stop arson against African-American churches. He also took actions to improve consumer protection, cut down on Medicaid fraud and enhance public safety.
In addition to serving as the 68th Governor of Virginia, Gilmore has chaired two prominent Congressional advisory panels: one created to assess the nation’s readiness to combat domestic terrorism, which led to the creation of the National Council on Readiness and Preparedness; the other panel created to study taxation on internet commerce, which the panel opposed.
In December 2009, Gilmore joined the Free Congress Foundation as President and CEO, succeeding the late Paul Weyrich, who founded FCF more than three decades earlier and was the driving force until his death in 2008. Gilmore served as a FCF board member from 2006 until his election by the FCF board to be the organization’s president and CEO.
Improved Education, Technology and Transportation
Guided by his lifelong belief in smaller government, free markets and individual initiative, Gilmore’s gubernatorial administration successfully championed improvements in Virginia’s education and transportation systems and laid the foundation for the state’s leadership as a national technology center. He accomplished these goals while carrying out his signature campaign promise to phase out property taxes paid by Virginians on their cars and trucks and to add 4,000 new teachers to the public school system.
Under his guidance, Virginia created its first cabinet-level position to oversee an aggressive move into technology and developed the nation’s first Internet policy well before the full potential of the web was realized. His economic development policies also led to the creation of than 200,000 jobs during his term.
A Record of Reaching Out
Gilmore’s administration also worked vigorously to break down racial and regional divisions that have plagued Virginia’s past. He viewed this as a critical step to ensure that Virginia was prepared for “the sum of challenges” that he believed the state would face in the 21st century.
Accordingly, his administration engaged the state’s African-American community, organized labor and Democrats, some of who were appointees in his administration. He initiated and signed into law the state’s first Martin Luther King Holiday as a stand-alone commemorative date in Virginia. Gilmore increased funding for two of Virginia’s historically black universities, Norfolk State University and Virginia State University.
Political Candidacies and Private Sector Experience
Gilmore remained active in other public arenas both during and after completing the one term allowed all governors under Virginia law. He chaired the Republican National Committee from 2001 until 2002. Gilmore entered the race for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, but exited that race in the summer of 2007. He won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in Virginia the following year, but was defeated by a Democratic opponent that autumn.
In addition to an active political life in local, state and national Republican politics, Gilmore serves on the boards of several major American corporations, has chaired the board of visitors of the U.S. Air Force Academy, and has been partner at a national law firm. He traveled to major regions of the world in his capacity as governor and in private-sector roles and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
Early Career and Private Life
Gilmore enlisted as a volunteer in the U.S. Army after college and worked as a counter-intelligence agent in then-West Germany in the early 1970’s after intensive language training in German, in which he became fluent. He was awarded the Joint Service Commendation Medal for Service to NATO.
As a student, he received his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Virginia. He worked as a grocery store cashier to help pay for his college education.
Married to Roxane Gatling Gilmore with whom he shares two adult sons, Gilmore divides his time between his two Virginia residences in Alexandria and his hometown of Richmond.

JAMES S. GILMORE III was born and raised in Richmond, Virginia. He received an undergraduate degree from the University of Virginia in 1971. After a three-year tour as a U.S. Army counterintelligence agent in West Germany, he entered the University of Virginia Law School, graduating in 1977. He worked for a decade in community service and as a lawyer in private practice, after which he was elected Commonwealth's Attorney in his home county of Henrico in 1987 and 1991. He was elected Virginia Attorney General in 1993 and Governor in 1997. As Governor, he established a record of success in improving education in Virginia and providing tax relief to Virginia's working families. Governor Gilmore oversaw the successful implementation of rigorous academic standards and testing to ensure improvement in student learning and accountability for teachers and administrators. Governor Gilmore had a solid record of cutting taxes. In the first two years of his administration, he enacted more than a dozen tax cuts, led by the virtual elimination of Virginia's personal property tax on cars and trucks - the largest tax cut in the state's history. He also cut income taxes for military personnel living in Virginia, lowered college tuition by 20 percent, and eliminated Virginia's tax on prescription drugs. A noted leader on technology issues, Governor Gilmore created the nation's first secretariat in technology, established a statewide technology commission, and signed into law the nation's first comprehensive state Internet policy.

Full name: James S. "Jim" Gilmore III

Party: Republican

What he does now: Gilmore serves as a member of the National Rifle Association’s Board of Directors. He’s also the President and CEO of the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative think tank founded in 1977.

What he used to do: He served as the governor of Virginia from 1998 to 2002. He chaired the Republican National Convention from January to December of 2001. Gilmore was elected as Virginia’s attorney general in 1993. And after graduating college in 1971, Gilmore joined the Army and worked as an intelligence officer until 1974.

Declared as a candidate: On July 29, 2015, Gilmore filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Elections Commissions.

In his own words: “I am committed to addressing the central problems facing the nation.” 

Family tree: Gilmore grew up in a working class area of Richmond. His father was a butcher and his mother was a church secretary.

Double legacy: Gilmore completed both his undergraduate and his law degrees at the University of Virginia.

Claim to fame: Gilmore headed the Gilmore Commission during the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The commission’s purpose was to advise presidents on how to handle terrorist incidents in the U.S. that involved weapons of mass destruction. He was also Virginia’s governor during the September 11 terrorist attacks when a plane flew into the Pentagon in Arlington, Va.

Might have wished for a do-over: Gilmore resigned from his post as RNC chair after less than a year in the position, saying, “Neither I nor my family can see any light at the end of this tunnel,” according to The Washington Post. While President George W. Bush called Gilmore a, “close friend and valuable ally,” his departure came after two gubernatorial losses for the GOP in the same year.

Biggest disagreement with President Obama: Gilmore sharply criticized President Obama’s comparison of the brutality of ISIS militants to actions committed by Christians during the medieval Crusades, calling the president’s comments, “the most offensive I’ve ever heard a president make in my lifetime.” He told the New York Times that Obama had “offended every believing Christian in the United States.”

A bilingual president: Jim Gilmore is fluent in German. Gilmore was stationed in Germany from 1971 to 1974 doing counter-intelligence work to protect American military bases in Europe.

What could hold him back: Gilmore’s gubernatorial race was won without much fanfare and that could hurt his visibility since the GOP field has several prominent governors-turned-candidates including Jeb Bush and Scott Walker. A Washington Post article called his race “the bland leading the bland,” and quoted a University of Virginia political science professor who referred to the race as, “a charisma-free zone.”

Comfort food (and drink): When it comes to favorite foods, Jim Gilmore says his favorite restaurant is Pizza Hut. According to the Washington Post, he drinks Miller Genuine Draft.

Woodwinds in the White House?: According to Gilmore, “All I did in high school was play music.” He played clarinet in several bands during his high school years and served as drum major of his school’s marching band and president of his school’s concert band.

See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
