Download this white paper to learn the basics of testing RF PAs and FEMs via an interactive white paper with multiple how-to videos.May 22, 2017Sponsored by National InstrumentsWafer Handler Predictive Monitor and Equipment Verification, Excursion Detection, Defect Reduction & Tool MatchingConsistent equipment performance, avoiding unscheduled downtime, reducing defects and preventing excursions is key to reducing cost and improving die and line yield in semiconductor manufacturing. The fully automated InnerSense SmartWafer (SMW2) system addresses these key metrics. The SMW2 system is effectively being used as a predictive monitor for handler PM’s, a leading indicator for mechanical defects and can detect, predict and prevent most mechanical related excursions, including wafer damage that can lead to subsequent wafer breakage. The SMW2 system can further improve tool availability by improving post PM recovery and tool matching.January 24, 2017Sponsored by InnerSenseMore Technology Papers 
WEBCASTSDense Off Chip Integration (DOCI): Advanced Packaging, low cost alternatives to boost electronic system performance Wednesday, August 9, 2017 at 1 p.m. ET The slowing down of Moore's Law even at leading CMOS Fabs due to approaching Physics limits, while at the same time the explosion in demand for chips and systems across a wide range of market segments (compact wearable / portable consumer systems, the transfer and processing of data to and from the cloud, at the high performance end specialized architectures e,g for AI) has revived interest in Dense Off Chip Integration (DOCI ), first used in MCMs (Multi Chip Modules) for mainframes some 3 decades ago.

Materials Date and time TBD Success in electronics manufacturing increasingly relies on the materials used in production and packaging. More than 50 different elements from the periodic table are now used in semiconductor manufacturing, and the list grows even longer when you consider the requirements of flexible/printed electronics, LEDs, compound semiconductors, power electronics, displays, MEMS and bioelectronics. In this webcast, experts will focus on changing material requirements, the evolving material supply chain, recent advances in process and packaging materials and substrates, and the role new materials such as carbon nanotubes will play in the future.
