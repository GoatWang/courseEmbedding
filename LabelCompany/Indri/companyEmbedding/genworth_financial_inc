We’re here to help make those dreams come true. To work with lenders and help get more people in the homes they deserve. For us, there’s no greater feeling in the world.
What is mortgage insurance (MI)?
Mortgage insurance can help qualified borrowers realize the dream of homeownership sooner:

It allows borrowers to buy a home with less than a 20% down payment.
It provides financial protection to lenders and investors in case of default.
It requires less paperwork than a FHA loan.
It makes it easier for homebuyers to qualify for a mortgage.

Understanding the benefits of Genworth MI

Competitive rates and guidelines
Technology that saves you time in the origination process

For homebuyers
At its core, MI provides these advantages for homebuyers:

Affordable monthly payments
Convenient and easier closing paperwork than a FHA loan
Premiums that are tax deductible1
Cancellation of the mortgage insurance upon building sufficient equity (approximately 80% of the home's original value)2
Value added offerings like our Homebuyer Privileges® and Homeowner Assistance programs, as well as our new self-paced online Homebuyer Education course

Buying a home? Learn why you’ll be glad you picked MI on our website.
Mortgage insurance discussed in this website is underwritten by Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation.
1Deduction applies to loans closed on or after January 1, 2007 and is currently available through December 31, 2016. MI premium is fully deductible for households with incomes at or below $100,000; households earning up to $109,000 can qualify for a reduced deduction. Homeowners should consult a tax professional for specific advice.
2Different lenders have slightly different MI cancellation requirements, so be sure to ask your lender to share the details with you.

Genworth Financial is a Fortune 500 insurance company. The firm was founded as The Life Insurance Company of Virginia in 1871.[3] In 1986, Life of Virginia was acquired by Combined Insurance, which became Aon plc in 1987. In 1996, Life of Virginia was sold to GE Capital.[4] In May 2004, Genworth Financial was formed out of various insurance businesses of General Electric in the largest IPO of that year.[5]
The Genworth Financial family of companies has three segments: Retirement & Protection, US Mortgage Insurance, and International. Products and services include life and long-term care insurance, mortgage insurance, and annuities. Its legal structure is set up as six separate companies.
On April 1, 2013, Genworth announced the completion of a legal entity reorganization, with the result being the creation of a new ultimate holding company. This restructuring separated the U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries from the overall firm.[6]

Company history[edit]
A.G. McIlwaine was the company’s first president.[7] Begun by two dozen Petersburg investors, the Life Insurance Company of Virginia offered its first policies to local customers before expanding to Richmond, Virginia. Under general agent F.W. Chamberlayne, the Richmond Department attracted a large number of new clients. Within the first decade, the client base expanded beyond the South.
As the Life Insurance Company of Virginia grew, the headquarters were moved to Richmond, Virginia.[8] By the turn of the twentieth century, the company offered products through different divisions,. The “Ordinary Division” of the company offered whole life annuity options and related products, the “Intermediate Division” offered term life products, endowment policies, and limited payment policies, and an industrial division offered inexpensive products.
Colloquially known as “Life of Virginia”,[citation needed] the company expanded its portfolio in the 20th century. Beginning with its first annuities business written in 1928, the company grew to include different mortgage insurance, lifestyle protection, and long-term care products and options.[9]
Over the past few decades, the company has undergone several major acquisitions, beginning in 1986 when Life of Virginia was acquired by Combined Insurance for $557 million, which became AON Corporation the following year.[10] In 1995, almost a decade after the acquisition, GE Capital, the financial services unit of General Electric, announced its plan to buy most of AON Corporation’s life insurance business, including Life of Virginia.[11]
Under GE Capital, Life of Virginia became a part of GE Financial Assurance Holdings, Inc., before becoming GE Capital Assurance Company. The company was incorporated as Genworth Financial, Inc. on October 23, 2003,[12] formed out of several GE Capital insurance companies. On May 25, 2004, Genworth became a publicly traded company in the largest initial public offering (IPO) of 2004.[13]
GE sold its remaining stake in the company in 2006 for an estimated $2.8 billion.[14] In 2007, another GE Capital insurance company, First Colony Life Insurance Company, merged with Genworth Life and Annuity Assurance Company, one of the entities within Genworth Financial, Inc, also in 2007, Sun Life Financial bought the Employee Benefits Group (EBG) of Genworth Financial, putting Sun Life Financial on the top market for Employee Benefits programs. As of December 31, 2011, Genworth Financial, Inc. had more than 15 million customers in more than 25 countries.[15]
In October of 2016, China Oceanwide Holdings Group agreed to buy Genworth Financial Inc. for $2.7 billion in US dollars.[16]
Products and services[edit]
Genworth Financial offers a range of products and services, including long-term care insurance and mortgage insurance. In 2016, the company suspended sales of annuities and life insurance, putting the existing books of business in to runoff. In 2012, Genworth’s U.S. companies paid over $3.2 billion in benefits to life insurance, long-term care insurance, and annuity policyholders and beneficiaries.[17]
The company provides individual long-term care insurance, group long-term care insurance for employers offering benefits to employees, and caregiver support services.[18]
Prior to 2016, the company offered several annuities: fixed immediate annuities, traditional fixed deferred annuities, and fixed index annuities.[19]
Life insurance was the company’s first product. As of December 2013, Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company and Genworth Life Insurance Company have over $728 billion in force.[20] Prior to the suspension of sales in 2016, the firm offered term life insurance, whole life insurance, universal life insurance, and index universal life insurance.[21]
Mortgage insurance[edit]
Genworth offers mortgage insurance, with benefits including homebuyer privileges, which provides rebates to items purchased for the home, and the homeowner assistance program, in which Genworth professionals work with homeowners and lenders to structure a feasible loan repayment program.[22]
Awards[edit]
Genworth Financial won “Best of Show” in 2007 at the Insurance & Financial Communicators Association (I.F.C.A) for outstanding interactive advertisement for their 100+ stories microsite. The microsite, which used a variety of multimedia to communicate the experiences of Americans who are 100 years of age or older, also won other accolades in 2007, including “Best of Category”, two gold and one silver awards in the Horizon Interactive Awards, and a gold award in the Financial Communications Society (FCS) portfolio awards.[23]
For three consecutive years (2012-2014), Genworth Financial received the DALBAR Life Insurance Service Award, making it the only life insurance firm to emerge as a leader in customer service. DALBAR identified characteristics that differentiated Genworth Financial from the rest of the life insurance industry, including their high degree of professionalism in dealing with policyholders, and their high attention to detail when answering clients’ questions. Genworth also won DALBAR’s annual Annuity Service Award, making them one of six companies that had “emerged as the titans of customer service in 2014".[24][25][26]
Securities fraud lawsuits[edit]
On April 14, 2014, a class action lawsuit was commenced the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Genworth for "disseminating false and misleading statements to the investing public." [27]
Another lawsuit was brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on behalf of investors. On March 14, 2016, the Alberta Investment Management Corporation and the Fresno County Employees' Retirement Association reached an agreement in principle to recover USD 219 million. [28] The lawsuit alleged that Genworth and certain senior executives made false and misleading statements about Genworth's long-term care insurance business and the company's financial statements between October 30, 2013 and November 5, 2014. [29]

Genworth Financial is a Fortune 500 insurance company. The firm was founded as The Life Insurance Company of Virginia in 1871.[3] In 1986, Life of Virginia was acquired by Combined Insurance, which became Aon plc in 1987. In 1996, Life of Virginia was sold to GE Capital.[4] In May 2004, Genworth Financial was formed out of various insurance businesses of General Electric in the largest IPO of that year.[5]
The Genworth Financial family of companies has three segments: Retirement & Protection, US Mortgage Insurance, and International. Products and services include life and long-term care insurance, mortgage insurance, and annuities. Its legal structure is set up as six separate companies.
On April 1, 2013, Genworth announced the completion of a legal entity reorganization, with the result being the creation of a new ultimate holding company. This restructuring separated the U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries from the overall firm.[6]

Company history[edit]
A.G. McIlwaine was the company’s first president.[7] Begun by two dozen Petersburg investors, the Life Insurance Company of Virginia offered its first policies to local customers before expanding to Richmond, Virginia. Under general agent F.W. Chamberlayne, the Richmond Department attracted a large number of new clients. Within the first decade, the client base expanded beyond the South.
As the Life Insurance Company of Virginia grew, the headquarters were moved to Richmond, Virginia.[8] By the turn of the twentieth century, the company offered products through different divisions,. The “Ordinary Division” of the company offered whole life annuity options and related products, the “Intermediate Division” offered term life products, endowment policies, and limited payment policies, and an industrial division offered inexpensive products.
Colloquially known as “Life of Virginia”,[citation needed] the company expanded its portfolio in the 20th century. Beginning with its first annuities business written in 1928, the company grew to include different mortgage insurance, lifestyle protection, and long-term care products and options.[9]
Over the past few decades, the company has undergone several major acquisitions, beginning in 1986 when Life of Virginia was acquired by Combined Insurance for $557 million, which became AON Corporation the following year.[10] In 1995, almost a decade after the acquisition, GE Capital, the financial services unit of General Electric, announced its plan to buy most of AON Corporation’s life insurance business, including Life of Virginia.[11]
Under GE Capital, Life of Virginia became a part of GE Financial Assurance Holdings, Inc., before becoming GE Capital Assurance Company. The company was incorporated as Genworth Financial, Inc. on October 23, 2003,[12] formed out of several GE Capital insurance companies. On May 25, 2004, Genworth became a publicly traded company in the largest initial public offering (IPO) of 2004.[13]
GE sold its remaining stake in the company in 2006 for an estimated $2.8 billion.[14] In 2007, another GE Capital insurance company, First Colony Life Insurance Company, merged with Genworth Life and Annuity Assurance Company, one of the entities within Genworth Financial, Inc, also in 2007, Sun Life Financial bought the Employee Benefits Group (EBG) of Genworth Financial, putting Sun Life Financial on the top market for Employee Benefits programs. As of December 31, 2011, Genworth Financial, Inc. had more than 15 million customers in more than 25 countries.[15]
In October of 2016, China Oceanwide Holdings Group agreed to buy Genworth Financial Inc. for $2.7 billion in US dollars.[16]
Products and services[edit]
Genworth Financial offers a range of products and services, including long-term care insurance and mortgage insurance. In 2016, the company suspended sales of annuities and life insurance, putting the existing books of business in to runoff. In 2012, Genworth’s U.S. companies paid over $3.2 billion in benefits to life insurance, long-term care insurance, and annuity policyholders and beneficiaries.[17]
The company provides individual long-term care insurance, group long-term care insurance for employers offering benefits to employees, and caregiver support services.[18]
Prior to 2016, the company offered several annuities: fixed immediate annuities, traditional fixed deferred annuities, and fixed index annuities.[19]
Life insurance was the company’s first product. As of December 2013, Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company and Genworth Life Insurance Company have over $728 billion in force.[20] Prior to the suspension of sales in 2016, the firm offered term life insurance, whole life insurance, universal life insurance, and index universal life insurance.[21]
Mortgage insurance[edit]
Genworth offers mortgage insurance, with benefits including homebuyer privileges, which provides rebates to items purchased for the home, and the homeowner assistance program, in which Genworth professionals work with homeowners and lenders to structure a feasible loan repayment program.[22]
Awards[edit]
Genworth Financial won “Best of Show” in 2007 at the Insurance & Financial Communicators Association (I.F.C.A) for outstanding interactive advertisement for their 100+ stories microsite. The microsite, which used a variety of multimedia to communicate the experiences of Americans who are 100 years of age or older, also won other accolades in 2007, including “Best of Category”, two gold and one silver awards in the Horizon Interactive Awards, and a gold award in the Financial Communications Society (FCS) portfolio awards.[23]
For three consecutive years (2012-2014), Genworth Financial received the DALBAR Life Insurance Service Award, making it the only life insurance firm to emerge as a leader in customer service. DALBAR identified characteristics that differentiated Genworth Financial from the rest of the life insurance industry, including their high degree of professionalism in dealing with policyholders, and their high attention to detail when answering clients’ questions. Genworth also won DALBAR’s annual Annuity Service Award, making them one of six companies that had “emerged as the titans of customer service in 2014".[24][25][26]
Securities fraud lawsuits[edit]
On April 14, 2014, a class action lawsuit was commenced the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Genworth for "disseminating false and misleading statements to the investing public." [27]
Another lawsuit was brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on behalf of investors. On March 14, 2016, the Alberta Investment Management Corporation and the Fresno County Employees' Retirement Association reached an agreement in principle to recover USD 219 million. [28] The lawsuit alleged that Genworth and certain senior executives made false and misleading statements about Genworth's long-term care insurance business and the company's financial statements between October 30, 2013 and November 5, 2014. [29]

Genworth Financial is a Fortune 500 insurance company. The firm was founded as The Life Insurance Company of Virginia in 1871.[3] In 1986, Life of Virginia was acquired by Combined Insurance, which became Aon plc in 1987. In 1996, Life of Virginia was sold to GE Capital.[4] In May 2004, Genworth Financial was formed out of various insurance businesses of General Electric in the largest IPO of that year.[5]
The Genworth Financial family of companies has three segments: Retirement & Protection, US Mortgage Insurance, and International. Products and services include life and long-term care insurance, mortgage insurance, and annuities. Its legal structure is set up as six separate companies.
On April 1, 2013, Genworth announced the completion of a legal entity reorganization, with the result being the creation of a new ultimate holding company. This restructuring separated the U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries from the overall firm.[6]

Company history[edit]
A.G. McIlwaine was the company’s first president.[7] Begun by two dozen Petersburg investors, the Life Insurance Company of Virginia offered its first policies to local customers before expanding to Richmond, Virginia. Under general agent F.W. Chamberlayne, the Richmond Department attracted a large number of new clients. Within the first decade, the client base expanded beyond the South.
As the Life Insurance Company of Virginia grew, the headquarters were moved to Richmond, Virginia.[8] By the turn of the twentieth century, the company offered products through different divisions,. The “Ordinary Division” of the company offered whole life annuity options and related products, the “Intermediate Division” offered term life products, endowment policies, and limited payment policies, and an industrial division offered inexpensive products.
Colloquially known as “Life of Virginia”,[citation needed] the company expanded its portfolio in the 20th century. Beginning with its first annuities business written in 1928, the company grew to include different mortgage insurance, lifestyle protection, and long-term care products and options.[9]
Over the past few decades, the company has undergone several major acquisitions, beginning in 1986 when Life of Virginia was acquired by Combined Insurance for $557 million, which became AON Corporation the following year.[10] In 1995, almost a decade after the acquisition, GE Capital, the financial services unit of General Electric, announced its plan to buy most of AON Corporation’s life insurance business, including Life of Virginia.[11]
Under GE Capital, Life of Virginia became a part of GE Financial Assurance Holdings, Inc., before becoming GE Capital Assurance Company. The company was incorporated as Genworth Financial, Inc. on October 23, 2003,[12] formed out of several GE Capital insurance companies. On May 25, 2004, Genworth became a publicly traded company in the largest initial public offering (IPO) of 2004.[13]
GE sold its remaining stake in the company in 2006 for an estimated $2.8 billion.[14] In 2007, another GE Capital insurance company, First Colony Life Insurance Company, merged with Genworth Life and Annuity Assurance Company, one of the entities within Genworth Financial, Inc, also in 2007, Sun Life Financial bought the Employee Benefits Group (EBG) of Genworth Financial, putting Sun Life Financial on the top market for Employee Benefits programs. As of December 31, 2011, Genworth Financial, Inc. had more than 15 million customers in more than 25 countries.[15]
In October of 2016, China Oceanwide Holdings Group agreed to buy Genworth Financial Inc. for $2.7 billion in US dollars.[16]
Products and services[edit]
Genworth Financial offers a range of products and services, including long-term care insurance and mortgage insurance. In 2016, the company suspended sales of annuities and life insurance, putting the existing books of business in to runoff. In 2012, Genworth’s U.S. companies paid over $3.2 billion in benefits to life insurance, long-term care insurance, and annuity policyholders and beneficiaries.[17]
The company provides individual long-term care insurance, group long-term care insurance for employers offering benefits to employees, and caregiver support services.[18]
Prior to 2016, the company offered several annuities: fixed immediate annuities, traditional fixed deferred annuities, and fixed index annuities.[19]
Life insurance was the company’s first product. As of December 2013, Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company and Genworth Life Insurance Company have over $728 billion in force.[20] Prior to the suspension of sales in 2016, the firm offered term life insurance, whole life insurance, universal life insurance, and index universal life insurance.[21]
Mortgage insurance[edit]
Genworth offers mortgage insurance, with benefits including homebuyer privileges, which provides rebates to items purchased for the home, and the homeowner assistance program, in which Genworth professionals work with homeowners and lenders to structure a feasible loan repayment program.[22]
Awards[edit]
Genworth Financial won “Best of Show” in 2007 at the Insurance & Financial Communicators Association (I.F.C.A) for outstanding interactive advertisement for their 100+ stories microsite. The microsite, which used a variety of multimedia to communicate the experiences of Americans who are 100 years of age or older, also won other accolades in 2007, including “Best of Category”, two gold and one silver awards in the Horizon Interactive Awards, and a gold award in the Financial Communications Society (FCS) portfolio awards.[23]
For three consecutive years (2012-2014), Genworth Financial received the DALBAR Life Insurance Service Award, making it the only life insurance firm to emerge as a leader in customer service. DALBAR identified characteristics that differentiated Genworth Financial from the rest of the life insurance industry, including their high degree of professionalism in dealing with policyholders, and their high attention to detail when answering clients’ questions. Genworth also won DALBAR’s annual Annuity Service Award, making them one of six companies that had “emerged as the titans of customer service in 2014".[24][25][26]
Securities fraud lawsuits[edit]
On April 14, 2014, a class action lawsuit was commenced the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Genworth for "disseminating false and misleading statements to the investing public." [27]
Another lawsuit was brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on behalf of investors. On March 14, 2016, the Alberta Investment Management Corporation and the Fresno County Employees' Retirement Association reached an agreement in principle to recover USD 219 million. [28] The lawsuit alleged that Genworth and certain senior executives made false and misleading statements about Genworth's long-term care insurance business and the company's financial statements between October 30, 2013 and November 5, 2014. [29]

        MI PRODUCTS
    No matter which mortgage insurance product you choose, the result is the same—with
    mortgage insurance from Genworth, homeownership is sooner, safer, and smarter.

    
MI Benefits
    Mortgage Insurance from Genworth provides a win-win solution for everyone. While
    it protects investors from potential loss, it also provides important benefits for
    borrowers and lenders.
    
Borrower Paid MI
    We offer flexible options for Borrower Paid MI, enabling homebuyers to put little
    money down on a home... with the simplicity of one loan.
    
Monthly Premium MI/Zero Monthly Premium MI
Single Premium MI
Level Annual Premium MI
Split Premium MI


Lender Paid MI
    With Lender Paid MI, the lender pays the mortgage insurance premium instead of the
    borrower. It can be a great choice for borrowers interested in an alternative to
    traditional borrower paid MI.
    

    OTHER PRODUCTS

    Affordable Housing
Low-to-moderate income borrowers often look for the lowest monthly payment on their
mortgage loan. At the same time, you may be trying to grow your share of the market—and
potentially gain CRA credits. We insure many
investor affordable housing programs
that help borrowers buy a home sooner.

					Full Description



Genworth Financial, Inc., incorporated on December 5, 2012, provides mortgage insurance products that allow people to purchase homes. The Company offers individual and group long-term care insurance products to meet consumer needs for long-term care. Its segments include U.S. Mortgage Insurance, Canada Mortgage Insurance, Australia Mortgage Insurance, U.S. Life Insurance, Runoff, and Corporate and Other.U.S. Mortgage InsuranceIn the United States, the Company offers mortgage insurance products predominantly insuring prime-based, individually underwritten residential mortgage loans (flow mortgage insurance). The Company provides mortgage insurance on a bulk basis (bulk mortgage insurance) with essentially all of its bulk writings being prime-based. Through its U.S. Mortgage Insurance segment, it provides private mortgage insurance. Primary mortgage insurance is placed through flow or bulk mortgage insurance policies. Bulk mortgage insurance transactions provide primary coverage on a finite set of individual loans identified by the bulk policy. The Company also performs fee-based contract underwriting services for mortgage lenders. The Company distributes its mortgage insurance products through its sales force throughout the United States.Canada Mortgage InsuranceThe Company offers flow mortgage insurance and also provides bulk mortgage insurance that aids in the sale of mortgages to the capital markets and helps lenders manage capital and risk in Canada. In both primary flow and bulk mortgage insurance, its mortgage insurance in Canada provides insurance coverage for 100% of the unpaid loan balance, including interest, selling costs and expenses. Most mortgage lenders in Canada offer both fixed rate and variable rate mortgages. It also provides bulk mortgage insurance to lenders that have originated loans with loan-to-value ratios of less than or equal to 80%. These policies provide lenders with capital relief from applicable bank regulatory capital requirements and facilitate the securitization of mortgages in the Canadian market.Australia Mortgage InsuranceIn Australia, the Company offers flow mortgage insurance and provides bulk mortgage insurance that aids in the sale of mortgages to the capital markets and helps lenders manage capital and risk. The Company also provides bulk mortgage insurance in Australia mainly to Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)-regulated lenders that intend to securitize Australian residential loans they have originated.U.S. Life InsuranceThe Company offers long-term care insurance products, as well as service traditional life insurance and fixed annuity products in the United States. Its individual and group long-term care insurance products provide defined levels of protection against the significant and escalating costs of long-term care services provided in the insured's home or in assisted living or nursing facilities. In contrast to health insurance, long-term care insurance provides coverage for skilled and custodial care provided outside of a hospital or health-related facility. Its life insurance products provide protection against financial hardship after the death of an insured. Its fixed annuity products help individuals create dependable income streams for life or for a specified period of time and help them save and invest to achieve financial goals.RunoffThe Company's Runoff segment's non-strategic products primarily include its variable annuity, variable life insurance, institutional, corporate-owned life insurance, and other accident and health insurance products. Institutional products consist of funding agreements, funding agreements backing notes (FABNs) and guaranteed investment contracts (GICs). Its variable annuities provide contractholders the ability to allocate purchase payments and contract value to underlying investment options available in a separate account format. Its institutional products consist of funding agreements, funding agreements backing notes (FABNs) and guaranteed investment contracts (GICs), which are deposit-type products that pay a guaranteed return to the contractholder on specified dates.The Company competes with Federal Housing Administration, Veteran's Administration, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.

Company history[edit]
A.G. McIlwaine was the company’s first president.[7] Begun by two dozen Petersburg investors, the Life Insurance Company of Virginia offered its first policies to local customers before expanding to Richmond, Virginia. Under general agent F.W. Chamberlayne, the Richmond Department attracted a large number of new clients. Within the first decade, the client base expanded beyond the South.
As the Life Insurance Company of Virginia grew, the headquarters were moved to Richmond, Virginia.[8] By the turn of the twentieth century, the company offered products through different divisions,. The “Ordinary Division” of the company offered whole life annuity options and related products, the “Intermediate Division” offered term life products, endowment policies, and limited payment policies, and an industrial division offered inexpensive products.
Colloquially known as “Life of Virginia”,[citation needed] the company expanded its portfolio in the 20th century. Beginning with its first annuities business written in 1928, the company grew to include different mortgage insurance, lifestyle protection, and long-term care products and options.[9]
Over the past few decades, the company has undergone several major acquisitions, beginning in 1986 when Life of Virginia was acquired by Combined Insurance for $557 million, which became AON Corporation the following year.[10] In 1995, almost a decade after the acquisition, GE Capital, the financial services unit of General Electric, announced its plan to buy most of AON Corporation’s life insurance business, including Life of Virginia.[11]
Under GE Capital, Life of Virginia became a part of GE Financial Assurance Holdings, Inc., before becoming GE Capital Assurance Company. The company was incorporated as Genworth Financial, Inc. on October 23, 2003,[12] formed out of several GE Capital insurance companies. On May 25, 2004, Genworth became a publicly traded company in the largest initial public offering (IPO) of 2004.[13]
GE sold its remaining stake in the company in 2006 for an estimated $2.8 billion.[14] In 2007, another GE Capital insurance company, First Colony Life Insurance Company, merged with Genworth Life and Annuity Assurance Company, one of the entities within Genworth Financial, Inc, also in 2007, Sun Life Financial bought the Employee Benefits Group (EBG) of Genworth Financial, putting Sun Life Financial on the top market for Employee Benefits programs. As of December 31, 2011, Genworth Financial, Inc. had more than 15 million customers in more than 25 countries.[15]
In October of 2016, China Oceanwide Holdings Group agreed to buy Genworth Financial Inc. for $2.7 billion in US dollars.[16]
Products and services[edit]
Genworth Financial offers a range of products and services, including long-term care insurance and mortgage insurance. In 2016, the company suspended sales of annuities and life insurance, putting the existing books of business in to runoff. In 2012, Genworth’s U.S. companies paid over $3.2 billion in benefits to life insurance, long-term care insurance, and annuity policyholders and beneficiaries.[17]
The company provides individual long-term care insurance, group long-term care insurance for employers offering benefits to employees, and caregiver support services.[18]
Prior to 2016, the company offered several annuities: fixed immediate annuities, traditional fixed deferred annuities, and fixed index annuities.[19]
Life insurance was the company’s first product. As of December 2013, Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company and Genworth Life Insurance Company have over $728 billion in force.[20] Prior to the suspension of sales in 2016, the firm offered term life insurance, whole life insurance, universal life insurance, and index universal life insurance.[21]
Mortgage insurance[edit]
Genworth offers mortgage insurance, with benefits including homebuyer privileges, which provides rebates to items purchased for the home, and the homeowner assistance program, in which Genworth professionals work with homeowners and lenders to structure a feasible loan repayment program.[22]
Awards[edit]
Genworth Financial won “Best of Show” in 2007 at the Insurance & Financial Communicators Association (I.F.C.A) for outstanding interactive advertisement for their 100+ stories microsite. The microsite, which used a variety of multimedia to communicate the experiences of Americans who are 100 years of age or older, also won other accolades in 2007, including “Best of Category”, two gold and one silver awards in the Horizon Interactive Awards, and a gold award in the Financial Communications Society (FCS) portfolio awards.[23]
For three consecutive years (2012-2014), Genworth Financial received the DALBAR Life Insurance Service Award, making it the only life insurance firm to emerge as a leader in customer service. DALBAR identified characteristics that differentiated Genworth Financial from the rest of the life insurance industry, including their high degree of professionalism in dealing with policyholders, and their high attention to detail when answering clients’ questions. Genworth also won DALBAR’s annual Annuity Service Award, making them one of six companies that had “emerged as the titans of customer service in 2014".[24][25][26]
Securities fraud lawsuits[edit]
On April 14, 2014, a class action lawsuit was commenced the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Genworth for "disseminating false and misleading statements to the investing public." [27]
Another lawsuit was brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on behalf of investors. On March 14, 2016, the Alberta Investment Management Corporation and the Fresno County Employees' Retirement Association reached an agreement in principle to recover USD 219 million. [28] The lawsuit alleged that Genworth and certain senior executives made false and misleading statements about Genworth's long-term care insurance business and the company's financial statements between October 30, 2013 and November 5, 2014. [29]

Genworth Financial is a Fortune 500 insurance company. The firm was founded as The Life Insurance Company of Virginia in 1871.[3] In 1986, Life of Virginia was acquired by Combined Insurance, which became Aon plc in 1987. In 1996, Life of Virginia was sold to GE Capital.[4] In May 2004, Genworth Financial was formed out of various insurance businesses of General Electric in the largest IPO of that year.[5]
The Genworth Financial family of companies has three segments: Retirement & Protection, US Mortgage Insurance, and International. Products and services include life and long-term care insurance, mortgage insurance, and annuities. Its legal structure is set up as six separate companies.
On April 1, 2013, Genworth announced the completion of a legal entity reorganization, with the result being the creation of a new ultimate holding company. This restructuring separated the U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries from the overall firm.[6]

Company history[edit]
A.G. McIlwaine was the company’s first president.[7] Begun by two dozen Petersburg investors, the Life Insurance Company of Virginia offered its first policies to local customers before expanding to Richmond, Virginia. Under general agent F.W. Chamberlayne, the Richmond Department attracted a large number of new clients. Within the first decade, the client base expanded beyond the South.
As the Life Insurance Company of Virginia grew, the headquarters were moved to Richmond, Virginia.[8] By the turn of the twentieth century, the company offered products through different divisions,. The “Ordinary Division” of the company offered whole life annuity options and related products, the “Intermediate Division” offered term life products, endowment policies, and limited payment policies, and an industrial division offered inexpensive products.
Colloquially known as “Life of Virginia”,[citation needed] the company expanded its portfolio in the 20th century. Beginning with its first annuities business written in 1928, the company grew to include different mortgage insurance, lifestyle protection, and long-term care products and options.[9]
Over the past few decades, the company has undergone several major acquisitions, beginning in 1986 when Life of Virginia was acquired by Combined Insurance for $557 million, which became AON Corporation the following year.[10] In 1995, almost a decade after the acquisition, GE Capital, the financial services unit of General Electric, announced its plan to buy most of AON Corporation’s life insurance business, including Life of Virginia.[11]
Under GE Capital, Life of Virginia became a part of GE Financial Assurance Holdings, Inc., before becoming GE Capital Assurance Company. The company was incorporated as Genworth Financial, Inc. on October 23, 2003,[12] formed out of several GE Capital insurance companies. On May 25, 2004, Genworth became a publicly traded company in the largest initial public offering (IPO) of 2004.[13]
GE sold its remaining stake in the company in 2006 for an estimated $2.8 billion.[14] In 2007, another GE Capital insurance company, First Colony Life Insurance Company, merged with Genworth Life and Annuity Assurance Company, one of the entities within Genworth Financial, Inc, also in 2007, Sun Life Financial bought the Employee Benefits Group (EBG) of Genworth Financial, putting Sun Life Financial on the top market for Employee Benefits programs. As of December 31, 2011, Genworth Financial, Inc. had more than 15 million customers in more than 25 countries.[15]
In October of 2016, China Oceanwide Holdings Group agreed to buy Genworth Financial Inc. for $2.7 billion in US dollars.[16]
Products and services[edit]
Genworth Financial offers a range of products and services, including long-term care insurance and mortgage insurance. In 2016, the company suspended sales of annuities and life insurance, putting the existing books of business in to runoff. In 2012, Genworth’s U.S. companies paid over $3.2 billion in benefits to life insurance, long-term care insurance, and annuity policyholders and beneficiaries.[17]
The company provides individual long-term care insurance, group long-term care insurance for employers offering benefits to employees, and caregiver support services.[18]
Prior to 2016, the company offered several annuities: fixed immediate annuities, traditional fixed deferred annuities, and fixed index annuities.[19]
Life insurance was the company’s first product. As of December 2013, Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company and Genworth Life Insurance Company have over $728 billion in force.[20] Prior to the suspension of sales in 2016, the firm offered term life insurance, whole life insurance, universal life insurance, and index universal life insurance.[21]
Mortgage insurance[edit]
Genworth offers mortgage insurance, with benefits including homebuyer privileges, which provides rebates to items purchased for the home, and the homeowner assistance program, in which Genworth professionals work with homeowners and lenders to structure a feasible loan repayment program.[22]
Awards[edit]
Genworth Financial won “Best of Show” in 2007 at the Insurance & Financial Communicators Association (I.F.C.A) for outstanding interactive advertisement for their 100+ stories microsite. The microsite, which used a variety of multimedia to communicate the experiences of Americans who are 100 years of age or older, also won other accolades in 2007, including “Best of Category”, two gold and one silver awards in the Horizon Interactive Awards, and a gold award in the Financial Communications Society (FCS) portfolio awards.[23]
For three consecutive years (2012-2014), Genworth Financial received the DALBAR Life Insurance Service Award, making it the only life insurance firm to emerge as a leader in customer service. DALBAR identified characteristics that differentiated Genworth Financial from the rest of the life insurance industry, including their high degree of professionalism in dealing with policyholders, and their high attention to detail when answering clients’ questions. Genworth also won DALBAR’s annual Annuity Service Award, making them one of six companies that had “emerged as the titans of customer service in 2014".[24][25][26]
Securities fraud lawsuits[edit]
On April 14, 2014, a class action lawsuit was commenced the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Genworth for "disseminating false and misleading statements to the investing public." [27]
Another lawsuit was brought in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on behalf of investors. On March 14, 2016, the Alberta Investment Management Corporation and the Fresno County Employees' Retirement Association reached an agreement in principle to recover USD 219 million. [28] The lawsuit alleged that Genworth and certain senior executives made false and misleading statements about Genworth's long-term care insurance business and the company's financial statements between October 30, 2013 and November 5, 2014. [29]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
