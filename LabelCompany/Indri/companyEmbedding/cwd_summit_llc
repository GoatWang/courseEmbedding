Description
Coyote Outdoor
Coyote Outdoor Living was conceived to bring to market a suite of products that allow consumers to create the outdoor kitchen of their dreams.

The cornerstone of the lineup is the Coyote grill. In all of the available barbeque models, the Coyote grill marries solid construction with strong aesthetics and remarkable performance. Designed to endure, the Coyote grill will be the heart of the outdoor living space. The ease of use coupled with a great cooking performance makes the Coyote grill a must have for your outdoor kitchen.

To complement the grill, Coyote Outdoor Living offers a branded living space that will aesthetically and functionally enhance all outdoor cooking areas. The current Coyote outdoor offering includes a broad range of storage solutions, secondary cooking options, refrigeration, and more.

Whether you are creating an intimate outdoor cooking oasis or an extravagant outdoor kitchen design, Coyote has the product to make your space the envy of the neighborhood.

Learn:A Basic OverviewWhich BTU is right for you?Frequently Asked QuestionsStaff Review: Top 5 Portable Air ConditionersView All ArticlesPortable Air Conditioners: The Most Versatile Cooling SolutionPortable air conditioners are an alternative cooling solution that is able to be easily moved when needed elsewhere. Residential portable air conditioners range from 7,000 to 14,000 BTUs and are meant to cool areas up to 600 sq. ft. Commercial portable air conditioners are offered in both water cooled and air cooled models and range from 13,000 to 120,000 BTUs. These powerful units are meant to cool special equipment in large warehouses or factories.Since portable air conditioners are essential air movers, moving out hot air and replacing it with cooled air, they have to an outlet for the ventilation of warm air and moisture. Many residential portable air conditioners are vented through a nearby window using an included window vent kit, but accessories are available for ceiling and sliding door ventilation. Many commercial portable air conditioners are vented through the ceiling. Depending on the situation, other ventilation applications can be used. Other portable air conditioner accessories include window locks, filters, and remote controls.When shopping for a portable air conditioner, you’ll want to focus on the cooling power and square footage the unit can cover. These two units of measurement typically coincide; larger BTUs are associated with larger coverage.There are many benefits to using a portable air conditioner rather than a traditional cooling system. Other than the mobility factor, you have the ability to spot cool areas of habitation or concern, rather than using an entire central system. In commercial settings, portable air conditioners can be used to cool special equipment on weekends and after hours, giving business owners the freedom to use central systems less.×Login or sign up to save a list ofYour FavoritesLoginorSign Up×CloseSubmitPlease enter a valid email address!Thanks for Subscribing!We respect your privacy and promise to never spam you.

Not many people stop to consider the source unless they find themselves without. If you have a large family, love to entertain, or own your own business, you must consider the benefits of owning your own ice maker. Whether your needs or residential or commercial, an ice maker or ice machine is a reliable source for everyday ice use.Residential ice makers come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from small and compact portable ice makers to sleek built-in ice makers. These are perfect for small-scale ice needs and venues, such as your home, office, or small business.There are also different types of commercial ice machines, such as modular and self-contained ice units. Commercial units are ideal for large-scale ice needs and venues, such as schools, hospitals, restaurants, and bars. Modular ice machines require a separate ice bin for storage purposes. Different ice machines make different types of ice, as well.If you’re looking for a particular style of ice, you should shop by ice type. Bullet, clear, crescent, cube, gourmet , flake, and nugget/pearl are some of the options you can choose from.You must consider both the production and storage capacity when shopping for an ice maker. The production capacity is how much ice the machine can produce in a 24 hour period, while storage capacity is how much ice the unit can store at any given time. Many ice machines will suspend ice production once capacity is reached.Whether your needs are large or small, consider how a residential ice maker or commercial ice machine can offer automated ice production, completely eliminating the hassle of finding a reliable source elsewhere.×Login or sign up to save a list ofYour FavoritesLoginorSign Up×CloseSubmitPlease enter a valid email address!Thanks for Subscribing!We respect your privacy and promise to never spam you.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
