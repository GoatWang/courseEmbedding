Innovative cancer management tools















Using Circulating Tumor Cells as a robust biomarker for cancer management
Clinical studies have demonstrated that circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be utilized to diagnose, treat, and monitor cancer. However, the CTC capture technologies currently on the market are not sensitive enough for the full potential of CTCs to be realized.​





CapioCyte
 

 



CapioCyte™ is an ultra-sensitive cell capturing device invented by Capio cofounder Dr. Hong. Our clinical data show a sensitivity 10 to 100 times greater than other platforms currently available. This incredible sensitivity makes our product an excellent cancer detection and management tool.
