Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

BUSINESS




OVERVIEW



We are an early-stage company focused on manufacturing, sublicensing and
franchising heavy cruiser motorcycles with engines equipped with the Coates
Spherical Rotary Valve System, or CSRV System. We were incorporated in 1995, but
had no business activities or operations and none of our capital stock was
issued until March 2003. During the first quarter of 2003, we began active
operations as an independent subsidiary of Coates International, a technology
development company, to further commercialize our heavy motorcycles.


We have an exclusive sublicense from Coates International with the right to
sublicense and franchise, to make, use, sell and otherwise dispose to others,
motorcycle engines utilizing the CSRV System in the countries and their
territories comprising North America, Central America and South America. In
exchange for this exclusive sublicense, we issued 3,558,000 shares of our common
stock to Coates International.


We have an exclusive license from the Coates Trust, George Coates and Gregory
Coates with the right to sublicense and franchise, to make, use, sell and
otherwise dispose to others, motorcycle engines utilizing the CSRV System in the
entire world outside of North America, Central America and South America. In
exchange for this exclusive license, we issued 8,424,000 shares of our common
stock to the licensors. In February, 2005, the licensors transferred these
shares to the Coates Family Voting Trust.



TRADITIONAL MOTORCYCLE ENGINE TECHNOLOGIES



Traditional motorcycles utilize "poppet valves" in conventional combustion
engines. The poppet valves protrude into the engine cylinder or combustion
chamber. The standard poppet valve engine uses mushroom-shaped valves, which are
spring loaded and are opened by the force of the lobes of a camshaft, which uses
push rods or cam followers to open the valves and the valves have an up and down
reciprocating motion to open and close the valves for intake and exhaust. The
valve closing is activated by a spring, which returns the valve to the closed
position. They protrude into the combustion chamber and open approximately 8
millimeters to allow the fuel and air mixture into the combustion chamber. After
the compression and combustion strokes the exhaust valve opens and the piston
expels the spent gas from the cylinder. The four cycles are repeated thousands
of times per minute.


Traditional poppet valve combustion engines use many moving parts to operate the
engine, which includes parts such as the return springs, cam shafts, cam
followers, push rods, rocker arms, rocker shafts, etc. All of these moving parts
must be constantly sprayed with engine oil for cooling and lubrication purposes.
All these moving parts require energy to operate, wasting energy and reducing
the thermal efficiency of the engine. As a result, the poppet valve engine does
not maximize fuel efficiency or power output and emits more pollutants than
engines designed with fewer moving parts.


22






THE CSRV SYSTEM



The CSRV System replaces the poppet valves, including the moving parts these
valves require to operate. The reduced number of moving parts eliminates need
for oil spray to cool and lubricate the moving parts. The CSRV System replaces
the poppet valve and its many moving parts with two moving parts which do not
require oil lubrication: one set of spherical rotary valves on a shaft for inlet
and another set for exhaust. We believe these rotary valves consume less fuel,
lower emission of pollutants and increase power output and thermal efficiency.
Heavy motorcycles or heavyweight motorcycles are those which have engine
displacement of 1600 "cc's" or more. The abbreviation "cc" refers to the volume
of an engine's combustion cylinders in cubic centimeters. Motorcycle engines
with engine volumes in excess of 1600 cubic centimeters are characterized as
heavy cruiser motorcycles.


Over the past 12 years, Coates International has devoted substantial time and
financial resources to the research, development, design and construction of the
CSRV System. The CSRV System differs from the conventional poppet valve system
currently used in almost all piston driven automotive, motorcycle and marine
engines, by changing the method by which the air and fuel mixture is delivered
to the engine cylinder as well as the method of expelling the exhaust gases
after the mixture is ignited.


Unlike the poppet valve which protrudes into the engine cylinder, the CSRV
System utilizes spherical valves which do not protrude into the cylinder but
rotate in a cavity formed between a two piece cylinder head. As a result of
employing fewer moving parts as compared to the poppet valve and not protruding
into the engine cylinder, we believe that the CSRV System will promote less
engine wear and will require less lubrication over the life of the engine. In
addition, because the CSRV System does not employ parts which protrude into the
engine cylinder, it is designed with larger openings into the cylinder than
conventional poppet valves so that more fuel and air mixture can be inducted
into and expelled from the engine cylinder in a shorter period of time using the
CSRV System, leading to an ability to operate the engine faster and an ability
to utilize higher compression ratios with lower combustion chamber temperatures.
We believe that as a result, engines modified with the CSRV System will produce
more power than similar engines utilizing the poppet valve system. The CSRV
System operates on ceramic carbon bearings and seals, the seals and sealing
mechanism being activated by variations in combustion chamber pressure. This
results in less friction in the engine, generating greater output with less wear
on the engine.



EPA TESTING AND CERTIFICATION



We have completed the design phase of our initial line of heavy cruiser
motorcycles and are now preparing for manufacturing and distribution. An
essential step and integral part of this process is the testing of our
motorcycles for drivability, durability and compliance with all (50) states and
EPA standards and limits for exhaust emissions. The tests must be
performed at an independent test facility, recognized by the EPA. We have begun
the required testing and expect to complete the testing protocol to determine if
our motorcycles comply with the applicable 2005 and then the 2006 through 2008,
EPA emissions and durability standards. In the event our motorcycle passes these
tests, we would be permitted to begin our motorcycle sales and distribution
program as a "small volume" manufacturer of motorcycles and motorcycle engines.


On May 26, 2005, the EPA approved a reduced 4,000 kilometer durability testing
protocol instead of the standard 15,000/30,000 kilometer testing protocol for
our 2005 motorcycles. In the event we successfully pass the 2005 EPA emissions
and durability standards, we would be able to begin marketing our 2005 model
heavy cruiser motorcycles in 2005.



MARKET OPPORTUNITY



During each year of the period 1998 through 2002 sales of heavy motorcycles in
the United States have increased. We hope to be a participant in the worldwide
market for motorcycles which the Fredonia Group Report estimates was over $32
billion in sales for more than 100 million vehicles in calendar year 2002. The
Fredonia Group Report estimates this market to grow to over $46 billion U.S. and
increase to almost 130 million vehicles by 2007. The motorcycle industry is
currently undergoing a technology transition driven by a confluence of factors,
the strongest of these is related to exhaust emissions regulation. It includes
the phase-out of two stroke engines and significantly more stringent emission
standards which we believe provides us with a vast potential market for our
products and large revenue streams for licenses and royalties for our motorcycle
engines with our advanced spherical rotary valve technology.

OUR PRODUCT




THE COATES HEAVY CRUISER MODEL MOTORCYCLE



We intend to initially construct a heavy cruiser motorcycle with a V-Twin CSRV
System design, four stroke, air cooled 1600 cc's engine, equipped with disc
brakes and incorporating the CSRV System. We believe that our new heavy cruiser
motorcycle utilizing the CSRV System in its engine will be able to compete with
other similar heavy motorcycles currently available in the market. Our heavy
cruiser motorcycle, equipped with a new engine, utilizing the CSRV System, has
the potential to produce high performance, fuel efficiency and durability.


We have completed the construction of three prototype heavy cruiser motorcycles,
utilizing the CSRV System. In June 2003, our first motorcycle underwent an
initial tailpipe emissions test at Compliance and Research Services, Inc., "C&R
Testing", a motor vehicle testing facility located in Plainfield , New Jersey In
May, 2005, our motorcycle began a continuous emissions testing protocol at C&R
Testing. Our motorcycle must successfully pass the 2005 applicable EPA emissions
standards. Based upon preliminary testing results, C&R Testing obtained approval
from the EPA to "reduced testing" for our 2005 motorcycle, resulting in the
reduction of the testing cycle from 15,000/30,000 kilometers to 4,000
kilometers, with full durability testing for our 2006 models to continue once
the 4,000 kilometer benchmark is achieved. We anticipate that our motorcycles
will continue further testing in order to comply with these applicable emissions
regulations.


We have purchased parts and equipment to construct another 10 motorcycles. We
plan to assemble and then test each of these motorcycles in the next several
months. Following the successful completion of applicable emissions testing and
the certification of our motorcycle components meeting applicable safety
regulations, we plan to sell these 10 motorcycles to customers who have already
placed orders and, in some cases, placed a cash deposit with us for the purchase
of our motorcycles. We currently have received 10 orders from customers to
purchase our motorcycles.



OUR STRATEGY



We believe that our heavy cruiser motorcycle will successfully compete with
other motorcycle products in the domestic market. We initially intend to
manufacture and assemble one motorcycle product, our heavy cruiser motorcycle
with a 1,600 cc's engine utilizing the CSRV System. Our business plan is
comprised of four operational and marketing goals:


o We plan to manufacture, assemble and sell our heavy cruiser motorcycle to
customers from our New Jersey facility, focusing on customers located in the
Eastern United States.


o We intend to offer sublicenses for our motorcycle, including our engine design
and the CSRV System adapted to this application to original equipment
manufacturers.


o We intend to establish a marketing program by establishing relationships with
existing dealerships to sell our heavy cruiser motorcycle engines, incorporating
the CSRV System in the road and racing market as well as in the retrofit
after-market.



SALES AND MARKETING STRATEGY



We intend to market our heavy cruiser motorcycle product by direct advertising
in the print media, primarily magazines and newspapers devoted to the motorcycle
customer. We have not performed any marketing studies to assess the potential
marketability of our heavy cruiser motorcycle product and do not intend to do
so. We believe that because of its special features, including its design and
utilization of the CSRV System, our heavy cruiser motorcycle will be attractive
to customers nationwide; however, we can give investors no assurances that we
can attract customers with our new product and its features. We expect the
retail price for our heavy cruiser motorcycle to be slightly higher than other
heavy motorcycles, in the price range between $20,000 to $25,000 . We estimate
that the costs to produce approximately 100 heavy cruiser motorcycle products,
including the costs for manufacture, parts, and labor assembly, will be
approximately $12,500 per motorcycle. Accordingly, we believe that we can
manufacture, assemble and sell approximately 100 of our new heavy cruiser
motorcycles with approximately $6.4 million of the net proceeds received from
the sale of the minimum 750,000 units this offering within twelve months from
funding.

STRATEGIC AGREEMENTS




SUBLICENSE AGREEMENT



In a sublicense agreement entered into on April 30, 2003 (as amended on March 5,
2004), we received an exclusive sublicense from Coates International, Ltd., with
the right to sublicense and franchise, to make, use and sell our motorcycle
engines utilizing the CSRV System in the countries and their territories
comprising North America, Central America and South America. We also received a
non-exclusive license to use CSRV valve seals solely for the manufacture of the
CSRV System for incorporation into motorcycle engines throughout the same
territory. Coates International holds an exclusive license from George J. Coates
and his son, Gregory G. Coates, to manufacture, sell and grant sublicenses with
respect to products based on the Coates patents, including those sublicensed to
us in North America, Central America and South America.


The duration of the sublicense agreement is until the expiration of the last to
expire patent that is licensed unless the agreement is terminated earlier
pursuant to its termination provisions. Early termination by Coates
International, Ltd. could occur if we commit a material breach of any provision
of the sublicense agreement and the breach is not cured within thirty days, or
if we enter bankruptcy, become insolvent, or any similar event occurs to us.


In exchange for the rights granted under the sublicense agreement, we issued
3,558,000 shares of our common stock to Coates International, representing more
than 50% of our outstanding shares. Also, under this sublicense agreement, we
are obligated to pay Coates International a royalty of $25.00 per each 1000 cc
for each CSRV System motorcycle engine sold by us in the relevant territory.


We also agreed to obligate all our sublicensees to whom we sublicense the CSRV
System patents and technology under this sublicense agreement to pay Coates
International a royalty of $25.00 per each 1,000 cc for each motorcycle engine
they manufacture.


We also agreed to utilize our best efforts to register 1,500,000 shares in this
prospectus on behalf of Coates International to accommodate the distribution of
these shares to the shareholders of Coates International as a stock dividend.



LICENSE AGREEMENT



In a license agreement entered into on April 30, 2003 (as amended on March 5,
2004), we received an exclusive license from the Coates Trust, George J. Coates
and Gregory G. Coates, with the right to sublicense and franchise, to make, use,
sell and otherwise dispose to others motorcycle engines utilizing the CSRV
System, in all the countries of the world except those in North America, Central
America and South America. We also received a non-exclusive license to use CSRV
valve seals solely for the manufacture of the CSRV System for incorporation into
motorcycle engines throughout the same territory.


The duration of the license agreement is until the expiration of the last to
expire patent that is licensed unless the agreement is terminated earlier
pursuant to its termination provisions. Early termination by the licensors could
occur if we commit a material breach of any provision of the sublicense
agreement and the breach is not cured within thirty days, or if we enter
bankruptcy, become insolvent, or any similar event occurs to us.


In exchange for this exclusive license, we issued to George J. Coates, Gregory
G. Coates and the Coates Family Trust an aggregate of 8,424,000 shares of our
common stock. In February, 2005, all of these shares were transferred to the
Coates Family Voting Trust under the control of an independent and unrelated
trustee.


Also, under this license agreement, we are obligated to pay the licensors a
royalty of $25.00 per each 1000 cc for each CSRV System motorcycle engine sold
by us in the relevant territory.


We also agreed to obligate all our sublicensees to whom we sublicense the CSRV
System patents and technology under this license agreement to pay the licensors
a royalty of $25.00 per each 1,000 cc for each motorcycle engine they
manufacture.

COMPETITION



The Motorcycle Industry Council estimates the United States market for heavy
motorcycles during 2002 was dominated by Harley-Davidson (approximately 48%),
Honda (approximately 20%), Suzuki (approximately 10%) with BMW, Kawasaki, Yamaha
and others controlling the rest of this marketplace.


All of our potential competitors have well-established and long operating
histories, substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and
other resources, as well as greater name recognition and an established customer
base. As a result, these competitors will be able to devote much greater
resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their motorcycle
products than we will be able to devote. Competitors with an established
customer base will have a competitive advantage over us when selling their heavy
motorcycle products to such customers.



INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY



Our sublicense and license provide us with the right to utilize all existing
patents and future enhancements, whether patentable or not, covering the CSRV
System until the expiration of the last to expire patent unless the sublicense
and/or license are terminated earlier according to their terms.


Our goal is to have our licensors and sublicensors obtain, maintain and enforce
patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other
proprietary technologies. It is also our goal to preserve our trade secrets, and
operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in
the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to have
our licensors and sublicensors obtain, where appropriate, the broadest
intellectual property protection possible for our product candidates,
proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of
contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and elsewhere in
the world.


We currently have licenses or sublicenses to 12 U.S. patents and a number of
foreign counterpart patents and patent applications. We have licensed these U.S.
patents and their foreign counterparts from Coates International with respect to
North America, South America and Central America and from the Coates Trust,
George Coates and Gregory Coates with respect to the rest of the world.


The term of a patent is typically 20 years from filing date, subject to any
statutory extension. If any application contains a specific reference to an
earlier filed application or applications, the term of the patent is 20 years
from the date on which the earliest application was filed, subject to any
statutory extension. In the United States, for applications filed prior to June
8, 1995, the term of a patent is the longer of 17 years from the date of grant
of the patent and 20 years from the earliest effective U.S. filing date of the
application. Because the time from filing to issuance of engineering patent
applications often takes several years, patent protection, if any, on patented
engineering technologies, such as our products, may be substantially less than
the 20 year or 17 years periods referenced above.


We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and
technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other
contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary
know-how that is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be
difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality
agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all employees,
consultants, advisors and certain other contractors to enter into
confidentiality agreements which prohibit the disclosure of confidential
information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of
the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
Additionally, these confidentiality agreements require that our employees,
consultants and advisors do not bring to us, or use without proper
authorization, any third party's proprietary technology.



GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS



Our motorcycle engine utilizing the CSRV System will be subject to extensive
environmental laws, rules and regulations that impose standards for emissions
and safety. In order for our heavy cruiser motorcycle product to be sold in the
United States, it must meet certain emissions regulations promulgated by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA. In addition, certain
parts of our motorcycle, designated as the safety components such as brake
hoses, the brake system, tires and lights, must be individually certified as in
compliance with applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and
Regulations to the United States National Highway Transportation and Safety
Administration, or DOT.


26





The EPA is charged with overseeing compliance with applicable emissions
standards. We must submit an application to the EPA certifying that our
motorcycle engine is in compliance with applicable emissions standards. The
independent firm of Compliance and Research Services, Inc. of Plainfield , New
Jersey ("C&R Testing") will test our motorcycle to establish that its emissions
are in compliance with the applicable emission threshold standards for the year
of production as well as during the "useful life" of the motorcycle. As per
federal regulations, the useful life of motorcycles having an engine of 280 cc's
or larger is 15,000/30,000 kilometers. The "15,000/30,000 kilometer" standard
means that generally, the EPA permits an engine's emissions and durability
testing to actually endure for only 15,000 kilometers and the results achieved
at this point are permitted to be extrapolated out to the 30,000 kilometer
limit.


We have commenced the testing of our prototype motorcycles at C&R Testing. In
June, 2003, our motorcycle underwent initial emissions testing and achieved
positive results. In May, 2005, our motorcycles began a regular and continuous
testing protocol at C&R Testing. Based upon these tests of our motorcycle, C&R
Testing applied to the EPA for a reduced testing protocol for our 2005
motorcycle products, which was approved by the EPA in May, 2005. As a result,
our motorcycles will be tested to determine compliance with the 2005 EPA
emissions and durability standards over a reduced protocol of 4,000 kilometers
instead of the customary 15,000/30,000 kilometer requirement.


Beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2008, our heavy cruiser motorcycles
will be required to achieve more stringent emissions standards. These emissions
standards include the normal protocol that includes four durability tests run
over the 15,000/30,000 kilometers standard. We expect C&R Testing to complete
the emission tests on our prototype motorcycles during the third or fourth
quarter of 2005. Assuming our motorcycle engine meets these EPA emission
standards, C&R Testing will submit our application for us to the EPA also during
the third or fourth quarter of 2005 for certification that we are in compliance
with these emission standards. The EPA will review our application for
certification, make comments, ask questions and upon full review, either approve
or deny our application for certification. Based upon our initial test results,
described above, we believe that emissions from our prototype motorcycle engines
will comply with the 2006 - 2008 EPA standards, however, we cannot assure
investors that such clearance will be obtained. With the exception of the State
of California, the motor vehicle emissions standards of the remaining 49 states
conform to the EPA emission standards. Following successful testing and
compliance with EPA emission standards, we intend to test our motorcycle engine
under the applicable emission standards, rules and regulations of the State of
California. The State of California, in addition to its more strict emission
standards, will subject our motorcycle to additional evaporative emission
standards and durability requirements.


The DOT is responsible for overseeing the safety of motor vehicles, including
motorcycles. We must certify to the DOT that all of our motorcycle's safety
components comply with applicable federal safety standards. Since all of the
components of our motorcycle are currently available on the open market, they
have been previously certified by the DOT.


We estimate that the cost and expense to complete the required emissions testing
under the 2005 and the new 2006 through 2008 EPA standards and DOT
certifications will be approximately $100,000 .



FACILITIES



We are currently utilizing several offices and approximately 5,000 square feet
of assembly space at the business premises of Coates International, our
affiliate, rent free. Following our offering, we will either continue to utilize
the offices and assembly space of our affiliate or relocate to other available
business premises.

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Conditions TreatedAbdominal DisordersAll Headaches (incl.

If they do, we may pay them a commission of up to 10% of the gross proceeds from the shares they sell.  Any participating broker-dealers will be deemed to be underwriters, as defined in the Securities Act of 1933, and any commissions received by them will be deemed to be underwriting compensation.
(2)	Before deducting offering expenses estimated to be $100,000.
Our initial public offering will terminate nine months after it is declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The proceeds from this public offering will be utilized by us as described in the "Use of Proceeds" section of this prospectus.
 
There is no minimum required purchase and there is no arrangement to have funds received by us to be placed in escrow, trust or similar account or arrangement.  The minimum purchase by any one investor is 100 shares, and the number of shares purchased must be in multiples of 100 Shares. 

In May, 2003, we commenced a private offering of our common shares to fund our business plan, offering up to 2,000,000 shares at the offering price of $10 per share, on a best efforts, minimum 500,000 shares/maximum 2,000,000 shares basis. We would have obtained investment funds from this private offering only if we successfully sold the minimum 500,000 shares and received gross proceeds in the minimum amount of $5,000,000. Because  our motorcycle engine passed initial tailpipe emission tests applicable in 49 states and because we started receiving orders for our motorcycle, we decided to abandon our private offering and register our shares in this initial public offering. Based upon this decision, we terminated all of our private offering activities and efforts on July 31, 2003, and did not accept any offers to buy our shares.  As a result, this prospectus and the information it contains supercedes all
of the selling material used in our private offering.

  This summary highlights selected information contained elsewhere in this prospectus. It does not contain all of the information that is important to you. To understand this offering fully, you should read the entire prospectus carefully, including the risk factors and the financial statements and related notes to those statements included in this prospectus. References to "we", "us", "our",  "CMC", "Coates Motorcycle", or  to" our Company" means  Coates Motorcycle Company, Ltd. 
INTRODUCTION
 
Coates Motorcycle Company, Ltd. was recently reorganized as a subsidiary of Coates International, Ltd. to design and manufacture and then to market and sell, an initial line of "heavyweight" cruiser motorcycles. Heavyweight Motorcycles have engines with a displacement of 1,651 cc. Coates International, Ltd., referred to as the "Parent" of our Company, has been in the business of researching and developing  the "Coates Spherical Rotary Valve" in various types of combustion engines for over 14 years. Our Parent  has the exclusive license to 12 patents in the United States covering technologies invented by George J. Coates and his son, Gregory G. Coates. Our
Company received an exclusive sublicense from our Parent and a non-exclusive license from George J. Coates, Gregory G. Coates and the Coates family trust, or the "Coates Trust",  to use their respective patented technologies in our Company's design and production planning to produce our heavy cruiser  motorcycles in exchange for ownership  interests in our Company. Our Parent owns in excess of 50% of our Company and an anti-dilution right that guarantees its continued majority ownership position in our
Company at all times. In exchange for their license, George J. Coates, our Chief Executive Officer (as well as the majority shareholder and President of the Parent), Gregory G. Coates, our President and the Coates Trust  also received  common shares of our Company.
 
We are offering up to 2,000,000 shares of our common stock at the price of $10 per share. Our President, Gregory G. Coates,  will be offering our Shares for sale on  a best efforts basis and we may use the services of broker-dealers to assist us. There is no public trading market for our Shares. Although we intend to apply to list our Shares on either the American Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter Bulletin Board, we can not assure investors that our applications to list our Shares on these stock exchanges will be accepted. There is no minimum amount of shares that are required to be sold in this Offering. Our Offering will remain open for nine months following the date the Securities and Exchange Commission declares our registration statement effective unless we decide to cease selling efforts prior to that date. This prospectus is a part of our registration statement
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Our principal offices are located at 2100 Highway #34 & Ridgewood Road, Wall Township, New Jersey 07719 and our telephone number is (732) 449-7717.

Risk Factors

�
	The following risk factors should be carefully considered in addition to the other information contained in this Prospectus in evaluating Coates Motorcycle Company, Ltd., its financial condition and its business prospects.
Business and Financial Condition Risk Factors.
 Risk of Investment Loss. An investment in the Common Shares of Coates Motorcycle Company, Ltd. is highly speculative and may result in the loss of an investor's entire investment. Only potential investors who are experienced investors in high risk investments and who can afford to lose their entire investment should consider an investment in this Offering.


 Limited Operating History. The Company was incorporated in March 1995 and has only commenced business operations since March of 2003. Accordingly, the Company has no operating history upon which investors may evaluate its business plan and prospects. The Company's plan to  manufacture and sell heavy cruiser motorcycles utilizing the Coates CSRV System will depend upon the success of this Offering.  Moreover, the Company expects to incur losses and negative cash flow from its start-up operations for the foreseeable future, with the expectation that  such losses will increase as our operations develop.
There can be no assurance that the Company's heavy cruiser motorcycle will pass acceptable performance and durability tests;  pass state and federal emissions tests; be constructed and assembled on a scheduled basis, or; be successfully marketed and sold, or; that the Company will achieve and/or maintain profitability or generate cash from operations in future periods. The Company's prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their start-up phase of development. To address these risks, among other things, the Company must: - - test its motorcycles for durability
and emissions; - - implement and successfully execute its business and marketing strategy; - - continue to develop and upgrade its motorcycle products; - - provide superior customer service and order fulfillment; - - respond to competitive developments; and - - attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.


  Future Capital Needs; Uncertainty of Additional Funding. The Company requires substantial working capital to fund its business plan. The Company is expected to experience negative cash flow from operations from inception of its business and expects to continue to experience significant negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future. The Company's capital requirements depend on several factors, including the mechanical success of the CSRV System adapted to its heavy cruiser motorcycle engines, the achievement of successful performance, durability and emission testing results, the uncertainty of market acceptance, the ability to produce and assemble sufficient numbers of motorcycles
to achieve commercial acceptance as well as maintaining a retail operation to achieve sales and marketing and other factors. If capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned, the Company may require additional financing sooner than anticipated. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of the stockholders of the Company will be reduced, stockholders may experience additional dilution, or such equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of the Company's Common  Shares. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed on terms favorable to the
Company or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, the Company may be unable to develop or enhance its motorcycle product, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or operating results.

  Dependence on Suppliers. The motorcycle parts and engines supplier currently being targeted by the Company to supply its engine blocks and parts are single sources. At present, single-sourced components include frames, gas tanks and engines. Any interruption in the supply of any of these components, or the inability of the Company to procure these components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time, could result in higher projected prices for the Company's motorcycle products and could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business, operating results and financial
condition. Qualifying additional suppliers is time consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that such shortages will not occur in the future, and any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Product Liability Risk.  The Company's heavy cruiser motorcycles are intended to be high performance units. As a result they will be subject to stresses which may increase the product liability risks of the Company. Purchasers of the Company's heavy motorcycles  will rely on the integrity and durability of our motorcycles. However, there can be no assurance that the Company's heavy cruiser motorcycles will perform as expected or function as intended. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company will not
incur liabilities in connection with its motorcycles for product liability claims in the future that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
 Competition. The high-performance motorcycle domestic market is intensely competitive, currently dominated by Harley Davidson. In addition, expected competition in the  heavy motorcycle market will also come from such recognizable brands as Honda,  Suzuki, Kawasaki and Yamaha. We believe that our motorcycles will be able to enter the domestic market and successfully compete with these well known motorcycle products. The U.S. motorcycle market is characterized by frequent introductions of new or enhanced motorcycles, price competition, continued emergence of new industry standards, and regulatory developments. All of the Company's potential competitors have well-established and long operating histories, substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, as well as greater name recognition and an established customer base. As a
result, these competitors will be able to devote much greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their motorcycle products than the Company. Competitors with an established customer base will have a competitive advantage over the Company when selling their heavy motorcycle products to such customers. Although we believe that our heavy cruiser motorcycle will be competitive, all of the Company's potential competitors, domestic and foreign,  have significantly greater financial, production, distribution and marketing resources than we do.


Regulation. Federal, state and local authorities have various environmental control requirements  relating to air, water and noise pollution that will impact our business and operations. We will endeavor to ensure that our facilities and motorcycle products will comply with all applicable environmental regulations and standards.
Our motorcycles will be subject to certification by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for compliance with applicable emissions and noise standards and, if sold in California, they will be subject to the State of California Air Resources Board ("CARB") and its more stringent emissions standards. In addition to the U.S., emission standards are becoming universally more rigorous and will require a continuing level of research and development and production costs related to motorcycle emissions and noise for the foreseeable future.
As an anticipated manufacturer of motorcycle products, we will be subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, which is administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA"). We will have to certify to NHTSA that our motorcycle products comply fully with all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and related regulations. We can give no assurances to investors that our motorcycles will comply with any of these environmental and safety laws, rules and regulations, in which case such failures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and plan of operations.

 Start-up, Research and Development Company. Until our heavy motorcycles have been fully tested for performance, durability and emissions  and  until we are able to manufacture, assemble and sell our heavy cruiser motorcycle product in quantities sufficient to produce earnings, we are now and will continue to be primarily a development stage, start-up company.  As an expected result, we will incur operating  losses throughout the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect to have  minimal revenues during this period and expect to incur a substantial accumulated deficit.

  Lack of Prior Manufacturing Experience. We have no  motorcycle manufacturing, assembling or selling experience. Accordingly, we can give no assurances that we will be successful in manufacturing, assembling and selling a heavy cruiser motorcycle product on a cost effective basis.


 No Dividends.  Anticipated capital requirements make it highly unlikely that any dividends will be paid with respect to the Common Stock now or in the foreseeable future.

Management Risk Factors
 Dependence on Gregory G. Coates and George J. Coates.  The successful development of our heavy motorcycle business, including its production, assembly, marketing and selling operations will initially be dependent upon Gregory G. Coates and George J. Coates.  Accordingly, the loss of the availability or services of either  Gregory G. Coates or George J. Coates, whether due to death, incapacity or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.  See
"Management."

 Ownership of our Company. Our Company has been capitalized as a subsidiary of our Parent, Coates International, Ltd.  Our Parent will at all times own approximately 50+% of our equity ownership, represented by our initial issuance to it of 2,550,000 shares of our stock which ownership percentage is protected from dilution by an anti-dilution right. We gave our Parent these shares and the anti-dilution right as consideration for our Parent's granting us an exclusive sublicense, covering its patent and technology rights over the "Coates Spherical Rotary Valve" in the western hemisphere; see, "Sublicense". We also issued 2,500,000 initial Shares to the Coates family in exchange for their grant to us of a non-exclusive license, covering their patent and technology
rights over the "Coates Spherical Rotary Valve" in the rest of the world; see, "License". Although these 2,500,000 Shares initially represent approximately 49%of our equity, their ownership position is subject  to dilution,  as a result of this Offering and in cases of future issuances of our stock for proper corporate purposes. For example, the successful sale of 500,000 of the 2,000,000 Shares in this Offering will trigger an automatic increase in our Parent's equity ownership position, from its current 2,550,000 shares to 3,050,000 of our shares. This automatic increase of 500,000 shares is required pursuant to the "anti-dilution right" we granted to our Parent in the Sublicense. This anti-dilution right guarantees that our Parent will own approximately 50+% of our equity ownership as long as we remain in existence. On the other hand, the 2,500,000 shares issued to the Coates family, comprised of George
J. Coates, Gregory G. Coates and the Coates Trust, in exchange for the non-exclusive License, are not protected by an "anti-dilution" right like the one we granted to our Parent. Accordingly, the successful sale of 500,000 of the 2,000,000 Shares in this Offering will reduce the Coates family's aggregate equity ownership in our Company from approximately 49% to  approximately 41.25% and, in the event we sell all of the 2,000,000 Shares in this Offering, to approximately 27.70%. ( See "Dilution").

The consideration, or payment, we made to the Coates Family, represented by our issuance to its members of 2,500,000 shares of our stock, and to our Parent, represented by the issuance to it of 2,550,000 shares of our stock with the anti-dilution right, were arbitrarily determined by our Parent's management.  The decision concerning the amount of these payments, represented by the issuance of these amounts of our shares and in the case of the Parent, the anti-dilution right, was not based upon any arms length negotiations or any other recognizable criterion of value.

  Conflicts of Interest: Gregory G. Coates and George J. Coates. The success of our Offering, our current and future business operations and plans,  our ability to obtain future financing as well as our current and future financial condition may be adversely and materially affected by certain conflicts of interest assumed by Gregory G. Coates and George J. Coates, which include but are not limited to the following:
  Services To be Rendered.  Gregory G. Coates and George J. Coates are currently employed by our Parent, Coates International, Ltd. Although Gregory G. Coates, our President, will devote his full-time to our business and its development, he may be called upon to render services from time to time to our Parent. George J. Coates, our Chief Executive Officer and a director, also serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer of our Parent, Coates International, Ltd. As our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Coates shall devote as much of his time as is necessary to our management and operations.  Mr. George
J.  Coates shall not be be paid for the services he renders to us while he serves as our Chief Executive Officer. Gregory G. Coates will be paid by us for his services, the amount of which compensation will depend upon such factors as the success of this Offering, the success of our production, marketing and the volume of our motorcycle sales. Neither Gregory G. Coates nor Geoge J. Coates  currently have employment agreements with our Parent nor with us and we do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with either of them in the forseeable future. Both Messrs. Coates, therefore,  will be rendering services to us and to our Parent which  represent  direct conflicts of interest. Accordingly, investors should be aware that Gregory
G. Coates, due to his occasional ongoing commitments to our Parent, and George J. Coates, due to his current commitments to our Parent, may not be in a position to render to us the amount of time and services we will require to develop and operate a successful business.


 Control of Equity Ownership. George J. Coates owns approximately 78% and his son, Gregory G. Coates,  owns an approximate 5%, respectively, of the ownership equity of our Parent, Coates International, Ltd. Their combined holdings  represent an approximate aggregate 83.5% equity ownership position in our Parent.  Conjunctively,  our Parent, due to the anti-dilution right we gave it, currently and throughout our corporate existence, will continue to own in excess of 50% of our ownership equity interests.  Accordingly,  the Coates family, by virtue of its control position in our Parent, will be able to control our management and business operations, including but not limited to appointing all of the members of our Board of Directors and all of our officers for the foreseeable future, as long as they
remain controlling shareholders of our Parent.

Offering Risk Factors
 Arbitrary Offering Price.  Our offering price of  $10 per common share been arbitrarily determined by our management.  This offering price should not be considered as any indication of the value of our Company or our shares.  The offering price does not bear any relationship to our assets, net worth, results of operations, book value or any other objective criteria of value. Our offering price should not be considered as any indication of the future value of our shares.
No Trading Market exists and May Never Develop For Our Common Stock And Any Market That Does Develop May Be Sporadic Or Volatile. Our common shares are not listed for trading on any stock exchange. Although we intend to apply to list our common stock for trading on either the American Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter Bulletin Board, we may not qualify for such listing.  Even if our common stock was to qualify for such listing and begin trading, we cannot provide any assurances that a stable and liquid trading market will develop for our shares, or if such a trading market was to develop, whether it could be sustained.
  The Value of Our Shares You Purchase May be Effected by Penny Stock Regulations. Even if our application to list our common shares on the over-the-counter Bulletin Board was successful,  the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") recently adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in "penny stocks." Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a trading price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges, or quoted on the Nasdaq system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). Even though we may successfully sell part or all of our common shares in this Offering at our offering price of $10 per share and we later achieve their listing on the American Stock Exchange or on the Bulletin Board,  our subsequent share trading price could fall
below $5.00 for any number of reasons, including general economic conditions. If our common share trading price was to drop below $5.00, the penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to any transaction in our stock, then considered a penny stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Commission that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with the current bid and offer quotations for our stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of our stock and any other penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations for our stock, and the broker-dealer and sales person compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing before or with the customer's confirmation to purchase our stock. In addition,
the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from such rules the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our stock if our stock becomes subject to the penny stock rules. Although the offering price of our common stock has been set at $10.00, no assurance can be given that prices above $5.00 will be maintained in any future trading market that might develop. If the price of the common stock drops below $5.00 it would be subject to the penny stock rules and investors in this Offering may find it more difficult to sell their common stock until the Company's common stock trades
on the a national securities exchange, the Nasqac or sells at a price greater than $5.00 per share.
 George J. Coates - 10,000 Shares are Redeemable.  In order to fund our initial organizational costs and expenses, George J. Coates contributed $100,000 to us for which we issued to him 10,000 shares of our common stock.  We agreed to "redeem" or buy back these shares from Mr. Coates for the same price of $10 per share when we have the funds available to us for this redemption.  In addition, George Coates has loaned our Company approximately $300,000 to assist us.  We intend to pay these loans back out of the proceeds of this Offering; see, "Use of Proceeds".  Investors should know that the Company does not intend
to offer to them any redemption right such as that given to George J. Coates.  Investors will not be able to sell their shares back to us and the Company will not redeem any of our shares once an investor purchases them.  Except as may be required by applicable law, we will not give any  investors in this Offering any right to rescind their investment in our Company shares.  
 Immediate Substantial Dilution.  At June 30, 2003 we had a pro forma net  tangible book value of  $95,218 or a $.02 per outstanding share of the then outstanding common shares.  Purchasers of shares of the common stock offered hereby who are paying an effective purchase price of $10 per share of common stock will suffer an immediate substantial dilution based upon the difference between their per share purchase price and the adjusted per share net book value of the common stock after the offering.  See "Dilution."
�
 If We Issue Additional Shares, Your Shares Would Suffer Further Dilution.  Under applicable law, we have the right to issue additional common shares to employees, management, directors, advisors and consultants for services rendered and for other proper corporate purposes.  In the event we issue additional common shares, the percentage ownership of our Company that the shares you purchase in this Offering represent will be reduced.  In addition, such further stock issuances will reduce your voting power as a shareholder.
�
Use Of Proceeds

	After deducting the estimated expenses of this Offering, all of which will be paid by the Company, the net proceeds to be received by the Company are estimated to aggregate $17,950,000 if all 2,000,000  shares of Common Stock offered hereby are sold.  It is anticipated that the net proceeds will be allocated in the approximate amounts set forth below.

(2) Includes the legal and printing costs of this Offering (estimated at $100,000) as well as provision to pay commissions of up to 10% of the proceeds raised to NASD registered broker-dealers who may assist us in this Offering.
	None of the expenditures described above constitutes a firm commitment by the Company.  Projected expenditures are estimates or approximations only.  Future events, including changes in the economic climate or in the Company's planned business operations, including the success or lack of success of Company's intended business activities, may result in material shifts in the allocation of funds necessary or desirable.  Any such shift will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors.  See "Management." Prior to expenditure, the net proceeds will be invested in short-term interest-bearing securities, money market funds or marketable securities.
Dividend Policy
�
	We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on any of our securities.  We intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance our business operations.  We do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.  
Determination Of Offering Price.
	The $10 per share offering price for the 2,000,000 shares of our common stock was established arbitrarily by the management of our Company, without reference to any established criteria of value, including our financial condition and assets.  There is no established market for our common stock we are registering for sale.  We cannot give any investor assurances that a public market will be established for our shares.  We intend to apply to list our shares for trading on either the American Stock Exchange or on the over-the-counter Bulletin Board so that we can establish a public market for our shares.  Even if we succeed to list our shares on one of these markets, the public market trading price for our shares may fall below our offering price of $10 per share.  

�
�
Dilution.
	Investors will suffer immediate and substantial dilution as a result of purchasing our shares.  At June 30, 2003, the outstanding common stock  had a net tangible book value (deficit) per share of approximately $.02.  The term "net tangible book value per share" represents the amount of tangible assets less the amount of  liabilities divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding.  After giving effect to the sale of all of the 2,000,000 shares of common stock offered hereby at $10.00 per share, and assuming the receipt of the net proceeds (after deducting the estimated Offering Expenses therefrom),  the adjusted pro forma net tangible book value per share of the outstanding Common Stock and the 2,000,000 common shares offered hereby, as of June 30, 2003 would increase to approximately $1.98. Consequently, the purchasers of shares of  the common
stock offered hereby,  will sustain an immediate dilution of approximately $8.02 per share, as illustrated by the following table. 
	Offering price per share of Common Stock  $10.00
	  Net tangible book value (deficit) per share  
	  of Common Stock at June 30, 2003  ($.02)

(1) After deduction of the estimated expenses of this Offering.
Our Best Efforts Offering
Our President, Gregory G. Coates,  will use his best efforts to offer up to 2,000,000 shares of our common stock for sale to the public.  This "best efforts" means that none of our officers or directors has made any commitment to us to purchase any part or all of the 2,000,000 shares we intend to sell. In addition, if we utilize the services one or more NASD registered broker-dealers to assist us in our Offering, we anticipate that these broker-dealers as well will limit their commitment to a best efforts agreement to find purchasers for the shares we are offering for sale. We will continue our Offering for the 9 month period following the date the Securities and Exchange Commission declares the registration statement of which this Prospectus forms a part, effective.  Each purchaser will receive instructions from us or from any NASD registered broker-dealer who assists us, to send
their written statement of how many shares they want to purchase, the amount of their payment, their address and social security number or federal  tax identification number to us and we will authorize our stock transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company of New York, New York, to issue our Shares to the purchasers in this Offering after it is declared effective. We will have ten (10) days after receipt to reject any subscription offered to us.
Plan of Distribution

This is a "direct public" offering. There is no minimum amount that must be sold, and we will receive any proceeds from this offering immediately upon the acceptance of any subscriptions we receive. We will accept or reject any subscriptions  within ten days of receipt, and any checks submitted with rejected subscription will be returned promptly. Upon accepting a subscription for shares, our transfer agent will issue the shares to the purchasers.  We will continue our offering of the shares for the nine months following the date the Securities and Exchange Commission declares our registration statement effective. We will sell the shares on a "direct public offering basis" through our president, Gregory G. Coates, who will not receive any compensation in connection with the sale of shares, although we will reimburse him for expenses incurred in connection with the offer
and sale of the shares. Gregory G. Coates will be relying on Rule 3a4-1 of the Exchange Act as a "safe harbor" from registration as a broker-dealer in connection with the offer and sale of the shares. In order to rely on such "safe harbor" provisions provided by Rule 3a4-1, Gregory G. Coates must be in compliance with all of the following:


must not be subject to a statutory disqualification; 
must not be compensated in connection with such selling participation by payment of commissions or other payments based either directly or indirectly on such transactions;
must not be an associated person of a broker-dealer;
must restrict participation to transactions involving offers and sale of the shares; 
must perform substantial duties for the issuer after the close of the offering not connected with transactions in securities, and not have been associated with a broker or dealer for the preceding 12 months, and not participate in selling an offering of securities for any issuer more than once every 12 months; and
must restrict participation to written communications or responses to inquiries of potential purchasers. 
Mr. Gregory G. Coates will comply with the guidelines enumerated in Rule 3a4-1. Certain of our  officer and directors may purchase shares in this offering. You may purchase shares by sending to us a written statement of how many shares you want to purchase, giving us your name, address and social security number or federal tax identification number and delivering it with your payment in full for all shares which you wish to purchase to our offices. All payments are to be made by cash, check or money order payable only to: "Coates Motorcycle Company, Ltd.", and delivered to the Company. Your subscription shall not become effective until accepted by us. We will either accept or reject your subscription within 10 days, and if we reject your subscription, we will return your payment.

We have not retained a broker for the sale of our shares being offered. In the event we retain a broker who may be deemed an underwriter, an amendment to the registration statement will be filed. All sales will be made in compliance with the securities laws of local jurisdictions. Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the regulations thereunder, any person engaged in a distribution of the shares of our common stock offered by this prospectus may not simultaneously engage in market making activities with respect to our common stock during the applicable "cooling off" periods prior to the commencement of such distribution.

The Company has also agreed to indemnify Mr. Gregory G. Coates and any directors against specified liabilities including liabilities under the Securities Act. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling persons of the Company, we have advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore, unenforceable. We have advised Mr. Gregory G. Coates that while he is engaged in a distribution of the shares included in this prospectus
he is required to comply with Regulation M promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. With certain exceptions, Regulation M precludes Mr. Gregory G. Coates, any of our other directors, officers, any affiliated purchasers, and any broker-dealer or other person who participates in such distribution from bidding for or purchasing, or attempting to induce any person to bid for or purchase any security which is the subject of the distribution until the entire distribution is complete. Regulation M also prohibits any bids or purchases made in order to stabilize the price of a security in connection with the distribution of that security. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the shares offered in this prospectus.

Legal Proceedings.
 The Company is not a party to any pending legal proceeding.

  and George J. Coates, who are beneficiaries, their  percentage ownerships are 29.64% and 29.84%, respectively.
 ++These shares have not yet been issued to these directors and will represent an approximate ownership percentage of .020%

 (1) Our Parent, Coates International, Ltd., received 2,550,000 of our common shares and an "anti-dilution" right to maintain 
  its 50+% ownership in our stock  in exchange for the  exclusive "Sublicense" it granted us for the duration of the life of its 
 "Patents". 
(2), (3) and (4) Gregory G. Coates and George J. Coates each received 1,000,000 shares and the Coates Trust received 500,000

  shares of our common shares in exchange for a non-exclusive, worldwide "License".  Unlike the anti-dilution right we gave 
  to our Parent, Coates International, Ltd., the shares owned by these parties are subject to dilution.  In addition, George J.

  Coates contributed $100,000 of capital to our start-up operations, in consideration for which we issued 10,000 common

  shares to him.
(5) Seven and one-half years ago, the SEC commenced proceedings against Mr. Coates and our Parent, Coates International,

  Ltd. ("CIL") in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York which, in August, 2001, was settled and the 
  case dismissed.  The SEC brought a civil action against CIL,  Mr. George Coates and related parties for alleged violations

  of federal securities laws in connection with certain private placements that occurred in the early 1990's.  Initially, the Court

  froze the assets of CIL and George J. Coates, appointing a special master to manage CIL's business affairs.  Thereafter, CIL

  and George J. Coates negotiated a settlement with the SEC and a consent judgment was signed by CIL and Mr. Coates.  The

  principal settlement provisions of this final consent judgment required:  Mr. Coates to transfer ownership of CIL's Wall

  Township business premises to CIL; permitted Mr. Coates to retain title to the Coates Patents as long as he reimbursed the

  Company for the costs associated therewith, and;  CIL's commitment to undertake a registered rescission offer to certain  
  private placement investors.  George J. Coates agreed to use up to approximately $800,000  of his own funds first to buy

  back CIL stock from those investors who chose rescission, with any required further rescission funds necessary to complete

  the rescission offer to be paid by CIL.  The rescission offer was completed in 1997 with only 32 of the 328 private

  placement investors electing to rescind their investment. The 32 rescinding investors received $1,270,000 of rescission

  funds  out of approximately $6,500,000 invested by these investors.  Following the rescission, the Court dismissed the

  special master and the Company continued under the control of Mr. Coates.  In concluding this proceeding, Mr. Coates was

  assessed a fine of $40,000 by the Court based upon its findings of  four violations of federal securities disclosure laws in

  connection with the private placements.  Specifically, the Court found that the private placement offering documents used

  by Mr. Coates at the time misrepresented that (1) the Coates systems engine surpassed the emissions standards imposed by

  the EPA; (2) the offering documents omitted disclosing Harley Davidson's discontinuance of testing the Coates prototype

  engines due to Harley's claims of malfunction; (3) the Company had a substantial number of firm orders for engines

  equipped with the Coates System when the orders were found to be provisional, and; (4) the Company owned the patents to

  the Coates System when, at the time, they were owned by Mr. Coates.

  Since the above events, our Parent, Coates International, Ltd., has become a public reporting company, registering its class

  of common shares under federal securities laws and, as a result,  files quarterly, annual and special reports with the

  Securities and Exchange Commission.  Our Parent has also entered into various license agreements, licensing the

  technology and patents covering the "Coates Spherical Rotary Valve" to various entities.  Following the initial design and 
  construction of our motorcycle prototype, our Parent decided to organize our Company into a subsidiary for the specific

  purpose of designing and marketing its own heavy cruiser motorcycle.  Our initial tailpipe emission tests in June, 2003, for

  our prototype heavy cruiser motorcycle achieved a result of 1.5 grams per kilometer of hydrocarbons,  when the US EPA

  standard is currently 5 grams per kilometer, while our motorcycle results for carbon monoxide were 6.8 grams per kilometer

  with the applicable US EPA standard being 12 grams per kilometer.

Description of  Business
Form and Year of Organization

Our Company was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1995.  From its inception through fiscal year 2002, our Company had no business activities or operations and none of its capital stock was issued.  

During the first quarter of 2003, our Company, Coates Motorcycle Company, Ltd.  (the "Company" or "CMC") was reorganized as a subsidiary of our Parent, Coates International, Ltd. to manufacture and sell heavy cruiser motorcycles with engines equipped with the "Coates Spherical Rotary Valve" and other proprietary enhancements created and owned by  Coates International Ltd., George J. Coates and Gregory G. Coates (the "CSRV System").  Our Company intends to manufacture, construct and sell heavy cruiser motorcycles.
 
The Exclusive Sublicense

We received an exclusive sublicense from Coates International, Ltd. to make, use and sell motorcycles utilizing the CSRV System in the countries and their territories comprising North America, Central America and South America  (collectively, the "Western Hemisphere"). In exchange for this exclusive sublicense, we issued more than 50% of our ownership interests, in the form of 2,550,000 shares of its common stock, to Coates International, Ltd. which became by virtue of such issuance, became our "Parent" corporation and our Company, our Parent's subsidiary corporation. 

In addition, the terms of this exclusive sublicense include an "anti-dilution" right, providing our Parent with the right to continue to own in excess of 50% of our common stock at all times during the term of the sublicense. This "anti-dilution" right guarantees that the Parent  will be the Company's majority and controlling shareholder throughout the sublicense period and, therefore, will generally be permitted to control the Company's management, including the membership of its board of directors, and business operations under Delaware law. Both Coates International, Ltd., our "Parent", and Coates Motorcycle Company, Ltd., its "subsidiary", are organized under the laws of the State of Delaware. We will sometimes refer to our exclusive sublicense agreement
with our Parent as  the "Sublicense".  

The Non-Exclusive License

We also entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with the Coates Trust, George J. Coates and Gregory G. Coates to use and sell ( not make or manufacture) motorcycles employing the CSRV System in all the countries of the World except in the Western Hemisphere. In exchange for this non-exclusive license, we issued to George J. Coates, Gregory G. Coates and the Coates Family Trust an aggregate of  2,500,000 shares of its common stock, representing an approximate initial 49% ownership position in our Company. Unlike the Sublicense, this non-exclusive
license does not contain any "anti-dilution" rights in favor of any party. We will sometimes refer to our non-exclusive license agreement with George J. Coates ,Gregory G. Coates and the Coates Trust as the "License".

Our "Parent": Coates International, Ltd.
	Our Parent, Coates International Ltd., is a Delaware corporation organized in October 1991 by George J. Coates . 	Our Parent  holds an exclusive license  from  George J.  Coates  and his son, Gregory G. Coates,  to  manufacture,  sell and grant  sublicenses  with respect to products based on the Coates Patents in the Western Hemisphere. George J. Coates and Gregory G. Coates have also agreed, as long as our Parent remains  independent and viable, not to compete with our Parent in the manufacture,  assembly,  use,
or sale of internal  combustion  engines utilizing the  technology  falling within the scope of the Coates Patents in the Western Hemisphere, or to grant any other exclusive or non-exclusive  license in the Western Hemisphere except  through  our Parent.

Background
  	Based upon the strength of the heavy cruiser motorcycle market in the United States and in certain other parts of the world, our Parent, George J. Coates and Gregory G. Coates decided to organize our Company as a separate subsidiary within which to manufacture, market and sell new heavy cruiser motorcycle incorporating the Coates CSRV System.
Business Plan

The Coates Heavy Cruiser Model Motorcycle Line
  We believe that a new heavy cruiser motorcycle utilizing the CSRV System in its engine will be able to compete with other similar heavy motorcycles currently available in the market.  Our heavy cruiser motorcycles, equipped with a new engine utilizing the Coates CSRV System, has the potential to produce high performance, fuel efficiency and durability.  We intend to initially construct motorcycle models with a twin CSRV, four stroke, air cooled 1,625 cc engine, equipped with disc brakes and incorporating the Coates CSRV System.

	We have completed the construction of two heavy cruiser motorcycles, utilizing the Coates CSRV System.  We anticipate that these motorcycles will undergo emissions and safety testing in the next several months in order to comply with applicable state and federal regulations.  
Competition:  The Heavy Motorcycle Market
 
	During each year of the period, 1997 through 2001, the heavy motorcycle market in the United States has increased dramatically.  Heavy motorcycles or heavyweight motorcycles are those which have engine displacement of 651+cc.  The United States market for heavy motorcycles is dominated by Harley-Davidson (approximately 45%), Honda (approximately 20%), Suzuki (approximately 10%) with Kawasaki, Yamaha and others controlling the rest of this marketplace(1).
	We believe that we can manufacture, assemble and sell approximately 100 of our new heavy cruiser motorcycles with approximately between $2,5000,000 and $3,000,000 of the funds received from this Offering within twelve months from funding.  The basic design of the parts and engine has already been accomplished.  The only delays we anticipate are non-material engine refinements and the emissions and safety testing protocols.  The manufacture and assembly of these targeted 100 motorcycles will not be delayed since we have already negotiated costs and expenses with the suppliers for all of the parts, including engine blocks and frames. 
	Because of the special features, including its design and utilization of the Coates CSRV System, we expect the retail price for our  heavy cruiser motorcycle to be slightly higher than other heavy motorcycles, in the price range of between $25,000 to $30,000.  
	Assuming we are successful in selling the entire 2,000,000 Common Shares in this Offering, receiving gross offering proceeds of $20,000,000, we expect to manufacture, assemble and sell approximately between 500 and 750 heavy cruiser motorcycles within 24 months from funding. Of course, this schedule is subject to unforeseeable events and delays due to testing protocols.  Based upon our conservative estimates of overhead costs, we anticipate a net profit before taxes of approximately 50% of the retail price. 
	We expect that our capital requirements will increase, depending upon the success of our Offering, sometime commencing  12 months following completion of this Offering.  The manufacture and assembly of heavy motorcycles is a capital intensive business, that will require the Company to secure warehousing facilities for its inventory, a new location for its management and assembly operation.  In anticipation of the successful completion of this Offering, we are searching and investigating available properties for our future use.  We expect to utilize the facilities of our Parent, Coates International, Ltd., in Wall, New Jersey for our executive offices, inventory storage and assembly operations.  We will pay our Parent monthly rent of $5,000 for the use of its current offices and facilities.  
The Coates CSRV System

	The Coates CSRV System  differs from the  conventional  poppet valve system currently used in almost all piston driven automotive,  motorcycle and marine engines,  by changing the method by which the air and fuel mixture is delivered to the engine cylinder as well as the method of expelling  the exhaust gases after the mixture is ignited.  Unlike the poppet valve which  protrudes into the engine  cylinder, the Coates CSRV System  utilizes  spherical  valves which do not  protrude  into the cylinder but rotate in a cavity formed  between a two piece  cylinder head. As a result of  employing  fewer moving parts as compared to the poppet valve and not protruding into the engine cylinder,  management believes that the Coates CSRV System will promote less engine wear and will require less lubrication over the life of the engine.  In addition,  because the Coates CSRV System does not employ parts which protrude into the engine cylinder,  it is designed with larger openings
into the cylinder than  conventional  poppet valves so that more fuel and air mixture can be inducted  into and expelled from the engine  cylinder in a shorter  period of time using the Coates CSRV System, leading to an ability to operate the engine faster and an  ability to  utilize  higher  compression  ratios  with lower  combustion chamber  temperatures.  Management  believes that as a result,  engines modified with the Coates CSRV System will produce more power than similar  engines  utilizing the poppet valve system. 
	The Coates CSRV System operates on ceramic carbon bearings and seals, the seals and sealing mechanism being activated by variations in combustion chamber pressure.  As a result of employing fewer moving parts as compared to the poppet valve and not protruding into the engine cylinder, management believes that the Coates CSRV System will promote less engine wear and will require less lubrication over the life of the engine.  In addition, because the Coates CSRV System does not employ parts which protrude into the engine cylinder, it is designed with larger openings into the cylinder than conventional poppet valves so that more fuel and air mixture can be inducted into and expelled from the engine cylinder in a shorter period of time using the Coates CSRV Systems, leading to an ability to operate the engine faster and an ability to utilize higher compression ratios with lower combustion chamber temperatures. 

Patents and Licenses:  Coates International, Ltd.

We have received an exclusive Sublicense from our Parent, Coates International, Ltd.  We have also signed an agreement and received a non-exclusive License from George J. Coates, Gregory G. Coates and their family trust.  These agreements effectively give us the ability to exclusively manufacture, assemble and sell our motorcycle products in the Western Hemisphere.  We have the non-exclusive right to use (not manufacture) and sell our motorcycle products in all other parts of the world.  The Sublicense and the License give us the right to utilize all existing patents and future enhancements, whether patentable or not, covering the Coates CSRV System for the duration of the legal life of these patents, generally 20 years.  
A brief history of the patents we are entitled to use shows the early development of this extraordinary technology.  In 1982, George J. Coates obtained a patent from the Republic of Ireland for the Mark I version of the Coates spherical rotary valve SRV Engine for use in piston driven internal combustion engines. In 1986, George J. Coates emigrated to the United States where he commenced development of the Mark II version and subsequently the Mark III version of his spherical rotary valve SRV Engine. Between 1990 and 1994, George J. Coates was issued seven United States patents (the "Coates Patents") with respect to various aspects of the Coates SRV Engines including the Mark II and Mark III version. The Coates Patents are

Mr. Coates continues to have patent applications pending in some of these as well as other foreign countries.


Environmental Regulations
	Our motorcycle engine utilizing the Coates Spherical Rotary Valve will be subject to extensive environmental laws, rules and regulations that impose standards for emissions and safety.  Initial testing of one of our prototype motorcycle engines in June, 2003 by the independent testing facility, Compliance and Research Services, Inc. of Linden, New Jersey, provided the following preliminary results:
Tailpipe Emission Testing Results:

THC (Hydrocarbons):  Applicable U.S. EPA Standard is fixed at a maximum quantity of 5.0 grams per kilometer.
  Coates Motorcycle result:  1.5 grams per kilometer  
CO(Carbon Monoxide):  Applicable U.S. EPA Standard is fixed at a maximum quantity of 12.0 grams per kilometer.
  Coates Motorcycle result:  6.8 grams per kilometer
	Although these preliminary tailpipe emission tests were extremely positive, our motorcycle engine must undergo further testing under other U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board regulations covering emission standards, durability and safety.  We expect to subject our motorcycle engine to these tests during the fall of 2003.
Employees

 Gregory G. Coates, our President, and George J. Coates, our Chief Executive Officer, are devoting as much time as necessary to the organization and development of our business.  They are contributing their services to the Company without compensation until the completion of our Offering.  George J. Coates, the President and controlling shareholder of our Parent, will also serve as our Chief Executive Officer and a director of our Company and  will assist Gregory G. Coates in
the design and construction of our heavy cruiser motorcycles.  Following funding, Gregory G. Coates will devote all of his time to our operations and will be paid a salary and other benefits, the amount of which has yet to be determined.  Mr. George J. Coates will serve as President and generally will be available to us for consultation concerning our operations following funding.  Mr. George J. Coates  will devote his services to us without compensation, although we expect to reimburse him for any expenses incurred while rendering services to us.
	Upon funding from this Offering, we intend to hire a chief financial officer.  In addition, we have budgeted the hiring of approximately twenty employees for our administrative, assembly and sales support operations.

Plan of Operations
�
Business Strategy
  We believe that our heavy cruiser motorcycle, equipped with the Coates Spherical Rotary Engine will successfully compete with other motorcycle products in the domestic market. Our business plan is twofold: first, to successfully complete the testing of our motorcycle, and then to commence assembly and marketing of our motorcycle. We have completed the design and construction of two prototype motorcycles. One has been subjected to a tailpipe emissions test at an independent testing facility and achieved excellent preliminary results. We plan to have our motorcycle undergo all necessary emissions tests, including fuel economy and durability tests by the end of the current calendar year. We are confident that our specially designed engine, employing the Coates Spherical Rotary Valve, will enhance our motorcycle's performance capabilities, permitting us to sell our product in the heavy cruiser motorcycle market.
  We started to accept orders for our motorcycles. After our anticipated successful emissions, fuel economy and durability testing, we are targeting delivery of these motorcycle products to these customers for the second quarter of 2004. We have plans to initially assemble and market approximately 100 of our new heavy cruiser motorcycles within  12 months of raising between $2,500,000 and $3,000,000 in proceeds from this Offering. We expect to sell these motorcycles at retail prices between $25,000 to $30,000 each. We believe that if we succeed in raising the entire $20,000,000 in this Offering, we can assemble and sell between 500 and 750 heavy cruiser motorcycles within 24 months of  closing on our Offering.

  To date, we have utilized funds loaned to us by George J. Coates to finalize the design and construction of our two prototype heavy cruiser motorcycles, equipped with the Coates Spherical Rotary Valve. Mr. Coates has provided approximately $300,000 in funding on a revolving term loan basis. We intend to repay these borrowed funds to Mr. Coates out of the proceeds received from this Offering.
 
  We have made business arrangements with various vendors and manufacturers throughout the United States to provide us with all the parts necessary to assemble and construct our heavy cruiser motorcycles.  As our assembly and market operations grow, we expect to obtain more favorable pricing for our motorcycle parts, based upon economies of scale.  We expect to hire employees for our assembly and marketing distribution operations as we receive funding from this Offering.  See "Use of Proceeds".
Description of Property
  Our Parent, Coates International, Ltd., has provided us with  office and assembly space at its headquarters in Wall, New Jersey, without rental charge. We will pay our Parent a monthly rental fee of $5,000, commencing upon completion of our Offering.  Following the completion of our Offering, we will either continue to lease space from our Parent or relocate to different facilities on a lease basis or purchase a facility to accommodate all of our operations.
	Our Parent's executive  offices  and assembly/inventory facilities are  located  in  an approximately 25,000 square foot one and one-half story building of concrete and steel  construction  on a 6 1/2 acre  site in Wall  Township,  New  Jersey. 

Certain Relationships And Related Transactions
	To date, George J. Coates, our Chief Executive Officer and a Director, loaned the Company approximately $300,000 to fund the design, development and manufacture of our initial prototype and production model motorcycle engines. Our Parent, Coates International, Ltd., has also loaned us approximately $15,000.  We expect to pay back these loans upon the successful completion of this Offering.
	We issued 2,550,000 shares of our common stock to our Parent, Coates International, Ltd., in exchange for its grant to us of the exclusive Sublicense.  In addition, we granted our Parent an anti-dilution right pursuant to which our Parent will have the absolute right to maintain its 50+ % equity ownership for the duration of the Sublicense.  As a result of this issuance and anti-dilution right, we are and will remain for the foreseeable future, a subsidiary of our Parent.  Our Parent will retain its control position after this Offering and even in cases where we issue additional shares of our common stock for various proper corporate purposes in the future.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers
The Registrant's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Article TENTH) contains provisions limiting the liability of its Directors and requiring the Registrant to indemnify all persons whom it has the power to indemnify, to the maximum extent permitted under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "GCL"). In accordance with the GCL, Article TENTH also limits the personal liability of a director to the corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duty as a director except for (a) breaches of the director's duty of loyalty, (b) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law,
(c) effecting of certain unlawful payments related to the corporation's capital stock, and (d) transactions from which the director derived an improper benefit. The provisions of the GCL will not impair the Registrant's ability to seek injunctive relief for breaches of fiduciary duty. Such relief, however, may not always be available as a practical matter.
The GCL also contains provisions giving a corporation broad powers to indemnify officers, directors, employees and agents against liability and for their expenses in defending against threatened liability if the individual acted in good faith and in a manner that he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, if he had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors and officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the Registrant has been advised that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful
defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Coates Motorcycle Company, Ltd.
(A Development Stage Company)
Notes to the Financial Statements
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
  	Nature of Organization
  	Coates Motorcycle Company, Ltd. (The Company) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 21, 1995 under the name of Coates Technologies, Inc.  On March 18, 2003 (date of inception) the Company amended its articles of incorporation to increase its number of available common shares and change its name to Coates Motorcycle Company, Ltd.  Prior to March 18, 2003, the Company had never issued any shares of its common stock and did not have any financial
transactions.  The Company, located in New Jersey, is in the process of designing and manufacturing an initial line of "heavyweight" cruiser motorcycles.

  Development Stage Operations
The Company continues to devote substantially all of its efforts in the development of its "heavyweight" cruiser motorcycles.

  Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Loss Per Share
		Loss per share, in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board No. 128, "Earnings Per Share", is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.

 	Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred.

		Revenue Recognition
 The Company has not recognized any revenue from the sale of motorcycles.  The Company's policy is to recognize revenue when the products are shipped and title passes to the buyer.

 	Income Taxes
In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", deferred taxes are recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income.  Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.  The Company incurred net operating losses for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes.  Accordingly, the benefit from income taxes has been offset by a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset.

INCOME TAXES
 The Company's total deferred tax asset and valuation allowance are as follows at June 30, 2003:

SHARES SUBJECT TO MANDATORY REDEMPTION
Shares subject to mandatory redemption represents a $100,000 contribution to the Company by George J. Coates, the Company's CEO, in exchange for 10,000 shares of the Company's common stock.  The Company has agreed to redeem these shares for $100,000 when the funds are available.

LICENSES
The Company acquired an exclusive sublicense for North America, South America  and Central America and their territories (collectively, the "Western Hemisphere") from Coates International, Ltd. to make, use and sell motorcycles utilizing the Coates technology.  In exchange for this exclusive sublicense, the Company issued 2,550,000 shares of its common stock to Coates International, Ltd. which became by virtue of such issuance the parent corporation of the Company. 
 
The Company also entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with the Coates Family Trust, George J. Coates and Gregory G. Coates to use and sell (not make or manufacture) motorcycles employing the Coates CSRV System in all countries of the world except in the Western Hemisphere.  In exchange for this non-exclusive license the Company issued to George J. Coates, Gregory G. Coates and the Coates Family Trust an aggregate of 2,500,000 shares of its common stock.

As no readily determinable price existed of either the licenses or the common stock of the Company, no value was assigned to the above transactions.

DUE TO OFFICER  
  Due to officer represents non-interest bearing advances due on demand from an officer.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION

in WallTownship, New Jersey.  The Company will commence  payments upon completion of its
