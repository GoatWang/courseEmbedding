Former Nycomed CEO Hakan Bjorklund to chair Lundbeck
Mats Pettersson to step down in March

Lundbeck chairman Mats Pettersson has said he will not seek re-election at the company's annual general meeting on March 21, 2013. Pettersson has been in the role for two years and looks likely to be replaced by independent board member Hakan Bjorklund - who has agreed to step up to the chairman position and has the backing of the Danish company's board of directors. Bjorklund has been a member of the board at Lundbeck since March 2011 and was formerly chief executive of Denmark's Nycomed before it was taken over by Japanese pharma group Takeda. News of the switch comes as Lundbeck is in the midst of a difficult period precipitated by the loss of patent protection on the antidepressant Lexapro (escitalopram) and Alzheimer's treatment Ebixa (memantine) in the US, where they are sold by partner Forest Laboratories. Lundbeck faces even more difficult times ahead when escitalopram loses patent protection next year in Europe, where it is sold as Cipralex, while the company is also facing patent expiries for Parkinson's disease treatment Azilect (rasagline) from 2015. At a time when bringing new products through the pipeline is the clear priority, Bjorklund's R&D experience - including a long stint as head of research at Astra AB (now AstraZeneca) - seems to be a good option. The company could secure US approval for a long-acting depot formulation of its Otsuka-partnered schizophrenia drug Abilify (aripiprazole) by the end of this month, but the highlight in the pipeline is its new-generation antidepressant Brintellix (vortioxetine) which could be launched later in the year. Following behind are two other phase III candidates - brexpiprazole for schizophrenia and clotbuster desmoteplase - that if successful could also help the company recover from its patent cliff. "Lundbeck holds a unique and strong position in the development of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of brain disorders, which is one of the greatest health challenges of the 21st century," says Bjorklund. "I look forward to contributing to Lundbeck's progress and future growth in my role as chairman."

Hakan Bjorklund, CEO of Nycomed, talks growth

             This interview was conducted by Adam Burns on behalf of MeetTheBoss TV. Adam Burns: So Nycomed reported a solid start to 2009 and then sustained profits in the second quarter. I have a quote here. You said, ‘The trading environment will remain challenging for the year, but we believe in our strategy of identifying and in-licensing, promising new products and expanding our focus on emerging markets.’ In light of the sort of current economic conditions, how flexible has that strategy needed to be? Hakan Bjorklund: I think it's important to think of the strategy as a long-term or a mid-term strategy, where you don’t make dramatic changes because of short-term changes in the environment. We haven’t changed it. But of course the strategy is also there for you to be able to improvise around it. So a certain degree of flexibility is of course necessary. But a situation like this with an economic crisis does not only provide you with challenges, it also provides you with opportunities. Adam Burns: So how about the senior team? In tough times, everybody perhaps needs an arm around him or her. How have you been keeping the energy up there? Hakan Bjorklund:

Wehaven’t changed it. But of course thestrategy is also there for you to be able toimprovise around it. So a certain degreeof ﬂexibility is of course necessary.But asituation like this with an economic crisisdoes not only provide you withchallenges, it also provides you withopportunities.Adam Burns: So how about the seniorteam? In tough times, everybodyperhaps needs an arm around him or her.How have you been keeping the energyup there?Hakan Bjorklund:Well ﬁrst of all, most of the seniormanagement team has been together forquite some time. We know one anothervery well. We have developed a strategytogether, and that I think is veryimportant. This is not a strategy which iscoming from above and which is sort ofpresented to people, ‘This is the way youshould do it.’ Everyone has been part ofdeveloping it and I think that makespeople motivated.Then at the end of theday it’s also a question of how youmanage people. I think I have amanagement style which is based onempowerment and delegation. I thinkthat is essential for motivation at the endof the day.Adam Burns: You say that most of theteam has been together for a long time.It’s interesting because there are sort ofvarious schools of thought around that.Some people say, ‘No, teams need to bekept fresh so they’re energetic,’ andother people say, ‘No, no, no, keep themtogether because you develop anempathy.’Hakan Bjorklund: Well when I say thatmost of the team has been together for along time, I guess maybe you shouldtake that with a grain of salt. Half of ushave been together for probably aboutseven, eight, ten years. But we also havethe head of R&D who has been with usfor three years, head of sales andmarketing who has been with us forabout 12 months. So I think we have agood combination of people who havebeen in the company for quite some timeand people who come from the outside,but still very experienced people in theindustry, but with a differentbackground. I think that is a goodcombination.‘‘I believe in a lot of interaction, andI believe in a lot of informal interac-tion.’’Adam Burns: Of course. And what aboutyourself? This is your 11th year atNycomed. How do you keep it fresh? Isit still a challenge for you?Hakan Bjorklund: Well it’s been 11 yearswith Nycomed, that’s true, and when Iget this question which happens nowthat I’m a CEO, I get a little surprisedthat it is 11 years because it doesn’t feellike 11 years. Maybe it looks like 11years.I think the difference betweenNycomed 11 years ago and today isdramatic.

Mr. Björklund was retained by Avista Capital Partners in October 2011.  Mr. Björklund is the former CEO of Nycomed, which was sold to Takeda Pharmaceuticals in September 2011 for 9.6 billion euros.  Mr. Björklund worked closely with the Avista team on the development of Nycomed prior to its sale to Takeda.  Under Mr. Björklund’s leadership, Nycomed grew from a predominantly Scandinavian business into a global pharmaceutical company with leading market positions in Europe, Russia/CIS, Brazil and Latin America.  In 2006, Mr. Björklund led the integration of Altana Pharmaceutical, a German-based company that was acquired by Nycomed for 4.2 billion euros.  He was also instrumental in growing Nycomed in emerging markets, including through the acquisition of Guangdong Techpool Bio-Pharma Co., Ltd, a Chinese bio-pharmaceutical company, in 2010.
Prior to Nycomed, Mr. Björklund was Regional Director at Astra (now AstraZeneca) and, earlier, President of Astra Draco.  Mr. Björklund is Chairman of the Board of Directors at Acino International AG, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB and Trimb Holding AB and is a member of the Board of Directors of Alere Inc. and Coloplast A/S.  Mr. Björklund was formerly Chairman of H.

Avista Capital Partners has added Hakan Bjorklund as healthcare operating executive, the firm announced Thursday. Bjorklund was previously chief executive of Nycomed, a former Avista portfolio company that was sold to Takeda Pharmaceuticals.
PRESS RELEASE
Avista Capital Partners, a leading private equity firm, today announced that it has hired Hakan Bjorklund, the departing Chief Executive Officer of Nycomed, as Healthcare Operating Executive.  Mr. Bjorklund worked closely with Avista on the development of Nycomed during Avista’s ownership of the company, which was recently sold to Takeda Pharmaceuticals Company Limited for Euro 9.6 billion.
Under Mr. Bjorklund’s leadership, Nycomed was transformed from a predominantly Scandinavian business into a global pharmaceutical company with leading market positions in Europe, Russia/CIS, Brazil and Latin America.  In 2006, Mr. Bjorklund led the integration of Altana Pharmaceutical, a German-based company that Nycomed purchased for Euro 4.2 billion. He was also instrumental in growing Nycomed in emerging markets, most recently through the acquisition of Guangdong Techpool Bio-Pharma Co., Ltd, a fast growing Chinese bio-pharmaceutical company, in 2010.    
Thompson Dean, Co-Managing Partner and Chief Executive Officer of Avista, said, “We are delighted to welcome Hakan to Avista.  One of the top pharmaceutical executives in Europe, he possesses a deep understanding of the global healthcare market.  Having worked closely with him for many years, I know that Hakan will bring extensive strategic, operational and investment expertise to Avista as well as strong relationships throughout the global healthcare sector.”     





Newton Aguiar, the partner in charge of Avista’s European operations, added, “We are looking forward to working with Hakan on healthcare investments both in Europe and throughout the world.  Hakan built Nycomed into one of the fastest growing global pharmaceutical companies, in part, by expanding its presence in key emerging markets, particularly in Russia/CIS and Latin America.  His experience will be invaluable to the healthcare management teams in Avista’s portfolio as they seek to grow their own businesses.”    
Mr. Bjorklund said, “This is a very exciting opportunity. Avista is a leading private equity healthcare investor with a long track record of successful investments in the pharmaceutical, medical device, and healthcare services sectors.  As CEO of Nycomed, I was deeply impressed by the sector expertise and supportive ownership philosophy that Avista brings to its investments.  I am looking forward to helping other leading healthcare companies reach their full potential as a member of the Avista team.”
Before joining Nycomed, Mr. Bjorklund was Regional Director at Astra (now AstraZeneca) and, earlier, President of Astra Draco.  He is a member of the Board of Directors of Coloplast A/S, Lundbeck A/S, and Atos Medical AB. He was also a director at Danisco A/S until its recent acquisition by Dupont.  He holds a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden.
In addition to Nycomed, Avista’s portfolio of healthcare companies includes INC Research, a leading clinical research organization; ConvaTec, a global leader in ostomy and wound care; Lantheus, a leader in diagnostic imaging; Navilyst Medical, a manufacturer and distributor of single-use fluid management and venous-access medical devices; BioReliance, a leading contract services provider focused on biological safety testing, toxicology, viral manufacturing, and laboratory animal diagnostic services; and VWR International, a leading global distributor of equipment and consumable supplies to the laboratory sector across all industries.  In addition, during its time at DLJ Merchant Banking Partners, the Avista team was significantly involved in a variety of healthcare investments, including medical device companies such as Accellent and Kinetic Concepts; healthcare services companies such as Focus Diagnostics, Charles River Laboratories, and Fisher Scientific International; and pharmaceutical companies such as Warner Chilcott and Prometheus Laboratories.

Under Mr. Bjorklund's leadership, Nycomed was transformed from a predominantly Scandinavian business into a global pharmaceutical company with leading market positions in Europe, Russia/CIS, Brazil and Latin America.  In 2006, Mr. Bjorklund led the integration of Altana Pharmaceutical, a German-based company that Nycomed purchased for Euro 4.2 billion. He was also instrumental in growing Nycomed in emerging markets, most recently through the acquisition of Guangdong Techpool Bio-Pharma Co., Ltd, a fast growing Chinese bio-pharmaceutical company, in 2010.     
Thompson Dean, Co-Managing Partner and Chief Executive Officer of Avista, said, "We are delighted to welcome Hakan to Avista.  One of the top pharmaceutical executives in Europe, he possesses a deep understanding of the global healthcare market.  Having worked closely with him for many years, I know that Hakan will bring extensive strategic, operational and investment expertise to Avista as well as strong relationships throughout the global healthcare sector."    
Newton Aguiar, the partner in charge of Avista's European operations, added, "We are looking forward to working with Hakan on healthcare investments both in Europe and throughout the world.  Hakan built Nycomed into one of the fastest growing global pharmaceutical companies, in part, by expanding its presence in key emerging markets, particularly in Russia/CIS and Latin America.  His experience will be invaluable to the healthcare management teams in Avista's portfolio as they seek to grow their own businesses."     
Mr. Bjorklund said, "This is a very exciting opportunity. Avista is a leading private equity healthcare investor with a long track record of successful investments in the pharmaceutical, medical device, and healthcare services sectors.  As CEO of Nycomed, I was deeply impressed by the sector expertise and supportive ownership philosophy that Avista brings to its investments.  I am looking forward to helping other leading healthcare companies reach their full potential as a member of the Avista team."
Before joining Nycomed, Mr. Bjorklund was Regional Director at Astra (now AstraZeneca) and, earlier, President of Astra Draco.  He is a member of the Board of Directors of Coloplast A/S, Lundbeck A/S, and Atos Medical AB. He was also a director at Danisco A/S until its recent acquisition by Dupont.  He holds a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden.
In addition to Nycomed, Avista's portfolio of healthcare companies includes INC Research, a leading clinical research organization; ConvaTec, a global leader in ostomy and wound care; Lantheus, a leader in diagnostic imaging; Navilyst Medical, a manufacturer and distributor of single-use fluid management and venous-access medical devices; BioReliance, a leading contract services provider focused on biological safety testing, toxicology, viral manufacturing, and laboratory animal diagnostic services; and VWR International, a leading global distributor of equipment and consumable supplies to the laboratory sector across all industries.  In addition, during its time at DLJ Merchant Banking Partners, the Avista team was significantly involved in a variety of healthcare investments, including medical device companies such as Accellent and Kinetic Concepts; healthcare services companies such as Focus Diagnostics, Charles River Laboratories, and Fisher Scientific International; and pharmaceutical companies such as Warner Chilcott and Prometheus Laboratories.
