Why Choose Snaptactix?







So far I have two products from Jimmy, Doodly and Pixel Studio FX. I really appreciate that he keeps working on improving the products and listens to his customers needs as well. I would highly recommend him and am looking forward to reading the articles on this page.

I was looking for a software at a decent price that was able to produce amazing videos with custom images, characters and props, and then I step on Doodly at a super reasonable amount of money and my dreams finally manage to come true. Mr Jimmy Kim, you made my day! I am really impressed by the simplicity of the interface of your software, and by the quality of the work carried out by your designers. I love you all, guys. Please keep up the good work!

                Antonio Pieri                                   

for Doodly                





What I especially like about products purchased from Jimmy Kim, is that after I purchased my initial products, I continue to get valuable updates and training on how to use my purchase. It’s refreshing to receive ongoing emails with valuable, useful tips, without having every email offering requesting another purchase. Just ongoing pure content. Through special Social Media resources, Jimmy offers ongoing access to his knowledge without having to always pay for 1 to 1 coaching. Added value. Because of his integrity, knowledge and experience, I will indeed purchase future products he offers and suggests that help build my business. Thank You Jimmy!

for Snaptactix                





I have a few of Jimmy Kim’s products and I must admit they are pretty good and easy to follow. Wish I had the cash to get more. There are some innovators that I follow and Jimmy is one of them that is a must. more power to him.

for Snaptactix                





I have purchased three of Jimmy’s products so far. Doodly Pro, Pixel Studio FX and Leads Tunnel. My favorite is Doodly. It’s a lot of fun to play with. I really enjoy the quality of his products and the training provided. I’m new to the IM world and am in the process of getting everything set up to help my wife market the product she is currently writing. I’m sure that Jimmy’s products will help me succeed.

for Snaptactix                





I’ve been following Jimmy Kim for a while now, and recently bought my first product from him, Doodly!. Two things to say…
1 – Doodly! is a pretty darn good product. I make a lot of videos for clients and i use many video tools. Many times it takes a long time to produce a video, but sometimes I need it fast. The strength of Doodly! is its simple to use interface, with a very strong engine behind it. The simplicity allows more users to benefit from it and makes video creation much faster. The strong engine lets me put out high quality videos. Win-win!
2 – I never know until a first purchase what the vendor Really is like – most just want to sell me something and then move on to sell the next thing. It gives this industry a bad name. I’m very happy to report that Jimmy Kim is one of those rare gems who actually continues to stand behind – and improve – his products. And Jimmy shows that he cares about his customers. I can’t do much better than that!

                Alan Parker                                   

for Doodly                





I bought Doodly recently. It’s a fantastic, uncomplicated bit of software that allows the user to create sketch-type doodles, explainer videos. I’ve been super impressed with the ongoing support of this relatively inexpensive bit of software and the continual updates.
I hate leaving five star/excellent reviews because they always seem phony to me but Doodly really deserves it.

                Peter Bestel
