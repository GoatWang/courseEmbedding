August 20, 2009
Jacob Gaffney

The buildings, located along the Stemmons Freeway, contain 227,000 square feet and went for $6,675m. The first order of business for EastGroup is to change the names of the building, which are 87% occupied by six clients, to Interstate Distribution Center V, VI and VII.

Fannie Mae: from legacy to startup


        You'd be forgiven for thinking that a quasi-federal agency founded in the 1930s is the last place you’d describe using words like innovative or agile. But you’d be wrong. Defying all stereotypes, Fannie Mae’s recent actions read a lot more like a startup than a $2.8 billion company with more than 7,000 employees. In the last two years, the company has implemented a user experience strategy, adopted design thinking and accelerated time to market for an innovative array of products.

Prime status: an update on luxury residential real estate


Deborah Huso


Real Estate


        In the years leading up to the housing bubble of 2007, it seemed like everyone was getting a piece of the American Dream of homeownership (or maybe even second homeownership). Ten years after the Great Recession, how is luxury residential real estate faring? Was the recent market slowdown just a temporary blip on the radar and will the sector continue to draw the aspirational interest of buyers as it did in the early to mid-2000s?
      


Commentary

Convert leads like a top producer



Casey Cunningham


Lending


        Most mortgage professionals know that the client feels a sense of loyalty to the first person they speak with. When they establish themselves as the first contact, loan officers gain a critical sales advantage. In fact, speed-to-call is the single largest driver of conversion for new customer leads. 
Studies show that returning a call from a new customer within the first 30 minutes produces an average of a 62% increase in conversion rates.
