Debt Settlement
Debt settlement, also known as debt 
		  arbitration, debt negotiation or credit settlement is an approach to 
		  debt reduction in which the debtor and creditor agree on a reduced 
		  balance that will be regarded as payment in full.

		  Debt settlement is often confused with debt consolidation. In debt 
		  consolidation, the consumer makes monthly payments to the debt 
		  consolidator, who takes a small fee and passes the rest on to the 
		  creditors; this way, creditors continue to receive payments each 
		  month. In debt settlement, the consumer makes one reduced payment or 
		  several monthly payments on an agreed upon, reduced amount until the 
		  debt is settled in full.

		  The creditors get nothing until they decide to settle. Furthermore, 
		  the debt settlement company usually instructs the consumer not to make 
		  any payments to creditors. The intended effect is to scare creditors 
		  into settling the debt for less than the full amount.

		  In addition to recovering funds on behalf of clients for over 25 years 
		  HF Holdings, Inc. also negotiates on behalf of companies that OWE 
		  money to creditors. We charge a fee of 20% of the amount by which the 
		  outstanding balance owed is reduced. It's that simple.

		  HF Holdings, Inc. has been negotiating settlements on past due 
		  accounts for over 25 years, so if your business is struggling to make 
		  ends meet and you would like to have a team of professionals negotiate 
		  on your behalf against a collection agency or attorney, fill out the 
		  for below and we will contact you within 24 hours.

		  There are no upfront fees and no fee owed to our company if we fail to 
		  negotiate a settlement agreeable to you.

Our Services

		  Our Debt Recovery Service consists of three phases
Phase One
Within 24 hours of placing an account, 
		  the following will happen:
The first of four letters is sent to the debtor via US Mail. Your case 
		  will be placed into the workload of one of our on staff collectors. 
		  Our collector will attempt to contact the debtor and produce a 
		  resolution to the matter. Expect our collector to place daily phone 
		  calls, the first 14 to 21 days, in an attempt to contact the debtor. 
		  If all attempts to reach a conclusion to the account fail, we go to 
		  Phase Two where we immediately forward the case to one of our 
		  affiliated attorneys, located within the debtor’s jurisdiction.



Phase Two
Upon our office sending your case to one of our affiliated attorneys, you can expect the following:
The receiving attorney or one of his staff members will immediately 
		  start attempting to contact the debtor via the phone, in addition to 
		  the series of letters. If all attempts to reach a conclusion to the 
		  account continue to fail, we will send you a letter explaining the 
		  issues surrounding the case and what we recommend for the next and 
		  final step.



Phase Three
Our recommendation will be one of two things.
If after a thorough investigation of the facts surrounding the case 
		  and of the debtors assets, we determine the possibility of recovery is 
		  not likely we will recommend closure of the case. You will owe nothing 
		  to our firm or our affiliated attorney for these results.

If our recommendation is litigation you will have a decision to make. 
		  If you decide not to proceed with legal action we will drop the case 
		  and you will owe our firm or our affiliated attorney nothing. If you 
		  decide to proceed with legal action, you will be required to pay the 
		  upfront legal costs such as court costs, filing fees, etc., these fees 
		  vary depending on the debtor's jurisdiction. Upon payment of these 
		  funds, our affiliated attorney will file a lawsuit on your behalf for 
		  all monies owed including but not limited to the cost to file this 
		  action.

If our attempts to collect via litigation fail, the case will be 
		  closed. You will owe nothing to our firm or our affiliated attorney.

Invoice Factoring
What is HF Holdings, Inc. Financing?
		  HF Holdings, Inc. financing is a method used by businesses of all 
		  sizes to convert sales on credit terms for immediate cash flow. A 
		  company sells its invoices at a discount to their face value when it 
		  calculates that it will be better off using the proceeds to bolster 
		  its own growth than it would be by effectively functioning as its 
		  "customer's bank." The receivable line of credit is determined by the 
		  financial strength of the customer (Buyer), not the client (The seller 
		  of the receivables).

What basic qualifications does a business need to have in 
		  order to be a candidate for factoring?



			  Business qualifications for receivable 
			  financing are usually low.

			  You must be selling to other creditworthy 
			  businesses.

			  The product or service must have been 
			  delivered and accepted.
			  

			  The factor must be able to obtain a 
			  priority collateral position on the receivables.
			  

You, the customer, may not have any rights to 
		  return or offset payment on the product or service. The factoring 
		  business looks at the credit rating of the company that owes the debt. 
		  It is often easier to get business financing through factoring than it 
		  is to get a small business loan.

		  Many of our clients are attempting to find a solution to finance their 
		  growth or whose past earnings will not justify a traditional loan or 
		  line of credit increase.

		  HF Holdings, Inc. Financing is now available in days, not weeks.

		  The approval process is simple and initial funding, many times, can be 
		  received in 1 to 5 working days.
		  Contact us today at 1-877-680-6064 for invoice factoring, financing 
		  solutions that will help take your business to the next level!
Stop functioning as your "customer's bank." 
		  Click here to fill out our 
		  factoring application, or if you have any questions you can call us 
		  now at 1-877-680-6064 or fill out our contact form to the left.

Are You Personally Liable for Your Business's Debts?




Learn whether a business creditor can come after your house, bank account, or other personal property.


By Beth Laurence, J.D.

If your business is having trouble paying its bills, you may be worried about whether a creditor can come after your personal assets. Can a creditor raid your personal bank account? Garnish your wages? Foreclose on your house?
To answer these questions you need to understand whether you are personally liable for your business's debts. There is a huge difference between debts that only your business is liable for and those that you are legally responsible to pay from your personal assets. If you aren't personally liable for your business's debts, you have a lot less to worry about: a creditor can only go after your business's bank account and assets if your business doesn't pay its bills; creditors can't take your home or other personal property. But if you find out you are personally liable for your business's debts, you have a lot more to lose.
Which debts are you personally liable for? Most important, know that every business owner who has employees, no matter whether the business is organized as a corporation, LLC, partnership, or sole proprietorship, is personally liable if the business doesn't pay the taxes it withheld from employees' paychecks. (For more about why paying these taxes is always your first priority, see Nolo's article on Prioritizing Debt Payments.)
For other types of business debts, your business structure as well as what kind of contract or purchase order you signed usually determines whether or not you're personally liable for a business debt. Let's take a look.
Sole Proprietorships and Partnerships
If you're operating your business as a sole proprietorship (or "DBA" or as an independent contractor), you and your business are legally the same, which is another way of saying that you personally owe every penny that your business can't pay. So if your business doesn't have enough cash or assets to pay its debts, creditors can, and sometimes will, take your personal assets -- or at least the assets that aren't protected by state exemption laws. (See Nolo's article What Can Creditors Do If You Don't Pay?)
This is also generally true for general partnerships -- the partnership debt belongs to each partner personally -- with this added twist: Each partner is personally liable for 100% of the business's debts. This means that if there aren't enough business assets to pay the partnership's debts, and your partners are broke, creditors can take your partner's personal assets to pay all of the business's debts, not just your pro rata share of the debts.
Corporations and LLCs
If your business is organized as a corporation or LLC, you and your business are separate legal entities. As such, in theory you could have no personal liability for the debts of your business, meaning that creditors can't take your house or other personal assets to pay your business's debts, even if your business can't pay them.

EXAMPLE: Jean's Book Shoppe, Inc., orders books from 80 publishers and three wholesalers before the business tanks. Unable to pay its expenses, the corporation declares bankruptcy. The publishers' and wholesalers' bills are all unsecured debts of the corporation, and Jean, the corporation's sole shareholder, is not personally responsible for paying any of them. In the bankruptcy, the store's inventory will be sold to the highest bidder. The proceeds will be used to pay the costs of bankruptcy and the Book Shoppe's creditors, who may be fortunate to receive a few cents on the dollar.

However, there are many ways for a shareholder or LLC member to become personally liable for business debts; in fact, most owners of small businesses are personally liable for at least some business debts. Here are the most common ways the owner of a corporation or LLC can become personally liable.
Signing a Personal Guarantee
Because most suppliers, banks, and landlords know that shareholders or LLC members don't have personal liability for the corporation or LLC's debts, they often won't extend credit or loan money to a small LLC or corporation without the owner's personal guarantee. If you signed a personal guarantee for a particular loan, lease, or contract, you promised that you would pay it personally if your business did not. Put another way, every time you personally guaranteed that you would repay a debt, you deliberately gave up your limited liability for that debt. You volunteered to let the creditor sue you to take your personal assets if the business couldn't pay the debt.
Check to see if you signed a personal guarantee on all of your business contracts; for example, a loan for a business vehicle or business equipment, trade terms with a supplier, a bank line of credit, or a commercial lease.
Offering Your Property as Collateral
Banks typically require the owners of small corporations or LLCs to put up their house or other real estate as security for a loan. If you secured a business loan or debt by pledging property such as a house, boat, or car, you are personally liable for the debt, and if your business defaults on the loan, the lender or creditor can sue you to foreclose on the property and use the proceeds to repay the debt.
Signing a Contract in Your Own Name
You may also have given up your limited liability if you were careless about signing purchase agreements and service contracts. Sometimes these agreements display the personal name of the business owner without the name of the corporation or LLC. If you signed an agreement in your personal name and not on behalf of the corporation or LLC, you're personally liable for the underlying debt, even if it was the supplier's mistake. If you're not sure whether you have given a personal guarantee on an agreement or loan, check both the language of the agreement and the signature block to see whether you signed it in your name or in your capacity as an owner or officer.

Example: Talia signs a loan contract as Talia Finke, CEO of Book Nook, Inc., so only her business is liable to repay the loan. But she signs her commercial lease as just Talia Finke, so she will be personally liable to the landlord if her business can't pay the rent.

Using Credit Cards or Personal Loans to Fund the Business
You may have used credit cards or home equity loans to obtain funds for your business, which definitely means you are personally liable for those debts. (You are almost always personally responsible for making payments on your credit cards, even if they have your business name on them, under the terms of the application you signed.)
Fraud, Misrepresentations, or Sloppy Recordkeeping
If you personally misrepresented or lied about any facts when you were applying for a loan or credit on behalf of your corporation or LLC, you could be held personally liable for the debt. Likewise, if you failed to maintain a formal legal separation between your business and your personal financial affairs, creditors could try to hold you personally responsible for the business's debts under a theory known as "piercing the corporate veil." This happens when a court finds that your corporation or LLC is really just a sham and that it is you personally operating the business. One way creditors try to pierce the corporate veil is by showing that you didn't observe the formalities imposed on corporations and LLCs by state law. For instance, you may have made important corporate or LLC decisions without recording them in minutes of a meeting. Or you may have paid a number of the business's bills out of your personal checkbook or with a personal credit card. Even corporations or LLCs owned by a single individual or a married couple have to obey these rules and formalities.
What Can You Do If You Can't Pay Debts You're Personaly Liable For?
If you've determined you're personally liable for all or some of your business's debts, you risk being sued personally for the debt. What are the chances of this? For more information, see Nolo's article What Can Creditors Do if You Don't Pay?
If you think it's likely you'll be sued, you'll want to make sure that your business pays the debts off, either in full or by negotiating a settlement for less than you owe. (You want to be careful here: your spouse or partner may be liable for your business debts.)
If that's not possible, you may be able to file for Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy to wipe out your personal liability for your business debts, or use another option, like an "assignment for the benefit of creditors" or liquidating your business yourself.
For more information on your options, see Nolo's article on what your best strategy is or Nolo's book Save Your Small Business: 10 Crucial Strategies to Survive Hard Times or Close Down and Move On, by Ralph Warner and Bethany K. Laurence (Nolo).

Liability for Business Debts










 





There is a big difference between debts that only your business owes and debts that you (and perhaps your spouse) are personally responsible to repay. Understanding which debts you are personally liable for will help you determine whether to take them on in the first place and  how to deal with them if you can't pay them. While deciding not to pay any business debt comes with consequences, not paying some types of debt has worse consequences than not paying others. Knowing which is which is vital to protecting your personal assets.

Debt Settlement
Debt settlement, also known as debt 
		  arbitration, debt negotiation or credit settlement is an approach to 
		  debt reduction in which the debtor and creditor agree on a reduced 
		  balance that will be regarded as payment in full.

		  Debt settlement is often confused with debt consolidation. In debt 
		  consolidation, the consumer makes monthly payments to the debt 
		  consolidator, who takes a small fee and passes the rest on to the 
		  creditors; this way, creditors continue to receive payments each 
		  month. In debt settlement, the consumer makes one reduced payment or 
		  several monthly payments on an agreed upon, reduced amount until the 
		  debt is settled in full.

		  The creditors get nothing until they decide to settle. Furthermore, 
		  the debt settlement company usually instructs the consumer not to make 
		  any payments to creditors. The intended effect is to scare creditors 
		  into settling the debt for less than the full amount.

		  In addition to recovering funds on behalf of clients for over 25 years 
		  HF Holdings, Inc. also negotiates on behalf of companies that OWE 
		  money to creditors. We charge a fee of 20% of the amount by which the 
		  outstanding balance owed is reduced. It's that simple.

		  HF Holdings, Inc. has been negotiating settlements on past due 
		  accounts for over 25 years, so if your business is struggling to make 
		  ends meet and you would like to have a team of professionals negotiate 
		  on your behalf against a collection agency or attorney, fill out the 
		  for below and we will contact you within 24 hours.

		  There are no upfront fees and no fee owed to our company if we fail to 
		  negotiate a settlement agreeable to you.

Our Services

		  Our Debt Recovery Service consists of three phases
Phase One
Within 24 hours of placing an account, 
		  the following will happen:
The first of four letters is sent to the debtor via US Mail. Your case 
		  will be placed into the workload of one of our on staff collectors. 
		  Our collector will attempt to contact the debtor and produce a 
		  resolution to the matter. Expect our collector to place daily phone 
		  calls, the first 14 to 21 days, in an attempt to contact the debtor. 
		  If all attempts to reach a conclusion to the account fail, we go to 
		  Phase Two where we immediately forward the case to one of our 
		  affiliated attorneys, located within the debtor’s jurisdiction.



Phase Two
Upon our office sending your case to one of our affiliated attorneys, you can expect the following:
The receiving attorney or one of his staff members will immediately 
		  start attempting to contact the debtor via the phone, in addition to 
		  the series of letters. If all attempts to reach a conclusion to the 
		  account continue to fail, we will send you a letter explaining the 
		  issues surrounding the case and what we recommend for the next and 
		  final step.



Phase Three
Our recommendation will be one of two things.
If after a thorough investigation of the facts surrounding the case 
		  and of the debtors assets, we determine the possibility of recovery is 
		  not likely we will recommend closure of the case. You will owe nothing 
		  to our firm or our affiliated attorney for these results.

If our recommendation is litigation you will have a decision to make. 
		  If you decide not to proceed with legal action we will drop the case 
		  and you will owe our firm or our affiliated attorney nothing. If you 
		  decide to proceed with legal action, you will be required to pay the 
		  upfront legal costs such as court costs, filing fees, etc., these fees 
		  vary depending on the debtor's jurisdiction. Upon payment of these 
		  funds, our affiliated attorney will file a lawsuit on your behalf for 
		  all monies owed including but not limited to the cost to file this 
		  action.

If our attempts to collect via litigation fail, the case will be 
		  closed. You will owe nothing to our firm or our affiliated attorney.

Invoice Factoring
What is HF Holdings, Inc. Financing?
		  HF Holdings, Inc. financing is a method used by businesses of all 
		  sizes to convert sales on credit terms for immediate cash flow. A 
		  company sells its invoices at a discount to their face value when it 
		  calculates that it will be better off using the proceeds to bolster 
		  its own growth than it would be by effectively functioning as its 
		  "customer's bank." The receivable line of credit is determined by the 
		  financial strength of the customer (Buyer), not the client (The seller 
		  of the receivables).

What basic qualifications does a business need to have in 
		  order to be a candidate for factoring?



			  Business qualifications for receivable 
			  financing are usually low.

			  You must be selling to other creditworthy 
			  businesses.

			  The product or service must have been 
			  delivered and accepted.
			  

			  The factor must be able to obtain a 
			  priority collateral position on the receivables.
			  

You, the customer, may not have any rights to 
		  return or offset payment on the product or service. The factoring 
		  business looks at the credit rating of the company that owes the debt. 
		  It is often easier to get business financing through factoring than it 
		  is to get a small business loan.

		  Many of our clients are attempting to find a solution to finance their 
		  growth or whose past earnings will not justify a traditional loan or 
		  line of credit increase.

		  HF Holdings, Inc. Financing is now available in days, not weeks.

		  The approval process is simple and initial funding, many times, can be 
		  received in 1 to 5 working days.
		  Contact us today at 1-877-680-6064 for invoice factoring, financing 
		  solutions that will help take your business to the next level!
Stop functioning as your "customer's bank." 
		  Click here to fill out our 
		  factoring application, or if you have any questions you can call us 
		  now at 1-877-680-6064 or fill out our contact form to the left.
