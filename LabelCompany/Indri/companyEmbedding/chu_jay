It was an absolutely incredible night with so many talented musicians and amazing friends in attendance to support. And a personally significant venue to boot - the place where the night's lineup all pretty much met and started making music together. A truly meaningful night that showed how much we all grew over the last year. That means you, Amanda Cogan, Andrew... Begin, Gabriela Aparicio, Kimo Shim, Levi Dean. Let's continue making every day memorable - the beginning of something that keeps growing more beautiful and amazing. Here's a video of the first song I wrote after I moved to San Diego 2 years ago, featuring the fabulous Gabriela Aparicio on backup vocals, and my kick-ass band: Cristobal Luna on bass, Michael Husoski on guitar, and Eric Fay on drums. This was our last show with Eric before he goes on tour with Stomp, so it was a bittersweet show for us as well. And finally, special thanks to a special friend for taking this video.

I know this is LONGGG overdue, but I wanted to thank all the amazing people who made this release show such a great success. This show was the culmination of over 1.5 years worth of work in the making, from developing the record concept to bringing these songs to life on stage. I don't quite know how to describe in words what this whole process was like, but it was certainly an incredible journey that wo...uldn't have been possible without so many people. So here goes: Although he wasn't able to be at this show, so much gratitude goes out to my producer Alex Wong for making this record a reality for me. Shoutout to Eddie Jackson for putting his magic touch on the final masters. I hope this won't be the last time we work together! Thanks to the Tin Roof San Diego, their management, and Jake Jakovich Skolnick for allowing me to host this milestone event at their amazing venue.  My band was simply outstanding in every right, who learned an entire set of my original songs in a month over a few practices: Cristobal Luna on bass, Michael Husoski on guitar, Eric Fay on drums, Kimo Shim on percussion, and Serina Chang on cello/piano. My super talented openers who I also have the privilege of calling my friends and sharing a stage with on a regular basis: Amanda Cogan (who shared her badass hosting skills at this release show), Andrew Begin (who doubled as an emergency guitar tech when I broke a string right before the show), and Gabriela Aparicio (whose other artistic abilities were also called into action). Love you guys! Carol Cabrera, Ryan Gray, and El Desaparecido - you guys are first and foremost friends, but I also love that you're the best fans I could ever have. Thanks for sacrificing your time to help with the merch table instead of being able to relax and enjoy the show. This release show would not have been the success it was without your help! Thanks to Agape Films for their work on this highlight film and documenting the event on hours and hours worth of footage that I am looking forward to seeing. Potential behind-the-scenes watching party maybe? Special shout out to those who showed up from out-of-town - a couple of which were complete surprises! Ryan J.R. McHale and Vik Jaitly from back home on the east coast, and of course Kevin Tjho and Sharon Tran, who I also owe so much to for making sure I wasn't homeless over the 9 days of recording back when I first began making this album.  Lastly, to my family and my friends on both coasts and around the world - thank you so much for your support over all these years. There's still a long road ahead, but the light at the end of the tunnel shines brighter because of you guys. If I forgot anyone, please feel free to call me out on it - I didn't mean to, I promise!

Cristobal Luna on bass (5 shows in one day?!?), Michael Husoski on guitar, Eric Fay on drums, Kimo Shim on cajon, and special guest Sarah Kim on violin who whooped my ass in our little duel.
