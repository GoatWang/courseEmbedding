        Dilution is a very real risk for REIT investors.
        I discuss the capital offering and whether investors should take advantage of the drop in Annaly Capital’s valuation.
        Mortgage real estate investment trust Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (NLY) completed a share offering in July that saw the company’s share price dive sharply lower. Despite the drop in valuation on the back of the capital raise, Annaly Capital’s shares are still far from being a bargain, selling for a premium to the last reported accounting book value. What should income investors do now? Annaly Capital was one of the high-yielding income vehicles that I kicked out of my income portfolio earlier this year because of the company’s increasingly stretched valuation on a book value and core earnings basis, and because mortgage real estate investment trusts were significantly overbought at the time. After a short-lived dip in Annaly Capital’s share price in May, however, investors have again piled into high-yielding mortgage REITs. As a result, Annaly Capital’s shares are selling for a premium to book value…something that hasn’t happened for a very long time. 

NLY Price to Book Value data by YChartsI generally don’t like to buy high-yield income vehicles at a premium valuation for two simple reasons: 1. Paying a premium to book value limits my long term total return potential (it is much better to buy dividend-paying stocks when they are out of favor and are priced at discounts to intrinsic value/book value), and 2. A premium book valuation increases the risk of dilution as company executives feel a temptation to issue shares (and dilute existing shareholders).
 In fairness, real estate investment trusts often issue shares in order to raise capital for portfolio investments, so they are to some extent a ‘business-as-usual’ kind of thing. However, raising a lot of capital when shares sell at a premium may not always been in the interest of shareholders. Annaly Capital sold a whopping 60 million shares in July’s capital raise for expected gross proceeds of $710 million (pre-offering expenses). Annaly Capital further granted its underwriters an option to buy another nine million shares. The mortgage REIT will the use the proceeds from the share offering for the following purposes: Annaly intends to use the net proceeds of this offering to acquire targeted assets under the Company’s capital allocation policy, which may include further diversification of its investments in Agency assets as well as residential, commercial and corporate credit assets. These investments include, without limitation, residential credit assets (including residential mortgage loans), middle market corporate loans, Agency MBS pools, to-be-announced forward contracts, adjustable rate mortgages, commercial real estate loans and securities and mortgage servicing rights. Annaly also intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, to pay down liabilities and other working capital items.  Should You Buy Annaly Capital After The Price Drop?  Dilution is a very real risk for (mortgage) REIT shareholders, which is why the market reaction to secondary capital offerings is usually swift and instant. Annaly Capital’s shares, for instance, slumped after the capital offering announcement, as one would expect. 

 Source: StockCharts.com
 As far as I am concerned, I am not prepared to re-enter Annaly Capital after the capital offering because the REIT’s shares are still too expensive, selling for 1.06x BV, which is a high valuation based on Annaly Capital’s P/B range in the last five years. I don’t think that the long term reward-to-risk ratio is attractive enough to buy into Annaly Capital at today’s price point. That said, I will consider buying Annaly Capital again if shares drop towards $10.50, and the reward-to-risk equation improves significantly.  Your Takeaway  I would consider buying Annaly Capital as a long term dividend vehicle under the condition that the reward-to-risk combination is more balanced, i.e. when shares are priced at a discount to book value and when they can deliver both dividend income and capital gains long term. Annaly Capital’s shares have risen too high, too fast in my opinion, which is good for shareholders that are already invested, but it makes a new buy recommendation much harder to justify.

I am largely investing in dividend paying stocks, but also venture out occasionally and cover special situations that offer appealing reward-to-risk ratios and have potential for significant capital appreciation.

Annaly (NLY) Announces Public Offering of 60 Million Shares

  Annaly Capital Management, Inc. NLY   , the mortgage real estate investment trust (mREIT), has announced a public offering of nearly 60 million shares of common stock. In addition to the public offering, the underwriters have been given a 30-day option to purchase an additional 9 million shares. These shares will be offered in negotiated transactions at the negotiated price or at the market price prevailing at the time of sale.    Annaly will expend an uncapped amount of the net proceeds in targeted asset acquisitions under the company's capital allocation guidelines. It will also be used for general corporate purposes, which may include trimming Annaly's liabilities and working capital items. This public offering will help in diversifying the company's investment options. In fact, as part of the diversification strategy, it will allocate a chunk of the stockholders' equity in a variety of assets.    It may expand its Agency, residential, commercial and corporate credit assets investment such as middle market corporate loans, residential mortgage loans, Agency MBS pools, adjustable rate mortgages, TBA forward contracts, commercial real estate loans and securities and mortgage servicing rights. Particularly, the company is focused on expanding its commercial real estate investments. This, in turn, is likely to complement its agency investments by providing long-term floating-rate cash flows to the shareholders and make it less volatile.    Though a stock offering results in dilution of earnings, prudent investments in strategic assets are likely to help the company navigate through the challenging rate environment.    Annaly is a mortgage real estate investment trust (mREIT) that primarily owns, manages and finances a portfolio of real estate-related investment securities. Its investment portfolio includes agency MBS, agency pass-through certificates, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), interest-only securities and inverse floaters. On Jul 12, 2016, the company closed the acquisition of Winston Salem, NC-based mREIT - Hatteras Financial Corp. - for $1.5 billion. This acquisition has fortified Annaly's position in the mREIT space.    In addition, shares of Annaly underperformed the Zacks categorized REIT Mortgage Trust  industry over the past three months. During this time frame, shares of the company climbed 0.6%, whereas the industry gained 1.2%.       The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2017 remained unchanged at 29 cents, whereas the full-year estimate moved up 1.7% to $1.17, over the last 30 days.   Stocks to Consider    A few better-ranked stocks in the broader REIT industry include ProLogs, Inc. PLD  , Liberty Property Trust LPT  and Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. AHP  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank   (Strong Buy) stocks here   .  While ProLogs, Inc. has expected long-term growth rate of 4.3%, Liberty Property Trust and Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. have expected long-term growth rates of 6% and 2%, respectively.

Even Annaly Capital Management Is Selling Their Shares - Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (NYSE:NLY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Even Annaly Capital Management Is Selling Their SharesJul.18.17 | About: Annaly Capital (NLY) Colorado Wealth Management Fund REITs, micro-cap, small-cap, debtMarketplaceThe Mortgage REIT ForumSummaryIt looks like Annaly Capital Management agreed with a recent article. The stock was a great choice for selling. The company will sell 60 to 69 million shares.
        Management identifies their book value and earnings for the quarter. This offering helps them grow book value per share.
        This is precisely how mortgage REITs are supposed to operate.
        My recent work suggested shorting NLY as part of a pair trade because the valuation was so high.
        Some of the preferred shares remain attractive for investing. I’m only bearish on the common stock.
        Annaly Capital Management (NLY) seems to have agreed with my most recent piece. I argued shares of Annaly Capital Management were about to get clobbered. The share price was simply too high relative to book value and the net interest spread available on new investments simply isn’t high enough to justify trading most mortgage REITs a material premium to book value. 

 Not In the Book Value Business? Might Want to Tell Management. One of the ironic criticisms of the piece was that the company isn’t in the book value business. This move to issue new shares at a significant premium to book value completely refutes that argument. It isn’t just me starting analysis by using book value, it is the same way management is evaluating their company. 

 That theory didn’t turn out so well. Earnings and book value figures in this article will be estimates, but they are management’s estimates rather than mine.
 Book Value Book value for the end of Q2 2017 was $11.19. Perfect Timing I can’t complain about management’s decision at all. Share prices were higher before they went ex-dividend, but issuing before the ex-dividend date would’ve required paying out dividends on the new shares as well. Adjusting for the ex-dividend date, NLY is still near the highest value they’ve seen in quite a few years. Well, at least they were trading at those valuations before the announcement. Shares are falling in the after-hours market as investors digest the reality that even large mortgage REITs are completely capable of issuing new equity and putting it to work for shareholders. The Right Call This is the right decision for management because it allows them to capitalize on the premium to book value by issuing new shares and growing equity per share. Care to guess how NLY is producing net interest income and paying dividends? They take their equity and leverage it into a portfolio of MBS and then hedge the portfolio to the level they find appropriate. Since these positions are valued at roughly the same cost as a replacement position, each new dollar of equity should produce a similar amount of net interest income as the prior dollars of equity. 

 These offerings drive book value higher but tend to send share prices lower as investors realize the company can easily capitalize on the premium. This is like share buybacks, except companies are vastly more interested in issuing new equity. Dividend Implications For net interest income, this is actually a positive factor. On the other hand, if a mortgage REIT figured they would need to cut within the next year and had a solid premium to book value, it would be wise to issue as much as possible prior to the cut to capitalize on the premium.
 Earnings With the offering, NLY provided their earnings and book value for the end of the second quarter. Core EPS was $.23. The more useful value is Core EPS excluding PAA (premium amortization adjustment), which is $.30. That falls in line with my expectations for Core EPS excluding PAA. In future periods I think there could be some pressure from the relatively flat curve and the growth in interest expense. Recent Idea On Wednesday, 07/12/2017, I published an idea for subscribers (subscription required) suggesting a pair trade of buying Capstead Mortgage Corporation (CMO) and shorting Annaly Capital Management (NLY). The portfolios don’t match up well, yet they have very rarely seen a difference in price-to-book ratios remotely this large in the last few years. Both are strong mREITs with intelligent management. Regardless, the price for NLY was too high and fueled the efforts to find a viable pair trade option. In the article I said: “ In my view, the high valuation of NLY makes it an interesting shorting target. However, investors should be wary about shorting mortgage REITs without a very clear catalyst on the horizon or a solid hedge. In my view, CMO is an acceptable hedge even though there are material differences in the asset portfolio.” A Couple Extra Facts The offering is for 60 million shares. The price is not yet finalized. The underwriter’s allotment is for 9 million additional shares. More information is in the prospectus. This Sad Dog Feels Your Pain This could be a tough pill to swallow, so I found this cute picture of a sad dog to cheer you up. 

 Conclusion Annaly Capital Management is issuing new equity because they recognized the premium to book value created a very attractive opportunity. Their view on selling shares of Annaly Capital Management coincides nicely with my prior suggestion that investors should sell the shares. I remain bearish as the common stock of NLY because it still trades well above book value (as estimated by management) and the offering price has not been finalized.
 It isn’t all bad though. There was a nice opportunity lately in the preferred shares of Annaly Capital Management. I missed those shares on their prior dip, but was able to catch some of them on the most recent dip. I’ll have an article out on the opportunity there soon. Suffice it said, around $25.40, I think there is a decent opportunity for NLY-D. There is some call risk on the horizon, but I can deal with that risk given the dividend accrual. I wouldn’t be too comfortable with that NLY-A though. Be extra wary there.

Pass on these 10% Dividend Yields
Annaly Capital Management and American Capital Agency are trading at large premiums to book value. These shares are no bargain.











                Jordan Wathen
            

                (TMFValueMagnet)



            
            Jul 6, 2017 at 4:20PM
            
            





As investors dig deeper to find high yields, they're paying unjustifiably high prices for shares of high-yielding mortgage REITs. Don't make the same mistake.
Annaly Capital Management (NYSE:NLY) and American Capital Agency (NASDAQ:AGNC) now trade at a 10% premium to their last reported net asset values, or tangible book value, a price that doesn't reflect declining fundamentals for the mREIT industry.
Few reasons to pay a premium
Mortgage REITs are the textbook example of a commodity business. They raise equity capital by selling shares to the public, adding heaps of borrowed money, then using the proceeds to purchase mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
Like banks, mortgage REITs are in the "spread" business, earning a profit by borrowing at low rates on the short end of the yield curve and lending at higher rates on the long end of the curve. Unlike banks, though, mREITs have few proprietary ways to earn higher returns. Well-run banks attract low-cost deposits and pick good borrowers. Mortgage REITs do not have this funding cost advantage, nor do mREITs have many advantages when it comes to investment selection.

Mortgage REITs use short-term financing to buy long-term mortgage loans. Image source: Getty Images.

Virtually all of American Capital Agency's portfolio is invested in agency-backed MBSes, whereas Annaly has about 78% of its capital deployed in agency securities. Agency-backed paper is backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, mortgage guarantors that are themselves backed by the U.S. government. Therefore, agency-backed mortgages are said to be as safe as U.S. Treasuries.
For mREITs, this means the primary driver of their earnings isn't credit selection (picking good borrowers) or eking out an advantage in funding costs (the rates they pay are determined by the market). Their only possible advantage for the bulk of their business comes from an mREIT's ability to forecast the direction of interest rates and allocate their portfolios to reflect their view. For this reason, it makes little sense to pay a premium to book value for mREIT shares.
Declining spreads
One proxy for the long-term profitability of the mREIT industry is the 2-10 spread, or the difference between yields on 2-year U.S. Treasuries and 10-year U.S. Treasuries.
In simple terms, when the 2-10 spread is large, mREITs can earn more money by borrowing short and lending long. When the spread is small, mREIT earnings generally suffer, as there is only a small difference between their borrowing costs and the yield they earn on their portfolios.
Curiously, mREIT share prices have been moving higher even as the 2-10 spread has remained in place for much of the last year.

The recent decline in the 2-10 spread is the consequence of Fed rate hikes. The Fed has increased its targeted short-term interest rate, but long-term rates have not increased in kind. Thus, the price mREITs pay to borrow money has gone up, but the yield they earn on their portfolios has not increased to a similar degree, resulting in lower spreads when mREITs deploy capital to buy mortgage securities.





Investors shouldn't get greedy
It's tough out there for yield investors. Super-safe, short-term investments yield little more than 2% per year. Junk bonds yield less than 5%. Thus, the double-digit dividend yields offered by Annaly Capital and American Capital Agency are tempting. But investors should be cognizant of the risk that comes with paying a premium to book value to get a double-digit dividend yield.

AGNC Price to Tangible Book Value data by YCharts.
It was only 18 months ago that these two mREITs traded at 20% discounts to book value. Since that time, the 2-10 spread has compressed, yet mREITs now trade at a 10% premium to book value. It's inexplicable. A proxy for the industry's earnings power points downward, but share prices have rocketed higher. 
It's telling that the largest mREITs haven't used their premium share prices to raise capital, which suggests that their investment opportunities are so unattractive that raising new capital to invest today would dilute their earnings on a per-share basis. Historically, mREITs have been eager to sell more shares at even single-digit premiums to book value. Of course, when mREITs were most aggressive in issuing new shares, the 2-10 spread was much higher than it is now.
It's my view that investors who wait for a fat pitch will get the chance to buy in at book value, or even less, before missing out on a full year of dividends. Patience should be rewarded with the avoidance of capital losses, if not outsized profits.

Credit Suisse Group (CS), a Swiss multinational financial services holding company, forecasts that global demand on Egypt’s oil will be 5,000 barrels per day in 2017, compared to 51,000 barrels per day in 2016, a decrease of 90.1%. CS forecasts that the global demand on Egypt’s oil will be reduced to 4,000 barrels per day in 2018, a decrease of 92.1%.
CS issued a report on Monday expecting that the global demand on Egypt’s oil in quarter three (Q3) 2017 will be decreased by 0.4%, compared to Q2 2017 that reduced by 0.7%. Meanwhile, in Q1 2017, the demand was 2.5% of the global demand.
The report proposed that the global demand on Egypt’s oil in Q1 2018 will be reduced again from 1.4% in Q4 2017 to reach 1%. Furthermore, it will witness a severe decrease in demand to reach 0.1% in Q2 2018.
It projected that the demand on Egypt’s oil will represent 0.6% of global demand for oil in 2017 and will decrease one percentage point to reach 0.5% in 2018; however, it reached 1.3% in the period from 2011 to 2015.
CS forecasts $48 per barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) in the second half (H2) 2017 and H1 2018, rising into the mid $50s in H2 2018. The report pushed out the rebalance through 2019, with new long-term WTI forecasts at $57.5 per barrel.
WTI, also known as Texas light sweet, is a grade of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing. This grade is described as light because of its relatively low density, and sweet because of its low sulfur content.
“Nigeria and Libya production surprised to the upside, and demand growth hit a speed bump in Q1 2017, muting the pace of US inventory draw thus far. We anticipate a modest draw through the remainder of 2017 as DUC completions and outspending continue to drive shale growth, projecting a 120 million barrel per day OECD inventory surplus at the end of Q1 2018; hence, we see limited near-term price upside and update our 2H 2017 WTI forecast to $48 per barrel,” the report read.
Furthermore, the report assumed that OPEC will extend its ceiling until US inventories move to the top of the 5-year average in Q3 2018, with broadly similar (to current) levels of adherence. Moreover, the report slightly lowered US onshore growth assumption, moving from a slight acceleration to slight deceleration year-on-year (y-o-y), given lower prices and, thus far, less hedging heading into 2018.
“Our revised 2018 WTI quarterly forecasts are $48, $52, & $54 per barrel. Our 2019 forecast follows through with the rebalancing view, averaging $55.8 per barrel,” the report added.
On the long term (to 2020), the report noted that the oil prices will be reduced by $5 per barrel (to WTI at $57.5 per barrel; Brent at $60 per barrel). This is reflective of efficiency for international developers for as yet unsanctioned oil projects.
The report pointed out that Q1 2017’s oil demand growth underperformed, but this has been resolved. Specifically, India registered a 0.5% y-o-y demand decline in the first quarter, after growing 8% y-o-y in 2016. Meanwhile the US grew only 0.2% y-o-y in Q1 2017, despite growing 1.1% y-o-y in H2 2016, according to the report.
The Mideast and smaller EM Asia economies also underperformed in early 2017, but growth has since broadly improved across the board. Global demand growth accelerated from 1.0% y-o-y in Q1 to 1.5% y-o-y in Q2 17.
Russia should continue to comply as well, given it is a critical lynchpin in holding the agreement together from a political standpoint, and also from a timely oil market rebalance standpoint.

At-a-Glance

Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (“Annaly”) is a leading diversified capital manager that invests in and finances residential and commercial assets. Since our founding in 1996 and subsequent initial public offering (“IPO”) in 1997, we have generated net income for distribution to our shareholders and have preserved capital through the prudent selection of investments and continued management of our portfolio. With approximately $89.5 billion in assets(1), our portfolio includes securities, loans and equity in both the residential and commercial markets. Annaly has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes. 
Annaly is a vehicle for long-term asset ownership. We use our capital, coupled with various structured financing products to invest in assets in both commercial and residential markets, earning the spread between the yield on our investments and the cost of our borrowings and hedging activities. To maintain our desired capital profile, we utilize a mix of debt and equity funding based on our investment profile and market view. Our range of financing alternatives includes traditional repo, warehouse lines, FHLB and financing through our own broker dealer.
Diversification is a pillar of the Annaly strategy. Since 2010 we have diversified our business model by investing in credit assets directly on balance sheet, complementing our portfolio of interest rate sensitive investments. This strategy is designed to achieve durable risk-adjusted returns over various interest rate and economic cycles by pairing shorter floating-rate credit securities with our longer, fixed-rate agency portfolio. The diversification strategy reaches beyond simply our investment in credit sectors. Within each discipline we have diversified our investments to produce balanced cash-flows and leverage profiles. Our breadth of investment options and robust capital allocation process combined with careful risk management enables us to take advantage of market inefficiencies and rotate into credit markets when dislocations occur and pricing is attractive on a risk-adjusted, relative value basis.

Annaly Capital Management: Should You Buy The Drop? - Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (NYSE:NLY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Annaly Capital Management: Should You Buy The Drop?Jul.23.17 | About: Annaly Capital (NLY) Achilles Research Long/short equity, special situationsSummaryAnnaly Capital pursued a secondary capital offering in July, which caused the shares to drop.
        Dilution is a very real risk for REIT investors.
        I discuss the capital offering and whether investors should take advantage of the drop in Annaly Capital’s valuation.
        Mortgage real estate investment trust Annaly Capital Management, Inc. (NLY) completed a share offering in July that saw the company’s share price dive sharply lower. Despite the drop in valuation on the back of the capital raise, Annaly Capital’s shares are still far from being a bargain, selling for a premium to the last reported accounting book value. What should income investors do now? Annaly Capital was one of the high-yielding income vehicles that I kicked out of my income portfolio earlier this year because of the company’s increasingly stretched valuation on a book value and core earnings basis, and because mortgage real estate investment trusts were significantly overbought at the time. After a short-lived dip in Annaly Capital’s share price in May, however, investors have again piled into high-yielding mortgage REITs. As a result, Annaly Capital’s shares are selling for a premium to book value…something that hasn’t happened for a very long time. 

NLY Price to Book Value data by YChartsI generally don’t like to buy high-yield income vehicles at a premium valuation for two simple reasons: 1. Paying a premium to book value limits my long term total return potential (it is much better to buy dividend-paying stocks when they are out of favor and are priced at discounts to intrinsic value/book value), and 2. A premium book valuation increases the risk of dilution as company executives feel a temptation to issue shares (and dilute existing shareholders).
 In fairness, real estate investment trusts often issue shares in order to raise capital for portfolio investments, so they are to some extent a ‘business-as-usual’ kind of thing. However, raising a lot of capital when shares sell at a premium may not always been in the interest of shareholders. Annaly Capital sold a whopping 60 million shares in July’s capital raise for expected gross proceeds of $710 million (pre-offering expenses). Annaly Capital further granted its underwriters an option to buy another nine million shares. The mortgage REIT will the use the proceeds from the share offering for the following purposes: Annaly intends to use the net proceeds of this offering to acquire targeted assets under the Company’s capital allocation policy, which may include further diversification of its investments in Agency assets as well as residential, commercial and corporate credit assets. These investments include, without limitation, residential credit assets (including residential mortgage loans), middle market corporate loans, Agency MBS pools, to-be-announced forward contracts, adjustable rate mortgages, commercial real estate loans and securities and mortgage servicing rights. Annaly also intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, to pay down liabilities and other working capital items.  Should You Buy Annaly Capital After The Price Drop?  Dilution is a very real risk for (mortgage) REIT shareholders, which is why the market reaction to secondary capital offerings is usually swift and instant. Annaly Capital’s shares, for instance, slumped after the capital offering announcement, as one would expect. 

 Source: StockCharts.com
 As far as I am concerned, I am not prepared to re-enter Annaly Capital after the capital offering because the REIT’s shares are still too expensive, selling for 1.06x BV, which is a high valuation based on Annaly Capital’s P/B range in the last five years. I don’t think that the long term reward-to-risk ratio is attractive enough to buy into Annaly Capital at today’s price point. That said, I will consider buying Annaly Capital again if shares drop towards $10.50, and the reward-to-risk equation improves significantly.  Your Takeaway  I would consider buying Annaly Capital as a long term dividend vehicle under the condition that the reward-to-risk combination is more balanced, i.e. when shares are priced at a discount to book value and when they can deliver both dividend income and capital gains long term. Annaly Capital’s shares have risen too high, too fast in my opinion, which is good for shareholders that are already invested, but it makes a new buy recommendation much harder to justify. If you like to read more of my articles, and like to be kept up to date with the companies I cover, I kindly ask you that you scroll to the top of this page and click 'follow'. I am largely investing in dividend paying stocks, but also venture out occasionally and cover special situations that offer appealing reward-to-risk ratios and have potential for significant capital appreciation. Above all, my immediate investment goal is to achieve financial independence.
