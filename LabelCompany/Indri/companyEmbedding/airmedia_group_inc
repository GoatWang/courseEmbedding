Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

AirMedia Announces Divestiture of Two Unprofitable Product Lines

Jan 13, 2015, 07:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   AirMedia Group Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


BEIJING, Jan. 13, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- AirMedia Group Inc. ("AirMedia" or the "Company") (Nasdaq:   AMCN), a leading operator of out-of-home advertising platforms in China targeting mid-to-high-end consumers, today announced that it had reached agreements with two media companies to divest its TV-attached digital frames and airport digital TV screens business, two unprofitable product lines, to enhance its profitability. 
TV-attached digital frames and airport digital TV screens had been negatively contributing to the Company's overall results for years. The divestiture is expected to have an immediately positive effect on the Company's results of operation.  
"The divestiture is expected to bring the Company back to profit. Our sales force can concentrate on promoting the remaining product lines which have higher profitability, such as our mega-size LED screens and stand-alone digital frames. It is also helpful for the Company to redeploy capital and management's focus to support business with higher return. After the divestiture, we expect our current media business to become profitable and provide steady cash flow to support our transformation into a leading in-flight and on-train Wi-Fi operator in China, which we expect to bring remarkable growth to the Company in the long run," commented Mr. Herman Guo, chairman and chief executive officer of AirMedia. 
Details of the Transactions 
AirMedia reached an agreement with Beijing Tianyi Culture Development Co., Ltd., a third party unrelated to AirMedia, on January 13, 2015, pursuant to which AirMedia will sell 81% equity interest of Beijing AirMedia Jinsheng Advertising Co., Ltd. ("Jinsheng Advertising"), which is the operating entity of AirMedia's TV-attached digital frames business. AirMedia had transferred all relevant assets, liabilities and managerial duties to Jinsheng Advertising and will transfer all the concession rights contracts related to TV-attached digital frames to Jinsheng Advertising after obtaining the consents from the airports. Jinsheng Advertising will operate TV-attached digital frames under entrustment before the completion of the transfer of related concession rights contracts. 
On December 12, 2014, Beijing East Jiacheng Culture Media Co., Ltd. ("East Jiacheng"), a third party unrelated to AirMedia, and AirMedia established a joint venture, Beijing AirMedia Jiacheng Advertising Co., Ltd. ("Jiacheng Advertising"), in which East Jiacheng has 70% equity interest with subscribed capital contribution of RMB21.0 million (US$3.4 million). Pursuant to the joint venture arrangement, AirMedia will transfer all relevant assets, liabilities and managerial duties with regard to the airport digital TV screens business to Jiacheng Advertising and will also transfer all the concession rights contracts related to airport digital TV screens after obtaining the consents from the airports. Jiacheng Advertising will operate airport digital TV screens under entrustment before the completion of the transfer of related concession rights contracts. 
Expected Financial Impact 
TV-attached digital frames generated US$20.6 million revenues in fiscal year 2013 and US$11.4 million revenues in the first nine months of 2014, accounting for 7.5% and 6.1% of the Company's total revenues respectively in the corresponding periods. Airport digital TV screens generated US$14.0 million revenues in fiscal year 2013 and US$9.0 million revenues in the first nine months of 2014, accounting for 5.1% and 4.8% of the Company's total revenues respectively in the corresponding periods. The Company expects to cause some of its clients to reallocate part of their advertising budgets from TV-attached digital frames and airport digital TV screens to AirMedia's remaining product lines to offset part of the decrease in its revenues. As a result, the decrease in AirMedia's total revenues in 2015 due to the divestiture of the aforementioned two unprofitable product lines is expected to be less than the simple sum of the percentages of the two product lines. Based on its current estimate, the Company expects the decrease in total revenues in 2015 due to the divestiture of the aforementioned two unprofitable product lines to be less than 10% of its total revenues in 2014. 
The Company had loss from operations of US$18.2 million in fiscal year 2013 and US$24.1 million revenues in the first nine months of 2014, including loss from operations of US$9.3 million and US$8.1 million from TV-attached digital frames in the corresponding periods, and loss from operations of US$1.2 million and US$1.5 million from airport digital TV screens in the corresponding periods.
As a result of the aforementioned transaction in connection with its TV-attached digital frames business, the Company will use cost method to report results from TV-attached digital frames in airports in the first quarter of 2015. 
As a result of the aforementioned transaction in connection with its airport digital TV screens business, the Company will use equity method to report results from airport digital TV screens in the first quarter of 2015.

AirMedia does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required under applicable law.
