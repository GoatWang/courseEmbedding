Current Projects    The Texas Two-Step Joint Venture will be formed for the purpose of acquiring up to a 10% working interest in two oil, gas and mineral leases, to re-enter two wells in Matagorda County, Texas.  The first well in the Texas Two-Step Program is the Huebner #1 in the Live Oak Creek development project. The Huebner #1 was drilled in late 2014 with logged potential pay in seven zones. Downhole mechanical issues and low commodity prices in early 2016 made further work on the well uneconomic and the project was put on indefinite hold. With oil prices now on the rise, the lead geologist on the project is proposing to reenter the well and establish commercial production in either the Crooker, 8,300’ sand or the Hammon, 8,400’ sand. Once production is established, he proposes to drill a second well on the lease to exploit the deeper reserve zones noted on the Huebner #1 log, in an updip position. Drilling an additional well on the lease will be optional for the Texas Two-Step JV partners and could potentially add 1,215,000 barrels of oil equivalent to the economics.The second well in the Texas Two-Step Program is the Dawdy #1 well. The Dawdy #1 well was drilled to a total depth of 10,250’ and a pumping unit was installed on the well late last year. The well needs to be reentered and the pump reengineered in the current productive zone. The Dawdy #1 well has a potential 4,380,000 billion cubic feet of gas and 374,175 barrels of oil based on the post drill loganalysis.Next generation oil investing information and superior data driven exploration strategies do exist, they're just not widely known, until now. The new high tech, low cost oil boom is on!    CEG Holdings, LLC.

In One Giant "Texas Sized" Move CEG Holdings, LLC. Changes The Oil & Gas Investing Landscape With New Texas Two Step Project Launch



Share Article


















CEG Holdings, LLC., is releasing the Texas Two Step Project this week to new investors not already inside of CEG's 1,000 plus partner investment group. This is a big project release, that couldn't have come at a better time for the struggling oil industry.







CEG Holdings, LLC. - Producing America's Energy Future - Texas Two Step Development Project - Call 1-800-830-3029 for additional details.

Energy is a great investment, but the Lone Star Collection is a big bright spot, even for the energy industry. CEG Holdings, LLC., and partners are likely to be making profit headlines in the months and years to come.


Austin, Texas (PRWEB)
December 15, 2016
 This week CEG Holdings is releasing their massive new Texas Two Step Project to new investors. This expansive project, containing two major Texas drilling sites, is a bold move to take advantage of record low drilling costs.
As oil prices have dipped, so has the price of drilling oil wells, making this prime time for exploring for additional reserves. Industry analysts believe it's only a matter of time until oil prices could spike again, turning CEG's New Texas Two Step Project into a profit headliner. 
The Texas Two Step Project includes two large multi-layer fields in Matagorda County, Texas, comprising 400 acres, in the heart of Texas oil country.
Revenue from the CEG Holding's new Texas Two Step Project could reach $100,000,000. Experts believe there are approximately 5,200,000,000 cubic feet of natural gas and 1,215,000 barrels of crude ready to be pumped.
CEG's investors are bracing for a healthy round of what the industry refers to as double dipping. That is when investors drill during inexpensive times when prices are low, then sell their oil when the price goes back up. New investors have the advantage of getting in now at low energy prices, and being in position when prices skyrocket.
CEG Holdings uses advanced 3D seismic technology to pinpoint the location of rich oil reserves. This cutting edge technology is bringing greater precision to modern oil exploration and development.
Texas is the nation's leader in oil production with proven oil reserves approaching 10 billion barrels. The vast promise of American oil fields, coupled with newer drilling and refining methods, has made the United States the #1 oil producing country in the world.
