			Taxable Income
			 : Floating Rate Funds



			About Floating Rate Debt and Senior Loan Funds

			Floating rate debt typically consists of commercial loans senior to other loans and debt in a company's capital structure, and may also include certain floating rate preferred debt securities. Floating rate senior loans have an interest rate that resets periodically, are usually secured by specific collateral, and are often rated below investment grade. This means they are subject to a greater risk of default than investment-grade securities. In the event of liquidation, investors in these types of loans are given the highest priority for repayment – before holders of preferred and common stock and subordinated bondholders.

			Floating rate debt income typically rises as short-term interest rates rise, as the loans are structured to pay interest based on short term rates plus some additional percentage known as a spread. This means they tend to have low or negative correlation with most bond indexes. Since floating rate funds usually carry lower credit ratings or no credit rating at all, income is expected to be higher in market environments when higher rates are demanded from poor or unrated credits vs. highly rated or government-guaranteed securities ("wide credit spreads").





The types of collateral used to secure floating rate senior loans include:

Accounts receivable
Inventory
Equipment and machinery
Real estate


					Companies typically targeted by portfolio managers may include:

Hotel/restaurant/entertainment and leisure industries
Health care providers and services
Real estate
Chemical industries


					About Nuveen Floating Rate Funds

					Nuveen floating rate funds' dividends can act as a possible hedge against rising short-term interest rates and diversification for your overall income portfolio. Nuveen floating rate senior loan funds can help diversify a portfolio and may help to reduce an investor's overall portfolio volatility.






								Investor Profile

								Are these CEFs right for you?

								The features and investment objectives of these funds might be especially appealing to investors seeking:

High current income potential
Additional diversification within their portfolios
Enhanced capital preservation due to low correlation with other asset classes 


								What are potential risks?

Floating rate funds feature income that rises as short-term interest rates rise. Consequently, if short-term rates fall, the loans’ interest rates also fall, reducing fund income.
Floating rate loans are generally un-rated and not registered, meaning there is often less public information available about the loans. They are often relatively illiquid.

Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.
