Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and “best-efforts” basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.03. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of one-third, two-third and 100%, respectively, of
the securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we
will raise the full $90,000 as anticipated.

Gross proceeds                   $ 30,000     $ 60,000     $ 90,000 
Offering expenses                $  7,000     $  7,000     $  7,000  
Net proceeds                     $ 23,000     $ 53,000     $ 83,000  
Website development              $  1,500     $  3,000     $  3,000  
Leasing premises and equipment   $  5,980     $  9,680     $ 14,460  
Raw materials                    $  1,520     $ 17,320     $ 30,540
Employees’ salary                $      -     $  6,000     $ 12,000 
Miscellaneous expenses           $  1,000     $  2,000     $  3,000 
Marketing and advertising        $  3,000     $  5,000     $ 10,000 
SEC reporting and compliance     $ 10,000     $ 10,000     $ 10,000

The above figures represent only estimated costs. If necessary, Otmane
Tajmouati, our president and director, has agreed to loan the Company funds to
complete the registration process, implement business plan, and maintain
reporting status and quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board or other quotation
service. Also, these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering
will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting
status. Mr. Tajmouati will not be paid any compensation or anything from the
proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds
advanced by Mr. Tajmouati. Mr. Tajmouati will be repaid from revenues of
operations if and when we generate significant revenues to pay the obligation.
The Company will conduct the repayment of director’s loans in accordance to the
sequence of loans in full amount.


We need proceeds from this offering to enter this business. We will be in a
market where we compete with other companies offering similar products. We will
be in direct competition with them. Many of these companies may have a greater,
more established customer base than us. We will likely lose business to such
companies. Also, many of these companies will be able to afford to offer better
price for similar products than us, which may also harm business. We foresee to
continue to face challenges from new market entrants. We may be unable to
continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors, which
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.

Nearly all Addentax Group Corp.'s competitors have significantly greater
financial resources, technical expertise, and managerial capabilities than
Addentax Group Corp. We are, consequently, at a competitive disadvantage in
being able to provide such products and become a successful company in printing
industry. Therefore, Addentax Group Corp. may not be able to establish itself
within the industry at all.


Company Description
The Company is working on a field of producing images on a surface such as
glass, leather, plastic, ceramic, textile, and others using 3D sublimation
vacuum heat transfer machine. Heat transfer technology is one of most economical
methods of application of any way to creatively approach to the


 implementation
of various ideas. This modern technology is quiet popular for many years and has
not lost its relevance. Materials for the images can be varied, such as
ceramics, glass, crockery different quality, metal, clothing, caps, bags,
leather products and other products. Our products will be interesting for people
with individual single orders, business owners associated with the sale of 
souvenirs, and business owners who intend to order souvenirs in the corporate
style. In order to organize our business, we need equipment and supplies, so we
can make the images on our customer’s products, and then we will rent more space
for the warehouse with goods on which apply the images to provide the customer
with the final product. We plan to conclude a contract of carriage with local
shipping companies for delivery of our goods to other cities such as Meknes,
Rabat, Kenitra and worldwide.

Morocco is popular tourist country. We plan to find customers in the nearest
cities, such as Rabat, Kenitra, and Marrakech and sell our products to them on a
regular basis. If we are successful in attracting new customers in the nearest
cities, we will sign contracts with local delivery companies in the future to
deliver our goods to those customers.

When, and if, the Company succeeds in attracting new customers and the capital
of the Company grows, we plan to expand our business to the nearest countries,
such as Algeria, and Tunis and in positive scenario worldwide in the future.

Once our business grows and we are able to expand it to other countries such as
Algeria and Tunis, we plan to rent a small office in one of these countries, in
a tourist attractive city and use the same business plan that we implemented in
Fes, Morocco. We believe that expansion of our printing business to other
countries will take approximately two years.

Having additional customers and sales will positively impact our printing
business, as we will have more orders and become well known in the industry and
our revenues will grow accordingly. We believe that our future customers will
recommend our printing service to others.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
