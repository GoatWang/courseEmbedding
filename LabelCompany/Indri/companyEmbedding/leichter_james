2016.  Assessment of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) as a source of dissolved radium and nutrients to Moorea (French Polynesia) coastal waters. Estuaries and Coasts. 39:1651-1668.   10.1007/s12237-016-0108-y     AbstractWebsitePrevious work has documented large fluxes of freshwater and nutrients from submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) into the coastal waters of a few volcanic oceanic islands. However, on the majority of such islands, including Moorea (French Polynesia), SGD has not been studied. In this study, we used radium (Ra) isotopes and salinity to investigate SGD and associated nutrient inputs at five coastal sites and Paopao Bay on the north shore of Moorea. Ra activities were highest in coastal groundwater, intermediate in coastal ocean surface water, and lowest in offshore surface water, indicating that high-Ra groundwater was discharging into the coastal ocean. On average, groundwater nitrate and nitrite (N + N), phosphate, ammonium, and silica concentrations were 12, 21, 29, and 33 times greater, respectively, than those in coastal ocean surface water, suggesting that groundwater discharge could be an important source of nutrients to the coastal ocean. Ra and salinity mass balances indicated that most or all SGD at these sites was saline and likely originated from a deeper, unsampled layer of Ra-enriched recirculated seawater. This high-salinity SGD may be less affected by terrestrial nutrient sources, such as fertilizer, sewage, and animal waste, compared to meteoric groundwater; however, nutrient-salinity trends indicate it may still have much higher concentrations of nitrate and phosphate than coastal receiving waters. Coastal ocean nutrient concentrations were virtually identical to those measured offshore, suggesting that nutrient subsidies from SGD are efficiently utilized.

2016.  Spatial scale-dependent vertical zonation of coral reef community structure in French Polynesia. Ecosphere. 7   10.1002/ecs2.1342     AbstractWebsiteWe tested for depth-dependent vertical zonation in coral reef community structure with surveys conducted in 2013 at 10 m and 27 m depth off the islands of Moorea, Tahiti, Maiao, and Tetiaroa, which are distributed over similar to 3500 km(2) of the tropical south Pacific. Benthic communities were censused using photoquadrats to obtain percentage cover, first by functional groups (scleractinians, macroalgae, and crustose coralline algae, algal turf, and bare space combined [CTB]), and second by genus for scleractinians and Millepora. Virtually every aspect of community structure differed between the two depths, but the effects were dependent on spatial scale of investigation. Interactive effects of islands and depths determined the abundance of functional groups, as well as seven of eight common coral genera. On the two islands at which two sites were censused, the abundance of functional groups also differed between sites, and was affected by depth x site interactions. The spatially variable effects of depth on community structure underscores the importance of context-specific synergy between biotic and abiotic factors in driving these patterns. Spatial scale-dependent vertical zonation also shows the potential for these effects to be modulated by the changes that have affected coral community structure on contemporary reefs over the last few decades.

2016.  High frequency (hourly) variation in vertical distribution and abundance of meroplanktonic larvae in nearshore waters during strong internal tidal forcing. Continental Shelf Research. 117:92-99.   10.1016/j.csr.2016.02.004     AbstractWebsiteWe related the vertical distribution and abundance of nearshore meroplankton at hourly time scales with internal tidal wave events. We proposed that significant changes in plankter abundance would occur across internal tidal fronts, and that surface and bottom strata would respond in opposite fashions. First mode internal tidal bores propagating in the alongshore direction were detected in water-column currents and baroclinic temperature changes. Surface and bottom currents always flowed in opposite directions, and abrupt flow reversals coincided with large temperature changes during arrival of bores. Crab zoeae and barnacle cyprids were more abundant in the bottom strata, whereas barnacle nauplii showed the opposite pattern. Significant changes in vertical distribution and abundance of target meroplankters occurred across internal tidal fronts, especially for crabs at depth, with surface and bottom organisms responding in opposite fashions. Changes in plankter abundance were significantly correlated with current flows in the strata where they were most abundant. The manner in which plankters were affected (increasing or decreasing abundance) appeared to be modulated by their vertical position within the water column. The significant differences found at the high frequencies of this study, maintained across sampling days, suggest that nearshore meroplankton populations may have greater and more consistent temporal and vertical variability than previously considered.

2016.  Non-random feeding enhances the contribution of oceanic zooplankton to the diet of the planktivorous coral reef fish Dascyllus flavicaudus. Marine Biology. 163   10.1007/s00227-016-2849-3     AbstractWebsiteCombining gut content analysis and sampling of ambient zooplankton, we examine departures from random feeding in a planktivorous coral reef fish and explore the effects of apparent non-random feeding behavior on the relative contribution of oceanic versus reef-associated zooplankton to fish diet. The planktivorous damselfish Dascyllus flavicaudus appears to exhibit strong positive electivity for oceanic copepods including Candacia spp. and copepods from the families Oncaeidae and Corycaeidae and consistent negative electivity for cyclopoid copepods (Oithonidae). In total, prey taxa categorized as oceanic in origin contributed 10-76 % of total zooplankton biomass in fish guts. The summed contribution of oceanic prey taxa to fish diet was significantly higher than expected under a model of random feeding based on the availability of oceanic versus reef-associated prey as sampled by zooplankton net tows. The feeding behavior of D. flavicaudus appears to be visibility-selective rather than or in addition to size-selective, as electivity across prey taxa could not be explained by differences in prey size alone.

2016.  Ecological and genetic variation in reef-building corals on four Society Islands. Limnology and Oceanography. 61:543-557.   10.1002/lno.10231     AbstractWebsiteWe quantified benthic community structure on shallow (10 m isobath) reefs separated by 3-130 km on four islands in the south Pacific, and evaluated the roles of disturbances vs. coral recruitment as causes of spatial heterogeneity. Reefs were surveyed in 2013 on Moorea, Tahiti, Tetiaroa, and Maiao, with community structure sampled at two sites on each island using photoquadrats. The effects of coral recruitment on population structure were evaluated through genetic analyses of Pocillopora on three of the islands. Benthic community structure with functional group resolution differed among islands and generally among sites, but coral community structure (generic resolution) differed among islands, but generally not among sites. Genetic analyses of Pocillopora using the open reading frame of host mtDNA revealed varying relative abundances of Pocillopora meandrina/Pocillopora eydouxi, Pocillopora verrucosa, Pocillopora effuses, and two unnamed haplotypes on each island. These results suggest that corals on each island represent unique samplings of genetically discrete larval assemblages rather than random samplings of a single larval assemblage. Together, our findings emphasize the extent to which coral community structure varies over a scale of < 200 km, and suggests that recruitment from spatially discrete pools of coral larvae plays an important role in creating spatial variation in community structure, even where reefs are connected by prevailing currents.

2016.  The effects of tectonic deformation and sediment allocation on shelf habitats and megabenthic distribution and diversity in southern California. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science. 169:25-37.   10.1016/j.ecss.2015.11.020     AbstractLandscape and seascape structures are typically complex and manifest as patch mosaics within characteristic biomes, bordering one another in gradual or abrupt ecotones. The underlying patch structure in coastal shelf ecosystems is driven by the interaction of tectonic, sedimentary, and sea level dynamic processes. Animals and plants occupy and interact within these mosaics. Terrestrial landscape ecological studies have shown that patch structure is important for ecological processes such as foraging, connectivity, predation, and species dynamics. The importance of patch structure for marine systems is less clear because far fewer pattern-process studies have been conducted in these systems. For many coastal shelf systems, there is a paucity of information on how species occupy shelf seascapes, particularly for seascapes imbued with complex patch structure and ecotones that are common globally due to tectonic activity. Here, we present the results of a study conducted along a myriameter-scale gradient of bottom and sub-bottom geological forcing altered by tectonic deformation, sea level transgression and sediment allocation. The resulting seascape is dominated by unconsolidated sediments throughout, but also exhibits increasing density and size of outcropping patches along a habitat patch gradient forced by the erosion of a sea level transgressive surface that has been deformed and tilted by tectonic forcing. A combination of sub-bottom profiling, multibeam bathymetry, and ROV surveys of the habitats and the demersal megafauna occupying the habitats indicate (1) significant beta diversity along this gradient, (2) biological diversity does not scale with habitat diversity, and (3) species occupy the patches disproportionately (non-linearly) with regard to the proportional availability of their preferred habitats. These results indicate that shelf habitat patch structure modulates species specific processes and interactions with other species. Further studies are needed to examine experimentally the mechanics of how patch structure modulates ecological processes in shelf systems. Our results also provide further support for including multiple spatial scales of patch structure for the application of remote habitat sensing as a surrogate for biological community structure.

2014.  Seabirds and marine mammals redistribute bioavailable iron in the Southern Ocean. Marine Ecology Progress Series. 510:1-13.   10.3354/meps10923     AbstractWebsiteBiological vectors are important for redistribution of nutrients in many ecological systems. While availability of iron (Fe) to phyto plankton limits pelagic productivity in the Southern Ocean, biomagnification within marine food webs can lead to high concentrations of Fe in the diet of seabirds and marine mammals. We investigated patterns in concentrations of the micronutrients Fe, Co, Zn and Mn, and the toxins Cd and As, in the guano of oceanic, coastal and predatory seabirds and in faeces of 2 species of marine mammals that congregate to breed in the sub-Antarctic Auckland Islands. We found that much of the variability in concentrations of Fe, Co, Zn and Mn among species could be explained by foraging behaviour and by trophic position. We observed concentrations of Fe to be 8 orders of magnitude higher in the guano of predators and coastal foragers than in the sub-Antarctic mixed layer. High concentrations of As and Cd were associated with organic matter sources from macroalgae. Analyses of the molar ratio Fe:Al indicated that Fe within food webs supporting seabirds has likely been extensively recycled from its lithogenic source. Patterns in Fe:N among species indicated that Fe is concentrated 2 to 4 orders of magnitude in the guano of seabirds compared to limiting conditions for phytoplankton growth in sub-Antarctic waters. These data highlight the potential role of seabirds and marine mammals in the redistribution of micronutrients in the Southern Ocean and their likely role as key nutrient vectors in the ecosystem, particularly around the sub-Antarctic islands during the breeding season.

2014.  Regional synchrony of temperature variation and internal wave forcing along the Florida Keys reef tract. Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans. 119:548-558.   10.1002/2013jc009371     AbstractWebsiteAnalysis of 10 year temperature records collected along the Florida Keys reef tract (FLKRT) reveals strong, regional-scale synchrony in high-frequency temperature variation suggestive of internal wave forcing at predominately semidiurnal frequencies. In each year and at all sites, the amplitude of semidiurnal temperature variation was greatest from March to September, and markedly lower from October to February. Comparisons of the semidiurnal component of the temperature variation among sites suggest complex patterns in the arrival of internal waves, with highest cross correlation among closely spaced sites and synchrony in periods of enhanced internal wave activity across the length of the FLKRT, particularly in summer. The periods of enhanced semidiurnal temperature variation at the 20 and 30 m isobaths on the reef slopes appear to be associated with the dynamics of the Florida Current and the onshore movement of warm fronts preceding the passage of Florida Current frontal eddies. Regional-scale satellite altimetry observations suggest temporal linkages to sea surface height anomalies in the Loop Current (upstream of the Florida Current) and setup of the Tortugas Gyre. The synchronized forcing of cool water onto the reef slope sites across the FLKRT is likely to affect physiological responses to temperature variation in corals and other ectothermic organisms, as well as larval transport and nutrient dynamics with the potential for regionally coherent pulses of larvae and nutrients arriving on reef slopes across the FLKRT. Key Points  Temperature variation from internal waves is modulated regionally in the FL Keys High-frequency temperature variation changes synchronously across sites Thermocline dynamics are associated with Florida Current frontal eddies

2013.  Biological and physical interactions on a tropical island coral reef transport and retention processes on Moorea, French Polynesia. Oceanography. 26:52-63. AbstractWebsiteThe Moorea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research project funded by the US National Science Foundation includes multidisciplinary studies of physical processes driving ecological dynamics across the fringing reef, back reef, and fore reef habitats of Moorea, French Polynesia. A network of oceanographic moorings and a variety of other approaches have been used to investigate the biological and biogeochemical aspects of water transport and retention processes in this system. There is evidence to support the hypothesis that a low-frequency counterclockwise flow around the island is superimposed on the relatively strong alongshore currents on each side of the island. Despite the rapid flow and flushing of the back reef, waters over the reef display chemical and biological characteristics distinct from those offshore. The patterns include higher nutrient and lower dissolved organic carbon concentrations, distinct microbial community compositions among habitats, and reef assemblages of zooplankton that exhibit migration behavior, suggesting multigenerational residence on the reef. Zooplankton consumption by planktivorous fish on the reef reflects both retention of reef-associated taxa and capture by the reef community of resources originating offshore. Coral recruitment and population genetics of reef fishes point to retention of larvae within the system and high recruitment levels from local adult populations. The combined results suggest that a broad suite of physical and biological processes contribute to high retention of externally derived and locally produced organic materials within this island coral reef system.

2012.  The island-scale internal wave climate of Moorea, French Polynesia. Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans. 117   10.1029/2012jc007949     AbstractWebsiteAnalysis of five-year records of temperatures and currents collected at Moorea reveal strong internal wave activity at predominantly semi-diurnal frequencies impacting reef slopes at depths >= 30 m around the entire island. Temperature changes of 1.5 degrees C to 3 degrees C are accompanied by surges of upward and onshore flow and vertical shear in onshore currents. Superimposed on annual temperature changes of approximately 3 degrees C, internal wave activity is high from Oct-May and markedly lower from Jun-Sep. The offshore pycnocline is broadly distributed with continuous stratification to at least 500 m depth, and a subsurface fluorescence maximum above the strong nutricline at approximately 200 m. Minimum buoyancy periods range from 4.8 to 6 min, with the maximum density gradient occurring at 50 to 60 m depth in summer and deepening to approximately 150 to 200 m in winter. The bottom slope angle around all of Moorea is super-critical relative to the vertical stratification angle suggesting that energy propagating into shallow water is only a portion of total incident internal wave energy. Vertical gradient Richardson numbers indicate dominance by density stability relative to current shear with relatively limited diapycnal mixing. Coherence and lagged cross-correlation of semi-diurnal temperature variation indicate complex patterns of inter-site arrival of internal waves and no clear coherence or lagged correlation relationships among island sides. Semi-diurnal and high frequency internal wave packets likely arrive on Moorea from a combination of local and distant sources and may have important impacts for nutrient and particle fluxes in deep reef environments.

2012.  Vertical distribution of Macrocystis pyrifera nutrient exposure in southern California. Estuarine Coastal and Shelf Science. 106:85-92.   10.1016/j.ecss.2012.04.026     AbstractWebsiteWe examined water column temperature time series profiles for several years at two locations in a single kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) forest to characterize the alongshore variability of the nutrient climate that giant kelp is exposed to and compare it to the response of giant kelp. The differences in nutrient climate are due to differential alongshore vertical variations in temperature, a well-established proxy of nitrate, due to the topographically induced internal wave dynamics within the kelp forest. We observed the greatest temperature variability during summer and most of this variability occurred near the surface. The 14.5 degrees C isotherm, indicating the presence of nitrate, ranged the entire vertical extent of the water column, and was shallowest during the winter and in the southern portion of the kelp forest. Predicted water column integrated nitrate varies from 0 mu mol NO3-/m(2) to 431 mu mol NO3-/m(2) yielding a time series daily average of 0.12 gN/m(2)day (North La Jolla) and 0.18 gN/m(2)day (South La Jolla). Redfield conversion of these values puts the time series daily average for carbon production (upper limit) between 0.8 and 1.2 gC/m(2)day for the north and south parts of the bed respectively, and shows considerable variation at several time scales. Giant kelp in the southern portion of the forest exhibited greater stipe densities (a proxy for kelp production) than individuals in the northern portion, corresponding with the alongshore nutrient climate variability. The depth of the nutricline varied by up to 10 m over time scales as short as hours. Variability was greatest at diurnal and semi-diurnal frequencies, with shallower water column depths showing greatest variability. These depth-specific variations in temperature and nutrient exposure may have biologically important consequences for M. pyrifera especially during low nutrient seasons. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

2012.  Cross-shelf transport of sub-thermocline nitrate by the internal tide and rapid (3-6 h) incorporation by an inshore macroalga. Continental Shelf Research. 42:10-19.   10.1016/j.csr.2012.03.010     AbstractWebsiteDuring summer in shallow waters off Baja California, Mexico, the internal tide is a dominant thermal feature of the water column. However, its importance for sub-thermocline nutrient provision to benthic macroalgae is unknown. In order to determine if internal motions provide nutrients to macroalgae in summer, Ulva lactuca was outplanted at inshore stations for short (3 and 6 h) intervals, at the surface, 5 and 10 m depth, and tissue nitrogen content was measured before and after each deployment. Concurrently temperature, currents, and nutrients were measured using moored thermistors, current profilers, CTDs. Niskin bottles, and an in-situ UV absorbance nitrate sensor (ISUS). Discrete pulses of cool, nutrient-rich water were horizontally displaced at least 4 km on the shelf and shoaled more than 20 m depth at the semidiurnal frequency, resulting in more than a 10-fold change in the concentration of nitrate. Inshore, tissue nitrogen of Ulva outplants increased significantly during longer exposures to this cool water. At this site, the semidiurnal signal dominates water column temperature fluctuations from April to November, with summer showing the greatest cooling (up to 5 degrees C) in a one-hour period. We estimated that 11% of the days of a year show internal waves that would cause a significant change in nutrient availability to macroalgae at 5 m depth. This study supports the hypothesis that nitrate can reach and be rapidly incorporated by inshore macroalgae such as Ulva through transport forced by the internal tide, and that even very short (<1 h) nutrient pulses in nature are reflected in macroalgal tissue. We propose that at this site, the internal tide provides a significant, yet understudied, high frequency nutrient source to inshore primary producers, particularly in summer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

2012.  Sea ice microbial production supports Ross Sea benthic communities: influence of a small but stable subsidy. Ecology. 93:314-323. AbstractWebsiteDiversity in guilds of primary producers enhances temporal stability in provision of organic matter to consumers. In the Antarctic ecosystem, where temporal variability in phytoplankton production is high, sea ice contains a diatom and microbial community (SIMCO) that represents a pool of organic matter that is seasonally more consistent, although of relatively small magnitude. The fate of organic material produced by SIMCO in Antarctica is largely unknown but may represent an important link between sea ice dynamics and secondary production in nearshore food webs. We used whole tissue and compound-specific stable isotope analysis of consumers to test whether the sea ice microbial community is an important source of organic matter supporting nearshore communities in the Ross Sea. We found distinct gradients in delta C-13 and delta N-15 of SIMCO corresponding to differences in inorganic carbon and nitrogen acquisition among sites with different sea ice extent and persistence. Mass balance analysis of a suite of consumers demonstrated large fluxes of SIMCO into the nearshore food web, ranging from 5% to 100% of organic matter supplied to benthic species, and 0-10% of organic matter to upper water column or pelagic inhabitants. A delta C-13 analysis of nine fatty acids including two key biomarkers for diatoms, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 omega 3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 omega 3), confirmed these patterns. We observed clear patterns in delta C-13 of fatty acids that are enriched in C-13 for species that acquire a large fraction of their nutrition from SIMCO. These data demonstrate the key role of SIMCO in ecosystem functioning in Antarctica and strong linkages between sea ice extent and nearshore secondary productivity. While SIMCO provides a stabilizing subsidy of organic matter, changes to sea ice coverage associated with climate change would directly affect secondary production and stability of benthic food webs in Antarctica.

2011.  Nitrogen uptake and growth by the opportunistic macroalga Ulva lactuca (Linnaeus) during the internal tide. Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology. 406:108-115.   10.1016/j.jembe.2011.05.028     AbstractWebsiteTo determine if an opportunistic macroalga could increase its tissue nitrogen content in response to nutrient pulses forced by the internal tide, independent samples of the green alga Ulva lactuca (Linnaeus), previously cultured in nutrient-poor tanks, were outplanted in the nearshore ocean for 12 h deployment periods (8 daylight periods, 7 night periods), at three different depths (1.5. and 10 m), during stratified water column conditions and spring tides. Algal tissue nitrogen and growth weight (before and after each deployment), water-column temperature (continuous), and inorganic water-column nutrient concentrations (taken on 3 days during the experiment) were measured. Abrupt drops in temperature (up to 3 degrees C in an hour) occurred twice daily, at 10 m and occasionally at 5 m depth, associated with the internal tide. Date and deployment depth had significant effects on U. lactuca tissue nitrogen, showing a significant increase for deeper deployments and a positive correlation with the duration of cool water (< 15.8 degrees C, > 1 mu M NO(3)(-)) at the deployment depth. On days when temperature remained above 15.8 degrees C at all depths (15.8 degrees C was established as the temperature below which nitrate was above 1 mu M), no significant increase in tissue nitrogen was detected at any depth. Growth and tissue nitrogen were significantly and inversely correlated for mid-water (5 m) and bottom (10 m) deployments, but not at the surface. The data support the hypothesis that U. lactuca can increase tissue nitrogen in response to the cold phase of the semidiurnal internal tide. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

2011.  Temperature variability and algal isotopic heterogeneity on a Floridian coral reef. Marine Ecology-an Evolutionary Perspective. 32:364-379.   10.1111/j.1439-0485.2011.00469.x     AbstractWebsiteOn Conch Reef, Florida Keys, USA, we examine relationships between temperature variability measured with a unique, high-resolution sensor network, and the abundance of benthic reef organisms and carbon, nitrogen and oxygen stable isotopic composition of two abundant macroalgal species. Visualization of spatial temperature anomalies mapped onto measured reef bathymetry reveals episodic thermal patchiness and persistent thermal features likely indicating meter scale variability in nutrient supply. These patterns result from the relatively shallow depths of the offshore thermocline and an active internal wave field creating a hydrographic structure conducive to interactions of an offshore, subthermocline nutrient pool with reef topography. The distribution of major benthic reef organism taxa, as well as the stable isotopic composition of C, N and O, from the macroalgae Dictyota menstrualis and Halimeda tuna are all highly variable on scales of less than 10 m and are not necessarily depth-dependent. Covariability between spatial patterns of the temperature minima, depth and delta(13)C of D. menstrualis and H. tuna suggest a role of oceanographic forcing in inorganic carbon acquisition in these species. Comparisons of the measured temperature with the predicted temperature based on delta(18)O from H. tuna aragonite suggest a possible influence of low salinity water in the system and non-linear interactions between ambient conditions and calcification at fine temporal and spatial scales. These observations have implications for the interpretation of both contemporary and paleontologic reef environments where oceanographic forcing interacts with complex reef topography.

2011.  Anchor Ice and Benthic Disturbance in Shallow Antarctic Waters: Interspecific Variation in Initiation and Propagation of Ice Crystals. Biological Bulletin. 221:155-163. AbstractWebsiteSea ice typically forms at the ocean's surface, but given a source of supercooled water, an unusual form of ice-anchor ice-can grow on objects in the water column or at the seafloor. For several decades, ecologists have considered anchor ice to be an important agent of disturbance in the shallow-water benthic communities of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, and potentially elsewhere in polar seas. Divers have documented anchor ice in the McMurdo communities, and its presence coincides with reduced abundance of the sponge Homaxinella balfourensis, which provides habitat for a diverse assemblage of benthic organisms. However, the mechanism of this disturbance has not been explored. Here we show interspecific differences in anchor-ice formation and propagation characteristics for Antarctic benthic organisms. The sponges H. balfourensis and Suberites caminatus show increased incidence of formation and accelerated spread of ice crystals compared to urchins and sea stars. Anchor ice also forms readily on sediments, from which it can grow and adhere to organisms. Our results are consistent with, and provide a potential first step toward, an explanation for disturbance patterns observed in shallow polar benthic communities. Interspecific differences in ice formation raise questions about how surface tissue characteristics such as surface area, rugosity, and mucus coating affect ice formation on invertebrates.

2011.  Bleaching of the giant barrel sponge Xestospongia muta in the Florida Keys. Limnology and Oceanography. 56:2243-2250.   10.4319/lo.2011.56.6.2243     AbstractWebsiteThe giant barrel sponge Xestospongia muta is now the dominant habitat-forming organism on many Caribbean coral reefs and has been observed to undergo cycles of bleaching similar to those seen for reef-building corals. We examined bleaching of X. muta at 15-m, 20-m, and 30-m depths over 2000-2005 on Conch Reef, Key Largo, Florida, to determine the spatial and temporal patterns of bleaching, whether bleaching affected sponge mortality, and whether there was a relationship between bleaching and seawater temperatures. Bleaching increased significantly with depth and was greater in autumn than spring, but the response was not uniform across the sponge population. Bleaching of X. muta did not result in sponge mortality, corroborating the conclusion that cyanobacterial symbionts of the sponge provide little or no benefit to the host. There was greater sponge bleaching with higher minimum daily seawater temperature anomalies within 30 d of surveys in the spring. For both the spring and autumn, there was greater bleaching with a higher number of positive 0.5 degrees C daily anomalies within 14 d before surveys. Anomalously warm seawater temperatures fail to completely explain the variability of the observed bleaching response, however, and additional work would be required to conclusively determine whether a causal relationship between bleaching and temperature exists. As has been described for corals, bleaching of X. muta is likely a complex response that may be affected by multiple factors, including light availability and differences in bleaching susceptibility among Synechococcus symbionts.

2011.  Connectivity and stability of mesophotic coral reefs. Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology. 408:32-41.   10.1016/j.jembe.2011.07.024     AbstractWebsiteMesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs), occurring at depths of 30 to over 150 m, represents the deep continuum of adjacent shallow coral reefs about which little is known. These reefs are most developed, and most frequently studied, in areas where light penetration is high and photosymbiotic reef-builders (corals) can persist as common members of the benthic community. The upper mesophotic zone typically extends to 60 m and comprises communities that are generally similar to those found in shallow reef systems. Below 60 m, the lower mesophotic zone is dominated by sponges and algae that are uncommon or absent from shallower areas, and a fish fauna that is largely specialized to these intermediate depths. It is likely that these ecosystems are much more widespread and important than was previously recognized. MCEs have the potential to function as refugia for shallow reefs because many disturbances in the upper 30 m may leave MCEs largely intact. Ontogenetic movement and spawning migrations by reef fishes provide an important ecological component to connectivity between shallow and mesophotic reefs and may represent the effective range of larval dispersal. However, there is currently limited information on genetic connectivity between deep and shallow coral reef populations, and this is a critical gap in understanding the role of MCEs in coral reef resilience. Here we review the connectivity and trophic relationships between the shallow and mesophotic coral reefs, the potential role of MCEs as refugia, and the effects of a new biological invader that exposes critical gaps in our understanding of the stability of these ecosystems.

2011.  Effects of Coral Reef Benthic Primary Producers on Dissolved Organic Carbon and Microbial Activity. Plos One. 6   10.1371/journal.pone.0027973     AbstractWebsiteBenthic primary producers in marine ecosystems may significantly alter biogeochemical cycling and microbial processes in their surrounding environment. To examine these interactions, we studied dissolved organic matter release by dominant benthic taxa and subsequent microbial remineralization in the lagoonal reefs of Moorea, French Polynesia. Rates of photosynthesis, respiration, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release were assessed for several common benthic reef organisms from the backreef habitat. We assessed microbial community response to dissolved exudates of each benthic producer by measuring bacterioplankton growth, respiration, and DOC drawdown in two-day dark dilution culture incubations. Experiments were conducted for six benthic producers: three species of macroalgae (each representing a different algal phylum: Turbinaria ornata - Ochrophyta; Amansia rhodantha - Rhodophyta; Halimeda opuntia - Chlorophyta), a mixed assemblage of turf algae, a species of crustose coralline algae (Hydrolithon reinboldii) and a dominant hermatypic coral (Porites lobata). Our results show that all five types of algae, but not the coral, exuded significant amounts of labile DOC into their surrounding environment. In general, primary producers with the highest rates of photosynthesis released the most DOC and yielded the greatest bacterioplankton growth; turf algae produced nearly twice as much DOC per unit surface area than the other benthic producers (14.0 +/- 2.8 mu mol h(-1) dm(-2)), stimulating rapid bacterioplankton growth (0.044 +/- 0.002 log10 cells h(-1)) and concomitant oxygen drawdown (0.16 +/- 0.05 mu mol L(-1) h(-1) dm(-2)). Our results demonstrate that benthic reef algae can release a significant fraction of their photosynthetically-fixed carbon as DOC, these release rates vary by species, and this DOC is available to and consumed by reef associated microbes. These data provide compelling evidence that benthic primary producers differentially influence reef microbial dynamics and biogeochemical parameters (i.e., DOC and oxygen availability, bacterial abundance and metabolism) in coral reef communities.

2011.  Physical and biological processes underlying the sudden surface appearance of a red tide in the nearshore. Limnology and Oceanography. 56:787-801.   10.4319/lo.2011.56.3.0787     AbstractWebsiteThe sudden appearance at the surface of an alongshore-parallel band of red tide near Huntington Beach, California, is described in high spatial and temporal resolution using novel instrumentation including a global positioning system-tracked jet-ski. The scale of the surface chlorophyll a (Chl a) band was small (similar to 200 m cross-shore) and ephemeral (3 h) compared with the subsurface extent of the red tide (similar to 2 km, > 7 d). The red tide was dominated by the regionally common dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedrum (F. Stein) and had developed as a subsurface Chl a layer during the 7 d prior to the surface appearance. A few hours before the surface appearance, a subsurface patch of elevated Chl a (Chl a > 30 mu g L(-1)) was observed in 13-m total depth in the trough of a shoreward-propagating internal wave, consistent with dinoflagellate vertical swimming interacting with the internal wave-driven convergence. Internal wave-breaking-induced vertical mixing in similar to 8-m water depth vertically spread the Chl a patch to the surface, creating the alongshore surface band similar to 500 m from shore. Both the subsurface Chl a patch and the surface Chl a band were prevented from entering the surf-zone by a density barrier of warm water adjacent to the beach. These high-resolution observations emphasize the role of nearshore physical dynamics in controlling the duration and intensity of red tide exposure to coastal habitats.

2011.  Variation in environmental conditions in a subtidal prey refuge: effects of salinity stress, food availability and predation on mussels in a fjord system. Marine Ecology-Progress Series. 422:201-210.   10.3354/meps08911     AbstractWebsitePrey refuges are fundamental structural features in communities. We investigated variability in environmental conditions within a subtidal prey refuge for the blue mussel Mytilus edulis galloprovincialis formed by the persistent low-salinity layer (LSL) in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand. Multi-year observations and fine-scale oceanographic surveys along the axis of Doubtful Sound show strong spatial gradients in salinity, temperature, chlorophyll a (chl a) and nitrate concentrations. Mean surface salinity ranged from similar to 5 in the inner fjord zone to 15 in the mid-fjord, and 25 to 30 in the entrance zone. A marked subsurface maximum in chl a was observed below the LSL at 3 to 7 m depth. Adult blue mussels were confined to the LSL with a sharp decline in abundance from the entrance to the inner regions of the fjord. In contrast, mussel recruitment was observed both within and below the LSL to 10 m depth, with highest recruitment in the mid-fjord zone at 6 m depth. To test whether patterns in growth and survival in the absence of predation were coincident with food supply and salinity stress, we transplanted mussels in predator exclusion cages at depths of 2, 4, 6, and 8 m within inner, mid-, and entrance fjord zones and measured growth over 213 d. Variation in salinity and temperature, rather than food availability, had the largest impact on mussel growth rates and explained 89% of the variability in mussel growth. Salinity alone explained 87% of the variability in mussel growth. Adult survival in the absence of predation did not significantly differ with depth or fjord zone. Environmental stress, primarily in the form of stress associated with low salinity, exerted the greatest influence on growth of mussels within this critical subtidal prey refuge.

2010.  Landscape-scale variation in coral recruitment in Moorea, French Polynesia. Marine Ecology-Progress Series. 414:75-89.   10.3354/meps08728     AbstractWebsiteIn this study, we describe spatio-temporal variation in coral recruitment in the back reef of Moorea, French Polynesia, and explore the extent to which it is associated with community structure, seawater temperature, and wave regimes. Recruitment was assessed with settlement tiles deployed at 10 sites on the north, southeast, and southwest shores and sampled every 5 to 7 mo from 2005 to 2007. Temperature and waves were measured using thermistors and pressure sensors, and community structure was assessed using in situ surveys. Mean recruitment varied from 0 to 6 recruits tile(-1) (510 cm(2)) and was generally greater in the second compared to the first year of the study. Recruitment varied among sites, and this variation was similar between years but differed among sampling periods: acroporids were common on the southwest shore between January and September, but rare from September to January; poritids were common on the north shore between September and January, but rare on the southwest shore from January to September; and pocilloporids were found all year, but at slightly elevated densities between January and September. The mean daily seawater temperature, and the daily range, varied among sites, but neither was closely related to coral recruitment, and both were of biologically small magnitudes. The coral community structure also varied among sites, but likewise, was not associated with coral recruitment. In contrast, outer reef wave energy exposure, which likely played an important role in driving cross-reef transport of seawater into the lagoon, differed between shores and seasons in a pattern consistent with the variation in coral recruitment in the back reef. We hypothesize that coral recruitment in the back reef of Moorea is influenced by the interaction of seasonal variation in wave exposure, family-level differences in coral reproductive timing, and the spatial distribution of adult corals.

2010.  Long-term declines in coral cover at Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles. Atoll Research Bulletin. 582:1-22. AbstractThe reefs surrounding Bonaire have long been renowned for their high abundance and diversity of scleractinian corals and for their long-time status as a protected marine park. As part of a comprehensive study of the current status of Bonaire’s reefs, a quantitative benthic community survey was conducted at 7 locations across depths from 10 to 30 m in early 2008. This showed mean coral cover ranging from 23.7% ± 3.8 (SE) to 38.4% ± 4.4 (SE) on the island’s leeward shore and 1.6% ± 0.4 (SE) to 22.4% ± 3.6 (SE) on the windward shore. Percent cover of macrophytes and turf algae ranged from 41.7% ± 2.0 (SE) to 51.8% ± 3.0 (SE) on the leeward shore and 60.8% ± 4.1 (SE) to 82.7% ± 2.5 (SE) on the windward shore. Comparison of these results to earlier work from 1982 on the leeward shore and 1988 on the windward shore points to a significant, system-wide decrease in corals, increase in macroalgae and increase in the ratio of algae to corals. These observations point to significant degradation of reefs at a site often described as relatively ‘pristine’ in the Caribbean and highlight the sensitivity of coral reefs to anthropogenic and natural stresses even on well-protected islands.

2009.  Influence of bubbles and sand on chlorophyll-a fluorescence measurements in the surfzone. Limnology and Oceanography-Methods. 7:354-362.   10.4319/lo.2011.56.3.0787     AbstractWebsiteContinuous chlorophyll-a (Chla) measurements in the surfzone (region of wave-breaking adjacent to the shoreline) would increase understanding of harmful algal blooms, food supply for intertidal invertebrates and fishes, and the fate of terrestrial runoff pollution. Optical measurements of Chla fluorescence in the surfzone are affected by bubbles and suspended sand. Here, errors in surfzone Chla fluorescence measurements (using WET Labs ECO Triplet fluorometers) are estimated by comparing observed (Chla(raw)) with known (Chla(true)) Chla concentrations in laboratory tests with controlled amounts of bubbles and suspended sand (characterized with concurrently measured optical turbidity, tau). For both bubbles and sand, Chla raw and t are linearly correlated, and the regression line slope depends on Chla(true). When Chla(true) is low, Chla(raw) is biased high, and when Chla(true) is high, Chla(raw) is biased low. Fluorometers were also deployed in a natural surfzone, and for the limited range of field Chla observed, the field and laboratory tau-Chla relationships were largely consistent. Mechanisms responsible for these biases are proposed, and correction procedures using the observed tau-Chla relationship are developed and applied to surfzone Chla(raw) observations. For the moderate Chla(true) concentrations (2-4 mu g L(-1)) encountered, errors in hourly mean and instantaneous Chla(raw) are less than 5% and 15%, respectively. Larger errors are expected for Chla(true) outside this range. Although further testing is needed, the results suggest that in situ, optical Chla(raw) from other turbid environments (e.g., estuaries, bays) should also be interpreted cautiously.

2009.  Ecology of mesophotic coral reefs. Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology. 375:1-8.   10.1016/j.jembe.2009.05.009     AbstractWebsiteMesophotic coral reefs, reefs at depths of 30 m to 150 m, are receiving renewed interest from coral reef scientists and managers because they are linked physically and biologically to their shallow water counterparts, have the potential to be refugia for shallow coral reef taxa such as coral and sponges, and can be a source of larvae that could contribute to the resiliency of shallow water reefs. Here we review what is currently known about how mesophotic reef communities are structured and identify critical areas where new information is needed. The review covers two primary taxa, coral and sponges, where a majority of the ecological work on mesophotic coral reefs has been done, and physical processes (e.g., the attenuation of visible irradiance and internal waves) that exert significant abiotic control on the structure of these deep fore reef communities. Understanding the ecology of mesophotic coral reefs, and the connectivity between them and their shallow water counterparts, should be a primary focus of future reef studies as the worldwide degradation of shallow coral reefs, and the ecosystem services they provide, continues.

Contracting Business Success Pay for Performance: A Conversation with James Leichter


    He has a true desire to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit of those in the mechanical trades and help them build successful companies that engage employees and customers. 
  

Jun 30, 2017


































By Kelly Faloon
Ask James Leichter about the HVACR and mechanical contracting industry and you’ll hear many reasons why he believes the industry is a lucrative and rewarding field, and why more young people should enter the trades. He has a true desire to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit of those in the mechanical trades and help them build successful companies that engage employees and customers.
Leichter is president and CEO of software company Aptora Corp., Mr. HVAC LLC, and RA Tax and Accounting Inc. We talked with him recently about his thoughts on today’s HVACR industry.
1. When and why did you decide to go into your particular career field?
I grew up in a single-parent, alcoholic, drug-using family, and when I was in high school, my counselor brought me into her office shortly before graduation and reminded me I had a low IQ and a low GPA.
She asked me what my plans were for the future, and I stared at my feet. She went on to say, ‘You're probably not college-bound. You might want to consider a trade school such as plumbing or heating or air conditioning, possibly a career in the military. Have you thought about that?’ And I continued to stare at my feet. I glanced up at all the plaques on the wall and didn't dare argue with her. She went on for another few minutes, thanked me for coming into her office and I walked out.
Shortly after that, I got into the mechanical trade by signing up for something called the Job Training Partnership Act. It's not around anymore. It was a government program paid by welfare dollars that would pay me half my wage for 1,000 apprenticeship hours. So the government paid me $2.50 an hour, and the employer paid me $2.50 an hour, which was close to minimum wage at the time. And the employer was responsible for training me on useful skills, and my job was to learn and not become a permanent drain on society.
2. How did you develop the passion you have for the mechanical contracting industry?
I've had people ask me, ‘Why are you so passionate? Why are you always smiling? You're always in a good mood. Where does that come from?’ It began with that first mechanical trade job. I excelled at it. I was awesome at it, frankly. I was just very gifted for the trade. I came out of my shell, I had self-confidence, I felt important. I became a whole new person.
And I owe all that to the HVAC industry, and I've done extremely well financially and every way else. I've raised an awesome family. I mean, life has been fantastic, so why not smile all the time? That's why I'm always walking around with a grin on my face because life is awesome.
One thing I’ve learned about contractors, and this really hurts them, is they think their business is so unlike any other business that you could not and should not take advice from somebody who owns a lawn care company or a manufacturing company or a bar and grill. They couldn't possibly help you because you do heating and air conditioning, right? But really, HVAC is the product and service. Everything else is the same.
3. What's the most important thing you can impart on the readers for what they can expect to hear during Contractor Leadership Live?
My topic is performance-based compensation. That is basically pay for performance. And the good news is, business owners get paid by performance.
When owners hear performance-based compensation, at first they say, ‘Maybe I should do that. I don't know if we can. I don't know if we should implement that. Will people like it? Will it motivate people?’ Well, sure it will because performance-based compensation is the single method of paying a business owner. When the business does really well, you get paid. When the business does really poorly, you stop getting paid. It's just that simple. So all business owners are on performance-based compensation.
What my class will do is propose that we pay everybody on some form of performance-based compensation, a form that meets their individual culture, so it's not one-size-fits-all.
But I think what'll surprise them is how simple performance-based compensation is, how we're already implementing it in our company, and finally, how American performance-based compensation is. Performance-based compensation is about as American as apple pie.
4. Tell us something interesting about yourself.
I make my living running the software company called Aptora, but my passion is Mr. HVAC. It's a trademark of mine, and it came from being insulted. So part of that passion story is when I was an apprentice, I ran to the truck, I ran up the ladder, I ran down the ladder, and someone said, ‘Oh, look, there's Mr. HVAC.’ And I thought, ‘I like that.’ So I insisted everybody call me Mr. HVAC. Then I trademarked it and bought the domain name for it.
5. What's the most exciting part of your job right now?
Well, I believe public speaking and teaching classes is the most fun a person can have. It's a lot of fun filling a room full of people and showing them things maybe they haven't seen before or giving them different ways to think about things.
The other thing I really enjoy doing is being part of the design team that builds software for the contracting industry, so I serve as a software architect, not the same thing as a programmer. Being involved in designing software that makes the lives of contractors better is what Aptora is all about, and so it’s the second most fun that I have, building software, being part of the process.
6. What is the biggest issue we need to face in the HVACR contracting space?
I believe the biggest challenge the HVAC industry has is finding good employees, specifically service technicians. In fact, it's really hard to find employees, period. It doesn't matter what business you own because everywhere you go, there's a “Help Wanted” sign, but it's really difficult in the plumbing and HVAC industry because young people don't want to get dirty. They don't want to use tools. There are young people that have never fixed anything. They've never used a tool to make a repair.
Many of us in my generation, we fixed everything we could. You fixed the car, the toilet, you changed your own oil. But many young people just have no interest in repairing anything. And by the way, my two sons are just like that. One's 19, one's 22. They don't want to fix anything. They don't want to get dirty. They don't even want dirt on their hands. So it's really difficult when you combine that with a 4.2 percent unemployment rate nationally.
The other part of the problem, and people don't like to hear this, is there are too many owners. Too many technicians who start their own heating and air-conditioning business. Now, my daughter's middle name is America, so I'm about as pro-American as you can get. I'm all for starting your own company. But here's the difference. Many people start their own company because they have a better mousetrap to sell.
But in the HVAC industry, many people start their own company because they're tired of putting up with garbage from other people. So they walk out of your office and they quit. ‘I'm going to start my own heating and air-conditioning company,’ they say. So it wasn't that I thought I had a better idea. It's because I got tired of you telling me what to do. That's the wrong motivation because you trade one boss for hundreds, maybe thousands of bosses — your customers.
Many of them fail. Some struggle and do very poorly. They don't make as much money as they would working for somebody else, especially a good company. And they put up with a lot of stress they don't need. They put their family through stress they don't need. And again, it isn't because they are an entrepreneur at heart, it's because they were avoiding authority.
I mean, the economy can be so good that decent people can do pretty well. But when things get really tough, a lot of these weaker companies go out of business, and it's sad because many consulting people like me see a lot of pain. We've seen a lot of families in bad shape because the man, typically it's a man, is just dead-set on calling his own shots.
So if they would just go to work for other companies and get along, if we could all just get along, we would have many more technicians to pick from.
Owners need to think about it like this. You have to make the transition from technician to business owner. A lot of us are under the mistaken impression you can make more money by turning your wrench a little faster. But at some point, you realize you've maxed yourself out, you've done all you can do with a toolbox, right? So you have to graduate to pushing the pen.
But many of us come from a background where our families made fun of pen pushers. If you grew up middle class, lower middle class like me, the people who sat behind the desk, they didn't work. The people who made the company were the ones out turning the wrench, right?
But it's a team effort. That's like saying the head coach doesn't need the quarterback, and the quarterback doesn't need the coach or the offensive line. It's a different mentality to think you're actually working by sitting at a desk.
7. What technology is coming up in the near future that you believe will alter the mechanical contracting course forever?
I believe home automation could be potentially very bad for the contractor. As homes become ‘smarter,’ then it means things are going to get more and more sophisticated, leaving out unsophisticated contractors. So, in other words, if thermostats can monitor the operating conditions of the heating and cooling system, if water heaters can send a message to somebody saying, ‘I'm not heating water,’ if the home gets really, really sophisticated, it spells doom for smaller contractors that can't keep up with technology.
For example, many contractors have failed to transition to mobile software. Full disclosure: my company makes mobile software, among other things. But many contractors have said, ‘No. No, we're not doing that. My people won't like that. We're going to use pen and paper.’ If you're using that excuse, you're being left behind because it’s basically UPS vs. the United States Postal Service. UPS went high-tech long before the postal service did, and we all know how that worked out. UPS has done far better, and so has FedEx, right?
So dealers have to understand, contractors have to understand that they have to keep up with technology. Home automation means the larger companies have a chance to do away with the smaller contractor and I'll give you an example. Amazon sells you a thermostat that understands when the HVAC system isn't working properly. The thermostat then sends a message to Amazon, and then Amazon gives the service call to the lowest bidder.
And that's what's going to start happening. You're going to have home automation companies — Honeywell, Amazon, and others — starting to take away our customers. So our customers aren't going to know us anymore. They're going to know Amazon, Honeywell, etc., and they won't care about the company that actually comes out and does the work. They're going to steal my relationship with my customer.

Contracting Business Success Pay for Performance: A Conversation with James Leichter


    He has a true desire to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit of those in the mechanical trades and help them build successful companies that engage employees and customers. 
  

Jun 30, 2017


































By Kelly Faloon
Ask James Leichter about the HVACR and mechanical contracting industry and you’ll hear many reasons why he believes the industry is a lucrative and rewarding field, and why more young people should enter the trades. He has a true desire to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit of those in the mechanical trades and help them build successful companies that engage employees and customers.
Leichter is president and CEO of software company Aptora Corp., Mr. HVAC LLC, and RA Tax and Accounting Inc. We talked with him recently about his thoughts on today’s HVACR industry.
1. When and why did you decide to go into your particular career field?
I grew up in a single-parent, alcoholic, drug-using family, and when I was in high school, my counselor brought me into her office shortly before graduation and reminded me I had a low IQ and a low GPA.
She asked me what my plans were for the future, and I stared at my feet. She went on to say, ‘You're probably not college-bound. You might want to consider a trade school such as plumbing or heating or air conditioning, possibly a career in the military. Have you thought about that?’ And I continued to stare at my feet. I glanced up at all the plaques on the wall and didn't dare argue with her. She went on for another few minutes, thanked me for coming into her office and I walked out.
Shortly after that, I got into the mechanical trade by signing up for something called the Job Training Partnership Act. It's not around anymore. It was a government program paid by welfare dollars that would pay me half my wage for 1,000 apprenticeship hours. So the government paid me $2.50 an hour, and the employer paid me $2.50 an hour, which was close to minimum wage at the time. And the employer was responsible for training me on useful skills, and my job was to learn and not become a permanent drain on society.
2. How did you develop the passion you have for the mechanical contracting industry?
I've had people ask me, ‘Why are you so passionate? Why are you always smiling? You're always in a good mood. Where does that come from?’ It began with that first mechanical trade job. I excelled at it. I was awesome at it, frankly. I was just very gifted for the trade. I came out of my shell, I had self-confidence, I felt important. I became a whole new person.
And I owe all that to the HVAC industry, and I've done extremely well financially and every way else. I've raised an awesome family. I mean, life has been fantastic, so why not smile all the time? That's why I'm always walking around with a grin on my face because life is awesome.
One thing I’ve learned about contractors, and this really hurts them, is they think their business is so unlike any other business that you could not and should not take advice from somebody who owns a lawn care company or a manufacturing company or a bar and grill. They couldn't possibly help you because you do heating and air conditioning, right? But really, HVAC is the product and service. Everything else is the same.
3. What's the most important thing you can impart on the readers for what they can expect to hear during Contractor Leadership Live?
My topic is performance-based compensation. That is basically pay for performance. And the good news is, business owners get paid by performance.
When owners hear performance-based compensation, at first they say, ‘Maybe I should do that. I don't know if we can. I don't know if we should implement that. Will people like it? Will it motivate people?’ Well, sure it will because performance-based compensation is the single method of paying a business owner. When the business does really well, you get paid. When the business does really poorly, you stop getting paid. It's just that simple. So all business owners are on performance-based compensation.
What my class will do is propose that we pay everybody on some form of performance-based compensation, a form that meets their individual culture, so it's not one-size-fits-all.
But I think what'll surprise them is how simple performance-based compensation is, how we're already implementing it in our company, and finally, how American performance-based compensation is. Performance-based compensation is about as American as apple pie.
4. Tell us something interesting about yourself.
I make my living running the software company called Aptora, but my passion is Mr. HVAC. It's a trademark of mine, and it came from being insulted. So part of that passion story is when I was an apprentice, I ran to the truck, I ran up the ladder, I ran down the ladder, and someone said, ‘Oh, look, there's Mr. HVAC.’ And I thought, ‘I like that.’ So I insisted everybody call me Mr. HVAC. Then I trademarked it and bought the domain name for it.
5. What's the most exciting part of your job right now?
Well, I believe public speaking and teaching classes is the most fun a person can have. It's a lot of fun filling a room full of people and showing them things maybe they haven't seen before or giving them different ways to think about things.
The other thing I really enjoy doing is being part of the design team that builds software for the contracting industry, so I serve as a software architect, not the same thing as a programmer. Being involved in designing software that makes the lives of contractors better is what Aptora is all about, and so it’s the second most fun that I have, building software, being part of the process.
6. What is the biggest issue we need to face in the HVACR contracting space?
I believe the biggest challenge the HVAC industry has is finding good employees, specifically service technicians. In fact, it's really hard to find employees, period. It doesn't matter what business you own because everywhere you go, there's a “Help Wanted” sign, but it's really difficult in the plumbing and HVAC industry because young people don't want to get dirty. They don't want to use tools. There are young people that have never fixed anything. They've never used a tool to make a repair.
Many of us in my generation, we fixed everything we could. You fixed the car, the toilet, you changed your own oil. But many young people just have no interest in repairing anything. And by the way, my two sons are just like that. One's 19, one's 22. They don't want to fix anything. They don't want to get dirty. They don't even want dirt on their hands. So it's really difficult when you combine that with a 4.2 percent unemployment rate nationally.
The other part of the problem, and people don't like to hear this, is there are too many owners. Too many technicians who start their own heating and air-conditioning business. Now, my daughter's middle name is America, so I'm about as pro-American as you can get. I'm all for starting your own company. But here's the difference. Many people start their own company because they have a better mousetrap to sell.
But in the HVAC industry, many people start their own company because they're tired of putting up with garbage from other people. So they walk out of your office and they quit. ‘I'm going to start my own heating and air-conditioning company,’ they say. So it wasn't that I thought I had a better idea. It's because I got tired of you telling me what to do. That's the wrong motivation because you trade one boss for hundreds, maybe thousands of bosses — your customers.
Many of them fail. Some struggle and do very poorly. They don't make as much money as they would working for somebody else, especially a good company. And they put up with a lot of stress they don't need. They put their family through stress they don't need. And again, it isn't because they are an entrepreneur at heart, it's because they were avoiding authority.
I mean, the economy can be so good that decent people can do pretty well. But when things get really tough, a lot of these weaker companies go out of business, and it's sad because many consulting people like me see a lot of pain. We've seen a lot of families in bad shape because the man, typically it's a man, is just dead-set on calling his own shots.
So if they would just go to work for other companies and get along, if we could all just get along, we would have many more technicians to pick from.
Owners need to think about it like this. You have to make the transition from technician to business owner. A lot of us are under the mistaken impression you can make more money by turning your wrench a little faster. But at some point, you realize you've maxed yourself out, you've done all you can do with a toolbox, right? So you have to graduate to pushing the pen.
But many of us come from a background where our families made fun of pen pushers. If you grew up middle class, lower middle class like me, the people who sat behind the desk, they didn't work. The people who made the company were the ones out turning the wrench, right?
But it's a team effort. That's like saying the head coach doesn't need the quarterback, and the quarterback doesn't need the coach or the offensive line. It's a different mentality to think you're actually working by sitting at a desk.
7. What technology is coming up in the near future that you believe will alter the mechanical contracting course forever?
I believe home automation could be potentially very bad for the contractor. As homes become ‘smarter,’ then it means things are going to get more and more sophisticated, leaving out unsophisticated contractors. So, in other words, if thermostats can monitor the operating conditions of the heating and cooling system, if water heaters can send a message to somebody saying, ‘I'm not heating water,’ if the home gets really, really sophisticated, it spells doom for smaller contractors that can't keep up with technology.
For example, many contractors have failed to transition to mobile software. Full disclosure: my company makes mobile software, among other things. But many contractors have said, ‘No. No, we're not doing that. My people won't like that. We're going to use pen and paper.’ If you're using that excuse, you're being left behind because it’s basically UPS vs. the United States Postal Service. UPS went high-tech long before the postal service did, and we all know how that worked out. UPS has done far better, and so has FedEx, right?
So dealers have to understand, contractors have to understand that they have to keep up with technology. Home automation means the larger companies have a chance to do away with the smaller contractor and I'll give you an example. Amazon sells you a thermostat that understands when the HVAC system isn't working properly. The thermostat then sends a message to Amazon, and then Amazon gives the service call to the lowest bidder.
And that's what's going to start happening. You're going to have home automation companies — Honeywell, Amazon, and others — starting to take away our customers. So our customers aren't going to know us anymore. They're going to know Amazon, Honeywell, etc., and they won't care about the company that actually comes out and does the work. They're going to steal my relationship with my customer.
