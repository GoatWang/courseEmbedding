WELCOME TO BRAZIL MINERALS, INC.
Brazil Minerals, Inc. (OTC: BMIX) is a producer of diamonds, gold, sand, and industrialized mortar. We also own 30 mineral rights for gold and diamonds, including 10 mining concessions, the highest level of right to mine in Brazil.  
Our short-term intention is to become a profitable company with virtually no debt. 
Growth in Valuable Assets
Our progress has been steady, and can be measured in at least two quantifiable ways. First, in terms of mineral assets, in early 2013, our initial year of operations under the current business model and management team, we had 3 mineral rights. Now we have 30 mineral rights in our subsidiaries as follows:
i) 10 mineral rights that are mining concessions, the highest level of mineral right in Brazil (“Concessão de Lavra”) – all 10 mining concessions are diamond and gold, and once concession also includes sand as a mineral;
ii) 8 mineral rights for diamond and gold that have status just below mining concession (“Requerimento de Lavra”), which allows us to apply for both an upgrade to mining concession and to conduct limited commercial mining;
iii) 8 mineral rights for diamond and gold or solely gold in the research permit phase (“Autorização de Resquisa”), and;
iv) 4 mineral rights for diamond and gold in the phase of application for research permit (“Requerimento de Pesquisa”).
Please refer to the table of mineral rights contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. 
Growth in Product Mix 
The second manner in which we expanded as a company from 2013 to now is in the product mix output from our Brazilian subsidiaries. In 2013 we produced and sold rough diamonds and gold. In 2014 we added polished diamonds. In 2015 we added sand and mortar, a product made from our sand.
Deep Knowledge of Brazil & Strong Culture
Unlike most other listed mining companies operating in Brazil, our team is comprised almost completely of Brazilians, all of whom have been hand-picked. Our CEO and Chairman spent years in the U.S. venture capital and private equity and has modeled the company with the essential entrepreneur tenets of hard-work, meritocracy, and frugality.

Gold – Amazonas
BMIX’s Apui/Borba Project has essentially the largest size allowable for a mineral right in Brazil: it has 9,999.11 hectares, or approximately 24,700 acres, a surface area that is almost 15% larger than the entire island of Manhattan in New York. It is located in the northern part of Brazil, in the state of Amazonas, roughly between the cities of Apui and Borba, in a “gold belt” of the Amazon as described in maps of the mining department. 
This area has had illegal settlers who reportedly were able to extract several kilograms of gold monthly. Gold is found in conglomerate form, yielding pebbles and pellets, at depths starting as high as 2 feet and with better veins beginning at 15 feet. 
Historically, large gold areas in the Brazilian Amazon have commanded a range of valuations. In 2010, Eldorado Gold, through the acquisition of Brazauros Resources for a consideration of 122.4 million Canadian dollars, obtained the Amazon gold project known as Tocantizinho with reserves of 1.9 million ounces of gold at the time. In 2013, Brasil Resources, through the acquisition of Brasilian Gold for a consideration of 13.5 million Canadian dollars, obtained the Amazon gold project known as São Jorge, among others, with reserves of 1.75 million ounces of gold at the time. 
Note to U.S. investors: none of the mineralization or reserve numbers cited here were obtained or calculated in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Industry Guide 7, and therefore should not be considered as a basis for any investment decision.

Diamond/Gold – Minas Gerais
BMIX’s diamond and gold operations in the state of Minas Gerais are carried out by its two subsidiaries, Mineração Duas Barras Ltda. (“MDB”) and RST Recursos Minerais Ltda. (“RST”). Details regarding MDB and RST can be found in BMIX’s latest Annual Report on Form 10-K (“10-K”), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on April 15, 2016, a copy of which can be accessed in the “Investors” tab then “Public Fillings” in this website, or at the SEC’s website. An excerpt of the descriptions of MDB and RST from the 10-K is below.  
I. Mineração Duas Barras Ltda. (“MDB”)
MDB owns a large alluvial diamond and gold processing and recovery plant, capable of processing upwards of 45 tons of gravel per hour of operation. It is our best information that this plant was built by South African mining engineers hired for the task and cost $2.5 million to construct. It is regarded as the largest such plant in Latin America.
MDB has title to two mineral rights. One is a mining concession for diamond, gold, and sand (discussed below). The other, physically separated, is an area for which we have submitted the application to mine.  Both of the MDB mineral rights are located on the left margin of the Jequitinhonha River in the State of Minas Gerais in Brazil. The Jequitinhonha River valley is a well-known area for diamond and gold production; it has hosted alluvial production since the 18th century.
MDB’s plant, mining concession, and mineral right are all approximately one and half hour drive from Montes Claros, Brazil, a city of approximately 500,000 people. The first hour of the drive is on asphalt roads followed by a half-hour on dirt roads. Montes Claros has the infrastructure needed by MDB and also benefits from having an airport with regular carrier service to large Brazilian cities, including São Paulo and Belo Horizonte.
MDB’s Mining Concession
MDB’s mining concession (“Concessão de Lavra”) covers an area of 422 acres. It allows for the exploration and commercialization of diamonds, gold, and sand. “Concessão de Lavra” is the highest level of mineral right in Brazil. It permits the owner to mine in perpetuity provided that environmental licenses are kept current and that mining guidelines are followed.
There are no liens or other encumbrances on MDB’s mining concession, and there are no fees to be paid to maintain such claim. Therefore, we have no outright payments to maintain MDB’s mining concession.
Brazilian law guarantees the owner of the land from which the subsoil is mined a royalty of at least 0.1% of gross revenues. However, most Brazilian mining companies negotiate with the landowner and pay a higher royalty rate as an incentive for greater cooperation. MDB has a contract that pays the surface landowner a 6% royalty rate on any gross revenues from material mined in MDB’s titled mining concession. Additionally, MDB pays “CEFEM” royalties to Brazil’s tax authority if and when it sells diamonds and gold. These royalty rates are fixed by federal decree and currently are 0.1% on diamond sales and 1% on gold sales.
MDB’s Other Mineral Right (“MDB-2″)
MDB’s other mineral right covers an area of 982 acres. In February 2016, we filed with the mining department a detailed application with technical study for commercial mining of this area. We also filed the appropriate permit with the environmental department. We are monitoring both applications.
MDB-2 has not been mined commercially before, but prior to our ownership it has had prospector activity, something viewed by experts as a positive sign. In the plot within MDB-2 for which initial commercial exploration is targeted, our technical team identified both “grupiária” and alluvial gravel available for processing for diamonds and gold. “Grupiária” is a thicker rock mixture known locally for having a lower density diamond concentration, but larger diamonds where they do occur. Anecdotally, diamonds that are 5 to 10-carats in weight are reported from such material, although we have not had independent confirmation. Commercial exploration, when permitted, will be via open-sky, surface mining, with a small, moveable pre-processing structure, which will filter and concentrate material for transport to our large diamond and gold processing plant. We cannot estimate as to when MDB-2 will be operating on a commercial basis, although we have reason to believe it could be sometime in late 2016.
We intend to perform all of the necessary studies to move MDB-2 to the mining concession status as soon as possible in the future. There is no current recurring cost to the mining department to upkeep this area.
Mineralization
The previous owner of MDB’s mineral right performed detailed geological studies in part of MDB’s mining concession leading to the publication of an NI 43-101 technical report in 2007, with an update in 2008, as required by the rules of the Canadian securities administrator. The NI 43-101 report from 2008 describes the existence of mineralized materials amounting to 1,639,200 cubic meters with the following concentrations for diamonds and gold: 0.16 carats of diamonds per cubic meter and 182 milligrams of gold per cubic meter. The previous owner also submitted its “Plano de Aproveitamento Econômico”, a bankable feasibility study, to the mining department in accordance with the mining regulations of Brazil. We do not claim that MDB’s NI 43-101 technical reports and its bankable feasibility study are compliant with the SEC-sanctioned Industry Guide 7. Under the SEC’s Industry Guide 7, no assertion can be made about reserves; moreover, Industry Guide 7 does not recognize the term “resources.” 
II. RST Recursos Minerais Ltda. (“RST”)
We acquired from two Brazilian individuals, unrelated to us, 50% of RST for approximately $254,000. Previously in 2008, RST had been transacted for $10.5 million; the buyer paid $2 million and subsequently was unable to pay the remainder because of the global financial crisis. The RST mineral rights remained largely untouched until our acquisition.
RST has a storied history as holder of highly attractive areas for diamonds and gold. Most of its current mining concessions and mineral rights have never had land-based exploration performed properly. Many of the RST areas were owned before by Mineração Tejucana S.A., a famous Brazilian mining company that lasted for decades and mined inside the Jequitinhonha River by dredge boat.
Currently RST has title to 9 mining concessions and several other mineral rights, as seen in table attached above. All of RST areas are for diamonds and some for gold as well. All of them are located in the Jequitinhonha River valley in the northern part of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Some of the RST areas, including one that is potentially very rich in diamonds and gold, is located next to MDB’s plant and mining concession.
The quality of the RST areas is evidenced in an NI 43-101 technical report published in 2008.  We do not claim that RST’s NI 43-101 technical report is compliant with the SEC-sanctioned Industry Guide 7. Under the SEC’s Industry Guide 7, no assertion can be made about reserves; moreover, Industry Guide 7 does not recognize the term “resources.” 
RST has no recovery plant for diamonds and gold at this time. We plan on initially utilizing MDB’s plant for such recovery.

Brazil Minerals reports large rough diamond. Image from Brazil Minerals.
Brazil Minerals (OTCBB: BMIX) mined a 4.01 carats diamond, it's largest to date.
The company said the gem has good appearance with the ability to yield high colour and clarity grades. The company plans to cut and polish the diamond before selling it.
Brazil Minerals is a U.S. publicly-traded company with current revenues from sales of rough and polished diamonds, gold, and sand.
Full news release is below.
Brazil Minerals, Inc. Reports Largest Rough Diamond & Expected Further Cash Flows From Sand Products
BELO HORIZONTE, BRAZIL–(Marketwired – Apr 6, 2015) – Brazil Minerals, Inc. (OTCBB: BMIX) (the "Company" or "BMIX") announced today that it had mined its largest rough diamond to date at 4.01 carats. This gem has very good appearance and no visible points or inclusions, and thus appears to be able to yield high color and clarity grades. The Company plans to have this rough diamond cut and polished before selling it.
Separately, BMIX announced that conversations are in advanced stages with potential partners regarding aggregate products derived from its high-quality, abundant sand. Aggregate sand products include materials used in construction, such as mortar. Sand is a consistent source of revenues for the Company and able to generate positive cash flows, primarily due to a combination of much lower operating costs and relatively strong demand.
In particular, these sand-based products are much less dependent on the use of diesel, which is the single largest cost in the Company's mining and processing of rough diamonds and gold. Over time, BMIX plans to substantially diminish diesel use in the plant processing for diamonds and gold by implementing several approaches.
About Brazil Minerals, Inc.
Brazil Minerals, Inc. (OTCBB: BMIX) is a U.S. publicly-traded company with current revenues from sales of rough and polished diamonds, gold, and sand. Our intention is to continue to grow and become a premier diversified and profitable company focused on Brazil. We believe that our team is our main strength. Our team combines over 100 years of Brazilian business expertise and American experience in finance, private equity and venture capital.
BMIX owns 100% of MDB, a Brazilian producer and seller of polished and rough diamonds, gold bars, and industrial-use sand. MDB operates a fully-operational mining concession with the largest alluvial processing plant for diamonds and gold in Latin America, and has the Brazilian permit to export its production.
BMIX also owns 25% of RST Recursos Minerais, Ltda. ("RST"), a Brazilian company with 10 mining concessions and 12 other mineral rights for diamond and gold. The RST areas are located near MDB's plant, in the Jequitinhonha River valley, a well-known area for diamonds and gold for over two centuries.
Our goal is to become an attractive and liquid alternative for investment in Brazil, the 6th largest global economy. More information on BMIX can be found at www.brazil-minerals.com.

     $BMIX ALL-IN-ONE DD 3/31/17        *** NEW in this update: 1) New video of diamond and gold recovery plant is released in March 2017; 2) A qualified geologist has started to prepare an Industry Guide 7 technical report on the properties owned by Brazil Minerals; 3) Per 11/29/16 PR, the Company now expects its Brazil-based operations to be cash flow profitable by the second quarter of 2017 or possibly sooner; 4) PPS projections updated to reflect the new tiny share structure.    TABLE OF CONTENTS   1) The Company  2) The Property  3) The People  4) Frequently Asked Questions    1) The Company   Brazil Minerals, Inc. (OTC: BMIX) is a producer of diamonds, gold, sand, and industrialized mortar. The company also owns 30 mineral rights for gold and diamonds, including 10 mining concessions, the highest level of right to mine in Brazil.  Brazil Mineral's short-term intention is to become a profitable company with virtually no debt.  Growth in Valuable Assets  BMIX progress has been steady, and can be measured in at least two quantifiable ways. First, in terms of mineral assets, in early 2013, the company's initial year of operations under the current business model and management team, they had 3 mineral rights. Now BMIX has 30 mineral rights in its subsidiaries as follows:  i) 10 mineral rights that are mining concessions, the highest level of mineral right in Brazil (“Concessão de Lavra”) – all 10 mining concessions are diamond and gold, and once concession also includes sand as a mineral;  ii) 8 mineral rights for diamond and gold that have status just below mining concession (“Requerimento de Lavra”), which allows the company to apply for both an upgrade to mining concession and to conduct limited commercial mining;  iii) 8 mineral rights for diamond and gold or solely gold in the research permit phase (“Autorização de Resquisa”), and;  iv) 4 mineral rights for diamond and gold in the phase of application for research permit (“Requerimento de Pesquisa”).  Growth in Product Mix  The second manner in which Brazil Minerals expanded as a company from 2013 to now is in the product mix output from our Brazilian subsidiaries. In 2013 the company produced and sold rough diamonds and gold. In 2014 they added polished diamonds. In 2015 BMIX added sand and mortar, a product made from their sand.  Deep Knowledge of Brazil & Strong Culture  Unlike most other listed mining companies operating in Brazil, BMIX team is comprised almost completely of Brazilians, all of whom have been hand-picked. The company's CEO and Chairman spent years in the U.S. venture capital and private equity and has modeled the company with the essential entrepreneur tenets of hard-work, meritocracy, and frugality.    Share Structure:   O/S: 67,304,523 as of 3/31/17 (Verified by Transfer Agent)  https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/BMIX/profile   Shares held by the CEO (His salary has been paid entirely in BMIX common shares): 3,031,028 as of 2/16/17  https://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&article=73883076   Shares held by Peter Goldy: 2,203,637 as of 11/16/16  http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&article=72931541   A/S: 100,000,000    Website: http://www.brazil-minerals.com/  YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChcTI9t1v-E-9MJ7mMtH_tA  Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brazilmineralsbmix    2) The Property   BMIX owns 100% of Mineração Duas Barras Ltda. (“MDB”), a Brazilian producer and seller of polished and rough diamonds, gold bars, and industrial-use sand. MDB operates a fully-operational mining concession with the largest alluvial processing plant for diamonds and gold in Latin America, and has the Brazilian permit to export its production.  BMIX also owns 50% of RST Recursos Minerais Ltda. (“RST”), a Brazilian company with 10 mining concessions and 12 other mineral rights for diamond and gold. Many of the RST areas are located near MDB’s plant, and all of them are in the Jequitinhonha River valley, a well-known area for diamonds and gold for over two centuries.  RST property was acquired from two Brazilian individuals, unrelated to the company, 50% of RST for approximately $254,000. Previously in 2008, RST had been transacted for $10.5 million; the buyer paid $2 million and subsequently was unable to pay the remainder because of the global financial crisis. The RST mineral rights remained largely untouched until our acquisition.  On 4/29/16 Brazil Minerals announced that it obtained approval of a report regarding Apui/Borba gold project from the local mining department. BMIX's Apui/Borba Project titled right covers 24,708 acres, a surface area that is 15% larger than the island of Manhattan in New York. The project has potential mineralization of 4.3 million ounces of gold. Read more about this impressive property by following the two links below:  http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&article=71320402  http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=122338476   Finally, in August 2016, BMIX obtained three more large claims on gold-producing areas.  1) A priority for an exploration license on a gold mineral right covering 4,925 acres in Crixas, extending to an adjacent municipality, in the state of Goias in central Brazil. The Crixas area is one of the largest gold hubs in Latin America. It is home to several gold mines and projects from AngloGold Ashanti and Cleveland Mining, which combined have disclosed potential reserves of more than 8 million ounces of gold.  http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&article=72212837  2) A mineral claim for gold covering 773 acres in the municipality of Paracatu, in the state of Minas Gerais. Paracatu is where the largest gold mine in Brazil, named Morro do Ouro, is located. Morro de Ouro is an open-pit mine owned by global firm Kinross Gold, with 2015 reported proven and probable reserves of 9.645 million ounces of gold and annual production of 477,622 ounces of gold.  http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&article=72306313  3) A new mineral rights claim for gold covering 4,669 acres within the well-known area in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil called "Iron Quandrangle". The closest larger city to this new claim is Itabira. This region, known for both iron and gold mining, has excellent logistics and is also close to the states capital, Belo Horizonte.  http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&article=72420243   Check out all of BMIX mining rights by following the direct link below:  http://investorshub.advfn.com/uimage/uploads/2016/4/19/szxkyclaims.jpg    BMIX Documented Reserves   In 2006-2007, then Toronto Stock Exchange Venture -listed Vaaldiam Resources Ltd. (“Vaaldiam”) spent an estimated $2.0 million for detailed drilling and technical studies leading to the NI 43-101 geological report and bankable feasibility of the property, as well as an estimated $2.0 million for removal of overgrowth on the property. The total cost of development of MDB by Vaaldiam is estimated at $10 million.  The link to the resultant NI 43-101 is below. Keep in mind that the official study was done for only 7% of the MDB's total concession area. There is still a 93% chunk of MDB's property that has not been officially assayed. And let’s not forget about the 50% ownership in adjacent RST properties that include 10 mining concessions and 12 other mineral rights for diamond and gold.  http://www.brazil-minerals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Duas-Barras-NI-43-101.pdf  What the heck is NI 43-101? Read below:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Instrument_43-101  Excerpt from the BMIX NI 43-101:      The numbers are astounding! Some thoughts and reflections on them can be found in stervc's excellent post below:  http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=112576227  To make things even better, a qualified geologist has started to prepare an Industry Guide 7 technical report on the properties owned by Brazil Minerals. This study will permit the Company to publish information on all of its gold and diamond potential to the U.S. markets, as the Industry Guide 7 format is the reporting standard currently acceptable by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).  http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&article=73019795  To fully appreciate the magnitude of the BMIX potential with their 100%-owned MDB property, it is most useful to look at the performance of the previous owner:  "Vaaldiam launched production at Duas Barras in September 2007 and produced 33,385 carats of diamonds valued at an average $165 per carat in the first 11 months of operation. Gross sales revenues from the mine to date, including 1,036 ounces of gold recovered for the period September 2007 through July 2008 reached $6.5 million."  http://www.diamonds.net/news/NewsItem.aspx?ArticleID=23120  Moreover, during February 2008 a 15.68 carat diamond was recovered at the Duas Barras mine which is the largest diamond recovered to date at this mine. This diamond was sold in the second quarter for US$78,400 or US$5,000 per carat.  http://globaldocuments.morningstar.com/documentlibrary/document/29cf493380fe9217.msdoc/original   RST MINING PERMITS WERE RECEIVED ON 4/19/16 PER PR BELOW  http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&article=71171071&symbol=BMIX  The company now has all of the required permits for RST area. The previous operator in these areas had an annual diamond production as high as 74,395 carats in 1983 and as low as 15,285 carats in 1967, from the data set available. The previous operator essentially did not mine inland, which is where BMIX will focus its efforts. Read the related PR below:  http://www.brazil-minerals.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BMIX-PR-13.JUL_.2015.pdf  First gold yields from the RST property were released on July 20th 2016 - test run of 6.8 cubic meters of material produced 59.1 grams (approximately 1.9 troy ounces) of 96% gold, now molten into a gold bar, as seen on a picture below:  http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&article=72011238     Recently, a long-term BMIX equity holder provided funds through direct stock investments to allow for the acquisition of a second industrial-size gold-recovery centrifuge that will nearly double the current output in the near future.[/color]  http://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&article=73853654    BMIX Diamond & Gold Processing Plants   The MDB plant was originally built in 2006-2007 by then Toronto Stock Exchange Venture -listed Vaaldiam Resources Ltd. (“Vaaldiam”) at a cost of approximately $2.5 million. To the best of BMIX’s knowledge, the diamond and gold processing plant at Duas Barras is the largest alluvial recovery plant of its kind in Latin America.  In addition to a large stationary MDB plant, BMIX is now transitioning into portable mini-plants that are highly scalable and can be deployed at multiple properties at once. See the diamond and gold recovery mini-plant in operation below:        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTtHbledWQg    Other Developments:   Brazil Minerals mines primarily for diamonds and gold, but the company also has vast reserves of industrial-quality sand that provides an effortless cash flow for the company. Read more below:  http://www.brazil-minerals.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/BMIX-Press-Release-02.FEB_.2015.pdf  http://www.brazil-minerals.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/BMIX-Press-Release-03.DEC_.2014.pdf  The company's sand qualifies for use in the profitable fracking industry, as described in the following PR. The company's reserves of high-quality sand are between 500k and 1M tons. This will translate into millions of dollars of easily-extractable revenue.  http://www.brazil-minerals.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BMIX-PR-25.AUG_.2015.pdf  http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=115456325  The company also uses its vast sand reserves for high-quality mortar production and sale -- read more in the PR below:  "Brazil Minerals, Inc. had established a subsidiary in Brazil called Hercules Brasil Ltda. to pursue opportunities in the construction materials business. Initially, Hercules is focused on the production and sale of mortar. A medium size plant that can produce mortar, grout and other industrialized sand products has been fully built and is operating."  http://www.brazil-minerals.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BMIX-PR-13.AUG_.2015.pdf    In fact, the company's brand of mortar was recently chosen for use in a new 17-story building (see picture of the building below):  Additionally, BMIX’s Hercules mortar line has recently been accepted and bought for distribution by Pontual, one of the largest retailers of tiles and other construction supplies in Montes Claros.  http://www.brazil-minerals.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BMIX-PR-30.NOV_.2015.pdf     Finally, on July 13 2016 BMIX announced that the company formally received title from the local mining department to two manganese claims, both placed in a new wholly owned subsidiary. These mineral rights cover 4,700 acres and are located 75 and 110 miles, respectively, from the Company's gold and diamond operations, in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil. Both of these claims intersect known colluvial laterite deposits with high potential for mineralization of manganese and possibly iron ore as well.

Board of Advisors - Ambassador John Bell  http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=112767084    4) Frequently Asked Questions   Q: BMIX DD is impressive, but doesn't all this seem too good to be true? Why is BMIX trading so low?  A: BMIX is trading so low because in 2014 the company was in urgent need of cash to seize the remaining % ownership of the MDB property as well as 50% ownership of all RST properties before they were usurped by another party. To make it possible in a timely manner, the company resorted to toxic financing which was simply the fastest option at the time. This move was essential for LONG-TERM viability of BMIX. Then, while the company was in its weakest first quarter of 2015 (historically, due to Brazilian weather), the toxic lenders proceeded to do what they do best -- dump their holdings all at once with disregard for the stock's PPS. The simple concept of supply and demand came into play. The toxic debt resulted in too many shares supplied too fast, and there was not enough demand at the time to absorb all of the shares at higher prices. Since that time the company has continued to build a solid foundation for a long-term successful production of diamonds and gold and was not aggressively focusing on its stock price in particular. Now that the production is afoot and the company is expecting to be cash flow positive by the end of Q2/2017, I expect them to start working towards strengthening their stock valuation as well.   Q: So what do you think is fair PPS for BMIX?  A: I will provide two different perspectives below:  1) Combining revenue streams from gold, diamonds, sand, mortar and royalty-based partnerships, BMIX can reasonably make $3M net profit as early as end of FY 2017. An average P/E ratio for mining companies is 25-30. It is often higher than that for younger mining companies with many virgin claims, but let's consider the worst case scenario of 20, just to be conservative. So with a net income of $3M, the OS count of 100M (given the worst-case scenario of maxed out A/S), and the P/E ratio of 20, that comes out to $0.60 per share.  $3M/100M = $0.03 x 20 = $0.60  Reflecting upon the revenues obtained by the previous operator of BMIX property, $3M in net BMIX profit for the year is very doable for 2017. And the P/E of 20 is very conservative considering how many claims with future potential BMIX possesses. Add to that the upcoming hype from the penny traders who are starved for the stocks that actually have net profits, and the PPS potential here extends way beyond the $0.60 even at a maxed out A/S of 100M. This, obviously, represents a HUGE return from these levels.  2) In September 2014, Goldman Small Cap Research Report pinned a target market cap for BMIX at $25,380,000 (84.6M x $0.30).  http://www.brazil-minerals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Goldman-Small-Cap-Research-Report-BMIX.pdf  Given that the company's current OS is 67,304,523, the above market cap corresponds to a PPS of $0.38  Also, keep in mind that this target was established BEFORE all the new developments. For instance, BMIX has acquired many more property rights since then, established additional cash flow from sand and mortar sales, as well as developed royalty-generating partnerships. So, arguably, a reasonable market cap target should be significantly higher today.   Q: The property seems like a real winner - hundreds of thousands of carats of documented diamond reserves in only 7% of the entire area of the mineral rights available at MDB is utmost impressive. But the natural question is WHY then the previous owner failed?  A: To answer this, I will quote the CEO himself from one of the recent interviews:  The issue with the [previous] company was that it had 300 employees elsewhere in Brazil taking hold of ground for exploration. It had huge, huge research costs, so any semblance of profitability from diamond production was diluted by expenses elsewhere. The company also had 110 employees at the mine — we have 18 — and it had five vice presidents at the mine while we have one general manager.  In summary, Vaaldiam (the previous company) had 300 workers elsewhere in Brazil in various exploratory, non-revenue projects. When the 2008 financial crisis hit the markets, Vaaldiam left Brazil due to being unable to satisfy local social security payments and other demands. Initially, BMIX acquired a 55% stake in MDB, and subsequent rounds of acquisition have brought the percentage ownership to 86.88%, and then finally to 100% ownership as of today.   Q: How do we know that the CEO is not just using the shareholders here? Does Dr. Fogassa have any skin in the game?  A: Of course! The CEO has a lot of vested interest in BMIX. Dr. Fogassa now owns over 3M common shares of BMIX as of the last filing:  https://ih.advfn.com/p.php?pid=nmona&article=73883076  Dr. Fogassa graduated from MIT, then Harvard medical school, and then Harvard business school. Trust me when I say that he could be making a big chunk of money out there by either practicing medicine in a nice group in Boston, or even more so by staying at Goldman Sachs as a medical/technological financier. Instead, he dropped everything and went all-in into his baby company - Brazil Minerals. Moreover, instead of burning through the precious and scarce start-up capital, he decided to pay his own salary IN COMMON BMIX SHARES instead of cash. From my personal conversation with the CEO, he spends most of his days submerged in BMIX business -- and what does he get in return? Only common BMIX shares! Dr. Fogassa is a man in his late 40s boasting credentials that are nothing short of stunning who gave up several types of lucrative jobs where he could be making $400K+ per year from a cushy air-conditioned office in Boston or NYC, and is instead spending his days in dirt and gravel in Brazil while getting only BMIX common shares in return! The man is as invested in this company as it gets, if you ask me.   Q: Are there any research reports on BMIX?  A: Sure, in September 2014, Goldman Small Cap Research issued a report in which they called Brazil Minerals “The Most Attractive Revenue-Generating Mining Stock.” Read the full report below:  http://www.brazil-minerals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Goldman-Small-Cap-Research-Report-BMIX.pdf   Q: Any interviews with the CEO that I should check out?  A: I think one of the best interviews with Dr. Fogassa was done by TheStreet and can be read below:  http://www.thestreet.com/story/12937096/1/brazil-minerals-pursuing-profitable-diamond-and-gold-mining.html  Some of my personal thoughts and reflections on the interview can be found in the following posts:  http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=114401500  http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=114401650  http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=114621398  http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=114402899  http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=114403120  http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/read_msg.aspx?message_id=114403295   Q: Do you think the world’s high demand for rough and polished diamonds will continue into the future?  A: Yes I do, and I am not the only one who thinks so.  Source: http://www.diamondwww.com/files/presentation/Scotai_Bank_Jan_14.pdf       BMIX DAILY CHART      i.t.m.d.

(  OTC :  BMIX ) (the "Company" or "BMIX") announced today that its Hercules brand of mortars beat established competition from national brands becoming the first choice for use in a new 17-story residential building in Montes Claros, a city of approximately 500,000 people located 58 miles from BMIX's mortar factory.For the past few weeks, BMIX's Hercules mortar line has been submitted to analysis and usage tests by the construction and engineering companies responsible for this building. In this situation, Hercules mortars bested much larger providers because of product quality. In addition, BMIX's Hercules subsidiary received high marks for customer service and competitive pricing. Conversations are ongoing regarding a potential large sale in which BMIX's Hercules mortar line would be used for tiling of all of the internal areas and each of the four residential units per floor in this 17-story building. While there is no contractual sale yet, the results obtained in the analytical phase of this process already bode well for future sales opportunities with local construction and engineering companies. A photograph of this particular building accompanies this release.Additionally, BMIX's Hercules mortar line has recently been accepted and bought for distribution by Pontual, one of the largest retailers of tiles and other construction supplies in Montes Claros. Given that the Brazilian economy is contracting approximately 3.1% this year in the worst recession in decades, and that the construction industry has had in 2015 its worst year since 2003, the fact that the Hercules mortar line is selling more every month is an indication of progress despite strong headwinds from such economic background. The primary reason for Hercules to be gaining market share is due to the quality of its product line. Two factors may explain such advantage: 1) the high quality of BMIX's sand obtained from the Duas Barras mine, and which is used in the Hercules mortar line; and 2) proprietary processes put in place at the mortar factory to produce finer mortar. Whereas some of the national brands carry mortar that is quite "sandy" in texture, the Hercules mortar resembles the texture of "cake mix", i.e., much smoother. This has led users to have a better product experience.In other news, despite some heavy rains, BMIX has advanced the necessary improvements on the dirt road connecting its large diamond and gold processing plant to a new, highly promising mining area. Seventy-five percent of the cement drainage canalization is completed, as well as 50% of the work involved in layering rocks to provide surface traction for heavy trucks. A map of the road is attached to this release; BMIX's diamond and gold processing plant is located to the left; the curves on the road were needed to navigate various small hills in the most efficient manner.About Brazil Minerals, Inc.Brazil Minerals, Inc. (  OTC :  BMIX ) is a U.S. holding company with Brazilian mining properties that produce rough diamonds, gold, and sand, and a business that manufactures and sells mortar.

Brief UpdateAccesswireMarch 14, 2017ReblogShareTweetSharePASADENA, CA / ACCESSWIRE / March 14, 2017 / Brazil Minerals, Inc. (OTC PINK: BMIX) ("Brazil Minerals") announced today that the gold and diamond modular recovery plant located in one of its mining concessions in the Jequitinhonha River valley in Brazil is now operational and producing both gold and diamonds.Brazil Minerals is processing auriferous and diamondiferous gravel which had been excavated previously and stored. Recently, a technical expert on detailed local examination has identified two new exploration locations for gold and diamonds within the mining concession containing the modular plant. Samples of gravel from such areas were processed and confirmation of gold and diamonds obtained. Later this year these locations will be excavated for retrieval of gravel for storage and/or processing.In other news, the local state's electric utility has approved and authorized construction of a branch from the main electrical grid which upon completion will allow Brazil Minerals to receive electricity in the mining concession mentioned above. This development is expected to decrease operational costs related to usage of diesel-powered generators.About Brazil Minerals, Inc.Brazil Minerals, Inc. (OTC PINK: BMIX) is a producer of diamonds, gold, sand and industrialized mortar. Through various subsidiaries, consolidated in our statements, we have title to 38 mineral rights for gold, diamonds, manganese and sand, including 10 mining concessions for gold and diamonds, the highest level of right to mine in Brazil; the total surface area of these mineral rights is 218,525 acres or 440 square miles.
