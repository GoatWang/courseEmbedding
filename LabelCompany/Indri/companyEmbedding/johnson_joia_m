our company
HanesBrands is a socially responsible manufacturer and marketer of leading everyday basic apparel under some of the world's strongest apparel brands in the Americas, Europe and Asia, as well as in Australia and South Africa. Our iconic innerwear and activewear apparel brands found in the United States and elsewhere include Hanes, Champion, Playtex, Bali, Maidenform, JMS/Just My Size, Wonderbra and Gear for Sports. Outside the United States, we also have dominant national and regional brands, including DIM, Nur Die/Nur Der, Lovable, Abanderado, Shock Absorber, Zorba, Sol y Oro, Rinbros, Track N Field and Ritmo.
We are the world’s largest marketer of basic apparel. We sell bras, panties, shapewear, sheer hosiery, men's underwear, children's underwear, socks, T-shirts, sweatshirts, fleece and other activewear. In the United States, we sell more units of intimate apparel, male underwear, socks, shapewear, hosiery and T-shirts than any other company.
Founded in 1901, Hanes has a long history of innovation, product excellence, and brand recognition. In fact, nearly 90 percent of U.S. households have our company's products in them. We revolutionized Tagless T-shirts and underwear, we invented the sports bra and the stretch-cup T-shirt bra, we were the first to advertise a bra on national television (Playtex), and we are innovating with ComfortBlend and temperature-control X-Temp fabrics and seamless Smart Sizes bras.
Our Sell More, Spend Less and Make Acquisitions strategies are driving growth and creating value for our shareholders, consumers, retailers, employees and communities. Hanes has made more than a half dozen acquisitions, including Maidenform Brands, Gear for Sports and Knights Apparel in the United States and DBApparel in Europe.
Based in Winston-Salem, N.C., Hanes is a member of the S&P 500 and is ranked No. 490 on the Fortune 500 list. The company has approximately 65,300 employees in more than 40 countries.
Unlike most apparel companies, Hanes primarily operates its own manufacturing facilities. More than 90 percent of the apparel units that we sell worldwide and in the United States are manufactured in our own plants or those of dedicated contractors.

                                We take great pride in our strong reputation for ethical business practices and the success of our Hanes for Good corporate responsibility program for workplace practices and community and environmental improvement. The company is the only apparel producer to ever be honored by the Great Place to Work Institute for its workplace practices in Central America and the Caribbean. In the United States, the company has earned the Forbes magazine Best Place to Work honor. Hanes has won U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star sustained excellence recognition for seven consecutive years. Hanes has significant goals for reducing energy use, carbon emissions and water use and publicly reports its progress each year. More information about our Hanes for Good corporate responsibility initiatives may be found at www.HanesForGood.com

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The materials we have filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the "SEC," contain, or will contain, certain forward-looking statements regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance and other matters. Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and can generally be identified by the use of words such as "may," "believe," "will," "expect," "project," "estimate," "intend," "anticipate," "plan," "continue" or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements inherently involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. Where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of our management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. The following include some but not all of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated:

our ability to migrate our production and manufacturing operations to lower-cost centers around the world;
the highly competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we compete;
our ability to effectively manage our inventory and reduce inventory reserves;
any failure by us to successfully streamline our operations;
retailer consolidation and other changes in the apparel essentials industry;
our ability to keep pace with changing consumer preferences in intimate apparel;
any loss of or reduction in sales to any of our top customers;
financial difficulties experienced by any of our top customers;
risks associated with our foreign operations or foreign supply sources, such as disruption of markets, changes in import and export laws, currency restrictions and currency exchange rate fluctuations;
the impact of economic and business conditions and industry trends in the countries in which we operate on our supply chain;
any failure by us to protect against dramatic changes in the volatile market price of cotton, the primary material used in the manufacture of our products;
costs and adverse publicity arising from violations of labor and environmental laws by us or any of our third-party manufacturers;
our ability to attract and retain key personnel;
our substantial debt and debt service requirements which restrict our operating and financial flexibility, and impose significant interest and financing costs;
rapid technological changes;
future financial performance, including availability, terms and deployment of capital; and

The foregoing factors and others are described in greater length in our materials filed with the SEC. These forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date they are made. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained in any materials we have filed or will file with the SEC, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based other than required by law.
