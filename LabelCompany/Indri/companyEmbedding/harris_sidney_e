Nelson Mandela

Sidney E. Harris 

 

Sidney E. Harris is a graduate of Morehouse College and earned his Masters and Ph.D. degrees in Operations Research in the School of Operations Research and Information Engineering at Cornell University.
Dr. Harris is Professor and Dean Emeritus at the J. Mack Robinson College of Business at Georgia State University.   During his tenure (1997-2004) as dean, he reformulated the strategic direction of the College, provided leadership for a fundraising campaign that raised over $27 million (including the college’s naming gift) and launched three new research centers.   In addition, the College’s Part-time MBA program was consistently ranked in the Top 10 and overall sixteen different program areas were ranked by eight different national and international publications, including the Financial Times, BusinessWeek, U.S. News & World Report, and Forbes.
His professional career began in the Operations Research Center with AT&T Bell Telephone Laboratories in Holmdel, New Jersey and he moved to Georgia State University where he became a (tenured) member of the College of Business faculty.  In 1987, he joined the faculty of the Peter F. Drucker Graduate School of Management at the Claremont Graduate University as professor of management.   He served as dean of the school from 1991-1996.  He led a fundraising campaign that resulted in a new home for the school and co-founded the Institute of U.S.- Japan Relations in the World Economy with Professor Peter F. Drucker.
His research and teaching focused on the dilemmas that leaders face during times of uncertainty in confronting reality, adapting to strategic change and leading their firms through “fork in the road” decisions.  Decisions in which the stakes are high and so are the risks for the leader and the top management team.  He has traveled to thirty countries and has lectured internationally at several universities, including Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, Sorbonne University (Paris), Erasmus University (Holland), United Arab Emirates University (U.A.E.), University of British Columbia (Canada), University of West Indies (Trinidad) and the National University of Singapore.
He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Ridgeworth Funds ($20B mutual fund complex).  In 2015, he was named “Trustee of the Year” at the Fund Directions 22nd Annual Mutual Funds industry Awards.  He also serves on the board of TSYS, an electronic payments processor, where he is Chairman of the Technology Committee and a member of the Executive Committee.
He enjoys listening to jazz, traveling, boating, fishing, and college football.

Sydney J. Harris (September 14, 1917 – December 7, 1986) was an American journalist for the Chicago Daily News and, later, the Chicago Sun-Times. He wrote 11 books and his weekday column, “Strictly Personal,” was syndicated in approximately 200 newspapers throughout the United States and Canada.[1]

Biography[edit]
Sydney Justin Harris was born in London, but his family moved to the United States when he was five years old. Harris grew up in Chicago, where he spent the rest of his life. He attended high school with Saul Bellow, who was his lifelong friend. In 1934, at age 17, Harris began his newspaper career with the Chicago Herald and Examiner and studied Philosophy at the University of Chicago. After university, he became drama critic (1941) and a columnist for the Chicago Daily News (1944). He held those positions until the paper's demise in 1978 and continued to write his column for its sister paper, the Chicago Sun-Times, until his death in 1986.[2]
Harris's politics were considered liberal and his work landed him on the master list of Nixon political opponents.[3] He spoke in favor of women's rights and civil rights.[4] His last column was an essay against capital punishment.[5]
Harris often used aphorisms in his writings, such as this excerpt from Pieces of Eight (1982): "Superior people are only those who let it be discovered by others; the need to make it evident forfeits the very virtue they aspire to."[6] And this from Clearing the Ground (1986): "Terrorism is what we call the violence of the weak, and we condemn it; war is what we call the violence of the strong, and we glorify it."[7]
He was also a drama critic, teacher, and lecturer, and he received numerous honorary doctorates during his career, including from Villa Maria College, Shimer College, and Lenoir Rhyne College.[8] In 1980–1982 he was the visiting scholar at Lenoir-Rhyne College in North Carolina. For many years he was a member of the Usage Panel of the American Heritage Dictionary. He was recognized with awards from organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Conference of Christians and Jews, and the Chicago Newspaper Guild. In later years, he divided his time between Chicago and Door County, Wisconsin. Harris was married twice, and fathered five children. He died at age 69 of complications following heart bypass surgery.[9]

Biography[edit]
Sydney Justin Harris was born in London, but his family moved to the United States when he was five years old. Harris grew up in Chicago, where he spent the rest of his life. He attended high school with Saul Bellow, who was his lifelong friend. In 1934, at age 17, Harris began his newspaper career with the Chicago Herald and Examiner and studied Philosophy at the University of Chicago. After university, he became drama critic (1941) and a columnist for the Chicago Daily News (1944). He held those positions until the paper's demise in 1978 and continued to write his column for its sister paper, the Chicago Sun-Times, until his death in 1986.[2]
Harris's politics were considered liberal and his work landed him on the master list of Nixon political opponents.[3] He spoke in favor of women's rights and civil rights.[4] His last column was an essay against capital punishment.[5]
Harris often used aphorisms in his writings, such as this excerpt from Pieces of Eight (1982): "Superior people are only those who let it be discovered by others; the need to make it evident forfeits the very virtue they aspire to."[6] And this from Clearing the Ground (1986): "Terrorism is what we call the violence of the weak, and we condemn it; war is what we call the violence of the strong, and we glorify it."[7]
He was also a drama critic, teacher, and lecturer, and he received numerous honorary doctorates during his career, including from Villa Maria College, Shimer College, and Lenoir Rhyne College.[8] In 1980–1982 he was the visiting scholar at Lenoir-Rhyne College in North Carolina. For many years he was a member of the Usage Panel of the American Heritage Dictionary. He was recognized with awards from organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Conference of Christians and Jews, and the Chicago Newspaper Guild. In later years, he divided his time between Chicago and Door County, Wisconsin. Harris was married twice, and fathered five children. He died at age 69 of complications following heart bypass surgery.[9]
