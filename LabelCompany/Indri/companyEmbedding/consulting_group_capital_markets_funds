Explore Our Funds



Essential to the CGCM Funds is the Morgan Stanley Wealth Management (Wealth Management) Investment Solutions Committee’s exclusive research process used to identify and select the sub-advisers for the funds. It begins with a screening system conducted by Wealth Management’s broader Global Investment Manager Analysis team that narrows the universe of more than 14,000 investment advisers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission and with state regulatory agencies. After the managers have been selected, the Investment Solutions Committee’s team of research analysts continues to monitor each sub-adviser and fund for its investment quality.

Every manager is further evaluated by a team of investment professionals who examines each manager to confirm that they have the right mix of skills and capabilities to meet the rigid standards of our program.

The result is a suite of style-driven mutual funds that are appropriate for any investor.

About the Investment Solutions Committee



In addition to the research and evaluation process conducted by Wealth Management’s broader Global Investment Manager Analysis team, every manager ultimately chosen as a sub-adviser to the CGCM Funds has been further evaluated by the Wealth Management Investment Solutions Committee. The committee comprises experts who examine the fund managers who have passed the research screen to determine which have the best mix of skills and capabilities for a multi-disciplinary program. The analysts consider many criteria including: past performance, style consistency, personnel tenure, and concordance with other managers of the same fund. Among other things, multiple managers should be diversifying (within the same style) rather than duplicating efforts.

All mutual fund products are sold by prospectus, which contains more complete information about the fund. Please contact your Financial Advisor for copies. Please read the prospectus and consider the fund's objectives, risks, charges, and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the fund.

For more information, please contact your Financial Advisor.

	Portfolio turnover


	The Fund pays transaction costs, such as
	commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transactions costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These
	costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in






	Consulting Group Capital Markets


	1













	the above examples, affect the Fund’s performance. During the
	most recent fiscal year, the Fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 56% of the average value of its portfolio.


	Principal investment strategies


	The Fund will invest, under normal market
	conditions, at least 80% of its net assets (plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in the equity securities of large capitalization (or “cap”) companies or in other investments with similar economic characteristics.
	The Fund defines large cap companies as companies whose market capitalizations typically fall within the range of the Russell 1000

	®

	Growth Index, which ranged from approximately $64.4
	million to $717.1 billion as of November 30, 2014. The market capitalization of the companies in large-cap market indices and the Fund’s portfolio changes over time. The Fund may invest up to 10% of its assets in the securities of foreign
	issuers that are not traded on a U.S. exchange or the U.S. over-the-counter market. The Fund may also lend portfolio securities to earn additional income. Any income realized through securities lending may help Fund performance.


	The Fund employs a
	“multi-manager” strategy whereby portions of the Fund are allocated to professional money managers (each, a “Sub-adviser,” collectively, the “Sub-advisers”) who are responsible for investing the assets of the
	Fund.


	Principal risks of investing in the Fund


	Loss of money is a risk of investing in the
	Fund.


	The Fund’s
	principal risks include:


	➤ 

	Market risk

	, which is the risk that stock prices decline overall. Markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to real or perceived adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market or economic
	developments in the U.S. and in other countries. Market risk may affect a single company, sector of the economy or the market as a whole.


	➤ 

	Equity risk

	, which is the risk that prices of equity securities rise and fall daily due to factors affecting individual companies, particular industries or the equity market as a whole.


	➤ 

	Investment style risk

	, which means large cap and/or growth stocks could fall out of favor with investors and trail the performance of other types of investments.


	➤ 

	Foreign investment risk

	, which means risks unique to foreign securities, including less information about foreign issuers, less liquid securities markets, political instability and unfavorable changes in currency
	exchange rates.


	➤ 

	Securities lending risk

	, which includes the potential insolvency of a borrower and losses due to the reinvestment of collateral received on loaned securities in investments that default or do not perform
	well.


	➤ 

	Manager risk

	, which is the risk that poor security selection by a Sub-adviser will cause the Fund to underperform. This risk is common for all actively managed funds.


	➤ 

	Multi-manager risk

	, which is the risk that the investment styles of the Sub-advisers may not complement each other as expected by the Manager. The Fund may experience a higher portfolio turnover rate, which can
	increase the Fund’s transaction costs and more taxable short-term gains for shareholders.


	➤ 

	Issuer risk,

	which is the risk that the value of a security may decline for reasons directly related to the issuer, such as management performance, financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer’s goods
	or services.




	For more information on the risks
	of investing in the Fund please see the “Fund details” section in the Prospectus.


	Performance


	The bar chart below shows how the Fund’s
	investment results have varied from year to year, and the following table shows how the Fund’s annual total returns for various periods compare to those of the Fund’s benchmark index and Lipper peer group. This information provides some
	indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. The Fund is available only to investors participating in Morgan Stanley-sponsored investment advisory programs. These programs charge an annual fee, which may be up to 3.00% depending on the
	particular program through which you invest (see Shareholder Fees above).

	The performance information in the bar chart and table below does not reflect this fee, which would reduce your return.

	The Fund’s
	past performance, before and after taxes, does not necessarily indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. For current performance information please see www.morganstanley.com/cgcm.

	The after-tax returns are
	calculated using the highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an individual investor’s tax situation and may differ from those
	shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. In some cases, the return after taxes may exceed the return before
	taxes due to an assumed tax benefit from any losses on a sale of Fund shares at the end of the measurement period.

	Consulting Group Capital Markets













	The Fund’s benchmark is the
	Russell 1000

	®

	Growth Index. The benchmark is composed of those Russell 1000

	®

	Index securities with greater than average
	growth orientation. The Russell 1000

	®

	Index is composed of the 1,000 largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. Unlike the Fund, the benchmark is unmanaged and does not include any
	fees or expenses. An investor cannot invest directly in an index.


	The Fund also compares its
	performance with the Lipper Large-Cap Growth Funds Average. The Lipper Large-Cap Growth Funds Average is composed of funds that, by fund practice, invest at least 75% of their equity assets in companies with market capitalizations (on a three-year
	weighted basis) greater than 300% of the dollar-weighted median market capitalization of the middle 1,000 securities of the S&P SuperComposite 1500

	®

	Index. Large cap growth
	securities will normally have an above-average price-to-earnings ratio, price-to-book ratio and three-year earnings growth figure, compared to the S&P 500

	®

	Index.


	Investment adviser


	Consulting Group Advisory Services LLC
	(“CGAS” or the “Manager”), a business of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Holdings LLC (“MSSBH”), serves as the investment adviser for the Fund. The Fund employs a “multi-manager” strategy. Subject to Board
	review, the Manager selects and oversees professional money managers (the Sub-advisers) who are responsible for investing the assets of the Fund.  The Sub-advisers are selected based primarily upon the research and recommendation of the
	Manager, which includes a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a Sub-adviser's skills and investment results in managing assets for specific asset classes, investment styles and strategies.  The Manager allocates and, when appropriate,
	reallocates the Fund’s assets among the Sub-advisers, continuously monitors and evaluates Sub-adviser performance (including trade execution), performs other due-diligence functions (such as an assessment of changes in personnel or other
	developments at the Sub-advisers), and oversees Sub-adviser compliance with the Fund’s investment objectives, policies and guidelines.  The Manager also monitors changes in market conditions and considers whether changes in the allocation
	of Fund assets or the lineup of Sub-advisers should be made in response to such changes in market conditions.  Sub-advisers may also periodically recommend changes or enhancements to the Fund’s investment objectives, policies and
	guidelines, which are subject to the approval of the Manager and may also be subject to the approval of the Board.
