(Evy Mages/For Capital Business)   By Abha Bhattarai  By Abha Bhattarai   June 12, 2014  Follow @abhabhattarai     After 17 years at the helm of Arlington Asset Investment Corp. — formerly known as Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group — Eric F. Billings announced this week that he is stepping down as chief executive of the firm he co-founded in 1989. J. Rock Tonkel, Jr., the company’s president and chief operating officer, took over Wednesday as chief executive of Arlington Asset Investment Corp. He will remain the company’s president. Billings’s retirement marks the departure of the firm’s last remaining founder. The other two founders, W. Russell Ramsey and Emanuel J. Friedman, left the company in 2001 and 2005, respectively. “It has been one of my greatest professional privileges to lead Arlington Asset and its employees,” Billings said in a statement. “We have capitalized on many opportunities, and faced and overcome many challenges together as well.” In its heyday, FBR was heralded as a Washington success story, a homegrown investment bank that rode the technology boom to riches. It suffered a setback when the dotcom bubble burst, only to rise again during the housing boom. But in the early 2000s, the company invested heavily in subprime mortgages, a move that resulted in huge losses when the credit crisis triggered the Great Recession. In 2006, FBR spun off a new subsidiary, FBR Capital Markets (now called FBR & C0.) as an independent investment bank. Billings headed both, before announcing in 2008 that he would retire from FBR Capital Markets. Billings, who will remain executive chairman of the company, said he plans to spend more time working with his three sons at Billings Capital Management, an Arlington-based investment management company where he serves as senior managing partner.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
