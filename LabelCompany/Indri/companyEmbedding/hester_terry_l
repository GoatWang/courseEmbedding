                            Commercial Flooring Incorporated began in 1967 when Terry Hester gave a commitment to the owners, architects and general contractors of Jackson, Mississippi to provide workmanship and attention to detail in the installation of their floor covering.  This once small company is now servicing the greater part of the U.S. due to Terry’s belief, “a quality flooring installation leads to the project’s overall success.”

                            Since then, Commercial Flooring, Inc. has established itself as a leader in the commercial flooring arena with not only a great product knowledge, but also with an installation team of over 100 craftsmen, installers and laborers.  Commercial Flooring, Inc.’s multi-faceted approach in providing either labor only or material and labor means added flexibility to meet your individual needs. 
                            
                            Having operated in over 30 states, Commercial Flooring, Inc. has successfully completed projects on time for customers in Hospitality, Gaming, Major Retail, Education, Universities, Historical Renovations, Healthcare, Government, Food Service, Correctional, Corporate and Industrial Facilities.  
                            
                            Certified by the Associated Builders and Contractors as a Qualified Green Contractor, Commercial Flooring, Inc. can help in the design and implementation of flooring that will not only help sustain the environment but also help in the certification of your project by the USGBC.
