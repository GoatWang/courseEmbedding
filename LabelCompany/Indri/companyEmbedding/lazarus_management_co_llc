					Lazarus Realty & Financial Group ...



                 


					
					                                  
					Commercial / Residential Real Estate & Business Brokerage
				





Selling A Business


					
						A profile is professionally assembled by the Lazarus Financial Group. It is a 
						marketing tool designed specifically to motivate qualified investors to seek 
						additional information.
					






Buying A Business


						Respondents from advertising are matched with the types of businesses in which 
						they have expressed interest. Sellers' identity is kept confidential until 
						final information has been received and prepared by Lazarus, then each 
						prospective buyer receives a business profile of each successful match.
					






Valuation


						We perform a professional business valuation that will assist you in analyzing 
						the financial scope of your business. This valuation will give you an 
						indication of the value of the entity, and be helpful in any buy/sell 
						transactions.
					






Advertising


						Lazarus advertises via generic, business-for-sale advertising in major 
						financial, business and Internet publications.
					






Benefits


						Third Party Valuations along with Advertising exposure oftentimes makes the 
						difference between selling a business at top market value, or just liquidating 
						it.
					






Duties of a Consultant



							A Lazarus Business Consultant will perform an analysis of your business to help 
							you determine its worth.

Learn More About Professional Property Management



Do I need a property manager?
As the owner of a small-scale rental property, you may be on the fence about whether or not to use a property management company. Especially if you've never managed an income property, it can be tempting to assume that property management duties amount to "find tenants, sign lease, receive rent check," along with handling some minor maintenance issues from time to time. 
In reality, managing tenant relations, staying on the right side of the law, being on call for any emergencies that come up, staying on top of home maintenance, conducting periodic property inspections, and handling the accounting and taxes can be a time-consuming effort.
Professional property managers have developed systems that allow them to manage all of the above with maximum efficiency. Their expertise allows them to prevent problems before they arise, as well as handle any issues that do come up with minimum disruption to your revenue stream.

Is property management affordable for single-family rental owners?
Not only is property management affordable, using a property manager can actually increase your property's overall profitability. Most property managers charge a small percentage of your monthly rent in exchange for comprehensive services that range from finding and screening tenants, to handling emergency maintenance, to keeping the books and preparing year-end taxes. 
For what usually amounts to $100.00-$200.00 per month, you can outsource all of the responsibilities related to managing your rental property. When you weigh that fee against the 10-15 hours per month you'd likely spend managing the property yourself, not to mention being constantly on-call in case of emergency, the tradeoff becomes pretty clear.
You should also consider that property management companies are experts at preventing vacancies and turnover costs, the two factors that can sink your profit margins almost instantly. As the owner of a single-family rental home, keeping your property filled is especially important---your total revenue is likely generated by a single set of tenants.

How can I find the right property management company for me?
You can take the first step toward finding the right property management company by using All Property Management's search feature to locate the property managers in your area who manage single family homes. We recommend that you speak with two or three companies to determine which company's services, strengths, and fee structure best suit your needs.

What should I look for in a professional HOA manager?
The most effective attributes a successful HOA Property Management Company can have are: 1.) the ability to handle day-to-day issues without supervision 2.) guide the Board's decision-making processes and 3.) be responsive to homeowners. 
Naturally, a successful HOA manager should be professionally compentent in all aspects of Association Management and have the requisite certifications and track record to perform their required duties. But there are other attributes that are important to be a successful HOA service provider.
Homeowners have more permanence than renters, so effective HOA Management must consider the long-term implications of its actions differently than a typical property management firm. Consistency, longevity and proven experience are important considerations, as are the interpersonal skills of the firm's managers in dealing with conflicts, emergencies and the expressed interests of the Board in improving their community.
With this in mind, it's important to hire an HOA management company that has proven methods for managing group politics and negotiating agreements among members with conflicting points of view. As you interview potential HOA managers, be sure to focus a significant portion of your discussions on understanding each manager's typical communication methods and tactics for conflict resolution.

What Does an Apartment Manager Do?



An apartment or duplex building manager handles the day-to-day operations of an apartment complex, whether big or small. While the responsibilities will vary based on the specific needs of the complex’s owners and the agreed upon employment terms with the management company, their duties can include any or all of the following:

Rental Payment: A manager plays two roles, 1) rent enforcer and 2) payment. They will manage collecting rent and use their local knowledge to set the right rental payment levels to attract tenants and get you the most from your investment.
Manage Tenants: From finding tenants to dealing with complaints and evictions, an apartment complex manager handles it all. In addition they screen tenants, negotiate leases, facilitate move-in and move-out inspections and more.
Maintenance & Repair: a building manager handles the physical management of the property, including regular and preventative maintenance, as well as repairs.
Legal Issues: Professional managers know local, state and national laws for screening tenants, handling security deposits, terminating a lease, evicting a tenant, and complying with safety standards.
Budget & Records: The manager must maintain thorough records, including income and expenses, inspections, leases, maintenance requests, complaints, repairs, rent collection, insurance and can help with taxes for the property.


Any tips on hiring the RIGHT property manager?
Here is a great checklist for finding a capable apartment or duplex complex manager:

Proven Profit: A track record of profitably managing complexes
Reviews: A strong background in customer service and former tenant reviews
Assistance: A crew of maintenance professionals or relationships with local vendors
Planning: Detailed, computerized accounting and seasonal maintenance tracking systems
Licensed: Professional certifications or licenses from trade organizations such as: the Institute of Real Estate Management, National Apartment Association, National Association of Residential Property Managers and the Community Associations Institute.



Do I really need an apartment building management company?
The more tenants you have the higher volume of complaints, maintenance issues, and vacancies you will need to deal with. It is in your best interest to employ a manager to quickly respond to emergencies and collect the rent on time.
Apartment building managers have professional knowledge to assist you with hiring and managing local vendors, keeping current with local, state and federal housing laws, maintaining low vacancy rates, and dealing with sensitive tenant issues such as evictions. 

How can I easily find a property manager?
At All Property Management, we make it easy to find the right apartment complex manager for your rental property, whether you’re looking for someone to manage a few apartments and townhomes, a large apartment complex, commercial property – or a portfolio that includes all these and more. Just select the property type and fill in your rental’s zip code to generate an instant list of apartment building managers in your area. For best results, we recommend interviewing at least two or three companies to find the one that is best suited for your needs.
