2016 President's Award
Renato 'Renny' DiPentima

By Anne ArmstrongApr 08, 2016




Renato "Renny" DiPentima has won most of the awards the federal IT marketplace offers -- including five Federal 100 awards, FCW's Eagle award in 2003, ACT-IAC's Janice Mendenhall Spirit of Leadership Award and two Presidential Rank Awards. But this year's President's Award recognizes another accomplishment that is arguably even more significant: his career-long commitment to mentoring young and midcareer government executives and those who are transitioning to industry.
 
DiPentima spent his entire government career of more than 30 years at the Social Security Administration, where he rose from a GS-5 claims examiner to become the deputy commissioner for systems and the agency's first CIO. He managed the transition from a paper-based approach to handling claims to an online system that processes millions of transactions each day. Along the way, he learned some important lessons about managing expectations in Congress and getting buy-in from his SSA team.

The lessons of inclusion and buy-in that shaped the revamping of SSA systems also governed DiPentima's time at SRA International (now part of CSRA). Like most companies in the systems integrator community, SRA hired smart executives from government -- but rarely for a specific job. Instead, new recruits spent time in the finance department to learn how the company made its money and then, not unlike a medical internship, rotated to other departments to learn about the different parts of the company's business. At that point, each executive would devise a role in which he or she could create new value for the company.
During his 13 years at SRA, DiPentima mentored a wave of executives who still play an important role in the community today. And he continues to serve as counselor through his involvement with multiple companies' boards.
 
Mary Ellen Condon, who joined SRA from the Justice Department in 1999, said DiPentima was special because he listened. "He didn't think he had all the answers," she said. "He let people play to their own strengths." 
 
She wanted to create a security practice, but at the time, DiPentima said there was no future in security -- a declaration about which all involved still chuckle. He did change his mind, however, and Condon built a security practice.
 
Ed Meagher, another government recruit, said, "Renny has such a deft touch to mentoring.... He has given an untold number of transitioning executives a safe harbor to ask the dumb questions and to explore the available possibilities. His advice comes in the form of subtle questions, gentle suggestions and constant encouragement. I owe Renny more than I can ever repay, so I just try to emulate him and pay it forward."
 
Kay Kapoor, president of AT&T Global Business Public Sector Solutions, never worked for DiPentima but took a class he taught at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. "Renny has always been generous with his wisdom, insights and ideas -- not only to me but to so many people in the government/contracting industry," she said. "I owe him a huge debt of gratitude for his guidance and friendship, which I treasure."

                                I had the privilege to work with Renny over the years, starting with SSA. What I experienced was high energy, unassailable integrity and a deep commitment to the notion that success comes from making others successful - he did and he is.

 Age: 64



Education: BA, psychology, New York University; MA, public policy, George Washington University; PhD, public policy with concentration in technology, University of Maryland.



 Personal: Lives in Annapolis with wife, Pat. Daughters Margaret and Katherine are both lawyers in Washington.



How did you get to where you are?



The things that prepared me for what I do today began with the Social Security Administration. I held many jobs there. And, from about my third year on, my jobs were in supervision, then management and then executive positions. I got wonderful experiences and training [there]. While at Social Security, I earned my master's and PhD. From the combination of working at a great agency . . . and the opportunities they gave, I was able to develop a series of executive skills that have served me well ever since.


Upon retiring from Social Security, I was fortunate to have an number of opportunities in private industry. And, at that time I chose to join SRA International. People always kid me that I'm one of the few CIO's that have ever progressed to CEO. SRA -- very much like Social Security -- gave me a number of opportunities to demonstrate my skills and were willing to move me along through a number of executive positions until the board appointed me as CEO. I think what SRA saw in me was that I had a pretty deep knowledge of the federal government and how it works. SRA's focus is always on satisfying the customer and delivering high-quality products to the customer. And [the company] felt that because of my government experience I could identify with the best ways of adding value for our customers, and that's a key point. That and taking care of our people are the two main things that drive our company.


What motivates me [is having] to address difficult problems. I think that's why throughout my career I've been attracted to the federal government. I like problems that are mission critical, that challenge me intellectually and that allow me to work in a team environment. I'm just not a loner who would get a lot of enjoyment being off on a single task by myself. I think I derive the most pleasure out of my job in working in a strong team environment. That was one of the things that attracted me to SRA. I saw very good people and a commitment to people and to the customers. Also, what attracted me was the company's commitment to an ethic of honesty and service.


 In my Social Security career, the biggest challenge -- but also the most rewarding challenge -- was helping the agency move from being a paper-based operation to being a highly computerized operation. (And, even now it's considered one of the best agencies in the government.) That whole process was one of the most enriching experiences of my career. And, going from a privately owned company to becoming a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange and growing a company -- in both revenue and numbers of employees -- has been both a challenge as well as a wonderful experience. In many ways, I feel that I've always worked on government issues and challenges -- for 32 years, as a government employee and now for 10 years as an industry executive.


There has to be a basic underpinning to everything you do, and that underpinning for me is based on a culture of honesty, taking care of your customers, giving them a high-quality product and taking care of your people. 



 -- Judith Mbuya

Mission DiPentima:
Grow SRA's Civilian Share
By Nick Wakeman 
Staff Writer
     Renato A. "Renny" DiPentima  
It is not who he knows but what he knows that Renato A. "Renny" DiPentima brings to his new job as president of federal systems for SRA International Inc. of Arlington, Va.
 Everyone knows that chief information officers in the federal government must do more with less and show that resources allocated for information technology is money well-spent.
  But DiPentima experienced those pressures firsthand, spending more than 30 years inside the Social Security Administration. His last stint before joining SRA in 1995 was as deputy commissioner for systems, the agency's top IT position. While there, he also served as chairman of the IT Acquisition Improvement Team for President Clinton's National Performance Review initiative. Among the team's recommendations was the creation of the CIO position at all agencies.  "I don't think that gives me any special entrée or relationships," he said in an interview June 3. But, it does give him a keen understanding of the myriad challenges facing the civil and defense agencies.  That knowledge should boost DiPentima's efforts to make agency officials think of SRA when it comes to business process re-engineering - a hallmark of the systems integrator.  Processes are especially important in the current budget environment, said DiPentima, former chief information officer at SRA. Agencies need to look closely at how they plan projects, manage them and conduct risk assessments. "We have always been steeped in those types of things," he said.  DiPentima also wants to keep the privately held SRA on the track it has followed for 19 years - a historical growth rate of 20 percent annually and a reputation for high-quality systems integration work. SRA had revenues of about $157 million in its last fiscal year, an increase of 17 percent from the previous year. The company's 1997 fiscal year ends June 30.  For 1997, DiPentima expects revenues to be more than $180 million. The federal government accounts for about 85 percent of SRA revenues; two-thirds of that business is with defense and intelligence agencies.  While the company's core business has been with the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies, SRA has pursued and won several indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts with civilian agencies in the last two years. Wins such as the National Institutes of Health's Chief Information Officers Solutions and Partners contract will help SRA expand its civilian business, DiPentima said.  The government's downsizing  is creating additional opportun-ities for SRA. "This is real downsizing," DiPentima said of the government's plan to reduce  its work force by 272,900 people over five years.  What's more, the demand for government services continues to grow, DiPentima said. "The only way to do that is to automate and make the people who are still there more productive," he said.  But agencies cannot simply throw IT dollars at their problems in the current budget environment, he said. As a result, agencies are wrestling with questions about what kind of investments they should make, what kind of projects to pursue and how to choose among the wide variety of options available, he said.  "CIOs have to focus on strategic planning, business process re-engineering, investment analysis and capital planning and performance measures," DiPentima said.  To do this, the agencies have to look at how they do their jobs, an area in which SRA is particularly strong, he said.  "They are a market leader in business process re-engineering," said William Loomis, an analyst with Ferris, Baker Watts, a Baltimore market research firm. The market for these types of services is growing because agencies must be able to justify how their IT spending addresses their needs. "You have to be able to show your underlying business processes aren't flawed," Loomis said.  SRA is a "superb, high-end IT company," said Tom Hewitt, chief executive of the market research firm Federal Sources Inc. of McLean, Va. "You'll have a hard time finding flaws in that company."  While the pressure is on the agencies to make wise of their IT dollars and find new ways of doing their jobs, there also is pressure on firms like SRA to deliver the services and products the agencies need, DiPentima said.  One way SRA is doing this is through its Rapid Enterprise Solutions service, a process for expedited development of applications and systems, he said.  "Government IT managers can't wait three or four years for some big bang to occur and all of a sudden they get a system," he said. Agencies need tangible results more quickly.  "We will take big projects that might be four years in the making and break them into six- to nine-month increments," he said. Each increment builds on the preceding one, and IT managers have real results to show for the money they are spending.  DiPentima's promotion is a wise move, Hewitt said. Many of the procurement reforms aimed at getting the federal market to adapt more commercial practices were ideas DiPentima was promoting five years ago. "He is a real visionary," Hewitt said.  At the time, however, the ideas were considered radical. "He put his job on the line for what he thought was right," Hewitt said.  "With the government becoming smaller in size, IT and automation have enormous roles to play and that means that the IT folks have to be nimble and have to have the authority to move quickly," DiPentima said.  "It is important for CIOs to show they are successful," he said. "That is where we come in. Someone puts their faith and funds in us, so it is important that we deliver."
