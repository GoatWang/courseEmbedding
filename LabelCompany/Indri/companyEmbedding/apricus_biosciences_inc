Apricus Biosciences | APRI (Apri), Drug Delivery System, Patient Friendly Drugs San Diego by Apricus Bio



























Dear Shareholders:
Over the past two quarters following the disappointing fispemifene clinical trial results, we have sharpened our focus on increasing value through the fostering and expansion of our Vitaros® commercial partnerships, preparing the Vitaros NDA resubmission and improving the Company’s financial position.
Strategic Priorities:
Vitaros®* (alprostadil)

Continue implementation of the U.S. regulatory approval strategy to address the safety and manufacturing issues raised by the FDA in the original Vitaros NDA submission. In November, the FDA provided clarity on the requirements needed to address the deficiencies in the 2008 Complete Response letter to include suggested additional analysis of existing clinical and non-clinical data. The FDA feedback did not indicate that new clinical studies would be required for re-submission, but the FDA did determine that Vitaros is now considered a drug-device combination. The Company intends to meet with the Office of Product Quality to confirm the necessary device engineering and compliance requirements for the NDA re-submission and then resubmit the Vitaros NDA in the second half of 2017. An FDA approval decision is expected after a six month review period;
Continue to support the Company’s ex-U.S. partners’ efforts to build a global Vitaros brand and increase revenue by supporting new commercial launches by the Company’s partners and assisting the Company’s partners in obtaining additional regulatory approvals in their respective territories;
Continue the Company’s efforts to license Vitaros in available countries throughout Asia to include Japan, China and India; and
Continue to generate the required data to support delivery device improvements and related regulatory submission(s) with a priority to support the U.S. NDA resubmission of the refrigerated version of Vitaros and to deliver a commercially viable refrigerated product in Canada.

RayVa™ (alprostadil)

Explore Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. and EU; and
Explore global or regional partnerships prior to initiating the Phase 2b study.

Corporate/Financial

Reduce operating expenses by approximately 30% in 2016 and 60% in 2017 as compared to 2015 operating expenses;
Work with NASDAQ to try and regain compliance with the minimum $35 million market value of listed securities requirement as required for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(2); and
Grow Vitaros revenue, seek non-dilutive capital and utilize lower cost of capital financial instruments to fund operations with the goal of achieving profitability in 2018.

Apricus’ development priority is now focused on Vitaros, both to accelerate commercialization outside of the U.S. and to attempt to bring this novel erectile dysfunction therapy to patients in the U.S. next year, with the goal of achieving profitability in 2018.
As always, thank you for your continued support and interest in Apricus Biosciences.
Warm regards,
Richard W. Pascoe

Vitaros™

Vitaros™ is a topically-applied cream formulation of alprostadil, which dilates blood vessels, combined with a proprietary permeation enhancer NexACT , which directly increases blood flow to the penis, causing an erection. Vitaros™ is currently in development in the U.S. and approved and commercialized in certain countries outside of the U.S. Allergan owns the rights to Vitaros™ in the U.S. and in September 2015, we entered into an agreement with Allergan to license the U.S. development and commercialization rights for Vitaros™. Ferring International Center S.A. owns the ex-U.S. rights to Vitaros™, pursuant to an asset sales transaction that closed in February 2017. 
 

TARGETING THE UNTREATED ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION MARKET.
It is estimated that, worldwide, 150 million men suffer with erectile dysfunction. Factors contributing to the appearance of the disease or its severity include medical history, tobacco use and age. Erectile dysfunction is also found in men with cardiovascular disease.
Other prescription medicines are available for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, including phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors are effective for the treatment of Erectile Dysfunction but also have reported side effects such as those that affect the cardiovascular system, headaches, muscle aches, impaired hearing and vision.
Whereas phosphodiesterase inhibitors are taken in the form of a tablet, Vitaros™ was designed for direct application and to provide a rapid onset with significant efficacy and a favorable safety profile. Vitaros™ was studied in over 3,000 patients and demonstrated positive, clinically meaningful responses in measures of erectile function.
Because men with erectile dysfunction often have other diseases, Vitaros™ was also evaluated in these populations. Men with erectile dysfunction and accompanying diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and prostatectomy also had clinically meaningful enhanced erectile function with Vitaros™. Vitaros™ was well-tolerated in patients, including those with additional diseases.
Availability of a locally acting product that is safe and effective addresses an unmet medical need. Men who are resistant to taking oral medication or have diseases that may preclude them from other treatments now have an alternative with Vitaros™.

History[edit]
Until September 10, 2010, when it formally changed its name, Apricus Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: APRI) had been operating in the pharmaceutical industry since 1995 under the name NexMed, Inc. NASDAQ:NEXM. On November 15, 2010, Apricus Bio received Canadian approval for its topical ED treatment Vitaros and it announced European approval on June 10, 2013.[3]
Location[edit]
Apricus Biosciences is headquartered in San Diego, CA. The company, and its subsidiaries, has approximately 35 employees.
Products[edit]
Vitaros® - is a rapid-onset (generally 5–15 minutes) topical cream for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. It contains Prostaglandin E1 as the active ingredient and the Company's proprietary permeation enhancer (NexACT®) which facilitates the delivery of the drug into the blood stream. The current formulation of Vitaros requires refrigeration and is delivered via a small individual dispenser. Vitaros has been approved for patient use in Canada and Europe and to date (January 24, 2015) has been launched by marketing partners in the United Kingdom (Takeda), Germany (Sandoz), Sweden (Sandoz) and Belgium (Sandoz). Six additional European territories are expected to launch Vitaros during 2015.
Apricus has developed a room temperature formulation of Vitaros which is housed and delivered in a small, custom developed, disposable dispenser or "room temperature device" (RTD). Initial production of Vitaros RTD has commenced in order to generate the required stability data required for marketing approval. The Company continues to expect its commercial partners to launch the Vitaros RTD in 2016.[4]
In November 2007 Apricus Biosciences sold the rights for the refrigerated formulation of Vitaros in the US to Warner Chilcott.[5]
Fispemifene is a new chemical entity initially being pursued for the treatment of low testosterone (secondary hypogonadism) in males. Apricus plans to begin a Phase 2b clinical trial with fispemifene in this indication in the first half of 2015, with top-line data expected to be reported by the end of 2015. Apricus in-licensed the U.S. rights to fispemifene from Forendo Pharma in Q4 2014. Since then, it has transferred the regulatory filings from Forendo, developed a Phase 2b clinical trial protocol, held a scientific advisory board meeting with experts in the field to refine its development strategy, initiated the manufacturing process for the drug, and begun the clinical trial site selection process.
RayVa™ is a topical cream for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon, a circulatory disorder affecting the hands and feet. Patient enrollment commenced in December 2014 for a 45-patient Phase 2a clinical trial for RayVa which is expected to be completed and results announced in the second quarter in 2015. RayVa has the potential to be the only FDA approved treatment for this debilitating condition. RayVA contains Prostaglandin E1 as the active ingredient and Apricus' permeation enhancer (NexACT) which facilitates the delivery of the drug into the blood stream.
Femprox® is a topical cream for the treatment of female sexual interest / arousal disorder. It contains Prostaglandin E1 as the active ingredient and a permeation enhancer (NexACT) which facilitates the delivery of the drug into the blood stream.[2][6]
NexACT Technology[edit]
NexACT® is a proprietary water-soluble small molecule permeation enhancer which temporarily changes the permeation dynamics of the lipid bi-layer and transiently loosens the tight junctions between the cells so that active drug molecules can be rapidly absorbed into systemic circulation. The NexACT technology is used in both Vitaros and RayVA. It can also improve the solubility of compounds resulting in enhanced drug permeation.[7]
Leadership[edit]

History[edit]
Until September 10, 2010, when it formally changed its name, Apricus Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: APRI) had been operating in the pharmaceutical industry since 1995 under the name NexMed, Inc. NASDAQ:NEXM. On November 15, 2010, Apricus Bio received Canadian approval for its topical ED treatment Vitaros and it announced European approval on June 10, 2013.[3]
Location[edit]
Apricus Biosciences is headquartered in San Diego, CA. The company, and its subsidiaries, has approximately 35 employees.
Products[edit]
Vitaros® - is a rapid-onset (generally 5–15 minutes) topical cream for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. It contains Prostaglandin E1 as the active ingredient and the Company's proprietary permeation enhancer (NexACT®) which facilitates the delivery of the drug into the blood stream. The current formulation of Vitaros requires refrigeration and is delivered via a small individual dispenser. Vitaros has been approved for patient use in Canada and Europe and to date (January 24, 2015) has been launched by marketing partners in the United Kingdom (Takeda), Germany (Sandoz), Sweden (Sandoz) and Belgium (Sandoz). Six additional European territories are expected to launch Vitaros during 2015.
Apricus has developed a room temperature formulation of Vitaros which is housed and delivered in a small, custom developed, disposable dispenser or "room temperature device" (RTD). Initial production of Vitaros RTD has commenced in order to generate the required stability data required for marketing approval. The Company continues to expect its commercial partners to launch the Vitaros RTD in 2016.[4]
In November 2007 Apricus Biosciences sold the rights for the refrigerated formulation of Vitaros in the US to Warner Chilcott.[5]
Fispemifene is a new chemical entity initially being pursued for the treatment of low testosterone (secondary hypogonadism) in males. Apricus plans to begin a Phase 2b clinical trial with fispemifene in this indication in the first half of 2015, with top-line data expected to be reported by the end of 2015. Apricus in-licensed the U.S. rights to fispemifene from Forendo Pharma in Q4 2014. Since then, it has transferred the regulatory filings from Forendo, developed a Phase 2b clinical trial protocol, held a scientific advisory board meeting with experts in the field to refine its development strategy, initiated the manufacturing process for the drug, and begun the clinical trial site selection process.
RayVa™ is a topical cream for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon, a circulatory disorder affecting the hands and feet. Patient enrollment commenced in December 2014 for a 45-patient Phase 2a clinical trial for RayVa which is expected to be completed and results announced in the second quarter in 2015. RayVa has the potential to be the only FDA approved treatment for this debilitating condition. RayVA contains Prostaglandin E1 as the active ingredient and Apricus' permeation enhancer (NexACT) which facilitates the delivery of the drug into the blood stream.

The NexACT technology is used in both Vitaros and RayVA. It can also improve the solubility of compounds resulting in enhanced drug permeation.[7]

History[edit]
Until September 10, 2010, when it formally changed its name, Apricus Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: APRI) had been operating in the pharmaceutical industry since 1995 under the name NexMed, Inc. NASDAQ:NEXM. On November 15, 2010, Apricus Bio received Canadian approval for its topical ED treatment Vitaros and it announced European approval on June 10, 2013.[3]
Location[edit]
Apricus Biosciences is headquartered in San Diego, CA. The company, and its subsidiaries, has approximately 35 employees.
Products[edit]
Vitaros® - is a rapid-onset (generally 5–15 minutes) topical cream for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. It contains Prostaglandin E1 as the active ingredient and the Company's proprietary permeation enhancer (NexACT®) which facilitates the delivery of the drug into the blood stream. The current formulation of Vitaros requires refrigeration and is delivered via a small individual dispenser. Vitaros has been approved for patient use in Canada and Europe and to date (January 24, 2015) has been launched by marketing partners in the United Kingdom (Takeda), Germany (Sandoz), Sweden (Sandoz) and Belgium (Sandoz). Six additional European territories are expected to launch Vitaros during 2015.
Apricus has developed a room temperature formulation of Vitaros which is housed and delivered in a small, custom developed, disposable dispenser or "room temperature device" (RTD). Initial production of Vitaros RTD has commenced in order to generate the required stability data required for marketing approval. The Company continues to expect its commercial partners to launch the Vitaros RTD in 2016.[4]
In November 2007 Apricus Biosciences sold the rights for the refrigerated formulation of Vitaros in the US to Warner Chilcott.[5]
Fispemifene is a new chemical entity initially being pursued for the treatment of low testosterone (secondary hypogonadism) in males. Apricus plans to begin a Phase 2b clinical trial with fispemifene in this indication in the first half of 2015, with top-line data expected to be reported by the end of 2015. Apricus in-licensed the U.S. rights to fispemifene from Forendo Pharma in Q4 2014. Since then, it has transferred the regulatory filings from Forendo, developed a Phase 2b clinical trial protocol, held a scientific advisory board meeting with experts in the field to refine its development strategy, initiated the manufacturing process for the drug, and begun the clinical trial site selection process.
RayVa™ is a topical cream for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon, a circulatory disorder affecting the hands and feet. Patient enrollment commenced in December 2014 for a 45-patient Phase 2a clinical trial for RayVa which is expected to be completed and results announced in the second quarter in 2015. RayVa has the potential to be the only FDA approved treatment for this debilitating condition. RayVA contains Prostaglandin E1 as the active ingredient and Apricus' permeation enhancer (NexACT) which facilitates the delivery of the drug into the blood stream.
Femprox® is a topical cream for the treatment of female sexual interest / arousal disorder. It contains Prostaglandin E1 as the active ingredient and a permeation enhancer (NexACT) which facilitates the delivery of the drug into the blood stream.[2][6]

NexACT® is a proprietary water-soluble small molecule permeation enhancer which temporarily changes the permeation dynamics of the lipid bi-layer and transiently loosens the tight junctions between the cells so that active drug molecules can be rapidly absorbed into systemic circulation.

					Full Description



Apricus Biosciences, Inc., incorporated on October 20, 1987, is a pharmaceutical company, which develops pharmaceutical products. The Company primarily focuses on the development and commercialization of products and product candidates in the areas of urology and rheumatology. The Company's drug delivery technology is a permeation enhancer called NexACT. It has over two product candidates in Phase II development, fispemifene for the treatment of symptomatic male secondary hypogonadism and RayVa for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon, secondary to scleroderma. The Company has a commercial product, Vitaros for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED), which is in development in the United States, approved in Canada and marketed throughout Europe.FispemifeneFispemifene is a once-daily, orally administered, tissue-specific selective estrogen receptor modulator designed to treat a range of men's health conditions, including secondary hypogonadism, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and chronic prostatitis in men. Fispemifene acts in secondary hypogonadism by inhibiting the negative feedback of testosterone production through an estrogen-blocking effect at the level of pituitary, resulting in increased testosterone production in the testes, which in turn restores circulating testosterone levels to within, but not beyond, the normal range. Fispemifene has also shown other positive tissue effects in animal studies, such as preserving bone density, anti-proliferative activity in prostate and breast cancer. The Company is conducting a randomized double-blind Phase IIb clinical trial in symptomatic secondary hypogonadism.RayVaRayVa is the Company's product candidate for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon associated with scleroderma (systemic sclerosis). RayVa product combines alprostadil, which dilates blood vessels, with its permeation enhancer, NexACT, and is applied as an on-demand topical cream to affected extremities. Raynaud's Phenomenon is characterized by constriction of the blood vessels in response to cold or stress of the hands and feet, resulting in reduced blood flow and the sensation of pain, which can be severe. RayVa utilizes its NexACT technology, combining alprostadil and NexACT in an on-demand topical application to the affected areas. The Company has completed a Phase IIa clinical trial of RayVa for the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon secondary to scleroderma.VitarosVitaros, the Company's product for the treatment of ED, is a topically-applied cream formulation of alprostadil, a vasodilator and NexACT, which directly increases blood flow to the penis causing an erection. Vitaros is manufactured by Therapex, a division of E-Z-EM Canada Inc., a subsidiary of Bracco SpA in Italy (Therapex) and by Groupe Parima, Inc. Vitaros is marketed in the Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Portugal and Romania.The Company competes with Pfizer, GlaxoSmith-Kline, Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., The Menarini Group, Meda, Futura Medical Inc, Abbott Labs and Eli Lilly.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Over the past two quarters following the disappointing fispemifene clinical trial results, we have sharpened our focus on increasing value through the fostering and expansion of our Vitaros® commercial partnerships, preparing the Vitaros NDA resubmission and improving the Company’s financial position.
Strategic Priorities:
Vitaros®* (alprostadil)

Continue implementation of the U.S. regulatory approval strategy to address the safety and manufacturing issues raised by the FDA in the original Vitaros NDA submission. In November, the FDA provided clarity on the requirements needed to address the deficiencies in the 2008 Complete Response letter to include suggested additional analysis of existing clinical and non-clinical data. The FDA feedback did not indicate that new clinical studies would be required for re-submission, but the FDA did determine that Vitaros is now considered a drug-device combination. The Company intends to meet with the Office of Product Quality to confirm the necessary device engineering and compliance requirements for the NDA re-submission and then resubmit the Vitaros NDA in the second half of 2017. An FDA approval decision is expected after a six month review period;
Continue to support the Company’s ex-U.S. partners’ efforts to build a global Vitaros brand and increase revenue by supporting new commercial launches by the Company’s partners and assisting the Company’s partners in obtaining additional regulatory approvals in their respective territories;
Continue the Company’s efforts to license Vitaros in available countries throughout Asia to include Japan, China and India; and
Continue to generate the required data to support delivery device improvements and related regulatory submission(s) with a priority to support the U.S. NDA resubmission of the refrigerated version of Vitaros and to deliver a commercially viable refrigerated product in Canada.

RayVa™ (alprostadil)

Explore Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. and EU; and
Explore global or regional partnerships prior to initiating the Phase 2b study.

Corporate/Financial

Reduce operating expenses by approximately 30% in 2016 and 60% in 2017 as compared to 2015 operating expenses;
Work with NASDAQ to try and regain compliance with the minimum $35 million market value of listed securities requirement as required for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(2); and
Grow Vitaros revenue, seek non-dilutive capital and utilize lower cost of capital financial instruments to fund operations with the goal of achieving profitability in 2018.

Apricus’ development priority is now focused on Vitaros, both to accelerate commercialization outside of the U.S. and to attempt to bring this novel erectile dysfunction therapy to patients in the U.S. next year, with the goal of achieving profitability in 2018.
As always, thank you for your continued support and interest in Apricus Biosciences.
Warm regards,
Richard W. Pascoe
