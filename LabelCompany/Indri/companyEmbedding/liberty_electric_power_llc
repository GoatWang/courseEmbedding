Liberty Electric Power


        Power    

Client:
Duke Fluor/Daniel & Liberty Electric Power, LLC
End Use:
Power Generation
Project Location:
Eddystone, PA
Square Footage:
40,100


Description:
This 40,100 sq. ft. multi-unit combined cycle plant was built near South Philadelphia to help accommodate the area’s ever-growing energy needs. Heavy Structures provided a hybrid structural steel framing system that incorporated both conventional and pre-engineered components for the Turbine building. A pre-engineered standard product line was used for the structural steel and cladding systems on the complex’s Office and Administrative buildings. Welded-up, stepped-crane columns were used in the Gas and Steam Turbine building to support a 70-ton top running crane that traverses the 325' length of the building. Framing for this section of the complex was complicated by a 40' roof step and heavy support framing for two large filter house units that sit on the low bay roof. A standing seam metal roof system and metal wall system were used on all of the buildings

BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

BBB Rating System Overview

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Liberty Power Corp., LLC has received 2.38 out of 5 stars based on 10 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of C.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

					 Manufacturing's intelligent makeover
				





Software, sensors, data analytics and network technologies are the new "hammers" of American manufacturing The entire production lifecycle can be transformed with intelligent tools, and early adopters are forging their way to competitive advantage.
























					
                                        Ushering in the age of the digital enterprise              
				








The impetus for becoming a digital enterprise is not about who has the coolest technology - but who can best achieve advantage without disruption. The case for adopting innovation is often made as companies plateau in mastering perennial challenges such as efficiency and time to market. Discrete and process industries at all levels of maturity, and companies of all sizes are forging a path to digitalization using Siemens ingenuity:

 Integrating islands of data to gain systemic visibility and enhance production control.
 Enhancing design and engineering through software that enables virtual design and rapid prototyping.
 Performing remote diagnostics and running simulations to predict and plan for maintenance.

The future of manufacturing is digital. Are you ready?

					 Rethinking operating costs from end to end
				





Today's challenging oil price environment is forcing major change and difficult decisions within the Oil & Gas industry. Existing operating models are being challenged and new approaches are required to overcome the technical and economic transformations at hand. Across the entire value chain Siemens is helping customers transform their business with solutions that blend operational technology with software and data.

America needs affordable, reliable and clean electricity. Businesses demand inexpensive power sources to be competitive, and people rely on electricity to make the conveniences of modern life possible. From powering our smart phones to powering our factories, Siemens is helping to create a resilient, flexible and secure energy system in the United States.
 
Whether you're talking about intelligent energy delivery, distributed energy, microgrids, digital grids, highly efficient combined cycle power plants, a new generation of gas turbines, or more productive wind turbines, Siemens is helping to build a sustainable energy future today.

					  America's express pass to mobility
				





City light rail and metros together with inter-city passenger rail is giving a boost to regional economies, making it easier for people to move around, expand access to opportunity and improve quality of life. Rail and road solutions are also helping to reduce traffic congestion on roads and highways.












					
                    Siemens is working with cities and people to help move America forward
				








To modernize and revitalize cities, we make transportation more efficient, intelligent, and safe - while lowering environmental impact and creating a better traveler experience. We deliver cloud-based traffic management systems, locomotives, light rail and metros, rail signaling and electrification solutions. One in every 3 light rail cars operating in the U.S. was built by Siemens. Along with our rail electrification and rail signaling systems in the U.S., we bring advanced technologies that improve operator performance and passenger quality of life. For example:
 

 Communications-Based Train Control systems for New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority
 Light rail vehicles for the Twin Cities that reduce gas emissions by more than 70% vs. cars
 Traffic management systems that shorten commute times by 20% along routes in San Antonio, Texas

 
We live and work in the communities where we create Ingenuity for life, with 2,000 employees across North America and full-scale transportation manufacturing facilities in five U.S. locations.
