Australian telco Telstra has announced the appointment of Chin Hu Lim, 54, as a non-executive Director. Mr Lim is based in Singapore and will bring almost 30 years of experience in the technology sector across the Asia Pacific region.
Mr Lim is managing partner of venture capital firm Stream Global and has a professional history including Hewlett Packard, Sun Microsystems and BT Global Services.
Telstra Chairman Catherine Livingstone said Mr Lim would add to Telstra’s depth of Asian expertise as well as contributing to the company’s consideration of technology opportunities.
“Chin Hu Lim has a significant range of skills and experience to bring to the Telstra Board from the perspectives of technology, geography, healthcare, venture capital and broader pan-Asian business,” Ms Livingstone said. “It is essential the Board continue to evolve its skills and diversity base to reflect the needs of the business and the interests of shareholders. We are very pleased Chin Hu will join us.”
Mr Lim said the Telstra position was highly aligned with his business experiences and appreciated the opportunity to join as the company extended its regional footprint. “Telstra is a successful Australian telecommunications and technology company developing its presence across Asia and I’m delighted to become part of that expansion,” he said.
Mr Lim’s firm, Stream Global is appointed by Singapore’s National Research Foundation to provide seed funding for technology startups. His current Board positions include Kulicke & Soffa Inc (NASDAQ: KLIC), a semiconductor equipment assembly manufacturer; G-Able, an IT systems integration and professional services company in Thailand; Changi General Hospital and Integrated Health Information Systems, a healthcare IT services solutions provider for public hospitals in Singapore. He serves as a council member in the Singapore Institute of Directors and Infocomm Development Authority – Personal Data Protection Advisory Committee. Previous directorships include Director/CEO of Frontline Technologies and BT South East Asia.
Mr Lim started his career in Hewlett Packard and held various sales, marketing and management positions with HP in Singapore, Melbourne and south-east Asia. He was previously Managing Director for Sun Microsystems in Singapore and country director for Sun in Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam.
He holds a Bachelor of Applied Science from La Trobe University in Melbourne and a Diploma in electrical and electronics engineering from Ngee Ann Polytechnic in Singapore.
Mr Lim’s appointment is effective 9 August 2013. He will stand for election by shareholders at Telstra’s next annual general meeting in Sydney on 15 October.
Upon this appointment, the Telstra Board will comprise Chairman Catherine Livingstone, CEO David Thodey and directors Geoffrey Cousins, Russell Higgins, Chin Hu Lim, John Mullen, Nora Scheinkestel, Margaret Seale, Steven Vamos and John Zeglis.

                                            CA Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) today announced that Lionel Lim will join the company as President of Asia Pacific, effective August 30, 2010. Lim will be responsible for growing CA Technologies business in the AP region that includes Australia/New Zealand, India, Greater China, Taiwan, Korea and Southeast Asia.



"As CA Technologies moves into a phase of growth, we are pleased to have an executive of Lionel's caliber joining the team," said John Ruthven, General Manager and Managing Director of Growth & Emerging Markets for CA.  "Lionel has 30 years of experience at IT companies in the region, and has proven his ability to drive change, build successful teams, forge outstanding customer relationships and ultimately, grow sales.  Lionel's addition is good for our customers, our partners and our employees."

Chin Hu Lim, Chief Executive Officer of BT Frontline, said "Lionel Lim's appointment is a great step forward in the right direction for CA.  Lionel demonstrated strong leadership in identifying and growing an excellent partner centric ecosystem for Sun Microsystems in Asia South and Asia Pacific in his previous role in Sun.  BT Frontline has benefitted and grown over the past 13 years from a Singapore-based Sun reseller to a pan-Asia Pacific IT services company by adopting and investing with Lionel's vision of serving regional customers in the region via technology partners like us. I am confident that with Lionel at the helm of CA's leadership in Asia Pacific, the company will develop a strong network of partners to help grow CA's business in the region. We will be happy to invest in developing our partnership with CA further."

With Lionel's appointment, CA Technologies significantly strengthens its Asia Pacific management team.  The AP operation is key for CA as it combines first-class sales, technical and support teams focused on the needs of local businesses with one of CA Technologies worldwide development centers, located in China.

Prior to joining CA Technologies, Lionel spent 20 years at Sun Microsystems and 10 years at HP.  He held a variety of management and sales roles, including President and COO, Sun Microsystems Asia Pacific and President Sun Asia South, Greater China and Japan.

Lionel will be based in the company's regional headquarters in Singapore.
