ManagementWrittenVyomesh Joshi: The Business Plan is Simple, Executing It is HardThe executive from HP's imaging and printing group explains the five pillars of a sustainable business, and how to see them through.November 1, 2005|by
Marguerite Rigoglioso

What does it take for a company to create a sustainable business? Identify holes in the market; develop appropriate price models; establish business partnerships with other enterprises; foster respect and trust with employees; and provide leadership that puts business first, people second, and managers' egos third.
These were the five key success factors distilled from 25 years' experience with Hewlett-Packard Co. that Vyomesh Joshi, executive vice president of HP's imaging and printing group, shared with attendees of the 13th annual Net Impact Conference on Nov. 12.
"They sound simple," Joshi said, "but in fact they're hard to do."
Addressing an audience eager to hear how corporations are integrating social and environmental responsibility into their bottom lines, Joshi also said that HP partners with retailers in "take back" programs to retrieve and recycle 200 million pounds of used inkjet and LaserJet printer cartridge paraphernalia each year. "There must be a balance between caring for the environment and shareholders," he said. "You can do both.
Soon every HP inkjet cartridge will come with a postage-paid envelope for return when depleted, he announced, and the company is ramping up the "energy-saving" functions such as "sleep" mode on its printers. HP also has social projects in several regions in the United States and abroad to expand communities' access to computer technology. "These efforts don't make money, but we see them as part of our corporate responsibility," Joshi said.
Joshi focused his remarks on what it has taken to help build HP imaging and printing into a $25 billion business. "In 1984, when we started, we had no idea we would be so successful," he said. "We simply saw a market trend — that personal computers would be big." Reasoning that people would want to be able to print right off their desktop, the new team figured out how to use inkjet and laser technologies to create a low-end product for home users and a more upscale model for offices.
The group then filed for numerous patents on its products to create barriers to entry by competitors and settled on a market pricing structure. It paired up with Canon, an expert in laser technology, to create a long-term partnership that has helped make HP printers nearly ubiquitous in offices around the world.
Success at HP has been about more than managing technology well, however; it has been about managing people well, Joshi said. "In 1980, HP was the only place I wanted to work. I knew that if I did the right thing there, the right thing would happen." What contributes to HP's strength as a company, he told young professionals in the audience, is its emphasis on helping employees trust and feel respected by management. "I follow our founders' practice of managing by walking around," Joshi said. "You've got to talk to people to find out what they're thinking, and be honest and transparent in return."
Joshi said his own experience has proven that part of being successful is cultivating leadership that's not afraid to flinch in the face of difficulties and hard decisions. "In 2005 we've had to let 3,200 people go to get our cost structure in line," he said. "It was a very tough thing to do, but what helped us was knowing we had to put the business above all else."
Joshi concluded by listing some key trends that are driving new business models, including the primacy of digital versus analog, and the increasing presence of the Internet. "People spend 26 percent of their free time on the web versus 6 percent reading the newspaper. Yet advertising agencies, for example, spend 30 percent of their budgets on newspapers and only 4 percent on the Internet. That will switch completely." HP itself, he said, is currently experimenting with products that will align with that trend, such as devices that connect directly to the Internet without the intermediary of the PC.
"You've got to constantly figure out how to create new value propositions to meet customer needs in new ways," he told the crowd. "If you miss the opportunity, you don't catch up."
The Nov. 11—13 Net Impact conference at Stanford GSB included three keynote addresses and roughly 50 panel discussions. The event was organized in conjunction with the School's Center for Social Innovation and Public Management Program. Net Impact is an organization of some 12,000 members with 100 chapters around the globe dedicated to using the power of business to improve the world.

    3D Systems Appoints Former HP Exec Vyomesh Joshi as New President and CEO | 3DPrint.com | The Voice of 3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing                  









 3DPrintBoard.com | Insidebitcoins.com    Twitter     Pinterest     Facebook     LinkedIn     Youtube Videos     RSS           The Voice of 3D Printing / Additive Manufacturing    Select Page       3D Systems Appoints Former HP Exec Vyomesh Joshi as New President and CEO by Scott J Grunewald | Apr 4, 2016 | 3D Printing, Business |    Share on TumblrGlobal 3D printing and 3D printer manufacturing leader 3D Systems has finally announced their replacement for former CEO Avi Reichental, who stepped down last October amidst plummeting stock prices and controversy. Effective immediately Vyomesh Joshi (VJ) has been named as the company’s new President and CEO by the 3D Systems board. VJ will replace Interim-President and CEO Andy Johnson, who will stay with 3D Systems as 3D Systems’ Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer. The appointment comes after the role was vacant for nearly six months, and at a crucial time for the company that seems to be trying to redefine its role within the industry.3D Systems’ new President and CEO, Vyomesh Joshi.VJ is a former Vice President of Imaging and Printing at Hewlett Packard and is widely regarded as responsible for doubling the struggling printing business’ operating profits during the 11-year period that he was with the company. After the closing down of 3D Systems Cube line of desktop 3D printers and 3D printing products, the company has been refocusing its efforts into the industrial 3D printing market. So far the move seems to be finally heading the company in the right direction. As the head of a $26 billion printing business, VJ is ideally suited to take the reins of a 3D printing company that is seeking to reposition itself as a leader in industrial and commercial 3D printing applications.“We are pleased to announce VJ’s appointment as President and CEO of 3D Systems. VJ’s significant experience scaling and strengthening technology-driven businesses, his expertise in product development and innovation, and his proven track record of operational excellence make him the ideal candidate to lead our company into its next era,” said Chairman of the 3D Systems Board of Directors Wally Loewenbaum.To suggest that replacing Reichenthal was going to be quick and easy is to completely ignore 3D Systems as a company and the state of the business that he left behind him. While publically the split was amicable, it is doubtful that behind closed doors it was quite so cordial. Reichental’s resignation came after a string of bad news, poorly chosen acquisitions and lawsuits that plagued 3D Systems throughout 2015, including stock prices dipping to unprecedented lows, the loss of several legal battles and the implosion of the company’s desktop division. Avi Reichental, former president and CEO of 3D SystemsRegardless of the obvious errors in judgement made by Reichental, it is impossible to ignore the fact that he was a force of nature within the company, and within the 3D printing industry itself. He was unquestionably a large contributor to the public’s greater understanding, and embrace of 3D printing technology. Between giving TED Talks, enticing celebrity endorsements and spearheading a massive public advertising campaign, Reichental was the face of 3D printing for nearly two years, and for a while at least 3D Systems enjoyed the fruits of his labor. By positioning himself as the 3D printing mastermind, Reichental put a target on his head a mile wide if anything went wrong with 3D Systems. So when things started to fall apart, it was not at all surprising that he would be the first person to go. Not only was he directly responsible for many of the poorly chosen business decisions, but he was widely seen as the cause of much of the dysfunctional corporate culture at 3D Systems. However it is shocking that he seemed to be the only high level executive to get the boot, especially considering how very dysfunctional that corporate culture reportedly was. “I am incredibly excited about the future of 3D Systems. We have a tremendous opportunity to help customers take advantage of the era of manufacturing transformation, including mass customization. While the company has a strong history in place, it is clear that we need to develop new and innovative products with unprecedented quality and service levels to drive sustainable growth and profits,” said new 3D Systems President and CEO Vyomesh Joshi.While there has been some positive momentum coming from 3D Systems lately, the dysfunctional nature of the company still seems to be in place. Taking 3D Systems back to its heyday of stock market success and positive public opinion isn’t going to be an easy job unless some structure changes are made to the company. Let’s hope VJ’s success at HP, another company often plagued by dysfunctional executive culture, helps him putting 3D Systems back together again. Any thoughts?

Taking Over 3D Systems: Vyomesh Joshi on His New RoleMichael  Molitch-Hou posted on December 21, 2016 |    7293 views





At a tour of 3D Systems' Healthcare Technology Center outside of Denver, the company’s new CEO, Vyomesh Joshi, provided insight to press and investors about his plans for the future of 3D Systems. It may have been surprising that Joshi would be present for the facility tour, but after hearing about his vision for the company, it became clear that, in some ways, the Healthcare Technology Center was key to the 3D Systems roadmap—not because Joshi plans to make 3D Systems a medical business, but because he finds the firm's healthcare division to be the ideal model for the other verticals in which 3D Systems is involved.

ENGINEERING.com spoke with 3D Systems CEO Vyomesh Joshi at the Healthcare Technology Center in Littleton, Colo. (Image courtesy of 3D Systems.)

ENGINEERING.com had an opportunity to speak with Joshi, as well as executive vice president and chief operating officer of healthcare Kevin McAlea, to gain insight into what that roadmap looks like.
Out of Retirement
Joshi got his start as a tech executive by climbing the corporate ladder of HP, starting as an R&D engineer and working his way up to president of the imaging and printing group. In that role, he was able to double the operating profits of the division over the course of 11 years. Without delving into the role of HP's management at the time, we can say that Joshi ended his 32-year career with the tech giant when Meg Whitman took over in 2012.

Why did Joshi leave the comforts of retirement at the age of 62? “I got really bored,” Joshi said. What could stir him out of his boredom more than an exciting advanced manufacturing technology like 3D printing? According to the CEO, it wasn't just 3D printing that pulled him out of retirement. It was 3D Systems founder Chuck Hull and his latest 3D printing platform, the Figure 4.
“This opportunity came in and I said, ‘Oh, wow, I can make a real contribution here,’” Joshi said. “I had a conversation with Chuck Hull, when he showed me the Figure 4, and I thought that it was really interesting. So I said, ‘Hey, this could be fun. I can take all of my knowledge and really apply that with a great team.’”
He added, “I was retired and I didn’t have to do this thing, but when I saw the guy who invented the whole industry excited about what he could do with the technology and when I looked at the portfolio…” Though its competitor Stratasys has the largest market share in the industry, 3D Systems easily has the broadest product portfolio, including stereolithography, ColorJet Printing, MultiJet Printing, Direct Metal Printing, selective laser sintering and, with Figure 4, continuous digital light processing technologies on the additive manufacturing front. But it also develops software, through Geomagic and Cimatron, and mixed-reality products, through Simbionix.
With a bird's eye view of the entire company, Joshi began to understand his role in the company. “Then I looked at the operational problems. Once I joined, I talked to Kevin [McAlea], and all of the puzzle pieces fell into place. I knew I needed to augment some of the teams, but I really thought that we could make this company something really big.”
Beginning with Healthcare
Joshi sees what McAlea has done with the firm's healthcare division as a successful model to follow with 3D Systems' other verticals. By segmenting the market, as he did with HP's printing business, and then extrapolating the company's healthcare model to those segments—currently outlined by Joshi as the aerospace and defense, automotive and durable goods markets—he believes it would be possible to make 3D Systems into a tech giant.
In explaining the strategy, Joshi began with his work at HP. “When I was at HP, it was great to really drive the transformation of a printing industry and build a big business there. That was very exciting because I learned a lot about starting with the customer, taking over the technology and creating a great value proposition. The other thing is—especially in the graphics business that we built from scratch—there was a big transformation happening as we went from analog to digital. High-level presses had been the way people were making books and magazines and doing marketing collateral. Then, you could begin to do those things digitally all of a sudden.”
He continued, “The approach that I took then was to segment the market and understand the use cases. If you took the use cases and created an end-to-end workflow, then you would be able to move from analog to digital. So, when I started working at 3D Systems, I first understood the core technology platforms and the great kind of products we had. Then, I talked to Kevin [McAlea] about how he built his healthcare business similar to how I had with customer segmentation in terms of workflows. I said, ‘If you can take this technology and move from prototyping to manufacturing and apply the same principles that Kevin applied in creating a vertical, I think we can take this company to the next level.’”
The workflow that McAlea has created for the healthcare division sees 3D printing as one step in a larger process. This process sees physical objects digitized through 3D scanning or specialty software and products designed with CAD. These models can then be simulated with simulation software, including 3D Systems' Simbionix virtual surgery modules, before they are manufactured in the physical world with 3D printing. Afterwards, inspection tools perform essential quality control procedures, and the management of the end product takes place.
Joshi said that he has made McAlea not only head of healthcare for 3D Systems, but head of metal 3D printing in the hopes that the executive can build 3D Systems' aerospace and defense division in the same way. McAlea believes that, while aerospace and healthcare may seem fundamentally different, the two industries have much more in common than one might think.
“There are differences between medical and aerospace, once you get into the details. The medical field has all of the issues associated with biocompatibility and mechanical properties are important, but not critical, whereas, with aerospace, mechanical properties are absolutely essential, but companies don't worry about things like biocompatibility,” McAlea said. “But a lot of the building blocks to be

successful in these advanced manufacturing applications are the same.”
Some of the building blocks McAlea referred to are segmenting the market and use cases, developing products to meet the requirements of those markets and hiring the right people from the right industries. In the case of the healthcare division, the company already has a cohesive workflow, a product portfolio tailored to specific use cases and a skilled staff that is knowledgeable about 3D printing in healthcare due to 15 years in the industry.
3D Systems just needs to ensure that the same model is executed in its aerospace and defense decision. According to Joshi and McAlea, the company is basically already there. “As an example, here [at the Healthcare Technology Center], we have ISO13485 certification for [producing medical devices],” McAlea said. “We had someone do a gap analysis for us for what would it take to get AS9100 aerospace certification. The gap was very small. We can do that work in about three months for low cost. If we were starting from scratch, it would take years.”
The Future of 3D Printing with 3D Systems
Reading our previous article on the Healthcare Technology Center, it's clear that 3D printing is already having a big impact on the medical industry. With the ability to plan surgeries with patient-specific models and produce patient-specific devices, the benefits seem obvious on an anecdotal level. McAlea pointed out that clinical studies are now reinforcing stories of 3D printing's benefits in medicine with actual data.
Now, the technology must see greater adoption, regardless of the industry, in order for its impact to be truly felt. Joshi and McAlea pointed out that it's often the younger generation that is more quick to adopt 3D printing, while older professionals will fall back on years of experience with tried and true techniques. While an established surgeon, for instance, might not be as quick to incorporate patient-specific models to plan a surgery, McAlea has found that new surgeons can't see doing it any other way.
“There's always going to be a generational gap with new technology,” McAlea said. “We deal with a lot of training in cadaver labs in conjunction with our medical device partners. There, you're training all of these relatively new surgeons in surgical planning [with 3D technology]. Afterwards, most of them say they would never consider doing it any other way.”

He likens the situation to the adoption of flight simulators in the aerospace industry. “Pilots in the 1960s were scornful of the notion of flight simulators. Today, pilots can't go up unless they've trained for hours on simulators,” McAlea said.
Both believed that the technology would gain widespread adoption, as the younger generation begins to supplant the old. And it's the potential that this technology holds that is part of the reason that Joshi decided to come out of retirement.
 “The things that we do are so meaningful,” Joshi said. “People don't usually get a chance to do this kind of stuff—to change the lives of people.” He referred to a recent surgery in which 3D Systems played a key role 3D printing presurgical models for a pair of twins joined at the skull. “Think about the McDonald twins and the impact felt by their mom and dad. We were really instrumental in making that surgery into a reality. That's a big deal.”

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
