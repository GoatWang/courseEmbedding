CareDx to acquire SBT Resolver™ HLA Typing Products from Illumina




















January 24, 2017 16:01 ET

 | Source: CareDx, Inc.






BRISBANE, Calif., Jan.  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CareDx, Inc. (Nasdaq:CDNA), a molecular diagnostics company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of clinically differentiated, high-value diagnostic solutions for transplant recipients, announces that it has signed an agreement with Illumina, Inc. (Nasdaq:ILMN) for the acquisition of Conexio SBT Resolver™ products and Assign™ SBT analysis software for high resolution HLA typing. SBT Resolver assay designs and Assign SBT software advances have been key to the global implementation of HLA typing. This technology set the benchmark for high-resolution HLA typing and the recently enhanced SBT Resolver assays and Assign SBT v4.7 software continue to provide innovative, high quality HLA typing. CareDx, through its recently acquired Olerup franchise, has a strong global presence in the pre-transplant HLA typing market. Olerup has successfully distributed the Conexio SBT product line since 2011. “We see CareDx well-positioned to take ownership of Conexio’s SBT business since the Olerup franchise previously distributed these products. The sale of Conexio’s capillary electrophoresis SBT portfolio permits Illumina to focus on next-generation sequencing products for HLA typing,” said Rob Brainin, Vice President and General Manager, Applied Genomics at Illumina, Inc. “This acquisition allows us to continue to build our transplant business as we commercialize our existing core products, launch new products and now also can leverage inorganic growth options such as Conexio’s SBT. Illumina has been a terrific partner and strategic investor. We are excited about adding the SBT product line and the capabilities of a great team in Fremantle, Australia to CareDx.” said Peter Maag, CEO of CareDx. About CareDxCareDx, Inc., based in Brisbane, California, is a molecular diagnostics company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of clinically differentiated, high-value, non-invasive diagnostic surveillance solutions for transplant recipients. The Company has commercialized AlloMap®, a gene expression test that aids clinicians in identifying heart transplant recipients.  CareDx is also pursuing the development of additional products for post-transplant monitoring of other solid organs that use a variety of technologies, including next generation sequencing, to detect donor-derived cell-free DNA to monitor the health of organs after transplantation. CareDx, with its presence through Olerup, also develops, manufactures, markets and sells high quality products that increase the chance of successful transplants by facilitating a better match between a donor and a recipient of stem cells and organs.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.

Personalizing Care for Heart Transplant Patients
AlloMap® is a non-invasive blood test for heart transplant patients. AlloMap is the first and only non-invasive test with a rapid turnaround time that helps physicians identify the risk of acute cellular rejection in heart transplant recipients.
Since its introduction in 2005, AlloMap has helped to:

Reduce patients’ pain, anxiety, and risk caused by biopsies through a simple, non-invasive method of blood sample collection
Give providers accurate information on the risk of acute cellular rejection in their patients following heart transplant

AlloMap is widely used and accepted
Use of AlloMap as part of post transplantation monitoring and surveillance has become the standard of care in approximately 90% of heart transplantation programs in North America. There are now over:

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
