BAYONNE, N.J., July  21, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BCB Bancorp, Inc., Bayonne, N.J. (NASDAQ:BCBP), announced that the Board of Directors unanimously approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.14/share on July 19th, 2017 to shareholders in its common stock of record on August 7th, 2017, payable on August 21st, 2017. This compares with a quarterly dividend of $0.14/share for the same period last year. Thomas Coughlin, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We were pleased with net income for the first six months of 2017 improving 66 percent over the prior year, and that this is in line with our strategic plan and positions us well for the second half of 2017. The declaration of our quarterly cash dividend reflects the Bank’s ability to provide consistent shareholder value and execute on our strategic plan while remaining a well-capitalized financial institution.” BCB Community Bank currently operates 22 full-service branches in Bayonne, Carteret, Colonia, Edison, Fairfield, Hoboken, Holmdel, Jersey City, Lodi, Lyndhurst, Monroe Township, Rutherford, South Orange, Union, and Woodbridge, NJ as well as two locations in Staten Island, NY. Questions regarding the content of this release should be directed to Thomas Coughlin, President and Chief Executive Officer, or Thomas Keating, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, at (201) 823-0700. Forward-looking Statements and Associated Risk Factors This release, like many written and oral communications presented by BCB Bancorp, Inc., and our authorized officers, may contain certain forward-looking statements regarding our prospective performance and strategies within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are including this statement for purposes of said safe harbor provisions. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies, and expectations of the Company, are generally identified by use of words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “seek,” “strive,” “try,” or future or conditional verbs such as “could,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” or similar expressions. Our ability to predict results or the actual effects of our plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from anticipated results. There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause actual conditions, events, or results to differ significantly from those described in our forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions and trends, either nationally or in some or all of the areas in which we and our customers conduct our respective businesses; conditions in the securities markets or the banking industry; changes in interest rates, which may affect our net income, prepayment penalties and other future cash flows, or the market value of our assets; changes in deposit flows, and in the demand for deposit, loan, and investment products and other financial services in the markets we serve; changes in the financial or operating performance of our customers’ businesses; changes in real estate values, which could impact the quality of the assets securing the loans in our portfolio; changes in the quality or composition of our loan or investment portfolios; changes in competitive pressures among financial institutions or from non-financial institutions; changes in our customer base; potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of companies targeted for acquisition; our ability to retain key members of management; our timely development of new lines of business and competitive products or services in a changing environment, and the acceptance of such products or services by our customers; any interruption or breach of security resulting in failures or disruptions in customer account management, general ledger, deposit, loan or other systems; any interruption in customer service due to circumstances beyond our control; the outcome of pending or threatened litigation, or of other matters before regulatory agencies, or of matters resulting from regulatory exams, whether currently existing or commencing in the future; environmental conditions that exist or may exist on properties owned by, leased by, or mortgaged to the Company; changes in estimates of future reserve requirements based upon the periodic review thereof under relevant regulatory and accounting requirements; changes in legislation, regulation, and policies, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to banking, securities, tax, environmental protection, and insurance, and the ability to comply with such changes in a timely manner; changes in accounting principles, policies, practices, or guidelines; operational issues stemming from, and/or capital spending necessitated by, the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information technology systems, on which we are highly dependent; the ability to keep pace with, and implement on a timely basis, technological changes; changes in the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board; war or terrorist activities; and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, and geopolitical factors affecting our operations, pricing and services. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this release. Except as required by applicable law or regulation, the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date on which such statements were made.

(the “Company” or “BCB”), Bayonne, NJ (NASDAQ:BCBP – News), the holding company for BCB Community Bank, has announced it has entered into a definitive merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement"), with IA Bancorp, Inc. (“IAB”), pursuant to which the Company will acquire IAB and its wholly owned subsidiary, Indus-American Bank.  Upon consummation of the merger, Indus-American Bank will merge with BCB Community Bank and will operate as a division of BCB Community Bank.  Following the closing of the merger, BCB will form an advisory board which will consist of current members of the IAB board of directors and other prominent community members.Indus-American Bank, which has its headquarters in Edison, New Jersey, operates full-service branches in Edison, Jersey City, Parsippany and Plainsboro, New Jersey, and Hicksville, New York. Indus-American Bank was founded primarily to meet the banking needs of the South Asian-American community. Indus-American Bank specializes in core business banking products for small- to medium-sized companies, with an emphasis on real estate-based lending.Mark D. Hogan, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, stated, "We are extremely excited and pleased to welcome Indus-American customers and employees to BCB. Our partnership with Indus-American is consistent with BCB's strategic plan of executing smart growth via expansions and organic branching. This transaction will allow the combined entities to further develop our existing markets in Jersey City and Edison, and will provide further opportunities in Parsippany, Plainsboro and Hicksville, New York, three new, attractive markets for BCB.”The total transaction value is approximately $20 million, including the assumption by BCB of approximately $7.5 million of IAB preferred stock, outstanding shares of IAB common stock of approximately 4.18 million and based on a 10-day volume weighted average price of BCB common stock. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, which both boards of directors have approved, IAB shareholders shall be entitled to elect to receive either 0.189 shares of BCB common stock or $3.05 in cash for each share of IAB common stock, subject to an overall allocation of exchanged IAB shares into 80% BCB common stock and 20% cash. The closing and the systems’ conversion is anticipated to occur in the fourth quarter of 2017, subject to approval by IAB shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.  On a pro forma basis, the transaction is expected to be accretive to the Company’s 2018 earnings by approximately 10% per share, with tangible book value per share dilution of approximately 1.3% and an earn-back period of approximately 1.2 years.Anil Bansal, Chairman of the Board of Directors of IAB, said, "We believe our loyal Indus-American Bank customers and shareholders will greatly benefit from this merger. BCB is a true community bank, with a history of a very strong commitment to its customers and the communities it serves. This merger will bring expanded lending capacity, supplementary retail and business products and added capital, which should enable our combined organizations to better serve our customers, to continue growing in our marketplaces, and to further enhance shareholder value."Thomas Coughlin, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank, added, "BCB is excited to be partnering with IAB and Indus-American Bank. Indus-American Bank’s branch locations complement BCB’s current locations. BCB will continue Indus-American Bank’s commitment of service to its customers and its communities. The existing Indus-American branches will operate and be known as “BCB-Indus-American Bank, a division of BCB Community Bank,” in recognition of the strong identity forged over the years by Indus-American Bank.”The merger will add approximately $235 million to the Company’s asset base, based on IAB’s assets as of March 31, 2017. Following completion of the merger, the Company will have total assets of over $2 billion, based on IAB’s and BCB’s respective assets as of March 31, 2017.  The merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals and IAB shareholder approval. The merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.Read MoreFinPro Capital Advisors, Inc. acted as financial advisor to BCB Bancorp, Inc., and its legal counsel was Covington & Burling LLP.  Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. acted as financial advisor to IA Bancorp, Inc., and its legal counsel was Windels, Marx, Lane & Mittendorf, LLP.About BCB Community BankBCB Community Bank operates 22 full-service branches in Bayonne, Carteret, Colonia, Edison, Hoboken, Fairfield, Holmdel, Jersey City, Lodi, Lyndhurst, Monroe Township, Rutherford, South Orange, Union and Woodbridge, New Jersey, and two branches in Staten Island, New York.Forward-looking Statements and Associated Risk FactorsThis release, like many written and oral communications presented by BCB Bancorp, Inc., and our authorized officers, may contain certain forward-looking statements regarding our prospective performance and strategies within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

BAYONNE, N.J., June  07, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BCB Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company" or "BCB"), Bayonne, NJ (NASDAQ:BCBP - News), the holding company for BCB Community Bank, has announced it has entered into a definitive merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement"), with IA Bancorp, Inc. ("IAB"), pursuant to which the Company will acquire IAB and its wholly owned subsidiary, Indus-American Bank.  Upon consummation of the merger, Indus-American Bank will merge with BCB Community Bank and will operate as a division of BCB Community Bank.  Following the closing of the merger, BCB will form an advisory board which will consist of current members of the IAB board of directors and other prominent community members.
Indus-American Bank, which has its headquarters in Edison, New Jersey, operates full-service branches in Edison, Jersey City, Parsippany and Plainsboro, New Jersey, and Hicksville, New York. Indus-American Bank was founded primarily to meet the banking needs of the South Asian-American community. Indus-American Bank specializes in core business banking products for small- to medium-sized companies, with an emphasis on real estate-based lending.
Mark D. Hogan, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, stated, "We are extremely excited and pleased to welcome Indus-American customers and employees to BCB. Our partnership with Indus-American is consistent with BCB's strategic plan of executing smart growth via expansions and organic branching. This transaction will allow the combined entities to further develop our existing markets in Jersey City and Edison, and will provide further opportunities in Parsippany, Plainsboro and Hicksville, New York, three new, attractive markets for BCB."
The total transaction value is approximately $20 million, including the assumption by BCB of approximately $7.5 million of IAB preferred stock, outstanding shares of IAB common stock of approximately 4.18 million and based on a 10-day volume weighted average price of BCB common stock. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, which both boards of directors have approved, IAB shareholders shall be entitled to elect to receive either 0.189 shares of BCB common stock or $3.05 in cash for each share of IAB common stock, subject to an overall allocation of exchanged IAB shares into 80% BCB common stock and 20% cash. The closing and the systems' conversion is anticipated to occur in the fourth quarter of 2017, subject to approval by IAB shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.  On a pro forma basis, the transaction is expected to be accretive to the Company's 2018 earnings by approximately 10% per share, with tangible book value per share dilution of approximately 1.3% and an earn-back period of approximately 1.2 years.
Anil Bansal, Chairman of the Board of Directors of IAB, said, "We believe our loyal Indus-American Bank customers and shareholders will greatly benefit from this merger. BCB is a true community bank, with a history of a very strong commitment to its customers and the communities it serves. This merger will bring expanded lending capacity, supplementary retail and business products and added capital, which should enable our combined organizations to better serve our customers, to continue growing in our marketplaces, and to further enhance shareholder value."
Thomas Coughlin, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank, added, "BCB is excited to be partnering with IAB and Indus-American Bank. Indus-American Bank's branch locations complement BCB's current locations. BCB will continue Indus-American Bank's commitment of service to its customers and its communities. The existing Indus-American branches will operate and be known as "BCB-Indus-American Bank, a division of BCB Community Bank," in recognition of the strong identity forged over the years by Indus-American Bank."
The merger will add approximately $235 million to the Company's asset base, based on IAB's assets as of March 31, 2017. Following completion of the merger, the Company will have total assets of over $2 billion, based on IAB's and BCB's respective assets as of March 31, 2017.  
The merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals and IAB shareholder approval. The merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Forward-looking Statements and Associated Risk FactorsThis release, like many written and oral communications presented by BCB Bancorp, Inc., and our authorized officers, may contain certain forward-looking statements regarding our prospective performance and strategies within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are including this statement for purposes of said safe harbor provisions. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies, and expectations of the Company, are generally identified by use of words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "project," "seek," "strive," "try," or future or conditional verbs such as "could," "may," "should," "will," "would," or similar expressions. Our ability to predict results or the actual effects of our plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from anticipated results.
In addition to factors previously disclosed in BCB's reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and those identified elsewhere in this document, the following factors among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance: ability to obtain regulatory approvals and meetother closing conditions to the merger, including approval by IAB shareholders on the expected terms and schedule; delay in closing the merger; difficulties and delays in integrating the IAB business or fully realizing cost savings and other benefits of the merger; business disruption following the merger; changes in asset quality and credit risk; the inability to sustain revenue and earnings growth; changes in interest rates and capital markets; inflation; customer acceptance of BCB products and services; customer borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices; customer disintermediation; the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives; competitive conditions; the inability to realize cost savings or revenues or to implement integration plans and other consequences associated with mergers, acquisitions and divestitures; economic conditions; and the impact, extent and timing of technological changes, capital management activities, and other actions of the Federal Reserve Board and legislative and regulatory actions and reforms.
Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.
Important Additional Information and Where to Find It

This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval. SHAREHOLDERS OF IAB ARE URGED TO READ THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND THE PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS REGARDING THE MERGER WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC BY BCB, AS WELL AS ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS TO THOSE DOCUMENTS, BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION.
