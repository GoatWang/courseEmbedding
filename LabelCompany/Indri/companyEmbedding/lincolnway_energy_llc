Inedible Corn Oil
An emerging co-product for the ethanol industry is inedible corn oil. During the distillation process, liquid is separated from the mash and partially dehydrated into syrup. Removing the crude oil from the syrup before it is mixed with distiller grains creates an additional co-product and revenue stream – inedible corn oil. The corn oil can be used by the biodiesel industry to produce ASTM biodiesel. In fact, biodiesel produced from inedible corn oil has the lowest carbon intensity score of any biodiesel feedstock. Inedible corn oil can also be sold to feed lots and poultry markets among others.

THE HISTORY AND FUTURE OF LINCOLNWAY  ENERGY
Lincolnway Energy, LLC was formed  on May 2004 to pool investors to build a name plate 50 million gallon per year  coal fired dry mill ethanol plant. Lincolnway Energy has been processing corn into fuel grade ethanol and  distillers’ grains at the ethanol plant since May 22, 2006. It is located in Nevada, Iowa in an area of  abundant corn production. The site was  chosen for its central proximity to an ample supply of feedstock, with a  location near a major national transportation corridor of Interstate 35 and US  Highway 30. It is adjacent to Union  Pacific’s Class 1 Rail Road. The site is  annexed by the City of Nevada with advantages of three phase electrical  service, ample and inexpensive water supply, waste water discharge, fire  protection and other municipal services. 
Lincolnway Energy began  extracting corn oil from the syrup which is generated in the production of ethanol in April 2008. In August 2010, Lincolnway Energy entered into an agreement with a third party to collect the carbon dioxide gas which is  produced as part of the fermentation process and converts the raw carbon  dioxide gas into a liquid carbon dioxide. Both of these co-products generate additional revenue for the company with minimal operating costs.
Lincolnway Energy strives to be  an efficient and low cost producer of ethanol. Growing demand will keep the ethanol industry growing and will help  assure a strong future for clean, renewable and domestically produced fuels  that will benefit the country. Lincolnway Energy wants to be a long term player to continue to make  this happen.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to:

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Management uses EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, to measure Lincolnway's financial performance and to internally manage its business. Management believes that EBITDA provides useful information to investors as a measure of comparison with peer and other companies. EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or cash flow as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. EBITDA calculations may vary from company to company. Accordingly, our computation of EBITDA may not be comparable with a similarly-titled measure of another company.  The following sets forth the reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA for the periods indicated:

Rayeman Elements sells RCD drying system to Lincolnway Energy 
By Rayeman Elements Inc.    | May 17, 2017



Rayeman Elements Inc., in conjunction with its partner Nationwide 5 LLC, has completed the sale of its second production unit to Lincolnway Energy of Nevada, Iowa.  Rayeman Elements, based in Berthoud, Colorado, has developed, designed, and manufactured a new, patented grain drying system, the Rayeman Compression Dryer, targeting the grain and grain co-products markets. 
Lincolnway Energy LLC, located in Nevada, Iowa, has been working to develop a high quality species specific animal feed, branded as PureStream Protein. This product will target the growing swine and poultry markets in Iowa. PureStream Protein is both higher in crude protein, and richer in the essential amino acids these animals need for growth than traditional DDG. The Rayeman Compression Dryer system is ideal for this kind of product; it is inherently a low heat process which will not denature the proteins in the product as can happen in some drying systems, and the RCD is scalable, so production volumes can grow with sales.
Eric Hakmiller, president of Lincolnway Energy said, “We first saw this system at the vendor exhibit floor of the FEW in 2016. We were very excited about the potential at the time and were one of the first to see the prototype when it was operational last fall.  Rayeman Elements and Nationwide 5 have been great to work with so far and we are looking forward to seeing PureStream Protein commercialized on this dryer system by the end of 2017.”
Mike Thomas, vice president and director of technology of Rayeman Elements, said, “Working with Lincolnway on this project has been a terrific experience and we are excited to help them achieve their ultimate goals in grain drying.”
The Rayeman Compression Dryer is a unique drying system for the industry. As wet grain goes in, the moisture in the grain meets two electrically heated, specially designed and patented screws inside a barrel. These screws intermesh with one another creating designated compression points that squeeze the water out of the grain, while simultaneously creating heat at low temperatures upon contact, and vaporizing the water within the grains at various flash points throughout the process. Additional heat is created naturally through shearing and compressing of the material from the rotating screws, causing this machine to conserve energy through self-generated low heat, and by squeezing water from the grain versus reaching heat of vaporization. The RCD process eliminates burning, and produces the highest nutritional value grain that is consistently a lighter, superior golden colored, more flowable grain; an attribute highly sought after in the business of grain exporting and feed.
In addition to the Rayeman Compression Dryer producing a superior quality grain, the required moisture levels are dialed in, meaning one has the flexibility to produce modified wets along the way, if desired. The RCD emits far lower VOCs, which reduces Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer requirements by as much as 66 percent, and makes EPA permitting easier. The RCD is explosion proof—providing unmatched safety and lower insurance rates. This technology offers a significantly smaller footprint than conventional dryers, and in comparison, a lower capital cost overall to purchase and operate—creating a win-win all around. 
Lincolnway Energy, an ethanol and grain processor since May of 2006, continually strives to seek out and implement the safest and most efficient, methods of production and has found all of that in the Rayeman Compression Dryer.  Lincolnway Energy and Rayeman Elements, together, are scheduled to have the dual drying systems fully operational by late fall of this year.
