Amica Mutual Insurance Company is a direct writer of personal lines insurance. The company, founded in 1907, is well known in the industry for its financial strength and for providing exceptional customer service to policyholders. They carry an A++ (Superior) rating from A.M. Best Company and have repeatedly been ranked #1 for customer service by a leading consumer publication. Amica employs over 3,000 people in 39 offices across the United States.
Amica's passion for delivering excellent customer service led to the decision to find a new policy administration, a new claims management system, and a billing management system that would have the flexibility to enable Amica to quickly respond to changes requested by the business, and provide an intuitive system for its customer service representatives and underwriters.
Amica started its journey with claims. The company selected ClaimCenter due to the system's functionality and ability to help them reach their goal of moving to an electronic claim file while increasing adjuster productivity. Amica is in production with Guidewire ClaimCenter for all claim transactions and activities across all of their lines. ClaimCenter now handles all new claims for Amica’s auto, homeowners, marine, and personal excess liability lines of business. Amica has a total of 2,500 active ClaimCenter users in-production with the system, including underwriters, support teams, and 1,100 claims professionals.
Amica is currently leveraging the technology skills acquired during its successful ClaimCenter project with its PolicyCenter implementation. PolicyCenter will help Amica more easily complete applications over the phone with customers, reduce CSR training times by roughly 50%, make product changes more quickly and capture a higher quality data for improved underwriting decisions.
In addition, Amica has most recently selected BillingCenter as its new billing management system for all of its lines of business in all states.as part of its continued dedication to customer excellence.












 


We selected BillingCenter due to our confidence in Guidewire’s architecture, the quality of its software and Guidewire’s track record of successful customers already running BillingCenter,” said Peter Moreau, vice president and chief information officer at Amica. “After experiencing the ease of use of the system as well the depth and breadth of its functionality firsthand, it was made clear to us that BillingCenter was the best fit for our objectives and would position us well for handling customer needs and preferences now and in the future.Peter Moreau, Vice President and Chief Information Officer, Amica Mutual Insurance CompanyOur decision to go with Guidewire PolicyCenter was based every bit as much on our positive past experience with Guidewire as it was on the strength of the PolicyCenter product. We believe in Guidewire’s ability to apply technology to effective business solutions, and we were impressed with the advances made in the latest version of PolicyCenter.Lou Peranzi, Senior Vice President, Information Technology, Amica Mutual Insurance CompanyClaimCenter was integrated with more than 20 internal and external systems requiring varying degrees of sophistication. Guidewire’s technology, integration approach, our use of agile, and the combined talents of the project team made these integrations as smooth as they could be. Our IT team is now self-sufficient and is readily making system changes and integrations on its own.Robert Bergeron, Section Manager, Integration Competency Center, Amica Mutual Insurance Company

                Terrible for home insurance. Very rude rep. Asking for an evidence of insurance dec page is like trying to obtain the secrets of the pyramids! They require 3 days turn time, then they ask for all kids of documents, then they review it over the next 3 days and ask for more info. It's like they do not want the business. State farm, Allstate, USAA are all able to send over a dec page SAME DAY requested. Amica's service is horrible, and they are far from the only insurer in the marketplace. They could take some lessons from the aforementioned companies.… read more

                I had Amica auto insurance for years. I was side-swiped on the highway and Amica did next to nothing to investigate and said in side-impact accidents it was difficult to tell who was at fault. The OTHER driver's insurance (Geico) looked at both cars and said their policy holder was clearly at fault. Amigo was willing to raise my rates rather than look into the accident. Geico is now my insurer since I know they do what they are being paid to do, unlike Amica.… read more

                Amica is the best.  A few auto claims, one serious at fault, and all have been handled timely and professionally. Although my rate was justifiably raised, I would stick with them as long as they'll have me. You get what you pay for is true in this case!

                I had an Amica homeowner's policy for a year. Toward the end of the year I was looking for a new auto insurer so I went with Amica. Shortly after signing up a new auto policy I was told that Amica would have to cancel my homeowner's policy because I told the agent that I was going to be travelling a lot over the course of the year for business, and they said that if I wasn't in my home for more than 11 months of the year they couldn't insure me. They immediately stopped returning my calls and began to treat me like I'd somehow attempted to deceive them. They refused to offer me any other policies, and overall kept misquoting me back to myself when I called in to ask why I was being refused a policy. Overall I felt really abused by Amica and it was a really terrible experience. I'll never have another policy with them again, and strongly recommend against them for customer service.… read more

                Amica is the pinnacle of car insurance and customer support. I got in an accident and reported my claim like anyone else. To my surprise, I was contacted by a very friendly agent just hours later to check in on me and see how I was doing. After seeing how I was doing, he then proceeded to talk business, something I appreciated. Amica was prompt in their problem resolution, as they were able to get me a check for the damages in just a few weeks and made sure I was back on the road with a new car in just a few days. What separates Amica from a company like GEICO is it's unparalleled customer experience. Each rep really takes the time to know you and your situation and it really makes the difference. GREAT company!… read more

                The customer service representative that I spoke to when deciding on car insurance coverage was very personable and answered all of my questions in a clear and effective manner.  She was knowledgeable and followed up on information requests in a timely manner.  Overall, I like the value that I get for the cost as compared to my previous auto insurance provider (MetLife).

                Everything was great when I first started car insurance with Amica. They had a great rate. The sign up was easy and the employees were very kind. Now, fast forward to a year later. My rates have nearly doubled. I will cancelling the policy soon. They did not even let me know it was going to be increasing until my bank account was about to be charged. I called and tried to negotiate a lower rate but they were rude and acted like I was crazy for asking such a thing. You have now lost a customer to another company!… read more

                I had Amica car insurance for about two years. I got in a minor accident, and they handled the claim by sending someone to the house to take a look at the car, and then sending a check for the repair costs. The check was supposed to cover the costs of the repair minus the $500 deductible. Unfortunately that was not the case, and it was over $100 short for the two repair shops they recommend. My new insurance company just tells you where to go and covers the cost. In addition, we were on automatic renewal. After two years, they sent a notice in the mail indicating that we needed to sign a few documents to continue coverage. I forgot to sign and send them in, and was dropped. When we called customer service, they were less than helpful, and proceeded to offer us the same coverage at a higher rate due to interruption of service. We left and were happy that we did!!… read more

                We researched for weeks before changing to Amica for our homeowners insurance because all in all it was the best rated insurance company out there. And now we are happy we did because have had several home insurance claims since changing to them and they paid willingly. We have great peace of mind knowing we are with a highly rated, dependable company with very reasonable rates. We plan to stay customers of Amica for a very long time to come. We just recently changed to them for our car insurance and are just as satisfied.… read more

                My husband and I have been customers of Amica for one year and could not be more satisfied with their services. We decided to switch our homeowner's insurance because our previous company was increasingly difficult to contact, losing our information, and had overall poor communication with us as customers. Amica's customer service representatives were personable, friendly, and highly available to my husband and I, clearly explaining every step during the process of switching over. Amica made an appointment with us, that was convenient to our schedule, to send an agent out to our house. This was an aspect of their service that I was particularly happy with because we were able to speak with the agent face to face. I highly recommend Amica to anyone looking for an insurance company that goes the extra mile to make sure their customers are well taken care of.… read more

                After shopping around for homeowner's insurance, a friend had mentioned that Amica had really low rates, yet a high quality of service. I called them, at 9pm, and they were open and available. I was worried they'd be closed like some companies. I talked to a guy named Ben. He went over all of the information that I needed. He also took the time to answer any and all questions that I had. Then, we discussed their available plans,, optional coverages as well as discounts. He really made sure to get us the most discounts he could. He was very flexible with the rates, and he helped me choose the best coverage for my needs. Their customer service is amazing. They are open 24/7. They answer emails and calls promptly. Their rates are amazing!! And to top it off, when there is an issue with my home, they are quick to help me get what I need to fix it! I would recommend them to anyone!!… read more

                I have been a customer of Amica Insurance for over 13 years. During that time I have only filed three claims, all for broken windshields. Amica has always been very customer friendly and it shows with their interactions. They have always been courteous and professional when I have needed to call their toll free number for customer service. Amica's website is also very user friendly and enables me to conduct all of my business with them over the internet. I will continue to use Amica for my auto insurance needs for the foreseeable future.… read more

                I've never had an insurance company with a more responsive customer service department. My only complaint is cost. They are one of the pricier auto insurance companies out there. However, after being rear ended, the others guy's insurance called me, I called my agent just to let them know, not really expecting them to do anything. The next day Amica sent out their own adjuster and the adjuster wrote me a check on the spot and said they would take care of everything else.… read more

                I was referred to Amica at a home buying seminar. Amica  is a great insurance company. The rates for home insurance do not increase as much as other insurance companies each year. My rate increases only $10-$20 per year. Amica's customer service is excellent. Amica keeps me well informed of my policy and any changes with the company. I have a reasonable $500 deductible. I have no plans to ever change insurance companies.

                After getting married, my wife and I decided to shop around for prices on a joint car insurance plan to cover both of our vehicles. We checked online for quotes from Geico and Progressive, but were not happy with the rates they were quoting us. Shortly thereafter, I received a flyer in the mail from Amica; they guaranteed to offer a comparable insurance plan for a cheaper rate than other companies. After a short call, I was able to purchase my plan and had insurance the next day. The representative on the phone was very patient as I had to track down the VIN numbers for the cars, and she was very knowledgeable about the products they offered.I have yet to send a claim through them, but at this point, I'm certain it would be a smooth process.… read more

                I had homeowner's insurance in Texas with Liberty Mutual, but they jacked up my rate, so I decided to switch and go with the company that had the best rates. At the time, that was Amica. The application process was a bit onerous, but the customer service support was excellent. And they'll even send us a dividend check at the end of the policy term, just for being customers! They are kind of picky as to who they insure, though, and if you're in an older house they will want to fully inspect it. All in all, though, I'm glad we switched.… read more

                I have Amica Home insurance for my rental. I find the rates to be fairly competitive and reasonable for me as a single woman. I have certain antiques and personal valuables that I cherish and they have helped me to figure out how to protect them in the event of a loss. Their customer service is excellent with very patient and knowledgable reps that provide you with many choices and levels. Mine has medical payments included and I find that very desireable as well as relocation reimbursement in the event of a fire or severe damage or unhealthy conditions. Vandalism is covered and I hope I never need it but have it just in case. The online features are excellent and flexible. I am very happy with Amica… read more

                I switched to my husband's Amica policy when we got married last year, and I was impressed from the start! First off, getting the quote and making the switch were incredibly easy. I just contacted them online and chatted with a representative. It literally took 5 minutes and we were done. Their quote was almost half the price of my current policy which was a pleasant surprise. I also appreciate the fact that they don't use pressure tactics to sell me products I don't want. I'm very happy with Amica and don't see myself going anywhere else - ever.… read more

                We've been insured (car insurance) with Amica Insurance for roughly 7 years now. I remember getting into my first auto accident (which was the fault of the other driver), and Amica was the company who handled my claim. Everything was done so quickly and efficiently - it was as if the accident never even happened. Everything was settled within literally two weeks from the time of the accident to the time of when everything was done and filed. Amica is a very trusted Insurance Company in the New England area, and living in Massachusetts it was a no-brainer to sign up with this Northeast company.… read more

                Amica was at least the 5th auto insurance company I have done business with through my nearly 40 years of driving.I became acquainted with Amica because I was tried of the constant price increases of other insurers I had been with. I compared just about every auto insurance company that was available in my state, and Amica offered rates that were significantly lower than all of the rest.That was about five years ago and I have been happy with them ever since. I have since moved to another state and Amica made it quite easy, and my rates actually went down.I've only had to file one claim for when my son's car was totaled a couple of years ago when he will still living with us. Luckily it was 100% the fault of the other driver, and his insurance paid more than enough for my son to buy a comparable car. Amica made the whole process very easy and kept me informed through it all.… read more

                Amica home insurance really does what they say they would do. I had them for a year, and there was an electrical surge from the cable company and killed my new HDTV. I was so upset, because getting the cable company to admit to wrong was not going to happen. So I called Amica and within seven days I had a deposit in my checking account to purchase a new HDTV. They are awesome and I would never leave them.… read more

                I used Amica for awhile for auto insurance. I liked the ease of use- everything can be done online which was good for me as I often travel outside of the U.S. and need to be able to access all of my financial accounts online. There is also a dedicated 24 hour hotline for any emergencies. They also offer an accident forgiveness plan but I have to say it didn't work well for me as I felt I would have to be on a probationary period for quite some time before the forgiveness part came into play. Overall I think it is a decent company with great customer service and speedy replies.… read more

                This is my first cycle with Amica, but already, I am LOVING it! The application process was quick and easy and was done over the phone with a live person! When I have questions, I call and get to speak with a live person! They offer many more discounts than other companies, such as the 'tenure' discount and my monthly fee was over $60 less than other companies were quoting. The best part, the unique structure of company allows for a return of your premiums if the company makes a profit - it's like you're really in it together!!… read more

                I have been with Amica for auto insurance for about 6 years and homeowners insurance for about 4 years. In both cases, Amica offered better coverage for less money than their competitors. Combine this with the fact that they receive high ratings for service from JD Power, and it's easy to see why choosing Amica was an wise decision.In the case where I had to file a claim for auto hail damage, dealing with claims was an easy process. I notified Amica of the damage online and they followed up with a phone call to say that they would send an adjuster to my workplace to do an estimate. The adjuster did the estimate and I had a check in the mail shortly after that. The check covered the damage easily, so I didn't have to call and ask for more money. It was a very satisfying process overall, or at least as satisfying as having hail damage repaired can be.I would highly recommend Amica to others.… read more

                I've had Amica insurance for over 14 years and could not be happier with the level of service and value they provide. The representatives are always friendly, knowledgeable, and thorough whenever I've had to call about a question or to file a claim. We've changed states a few times since we've had coverage through Amica, and they've always made the switch easy, even helping to find the best value rates for our new living situations. The reps always explain all the benefits of the coverage they offer, and provide quick answers or followup calls to questions I've had. Filing claims has been easy, and most of the time the claims are resolved within a day or two. I highly recommend Amica!… read more

                In my experience, car insurance is mostly there as a measure of your responsibility on the road. As such, in order to mitigate your impact on others on the road, it is essential to have a good liability coverage in your car insurance. I found my Amica auto insurance coverage to have a large choice of liability coverage. I like the fact that I can find the type of coverage that satisfies me. However, I am not so happy with the price I get from Amica nor am I happy with the deductible on the coverage for my own car.… read more

                I had Amica's auto insurance for two years and was very pleased with them, though they (thankfully for me) didn't get fully tested by me having to make an accident claim. Their nearest office is 20 minutes away, and most importantly for me at the time and even now, their rates were the cheapest that anyone had to offer. That's what made me sign up with them. If their rates crop up again as being the cheapest the next time I want to switch insurance companies, I won't hesitate to pick Amica again.… read more

                I have been using Amica for my car and homeowner's insurance for over five years. I recently had my first claim. After the recent snow someone side swiped my car while it was parked on the street during the night. I called them and they had an insurance adjuster out to see the damage in just one day. They did not try to force me to use a certain repair shop versus another. The insurance adjuster was very candid about my questions concerning repairs shops. Amica provided me with a rental car, and my car was fixed in five days. I was pleased with the process and definitely recommend them.… read more

                Amica is a big employer in my home state so it feels right to do business with them. When I bought a house, I got a quote for homeowners insurance through Amica. Their rates were comparable to other companies, but the fact that they were local made me feel better about doing business with them. When I called their customer service department, the agents I spoke to were pleasant and helpful. Any problems I have had were minor and easily resolved. At this point, my plan is to stay with Amica.… read more

                I have been with Amica Insurance for over 16 years now. When my husband and I got married I switched to Amica Insurance from another car insurance place. Over the years we have great service. Thankfully we have only been involved in one accident. The other person was at fault. My husband was not hurt, but his car was. Amica’s customer service department was awesome. They took care of the claim right away. He was able to get a great rental car for the time his vehicle would be in the shop. They handled dealing with the other driver’s insurance and we had no problems. They say you can measure the value of an insurance company by the way they take care of your claims and that is definitely true. Amica you are great.… read more

                I have been with Amica for years now, I look every year but can't seem to find a better rate- unless it's a promotional rate which I don't want to mess with. I haven't had any claims so I can't say how they are with that but if it's anything like the customer service they provide I would assume it's awesome! I have switched my coverages from time to time and they handle things right way and are always quick to send me a check (or bill) to get all squared away. The online interface is very nice, I pay my bills quickly and easily. I also like the fact the policy is a year at a time, seems to prevent the insurance from going up too quickly as it seems like insurance rates always rise. Overall I would really recommend Amica Insurance for auto, for home insurance however they did give me a quote and about 3 or 4 months later I got another quote that was a lot higher than another company could give that to me for. I will check again however because Amica has always been good to me.… read more

                I am no longer with them since I moved to Florida (they don't offer coverage down here) but I have nothing but good things to say. The only gripe I have is that the sign up process (at least as of 2-1/2 years ago) is really, really tedious. They examine EVERYTHING. But as long as you have decent credit and a good history, they seem pretty open. Other than that, their customer service is amazing and they make it really easy to file a claim. They were definitely on the pricier side but it was worth it to get the great service. Compared to the company I've switched to for my home in Florida, Amica's customer service was far better. They also have a mobile app which is really convenient. I would definitely recommend this company.… read more

                It was so easy to switch! I got the best deal out of all the companies that I researched, blowing away the 'mainstream' and TV companies. I got such a deal on higher coverage than anyone else in my family. The sales rep was very nice and we did everything online. My policy is fantastic and it is so affordable and easy to use. I am glad I switched and didn't let myself be sucked in by TV ads. I searched for the best regarded car insurance company in the country, based on reviews, and I found it. Amica is the company I recommend for ease, helpfulness, cost, and coverage. Amica means friend in Latin and they truly are your friend.… read more

                We use Amica insurance to cover our cars and for renter's insurance and the experience has been great. Granted we have not had the need to make any claims but just from their customer service dealing with them to add/remove/make changes/daily dealings – we are very satisfied. They have a mobile app, good website, and you can even do online chats with customer service which has been very helpful when we need to do small changes to the account. I would definitely use them for any other insurance products that they offer if we needed them. They have a great service and very good prices as well!… read more

                Amica insurance has been my family's provider for several years now. I got my own policy because of my mother's recommendation, and I couldn't be happier! The customer service is outstanding, and my agent has always been prompt to get back to me. The one claim I've filed was a breeze and the matter was taken care of very quickly. I've had to use the free towing a few times for an old car I had and every time they have reached me in 30 minutes or less. I don't have experience with any other policy than auto coverage, but based off of that alone I would highly recommend all of their services.… read more

                I have had Amica as my car insurance provider for a little over a year and so far I have been very happy with everything. I have yet to file a claim, so I cannot comment on that aspect, but the application process was a breeze and I have always had excellent experiences with customer service, both on the phone and via online chat. I contacted them a few months ago in an attempt to add my wife to my plan but I was told that she was ineligible because she had not been a licensed driver for their minimum of three years. However, I spoke with my agent and was able to have them bend the rules for me a bit and allow her to be added to my insurance for the few months before she'd officially been licensed for three years. This flexibility and the desire to help me as a customer really made me realize that I had made the right choice in choosing my car insurance company.… read more

                Of all the companies I've dealt with for auto insurance, Amica takes the cake. The cost wasn't prohibitive, but what kept me coming back was always the customer service. Their representatives would bend over backwards to make sure any problem was given a fair solution. They understand that accidents happen, and that the time after a collision is a very stressful time. My agent was very good at explaining the process in a way that never made me feel patronized. If I had a boat or owned my home, I've been told that the package deals are totally worth it. I've recommended Amica to many of my friends, and none have ever been dissatisfied with the results. Great company.… read more

                This is my second time around with Amica for renter's insurance. I was very pleased with the company the first time and so far I am equally pleased this time. I applied for the coverage in December 2012. The application process was conducted completely online, which was quite an advantage for me as I am disabled and homebound. (My one quibble is that I was not informed upfront that the policy was non-participating which means that it does not pay dividends as my first policy with them did.) I had a potential claim, and the process was handled professionally. (In the end I did not need to file a claim, so I cannot speak for their claims handling.) I would recommend Amica to anyone without reservations.… read more

                I recently purchased a condo and had to get insurance. I looked around the net and asked some friends if they had any ideas. One of my friends told me about Amica Insurance. I looked them up online and saw that they were rated as one of the top companies in this field. I was instantly interested in learning more. Once I searched their website and saw what they could offer me, I was sold. I made an appointment with an agent and discussed what I wanted from them. She was very eager to help me with that. She went step by step with me with all that I needed to know about the company. In the end it was enough for me to sign on dotted line with them. I was impressed by her service and what her company would offer me. Definitely look into them if you’re in the market for home insurance anytime soon.… read more

I moved while opening the credit card account so I did not receive statements on time (or maybe they did not send it to me). Called and got $17 back. As for the rest, I...show more

I have used Travelers insurance for my entire adult life and I love the service they have provided for me throughout. I have been involved in two accidents both not my fault and they went to bat for me in both. I felt very protected throughout the ordeal and I can't begin to describe the emotional toll a serious accident can have, they were very helpful and kind. I enjoy working with them and I will be a customer of theirs for life.… read more

Farmers has been our carrier for over a decade. We have had two major instances when our home incurred flood damage (once from a storm, and the other from an AC leak). On both occasions, the adjustor was at our home the next day, and the clean-up crew arrived the next day (on the second occasion, he was there that evening.) Farmers remained in touch throughout our ordeal to make sure everything had been take care of accordingly. I have definitely recommended Farmers to friends an family, and people are always appreciative when I do!… read more

Kentucky Farm Bureau has been my homeowner insurance provider since I bought my home in 2008. We never had any claims until June of 2014 after our house exploded due to a gas explosion. We lost everything we owned but at least walked away with our lives. That very same day, our insurance agent came by and was very reassuring that she would help us in any way she could. So, the next day we went to the insurance office and met with the adjuster. She was fairly nice but not very experienced. Ours was her first fire/explosion claim. Because of her lack of experience, I think that slowed the whole process down. Not to mention the ladies in the office and the agent were no help whatsoever with any questions we had. It was all up to the adjuster who was only available once a week and very hard to reach on the phone. It was a frustrating experience but in the end, everything worked out. I still use Kentucky Farm Bureau as my insurance provider.… read more

I have good and bad experiences with my car insurance company which is Nationwide Auto Insurance. A good experience I have had with them is one day at a local gas station I accidentally backed into a parked car. It was a pretty good dent so I gave the other party my insurance info. They contacted me right away and told me that they will take care of everything. All they asked of me was to record a statement explaining what happened and they contacted me that same week with the results. Even though I was found as the one at fault they did not give me any stress they immediately took care of the accident and notified me about how much coverage I still had with the company.… read more

I signed up for Cooke home insurance.and was ultimately very disappointed with my experience. The agent came out to my home to look at the property and meanwhile I filled out all the appropriate paperwork and received my login information online. I even received my first bill to pay. The price was right and everything appeared to be efficient. I assumed that I was in business and my home was now insured against damage. About one month later, I received a note telling me that my insurance was canceled because my home was not suitable to be insured with them. This was a very disappointing experience because they gave deceiving messages and even billed me. I would not recommend Cooke insurance at this time.… read more

When I was shopping around for car insurance so I could get away from one of the big box insurers I came across Nationwide. Not only are they ads quite catchy but their service is incredibly exceptional whether it's their prices or the quality of customer service. I ended up inquiring about a quote for my customized car insurance policy online and found that their prices were much better than the big chain insurers while offering me better protection. I confirmed my car insurance policy purchase over the phone with one of the most friendly and helpful customer service agents I have ever dealt with. I would definitely suggest anyone looking for car insurance to check into Nationwide.… read more

I've used several of the big providers, but my experience with Nationwide has been by far the best. In this day and age where everything is so automated and competitive; their attention to detail and customer service responsiveness is by far the best. The representative tailored everything without pushing an agenda. The Accident Forgiveness program is what drew me to check them out in the first place. This along with the Vanishing Deductible are features I can truly use to my advantage. I would highly recommend using Nationwide for any of your insurance needs.… read more

When I was looking for vehicle insurance, Nationwide was one of the companies I researched. Their website let me customize an auto insurance policy that would fit me and the pocketbook. I liked the Vanishing Deductible and Accident Forgiveness they offered and the rate I was quoted (online) was going to fit right in. I am very thorough when it comes to what I spend my money on, so I did check into a couple more. Being a senior citizen has added a few perks (discounts) that I have a tendency to forget about, but when asking Nationwide if they offered any, I was told no. So I was able to find another insurance company that gave me what I needed, for a better price and only raised monthly payment by $5 when I added 2nd vehicle. Nationwide is a good company, but they ended up being a little pricey for me.… read more

I have been a business customer of Progressive for about 5 years now. When our broker found this policy for us, I was initially a little nervous about accepting it- I had a homeowners policy with Progressive at one time and did not have a very good experience. However, I have been incredibly satisfied with my experience this time around. Progressive's website makes it easy to review your policy, make payments and/or claims, and even print new or additional insurance cards. Their customer service operators are always knowledgeable and friendly, and someone is available to answer my questions 24-7. Their rates are lower than any others we have checked with, and there has never been an issue as we have had to frequently change drivers and vehicles listed on our policy.… read more

I have been a customer of New York Central Mutual for my homeowners insurance ever since we closed on our house in late 2009. To date I have been extremely pleased with the policy. To start the rates seem very affordable for the level of coverage we are getting and there have never been any surprise policy increases. Additionally, I was able to add more liability coverage without any headaches and without seeing a drastic rate increase.… read more

I have been using USAA for my auto insurance for almost 15 years. Although I routinely shop around I have yet to find better rates for me and my wife. I commute over 80 miles daily in the Washington, DC area. We do have long and clean driving records so I know that helps our rates tremendously. USAA's online tolls are easy to use and allow you to tweak your policy to meet your needs and budget. You can enter a proposed change in coverage and it will give you the new rate right away. I used this to increase my deductible and increase my liability coverage just a couple of years ago and it allowed me to hone in on an amount of coverage with a payment I could live with. At first I paid every six months to take advantage of a discount but eventually the allowed monthly payments for the same premium. The automatically debit my bank account for the premium each month so there is never a missed payment and resulting late fee or lapse in coverage. It has been a decade or so since my last claim, but they responded quickly and fairly with settlement. If you are a veteran or family member of one I highly recommend you check out USAA for all your insurance needs.… read more

I have had great experiences with my Nationwide Policy. They are very knowledgeable and kind I can always call and expect the best customer service. Adding vehicles is so easy and they never make me pay upfront, it is added to next bill (monthly installments). I had to have my windshield repaired and it was free and the company they use drove to my place of work and fixed it on the spot all without charge. Premiums are very reasonable and you can rest assure that you have great coverage. Its the best company and coverage that I have ever had. I dont currently use them now because of relocation and expenses but when I had them I loved it. I will one day use them again as soon as possible.… read more

I have AAA auto insurance, and I find it to be excellent. I have long been a loyal AAA member, enjoying the benefits of roadside assistance and various retail discounts, that I thought it made sense to scope them out as an insurance provider. I like that they gave me a competitive rate and took the time to describe the details of exactly what I would be getting on my policy. I have a few minor accidents here and there, and my rates have stayed low, and the coverage they’ve provided has been great.… read more

I have had State Farm since I started driving many, many years ago! Perhaps they are a bit more expensive than many of the cut-rate insurers, but I find it comforting to know that my agent will personally take my calls 24/7 (and fortunately, have never had to do it, but he has assured me time and time again that it's ok to do so). In addition, when I did have an accident a while back, I wasn't keen on purchasing a new vehicle and having car payments; State Farm got my car repaired and I continue to drive that same car almost 75,000 miles later!… read more

We used Traveler when we had our business for liability insurance. The rates were very reasonable and competitive. Customer service was available when needed, which was often, as we had to produce certificates of insurance in very short time spans when we were doing some projects. Was very satisfied with their service. We were easily able to get the certificates as need with various certificate holders named, which was very important for us to be able to continue doing business. Never had to file a claim with them, but they were always professional and courteous when in all of our dealings with them.… read more

I currently use Arcadia for my car insurance. Billing started out around 107 a month which was perfect for me, and then after a few months they lowered my payments to 95. I was pleased with this action and haven't had any problems so far with my plan. I highly recommend Arcadia for those with newer vehicles since they give you discounts based on the vehicle you buy and more. I've had other insurance companies in the past try to scam me over and raise my monthly payments after a week, but I've had Arcadia for 6 months now and have loved every minute of it.… read more

My homeowner's insurance is with Tower Hill Insurance. I was assigned this company after Allstate dropped my policy - I live in Florida and Allstate chose to no longer insure due to hurricane risk. Despite this, I have had no problems with this company. I have put in one claim when my air conditioner was damaged due to a power surge. After this claim, everything was handled professionally, and I received excellent, quick customer service. I definitely would recommend them to anyone who is looking for insurance for their home. I will definitely continue to renew my homeowner's policy with Tower Hill Insurance.8… read more

I've had Farmer's insurance for many years now. Though I haven't had many incidents where I've needed them thankfully, there were always available when I did! When my car was backed over (Not into but over!) by a truck up to the middle of the hood, they got me in a stunning rental car right away. I first had Farmers through being on my mothers policy, but I chose to continue with them on my own because it was so simple to branch off! I highly recommend Farmer's for their personal care of your insurance needs.… read more

I was using Direct General auto insurance but since then I have switched. I noticed that I could get insurance cheaper at a different insurance company. I was satisfied with the services that I received from Direct General but, saving a few dollars was more important when shopping for coverage. Direct General has been very convenient and has always provided me with good customer service. Once one of my vehicles were stolen and Direct General got involved very quickly. Everything was taken care of immediately and all ended well. If it was not time for a renewal I would probably still be with Direct General.… read more

I use Liberty Mutual as my home insurance provider, and I have been very happy with them. A few friends of mine work for the company, and I originally signed up because they offered me a deal I couldn’t refuse. They were the first ones to help me through the process, and then they passed me along to helpful customer service representatives who very thoroughly went over any questions that I had. This was especially helpful because insurance policies can be difficult to understand navigate. Premiums and deductibles are also fairly low on my plan even though I have substantial coverage.… read more

I've done business with Farmer's Insurance in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma for many years, specifically with Dick Baze and later Jason Childs after Dick retired. Overall, I had a good experience with both of them, and I'd recommend doing business with them if you're in the area. I found them easy to work with, and it was nice to have the option to electronically print off the forms rather than waiting for the mail, though I'm sure that most if not all insurance companies have that option at this point.… read more

I was recently hit by a "hit and run" while parked in front of my apartment. One of my neighbors left a note on my car (I contacted the authorities) and the matter was resolved within 48 hrs.

In the past I have had a hard time finding a company that would insure my home at an affordable rate since it is an older home.

I used to be a member of Farmers Insurance. I was a member for over 7 years with no accidents or claims. I had 2 cars with full coverage on both of them. Not just liability,but FULL coverage. My wife was in an accident at no fault of her own. This happened on the weekend,we had the car towed to a dealer (the car was only 2 years old and we always had the dealer do the maintenance) so they could fix the damage. We both work so having a car for both of us was essential. I got a rental car for my wife,the dealer said it would be about 1 week to fix the problem. On Monday I contacted my agent,whom I will not disclose,and he said that "FARMERS doesn't allow the dealer to fix the damage because it is too expensive AND that they would have to approve the rental charges" Not,are you okay? but straight to the expenses that they would have to put out. I advised that the dealership already has the car and we have a rental car. He said that they would not pay for all the charges but would try to get us a discount. I was so upset that I hung up the phone and called another insurance company right then. Of course they couldn't help me with this claim...but I did switch over all my accounts to them (my cars and home). I eventually did get my wife's car situation all taken care of with Farmers,but it was such a hassle that I will never recommend this company to anyone.… read more

I have been a Geico customer for over 7 years.  I have had car insurance with them the whole 7 years, also had Motorcycle insurance with them for about 3 years and now have my renters insurance with them.  I have shopped around and have always found Geico to have the best price with the best multi car, renters insurance discount.  I would highly recommend them to anyone in the market for new insurance.

We recently switched our home and auto insurance to Progressive. We were hesitant leaving a local company with agents we knew, but after seeing how much we could actually save with Progressive, keeping the same coverage, it was a no-brainer for us to switch. We have been happy with the simplicity in them taking over our escrow account at our mortgage bank, and the amount of communication we have received has been perfect.

I have used Progressive Insurance for many years. I previously used another nationally advertised company that hits you over the head with advertising featuring a lizard, but found them over-priced and unresponsive to my needs. Progressive is consistently the lowest priced option for me, has excellent customer service, and is there when I need them.

I have used Liberty Mutual Insurance company for both of my cars for the last 5 years or so. They always seem to have with the lowest rates and the customer service is amazing. We had a claim and they took care of it so quickly and with no hassle, my rate didn't even go up after it. When I was having some financial difficulty and was late with my premium one month, they were so understanding and helpful. The only way I would switch companies is if I got a quote that was a LOT lower than what I'm currently playing.… read more

I have never had an issue with American Family Insurance. A while back I had an issue with the law and my initial insurance dropped me. American Family was able to renew my insurance and gave me incentives to never have such an issue again. Since then, my insurance has been delightfully unnoticeable. If you set up a recurring payment, they will remind you of the amount due before removing it from your account and that is perfectly enough for me. I would highly recommend it to anyone thinking of getting insurance.… read more

Geico rates are pretty reasonable actually. They have some of the lower rates out there so the commercials are not a sham. My husband and I saved on our insurance and he has a lot of tickets! Also we needed more time to pay and they worked with us, huge plus. So I think they are great.

American Family Insurance is a good company.  They have competitive prices and excellent customer service.  Their website is easy to navigate, and very informative.  My husband and I have had car insurance policies since 2001.  In 2004, we adopted our son and needed peace of mind.  Our representative helped us obtain the life insurance policies we needed.

I had Esurance for over a year. I needed full coverage and it was difficult to find an affordable premium. Esurance provided an affordable premium in return for a commitment of monthly automatic payments. It was a good trade-off. Customer service was also pleasant and helpful. I also felt comfort with knowing that I had first time accident forgiveness. Unfotunately, Esurance raised my rate when my premium was updated. I decided to cancel my policy. I now carry Safe-Auto which is not the most desirable insurance but it is the most affordable for my full-coverage needs. I plan on staying with them as long as they keep my rate consistent. It is difficult to find that in today's market.… read more

In January of this year (2015) I desperately needed car insurance and I didn't have much money, I never do, so after spending a couple of days looking around I went with Safe-Auto. They give minimal legal coverage at a decent price, my payments came out to $50 a month...at first. After the first $50 payment I received a letter in the mail from Safe-Auto telling me that my rate was going up to $107 for no reason that I could decipher. If it weren't for that I'd still be with them, as everything else about the company is decent, though my experience was short.… read more

In the summer of 2013, I needed insurance for my newly purchased Honda Civic. The enrollment for Primerica Financial Services Inc. was fairly easy. I talked to one of their representatives and they gave me the insurance policy, I accepted and everything went smoothly since then. I never had a problem with this insurance company. Although, I would appreciate it if their prices were lower.

American Family Insurance is a smaller company, but they are very good for car, business, home and life insurance. They have great prices that are easy to fit into your budget. The customer service makes you feel like a "real person", so to speak; when I needed to talk to someone about an insurance problem or had a question, I got a real person on the phone who understood what I was looking for. If you're looking for an affordable insurance company that doesn't treat their customers like a number, then I would highly recommend American Family.… read more

At my previous place of employment, I did business with Ameriprise Financial. Having used other insurance companies in the past, I can say that they do not offer the most superior service. When dealing with their customer service team, it was difficult to get a straight answer, and I always felt that they were trying to find ways to make us pay more money.

Over the years I have been insured by State Farm and Allstate. I never had a claim nor any form of traffic violation yet my bill continued to go up and up. A friend of mine suggested I check into GEICO and I have never been happier. The service is outstanding, the online reps do a fantastic job taking care of any policy holder needs and absolutely no one can match their rates. I constantly get notices from other carriers advertising savings of hundreds of dollars annually. I looked into a couple a few months back and discovered my GEICO rates at almost 50% less then their competition. I will be with GEICO until I leave this planet!… read more

I previously had home owners insurance with Erie Insurance. It was difficult to obtain coverage at the time because I owned a dog that was a Rottweiler mix - they had many breed restrictions. I was finally able to get the insurance, however I feel the rates were too high for the amount of coverage I received. I now have a much less costly plan through my credit union with a higher amount of coverage and no dog breed restrictions.… read more

I have AAA auto insurance and they've been a very reliable and somewhat affordable provider. When I have a car problem they can usually get a tow truck driver out to me in about five minutes. I get three free service calls a year. All and all I feel well protected when driving with AAA. Because I drive an older car, my yearly payment is under seven hundred dollars which I find manageable. They mail me any information about my account and there's a number for emergencies.… read more

I have Nationwide Insurance for renters coverage and it is...decent. Honestly, their prices are a little higher than I have been quoted elsewhere, and I am probably going to change companies pretty soon here. The only issue of real significance I have had happen was when they told me that I had to pay at lease $30 a month because I did not set up a bank account with them to automatically withdraw from.

I really enjoy Safe Auto because of the adequate and speedy and reliable customer service.

I couldn't be happier with this insurance company and I feel like my monthly premium is reasonable since I am school teacher.

I have used Country Financial for my home insurance since I purchased my home 4 1/2 years ago. Not only were they the lowest price, but they are very quick to respond when you have a claim! We had what is called a hundred year flood. The entire southern end of Illinois was flooded. Our town was even locked in by water. We couldn't get out. The National Guard had to bring in supplies and help us. It was so bad it was declared a national disaster area by the government. There were literally thousands of claims to work on in our area when it was over. Country Companies had my claim handled and I had a check in my hand within 2 weeks!… read more

I've had Farmers Insurance for an incredibly long time and it's been grouped with several other vehicles that my family owns. The local office is cute and our main staffer is incredibly friendly and helpful with everything. We had a rock hit one of our front windshields on the highway earlier this year and it took a small chip of the glass and as well leaving a few very small cracks. They actually offered a service to have someone come out and seal the cracks and small chip instead of raising rates for an incident. Saved us money on replacement and on insurance!… read more

The original reason I chose Liberty Mutual was because they gave me the lowest rate.  After my first year with them and a couple of car lock outs and one fender bender, my rate was still lower with them than any other company.  The customer service is extraordinary and they work with you in any way they can!

I recently bought a new car and decided to get a new insurance company. I went with Commerce insurance as their online website quoted me the best price. It also told me I needed to see a broker to put through my application. When I went to the broker they quoted me a price which was 300 dollars more than the online application. I still went with them as they were still cheaper than some of the others, and I wanted to go pick up my new car. The following week they sent me a letter saying once they entered my vin number in my policy went up ANOTHER 350. I was not pleased but in a bad position as I had already picked up my car and given Commerce my down payment, and didn't have another 400 for a down payment at a different insurance company. I will be changing once this policy is up though.… read more

I have been with Farmers Insurance Exchange for more than twenty years and have had four cars and two houses insured through them at one time. Love the discounts they give us and whenever we have compared with other companies and have been offered a lower price all we do is call our agent and he matches their price. Wouldn't change this company for anything.

I called recently and mentioned I was going to look around for a lower rate, and the representative I spoke with asked if I had done defensive driving, which I have, and my bill was reduced immediately because of this! I am very happy to be a Liberty Mutual customer and look forward to many more years of business together.… read more

I will continue to use Humana Insurance for my insurance needs inthe future. Humana is always willing to help in any cirumstance I have had need to contact them. Humana has integrity! Humana pays claims in a timely manner and if tje claim is rejected, the company doe it's best to give an explanation and will listen to my pounts amd often will change their decision.

I fixed all my fines, and got my license back. When searching for a new car insurance company I tried many different companies, but no one really wanted to help me because of the recent suspension, or the prices were sky high. I came across The General site for car insurance. Not only were their rates reasonable, they would also accept me as a new customer. I am very thankful for their service.

I use CSAAA. After my father's death, we tried to use their Automotive Club customer service to avoid having to go into DMV. The receptionist may have been smacking gum and looking bored for all the interest she gave myself and my mother. When we approached, having finally got her attention, she said she couldn't help us. We'd have to go into the DMV. We told her what the customer service rep from DMV told us and she still denied having any ability to help us. It was a horrible experience. I was sorry I'd been a longtime member and this year stopped renewing my membership and using them at all. Switched entirely to State Farm.… read more

Unfortunately, automotive insurance is required by law in the state of Ohio and throughout the United States. Safe Auto has provided me with the coverage I've needed for the past few months and I couldn't be happier. I have a very high mileage car and my alternator had went out leaving me stuck for about an hour before the vehicle and myself were towed to a shop. Safe Auto took care of my roadside assistance/towing fee and I was back on the road the next afternoon after the car had been repaired. I couldn't be happier with an insurance company and I feel like my monthly premium is very fair for the coverage I have chosen. I'd recommend Safe Auto to those tight on money who want a quality insurance company!… read more

Insurance is a necessary evil. I have had Amica insurance for many years. I have spoken to their customer service over the years and they were always very nice to me, but I always wondered how they would be when I had an actual claim to report. Well, unfortunately I found out the hard way. I lived in a large city and drive the interstate every day. During rush hour the traffic goes very slowly, and someone hit the side of my car. I was so surprised and upset, because I thought everyone would have seen the bad traffic and slow down. Within two weeks my car was fixed and I was given a complimentary rental for my trouble.

Farmers Insurance offered me a deal that I could not refuse when shopping for a new car. I was also searching for an auto loan provider, in which Farmers did as well. The promise was an excellent discount on both my auto and renter’s insurance if I used them as a loan provider as well. I signed up and not only got a great interest rate on the auto loan (half the rate the dealership offered), but I had a great discount on both auto and renter’s insurance as well. The process was simple and hassle-free, and I had to do very little legwork to document my renter’s insurance policy. Highly recommend Farmer's Insurance.… read more

When I financed my new car, it seemed like Nationwide was the cheapest provider that gave me the most coverage. For 3 years, they automatically drafted the payment out of my check account. Recently, I checked my account statements (it's a bad habit of mine to not keep up with my statements), and found that they raised my insurance by over $50 a month for no reason! They didn't even give me a fair warning that they were increasing it. When I contacted customer service, they were less than helpful. I told them to cancel my policy right then an there. I instantly did a search and found that State Farm was a much better fit for me. Not only was my payment the same as Nationwide (before the increase), but the agent told me they would never increase my payment, only lower it! The best quality about insurance companies should be honesty and to be honest, Nationwide does not have that quality!… read more

The insurance company took care of my every need when I was in a hit and run. They brought a car to pick me up because I didn't live near family or friends, and paid for the rental and repairs of my car.

We switched to the Hartford through AARP. We were with progressive but they do not have a stable rate. You never knew what your rate was going to be. For us the deciding factor to go with Hartford was the rate and the term. We got a lower rate for a 12 mth term then we were getting for a six month term with the other companies. So far we are pleased with the company. We have been with them only two months and are claim free so far (and plan on staying that way) so have no experience with how they are when you do have a claim.… read more

It was also very easy to get my insurance established. You are able to do everything online, which is wonderful for something who has a loud toddler running around all over the place. If you choose, you may call and set your insurance up through a live consultant.

I have recently signed up with The General Insurance Company for my automobile insurance. The sign-up process was quick and easy, and I was covered immediately. However, I do have a huge complaint that I discovered after being invoiced for my third month with the company. My monthly premium more than doubled, and when I logged in online to check out what the issue was, a family member who just recently moved into my house was automatically added to my policy without my consent. When I contacted the company about this, the explanation given was that I was mailed information about this new driver showing up at the same address, and since I DIDN'T contact them to say DON'T add to my policy, they added them for me. How is that even legal? Fortunately, they were able to revert the policy without issue, but the precedent that they would do this in the first place is very disturbing.… read more

Farmers Insurance Company was formed in 1928 by two men wanting to provide good vehicle insurance to farmers. As the times changed so did the company now writing policies for anyone for automobiles, homes, and liability insurance to name a few.. Farmers also has a commercial side providing quality insurance for businesses. At one time I had policies for my automobiles, home, umbrella liability, and commercial insurance for a pharmacy and delivery car. We had an attempted break-in at the store but the alarm sounded and the thieves left before the police got there. My Farmers Agent came out and boarded up the windows that were broken and we had new glass that met current building codes installed at no cost to me by noon. On the personal side the Farmer's Adjuster came out because of wind damage and replaced a wooden privacy fence and gate, looked at the roof and said 3 sides needed replacement and paid to replace the wire fence that was also damaged. Farmer's sent me a check for the damages even before all of the repairs were done. The check was for enough to pay for a complete new roof and the other repairs we needed done. I stuck with Farmers' because of their great service and agents. Over the course of thirty years we had several agents but all provided us with quick reliable service when we had a claim.… read more

I like the discounts and rewards you can get for being a safe driver. Allstate has not made any promises to me that they have not kept and this makes me a believer in them. When having to call the company I have always got someone friendly who was able to help me in whatever I needed.

I felt that going with a company that wasn't as major as the State Farms and GEICOs of the industry would provide me with better customer service and cheaper costs, and I was right. When I called to inquire about insurance policies and to get a quote, the sales representatives were more than happy to help me and even provided me with rates that other competitors would offer someone with my driving record. Their rates matched and surpassed those of other companies and because of that I signed up immediately. Their service was second to none and made me more than happy to sign up.… read more

I had Assurant Insurance for three years, but no longer do due to the fact that they would not accept the form of payment that I wanted to use.  I had renters insurance with them, so it wasn't a large amount.  The representative did not bat an eye and just said "Ok".  No reason why, no trying to get me to stay.  Thank goodness I never needed them to file a claim.

Hi, I am Narumi, I want to give my testimonial.I have been with Farmer's insurance for 8 years and I wouldn't change it for anything.A co worker from my job told me about farmers insurance when I was with Amica insurance.My sister and I were driving back home from our road trip 4 years ago. I drove a 2009 Ford expedition to my home state California. We were headed from Texas when my truck suddenly started to feel like it was rambling on rocks.We pulled over to the side of the road to find out the issue was our tire that had gone flat on the right side of my vehicle. I had no family in the state we were in. Thanks to my insurance company. There was back up for me that day. i will not regret for the things they have helped me with.… read more

I have nationwide insurance. I went with these guys because all my family have them. they are not very cheap but they are very easy to work with. now my rates are high and I wouldn't mind getting lower rates. so if there any car insurances. that anyone could suggest. my ears are open. overall nationwide is a great company to be with. they do take care of you. I haven't had very many great experiences with them, but I haven't had any bad. I do feel that rates should go down more often.… read more

I have been with Nationwide for almost 20 years and they are the best and most reliable home insurance company that I would ever use. Whenever I call the office and have a question, a real person is there and not an answering machine! That in itself is great. When we were experiencing a terrible storm, lightning hit a part of the house, which did not cause a fire, but knocked out all of our electronic equipment. It was a scary situation. I called right away from my cell phone and they sent a rep over on the same day and we received a check for the lost equipment and to have repairs done. The other amazing thing is that our rates did not go up, partly, I feel because we have been customers for so long.… read more

I have had Foremost for 7 years now and 4 years ago we had a robbery in our home. We were out of town and noticed what had happened when we returned home. We have never had anything like this happen to us and after contacting the police I called Foremost to file a claim. The agent helping me was very nice and helpful throughout the entire process. We unfortunately were not able to get our things back but we were able to replace them within 2 weeks. I expected this process to be a long one and painful, but it was just the opposite. I have chosen to stay with Foremost because of the kindness during a tough time and because our policy amount didn't change because we filed a claim.… read more

Nationwide is really easy to deal with when you have questions. The customer service people always take their time to make sure they answered all your questions, you feel like they really care about you as a person. I had an unpleasant experience with another insurance company that really left a bad taste in my mouth, but Nationwide has been wonderful and really seems to care about the clients. I would definitely recommend this company to anybody who wants a reasonably priced insurance company with great coverage.… read more

I have had Nationwide for over 7 years and have been very happy with them. I had in the past other companies and was not happy with them. Their customer service people when you contact them are always nice and understanding when you ask them questions and you might think that they are dumb. They make you feel like you are they only customer, but you know you are not. They always talk to you like you are a friend. I like that because others always made me feel like they really did not care and only wanted my money. I will always tell people about my experience with Nationwide.… read more

I believe that perhaps the important qualities that a car insurance company should have are respect for the consumer and qualified/pleasant customer service representatives. As a consumer of Nationwide, I believe that these criteria have been met well in all of my numerous experiences with them. I previously had other insurance options, which after a number of unpleasant experiences I decided to switch. After a number of years, I cannot speak highly enough of Nationwide’s auto insurance customer service and policies.… read more

For our home owners insurance we have Liberty Mutual. They are a great company for us. They offer us a lot of great discounts and they are always available when you need them. If they are not open and it's a non emergency they get back to you as soon as they open the next day. If you have an emergency they have a special number. I love that they are accessible and that they seem to care about getting my family a great deal.… read more

For more than ten years Nationwide has been my insurance company and I´m very happy with it. It is a very serious company and features an excellent customer service. I think the best asset an insurance company should bear, besides the normal insurance coverages, is the easy and fast response to claims, and Nationwide provides an excellent claim response.

I have Farmers insurance for both of our cars and our home. I work with them because I have found them to be the most reasonable (cost wise) for the coverage we need. They have always been very responsive to answer questions or help straighten out any claim we have ever had to make. They are available 24 hours a day, should the need arise. If you are in the market for insurance I would definitely give Farmers a look!… read more

I have nationwide car insurance. I am a recent graduate, and it has become my responsibility to pay for my own things, and one of those is car insurance. I went through the process of 'auditioning' insurance companies, and Nationwide was the only company that I spoke with that held my hand through the entire process of how auto insurance works. They were not the 'cheapest' company that i spoke with, but their customer service was by far much better than any of the other companies, and for me that's an attribute i love in a company. I know that if i ever have any questions, they will be able to answer them for me, and be able to explain in layman's terms everything i need to know.… read more

I want an insurance company that will give me one of the best rates available, which I can contact 24 hours a day, and provides roadside assistance. I want a company without a lot of hassle if there is a claim. I'm using 21st Century Insurance and so far, I have no complaints about them whatsoever.

The most important characteristic of an auto insurance company is affordable insurance. Nationwide by far was the cheapest of all the other insurance companies. I compared my quote with all the other companies and saved at least $20 from the other companies around my area. Another thing is the quality of their customer service. This is definitely something you have to look for, and nationwide has that to prove it. They were really helpful with my car accident and helped me get through every step of it and I was able to claim the money to fix it within about a week. They gave friendly advice and their staff was just amazing.… read more

For my car's and renters insurance, I was using Farmers Insurance. I'm saying "was" because when I purchased a new 2013 Hyundai Sonata, Farmers raised my insurance instead of lowering it. I have no tickets and the Sonata had way more safety features than my previous car. When I called my rep she couldn't really give me any explanation so I told her I was going to leave. To make a long story short, I went to GEICO and I'm now saving $900 a month! I stayed with Farmers for my renters insurance because they were actually cheaper than GEICO.… read more

What Is Guaranteed Acceptance Life Insurance?


                Guaranteed acceptance life insurance can help your loved ones pay for your final expenses, such as funeral and burial costs, medical bills, or other consumer debts. These policies can also build cash value you can use later in life.
            

                A MassMutual Guaranteed Acceptance Life Insurance policy is an affordable way to help protect your loved ones’ future—and help provide peace of mind today. Premiums can start at less than $10 per month, and your coverage is guaranteed throughout the life of the policy, provided the required premiums are paid. You can rest assured that your benefits will never decrease, and your premiums will never increase during the life of the policy. The policy provides a limited benefit in the first two policy years.
            

                If you are between the ages of 50 and 75, you cannot be denied for health reasons. You won’t be required to take a medical exam, or answer any health questions. Our quick approval process ensures that you get the coverage you need, when you need it.
            









Why MassMutual?

Frequently Asked Questions


Do I need MassMutual Guaranteed Acceptance Life Insurance?

                        If someone relies on your financial support, Guaranteed Acceptance Life insurance may be helpful.
                        This policy is designed to help your loved ones pay for your final expenses, such as funeral and burial costs, medical bills, or other consumer debts.
                    


Do I qualify?
If you are between the ages of 50 and 75, you cannot be denied coverage for health reasons. You won’t be required to take a medical exam or answer any health questions.


Will my insurance coverage decrease?

                        No—your coverage amount is guaranteed, and will never decrease for the life of your policy.
                        As long as you pay the premiums, MassMutual will not cancel your policy.
                        You should know, however, that if you have taken a loan on your policy, it will decrease your cash value and death benefit until it’s paid back. If it’s not paid back before you die, the death benefit paid to your beneficiaries will be reduced by any outstanding loan amounts.
                    


How can I use a Guaranteed Acceptance Life Insurance policy?

                        The funds are for your beneficiaries to use as they see fit.
                        For example, they may use the proceeds of a Guaranteed Acceptance Life Insurance policy to pay for expenses such as funeral and burial costs, medical bills, or other consumer debts.
                        Plus, the policy builds cash value that you can use for a loan or cash withdrawal if you need it later in life.
                    


 Will my premiums increase?
Your premiums are guaranteed to remain level and will not increase for the life of your policy.


How can I use my policy’s cash value?

                        The decision to purchase life insurance should be based on long-term financial goals and the need for a death benefit.
                        Life insurance is not an appropriate vehicle for short-term savings or short-term investment strategies.
                        While the policy allows for loans, you should know that there may be little to no cash value available for loans in the policy's early years.
                        Access to cash values through borrowing will reduce the policy's cash value and death benefit, increase the chance the policy will lapse, and may result in a tax liability if the policy terminates before the death of the insured.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
