                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      class PEZ certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for 
      the class A-S, class B and class C certificates.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Sept. 4, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $11,129,000 class G 
      or the $34,400,233 class H.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 64 loans secured by 92 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $958.5 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Citigroup Global Markets Realty Corp., Goldman Sachs Mortgage 
      Company, Rialto Mortgage Finance, LLC, KGS-Alpha Real Estate Capital 
      Markets, LLC, and RAIT Funding, LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 66.8% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 76.8%, and asset summary reviews on 76.8% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The transaction has higher leverage than other 
      recent Fitch-rated transactions. The pool's Fitch DSCR of 1.15x is below 
      both the year to date 2015 average of 1.20x and the 2014 average of 
      1.19x. The pool's Fitch LTV of 111.5% is above both the year to date 
      2015 average of 109.2% and the 2014 average of 106.2%.
    

      Above-Average Pool Concentration: The largest 10 loans account for 54.6% 
      of the pool by balance. This is greater than the year to date 2015 
      average of 47.0% and the 2014 average of 50.5%. The pool's above-average 
      concentration resulted in a loan concentration index (LCI) of 424, which 
      is greater than the year to date 2015 and 2014 averages of 335 and 387, 
      respectively.
    

      Diverse Property Types: The pool has a diverse mix of property types, 
      with office as the largest at 26.5%, followed by hotel at 22.8%, retail 
      at 22.5%, and multifamily at 13.1%. Three of the top 10 loans (23.5%) 
      are office properties. Overall, the office properties have a diverse mix 
      of geographic locations, including both CBD and suburban markets.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's NCF was 14.1% below the most recent year's 
      NOI (for properties for which a full year NOI was provided, excluding 
      properties that were stabilizing during this period). The following 
      rating sensitivities describe how the ratings would react to further NCF 
      declines below Fitch's NCF. The implied rating sensitivities are only 
      indicative of some of the potential outcomes and do not consider other 
      risk factors to which the transaction is exposed. Stressing additional 
      risk factors may result in different outcomes. Furthermore, the implied 
      ratings, after the further NCF stresses are applied, are more akin to 
      what the ratings would be at deal issuance had those further stressed 
      NCFs been in place at that time.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CGCMT 
      2015-GC33 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 11 - 12.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 64 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.
