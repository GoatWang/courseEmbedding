Seth V Hetherington's Experience
Title: Senior Vice President
               Company: Icagen , Inc.
Job Details
               Icagen partners with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to offer industry-leading scientific expertise and comprehensive access to technologies for ion channel and transporter drug discovery and development. With over 20 years of leadership in the ion channel field, the Icagen team offers an extensive track record of success in advancing molecules from drug discovery to clinical development across multiple therapeutic areas and ion channel classes. Icagen's growing tool box comprises a broad range of cell lines and technologies for ion channel and transporter research, capped by the label-free XRpro platform. XRpro technology, based on X-ray fluorescence, is a novel method that enables high throughput assessment of ion channels and transporters, including challenging systems with high therapeutic interest. Icagen is also exploring extended applications of the XRpro platform.
Title: Chief Medical Officer
               Company: Genocea Biosciences, Inc.
Job Details
               Company Size: Less than $1 mil - Employee Range: 25 to less than 100. Genocea is harnessing the power of T cell immunity to develop life-changing vaccines and immunotherapies. T cells are increasingly recognized as a critical element of protective immune responses to a wide range of diseases, but traditional discovery methods have proven unable to identify the targets of such protective immune response. Using ATLAS, its proprietary technology platform, Genocea identifies these targets to potentially enable the rapid development of medicines to address critical patient needs. Genocea's pipeline of novel clinical stage T cell-enabled product candidates includes GEN-003 for genital herpes, GEN-004 for the prevention of infection by all serotypes of pneumococcus (development suspended pending further data analysis and consultation with our advisers), and earlier-stage programs in chlamydia, genital herpes prophylaxis, malaria and cancer immunotherapy.
