permalinksavecontextfull comments (7)reportgive goldOvercoming barriers to accuracy by patrick_j in RocketLeague[–]patrick_j[S] 0 points1 point2 points 5 days ago* (0 children)This brings up another challenge of mine: translating high-level training to games.
I can typically score a passing grade on advanced (or whatever the 2nd level training is called, can't remember). I can certainly finish the training in short order, but with a few shots I don't make first try.
But I can't make more than a couple all-star plays without literally dozens of attempts per shot.
And when I'm trying the same shot 40 times back to back to back to back, it's very hard to tell what makes the difference when I do make the shot. The first 39 attempts typically result in the undesirable outcomes I gave above. And on attempt 40, I feel like I do the essentially same thing as the last 20 tries, but this time the ball goes in.
It starts to feel a bit like I'm blindfolded and swinging at a Piñata. Sometimes I hit it, most of the time I don't, and I'm not sure what separates the hits from the misses.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (14)reportgive goldRiL - Season 18, Race 1: SRF and Solstice at Charlotte Roval by Fatt_Rascal in RiL[–]patrick_j 4 points5 points6 points 12 days ago (0 children)Damn damn damn. Thought I had my first win in the bag on this one.
Incidents for Jacob and Jeff left me cruising in the lead with a ~9 second gap to Benjamin that was holding steady. Rumor had it the Solstice would be cutting it close on fuel even with a full tank pitstop. That meant Jeff's early stop would require a second stop for a splash of fuel.
Nope. I stopped on schedule and rejoined to find Jeff 10 seconds up the road - thanks in part to some collusion with a foreign power (sad!) - and Jacob 3 seconds behind me, having stopped early as well, evidently.
Neither Mr. Tyler nor Mr. Alesia stopped again, and I was unable to hold off Jacob for 2nd, thanks in part to a purple Solstice driving the wrong direction at the exit of the infield on the last lap (WTF?!?)
Apart from that last bit, which was pretty uncool, I'm happy with the race and my performance. I dialed the aggression back a bit after passing Jeff, thinking he was out of contention. Lesson learned - don't base your race strategy on rumors!

permalinksavecontextfull comments (8)reportgive goldF1 needs to leave "supermarket car park" tracks - Wolff by guilhermebm in formula1[–]patrick_j 43 points44 points45 points 1 month ago (0 children)I think this sentiment is probably what Toto meant. I'm not sure he's calling for more street races, but rather more challenge for drivers and excitement for fans.
Tracks like Russia, China, Abu Dhabi - where the only real challenge is picking out braking points and managing tires - are much more boring than Spa, Monaco, Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, and Suzuka.
Eau Rouge and Raidillon, the barriers and harbor at Monaco, the wall of champions, 130R and the Senna esses. These are the things that get F1 drivers and fans excited. When a driver locking up the inside front tire for half a second is worthy of a slo-mo replay, something is wrong.

AMuS interview [German] by Rentta in formula1[–]patrick_j 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago (0 children)If I added Miami at the expense of another $20 million race, yes I decreased profits by $13 million. But that $13 million represents an investment in the American market. We're basically spending $13 million to double our presence in the US.
And if other races come along and say they want a fee reduction, you can tell them that Miami and Austin got different rates because they're in a market where we want to expand our presence. As the CEO, you're paid to make those negotiations.
I don't know how else to explain this.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (92)reportgive goldChase Carey: 5 or 6 US-cities interested in hosting a F1 Grand Prix. AMuS interview [German] by Rentta in formula1[–]patrick_j 2 points3 points4 points 1 month ago (0 children)That assumption is backwards in my opinion. In that scenario, you could lower the fee you charge Austin, say to $12 million. You could then charge Miami $15 million to join the calendar.
As I said before, this would mean a short term reduction in profits, but also represents an investment in the American market. If these events grow, you could increase hosting fees. If they don't, you may end up fired.
And yeah, other venues might want a fee reduction, and you'll have to deal with that. But those are the risks and responsibilities CEOs are paid to take.

permalinksavecontextfull comments (92)reportgive goldChase Carey: 5 or 6 US-cities interested in hosting a F1 Grand Prix. AMuS interview [German] by Rentta in formula1[–]patrick_j 7 points8 points9 points 1 month ago (0 children)But he doesn't have to lower the price across the board. Monaco pays a hosting fee of $0, while it's been rumored that Abu Dhabi pays around $40 million for their spot as the last race on the calendar.
Different races have different economic situations. You can charge new venues more to get on the prestigious F1 calendar, while you can charge established and historical venues less in order to maintain F1's European character and link with the past.
And, you could argue that expanding F1's American calendar would help expand the sport's popularity is the US, making it worth it to take a decreased profit in the short term.
Also, just because Vegas has lots of casinos doesn't mean the city has lots of money in the bank.
And calling someone 'dear boy' makes you sound like a condescending asshole.

Trump doesn't decide how government spends money. Congress does. He creates these to:

That's all it is - a suggestion. Just like his last budget that everyone got all worked up over, this budget will be received by congress and go straight in the trash.

Synopsis ReviewsAuthor InfoDelivery & Returns







Synopsis
The authors of the fifteenth edition are proud of the book's heritage, which dates to 1936. At the same time, they are mindful of the needs of students and professors addressing the Conflict of Laws eight decades later. We have added the subtitle "Private International Law" to acknowledge the more common title of the subject outside the U.S., as well as to alert students that they will face a blend of domestic and international issues once they become lawyers. As an intellectual matter, the conflicts course presents rich and nuanced doctrine. As a professional matter, every litigator will face issues raised in this course. As a practical matter, an increasing number of students are drawn to the course because it is tested on the bar exam in every state that has adopted the universal bar exam or the multistate essay exam. The authors recognize the need, therefore, to provide appropriate review of civil procedure to allow the student to transition to the study of conflicts.A modern conflicts casebook must be flexible. Some professors will choose to cover a great deal of international and comparative law. Others, however, will prefer to address conflicts only in the domestic sphere. This edition fully supports either (or some middle) approach. The professor may comfortably choose how much international and comparative material to cover without losing transition or context.

#FoylesFive: Celebrating Beer
23/07/2017
Earlier this year, Belgian beer culture finally officially took its rightful place on the World's Intangible Cultural Heritage list, where it now sits in good company with the likes of the French gastronomic meal, Cuban rumba and Spanish flamenco.
To celebrate, here is a far from exhaustive selection of some of the beer literature that can help you better appreciate the delicate arts of brewing and drinking beer.
