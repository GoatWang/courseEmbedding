Resolute Networks was formed through a merger between Lycium Networks and Redux Communications. As part of the executive team and a co-founder of Lycium I led to a successful merger of the technologies developed by both companies and defined the new technological direction of the merged company. I built and led the system engineering group responsible for system specification and architecture. I built and managed the technology group that developed state of the art algorithms for synchronization over packet. I represented the company in multiple standard organization bodies, and in particular, I made significant contributions to the IEEE1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) version 2 standard.Co-founder and CTOLycium NetworksApril 2001  –  August 2005 (4 years 5 months)Lycium Networks was a leader in high speed circuit-over-packet silicon solutions. Lycium developed a SONET/SDH pseudo-wire circuit-emulation chipset that supports 8xT1/E1 and OC3/STM1 ports. As co-founder I was responsible to form the technical vision of the company, present it in front of investors and strategic customers, and push it within industry and standards organizations. As CTO I led the technology group which was responsible for the specification of the solution, architecture,algorithms, standardization and intellectual property. I relocated to California during the summer of 2003 and opened the Lycium Networks office in the USA. Lycium Networks and Redux Communications merged to form Resolute Networks during2005.Technical LeaderCiscoMay 1998  –  April 2001 (3 years)Following the acquisition of Classdata, I led the integration of Classdata’s solutions into Cisco's portfolio. I designed the architecture of Cisco’s next generation QoS policy solution. I participated in Cisco’s QoS cross-company design team. I participated in the definition of a new policy enforcement protocol (COPS-PR). I pushed the Policy QoS information model internally within Cisco and within the standard bodies.Chief ScientistClassdata SystemsNovember 1996  –  May 1998 (1 year 7 months)Class Data was an innovative company in the field of QoS and Policy management. I joined Classdata as one of the first two software engineers, and helped in forming the technical direction of the company. I introduced a new architecture for outsourcing of policy and admission control and pushed the new concept within the standardization bodies. In particular, this effort led to a new standard protocol definition for policy enforcement called COPS. Classdata was acquired by Cisco Systems in 1998. Classdata was Cisco's first acquisition outside of North America.Software EngineerRAD Network DevicesJanuary 1993  –  November 1996 (3 years 11 months)RND developed routers, bridges and switches. I was part of the IP technology group where I worked on definition and implementation of the new IP forwarding and routing tables and developed IP routing protocols, including RIP and OSPF. I worked on various other projects including an aggregation switch, a miniature router and a load balancer.PublicationsRFC4842: Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy SONET/SDH) Circuit Emulation over Packet (CEP)IETFApril 2007Authors: Ron Cohen, Prayson Pate, Andrew Malis, David ZeligEducationWeizmann Institute of ScienceMScMSc1989  –  1991The Hebrew University of JerusalemBScBSc1985  –  1988SkillsTestingCloud ComputingjQueryMPLSCisco TechnologiesTelecommunicationsNetworkingIntegrationIPSystem ArchitectureProduct ManagementSwitchesProgrammingRoutingSoftware DevelopmentSee 9+QoSOSPFStart-upsStrategyManagementVirtualizationOpen SourceMobile DevicesWeb ApplicationsSee lessHow's this translation?Great•Has errorsThanks for your help!GroupsbitcoinStart-Up Phase ForumMobile start-ups - 25,000+ members and growing!Timing over PacketDrupalDrupal IsraelBlockchain and Bitcoin StartupsSee 7 moreIETF - The Internet Engineering Task ForceMastercoinTel Aviv Entrepreneur Meetup - www.tech-scene.co.ilCoursera - Stanford Startup Engineering 2013 GroupMongoDBFind Co-Founders.

As co-founder I was responsible to form the technical vision of the company, present it in front of investors and strategic customers, and push it within industry and standards organizations. As CTO I led the technology group which was responsible for the specification of the solution, architecture,algorithms, standardization and intellectual property. I relocated to California during the summer of 2003 and opened the Lycium Networks office in the USA. Lycium Networks and Redux Communications merged to form Resolute Networks during2005.Technical LeaderCiscoMai 1998  –  April 2001 (3 Jahre)Following the acquisition of Classdata, I led the integration of Classdata’s solutions into Cisco's portfolio.

Ron Cohen is the CEO of Sig Sauer, the company that produced one of the guns that was used in Friday's Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre. You have probably never heard of Ron Cohen before. I know I never have. I tried to find a decent picture of him this weekend, but I came up empty. He may as well not exist.In the wake of the shootings, Cohen's name has appeared in a grand total of one Google alert. This is by design. You aren't supposed to know anything about Ron Cohen or about Sig Sauer. Every time a tragedy happens and you, Mr. Gun Control Advocate, decide to lash out at the NRA, or at "our national obsession with guns," or at the classic straw man hunter who needs a 50-bullet clip just to chase down a squirrel, you're doing Ron Cohen, Sig Sauer, and everyone else at Big Gun a huge favor. One of the amazing things about the gun control debate in America is the remarkable success with which gun manufacturers—Sig Sauer, Glock, Smith & Wesson, Ruger, The Freedom Group (yes, it's called the fucking Freedom Group)—have been able to avoid the conversation altogether. When you think of Glock, you think of a gun, and not of the company behind it. That needs to change. We've shit on cigarette companies for lying about cigarettes. We've shit on Roger Goodell and the NFL for underplaying head injuries. We're even making inroads against the sneaky bastards at BIG SUGAR for making us all hopeless fatasses. But here is an industry—firearms manufacturing—that makes products whose deadliness is disputed by NO ONE, not even the people who treasure those products. And yet the executives and shadowy international holding company execs—whose job is to flood the world with as many of these weapons as possible—skate by cloaked in blessed anonymity. Wanna know why nothing ever gets done about gun laws here in the US? This is why.Gun manufacturers have successfully managed to shift virtually all blame for lax gun laws in America onto their lobbyists and their customers. It's no coincidence that companies like Sig Sauer, Freedom Group and Glock (which also made one of the weapons used in the killings) are privately held. They strive for minimum transparency, and they have achieved it. The NRA, bless its heart, is a front—a perfect little whipping boy designed to weather all of your abuse so that Ron Cohen can drive to and from his office without a reporter shoving a microphone in front of his stupid fucking face. They have taken phrases like "Gun control" and "the Second Amendment" and crafted them into permanent, bulletproof diversions. They've done such a good job of shielding themselves that Sig Sauer doesn't even feel compelled to issue a public statement when one of its weapons is used in a mass tragedy. They don't have to express their regrets or spew some bullshit about being dedicated to making sure guns are used safely. Higher profile companies have to send out public apologies when they send out a bad tweet. Big Gun does nothing and doesn't have to. Isn't that remarkable?Gun manufacturers profit off of mass violence in America. See for yourself. Every time a massacre happens, gun sales go through the roof because liberals cry out for gun control, and then conservatives flee to buy as many guns as possible just in case those shady folks in the GUBMINT come calling for their precious arms. They've succeeded in getting gun owners to disguise their love of shooting shit under a bullshit pretense of one day having to form a militia just in case Hitler II gets elected President. And they've succeeded in letting those people fight their flame wars for them. You have to hand it the gun industry, really. It's an ingenious little sales cycle they've created. Every massacre draws attention to the product, yet somehow NEVER to the people ultimately responsible for their production. It's always the hunter that takes the brunt of liberal ire. Or the redneck, or the guy at the gun show selling them secondhand, or Mike Huckabee saying something fucking stupid. Meanwhile, Ron Cohen eats his dinner uninterrupted.In order to succeed in preventing future massacres, it would be wise to publicly hold these people accountable. Here's how:1. Do not feed the trolls. Never say the phrase "gun control" or get into a message board argument with Jimbo3421 on Politico ever again. You've done nothing. In fact, you've done exactly what you've been trained to do. You are playing your role to perfection.2. Re-brand the gun debate. The greatest PSA campaign in the history of advertising is the Truth campaign, which did away with the traditional "smoking is bad for you" ads that proved ineffective. Instead, what the "Truth" campaign did was demonize tobacco companies—NOT demonize tobacco or tobacco users—and say THESE PEOPLE ARE FUCKING YOU OVER. They are lying to you and trying to kill you and they are getting rich while doing it. When you change the language, you change people's perception of what's really at stake. Make this a crime issue, not an endless discussion about what guns MEAN to everyone.3. Exposure. I suggest you do everything you can to draw attention to Ron Cohen, or Freedom Group CEO George Kollitides (here's a photo to get you started). You're gonna have to work hard, because these people go out of their way to remain hidden from view. Do not send an angry letter to Wayne LaPierre. He eats those for breakfast. Send your letters to THESE men. Why are these men not under any scrutiny? Have you ever seen ANY of these fuckers brought up in front of a Congressional subcommittee? Someone needs to put a microphone in front of Ron Cohen and ask him, "What are you doing to make sure your guns aren't used to kill children?" Then we can all watch him fumble for a decent answer and then we can call him a prick. These men need to be made famous, far more famous than Adam Lanza. People need to camp out by their lawns smoking weed and holding up signs that say OCCUPY GUN STREET.4. Lawsuits. There's no point in going to a politician to help make your community safer. They're pussies, and many of them helped engineer lucrative government contracts for these companies to equip our armed forces and local police departments. Ultimately, money is the only language the gun industry really understands. Everything else is white noise. Cigarette companies were sued into oblivion. The NFL is currently doing everything short of renaming the sport "tag" to avoid punishing class action decisions. When Sig Sauer sends its products out into the world, their responsibility for them apparently ends. Why? You could argue that it's grossly negligent to create a fucking machine gun—to craft a weapon made for war and then sell it to civilians because it helps expand your market share—and then let it go whenever the wind may take it. At least, some hippie dippy "activist judge" might see it that way, and then people might be forced to actually do something. (Update: A reader has pointed out that gun manufacturers cannot be sued when their products are used in crimes.)That's what needs to happen. We don't need everyone to argue about the same shit they've always argued about. I wanna throw up, it all seems so pointless. I have three kids and I would like to live in a country where I don't have to worry about them getting fucking shot in the head any time they head off to homeroom. I would like to live in a country where I don't hop on the web and see photos of grieving parents screaming in agony because they are enduring the kind of anguish that will black out everything else they ever say or do. Currently, this country doesn't fit the bill. This is not a safe place. And Ron Cohen—FUCKHEADED ASSHOLE RON COHEN WHOSE NAME SHOULD BE IN BRIGHT SHINY LIGHTS ABOVE TIMES SQUARE SO THAT EVERYONE KNOWS PRECISELY WHO MAKES THE GUNS THAT ARE USED TO KILL PEOPLE—he is a big reason why.Image by Jim Cooke.

Learn about eTextbook features that help you study smarter, not harder.












We know there are things you would rather be doing than studying, so we built X-Ray for Textbooks to help you save time. With X-Ray for Textbooks, get everything you need with a single tap, including definitions, related pages in your eTextbook, and even relevant content from other sources like Wikipedia and YouTube. X-Ray for Textbooks is available on Fire tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac on select eTextbooks. To access X-Ray for Textbooks, bring up the control bar within an eTextbook by tapping at the top or bottom of your screen.  You can find the X-Ray for Textbooks button at the top of the control screen.

Just carrying around a yellow highlighter? How about pink, blue, orange, and yellow? Multi-color highlights are available on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. Tap a word and hold–the digital highlighting tool will pop up and you can adjust the highlighted text and highlight color. You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.














Studying for exams? Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. With Notebook you can mark and filter your most important concepts to study when it's test time–you can even export them to email and Evernote on Fire tablets. It's like a digital scrapbook for your studies. Notebook is available on Fire HD tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. On iOS and Android devices, tap the top or bottom of the screen from within the eTextbook to bring up the controls to access Notebook. On PC/Mac, the Notebook icon is on the left side of the Kindle Reading app.














Just finished a chapter and need to review key terms and definitions? Flashcards allow you to quickly brush up on all the terms, concepts, and definitions in each chapter with a simple, easy to use interface. Flashcards are available on iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac from within the eTextbook. Click on the flashcards icon to make your own flashcards. Or, you can auto-generate Flashcards from your notes and highlights and X-Ray terms if your eTextbook includes X-Ray for eTextbooks.














Have a tablet and a laptop? With eTextbooks, you can read your content on all your devices with the free Kindle Reading App. eTextbooks are currently supported on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. eTextbooks give you access to your content however you want, whenever you need it. Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.














You can save money and space in your bag with eTextbooks. Read across your devices and save time studying the concepts you need to learn with interactive features such as Keyword Search and X-Ray for Textbooks. Quickly create and manage your notes and highlights and access them anytime in the Amazon cloud.














Carry less around campus this semester. Take your entire library with you wherever you go, without having to lug around all of your physical textbooks. You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Fire tablet, iPad, iPhone, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle Reading App.














With the swipe of a finger, quickly and efficiently navigate through pages and chapters of eTextbooks. Swift navigation is available on Android and iOS tablets. Tap the top or bottom of your tablet screen from inside the eTextbook to access swift navigation. On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.
