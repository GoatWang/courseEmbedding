       Investing in the Senior Secured Transition Bonds involves risks. Please read “Risk Factors” on page 12 of the
accompanying 
                prospectus (PDF).

       AEP Texas Central Transition Funding III LLC is issuing $800,000,000 of Senior Secured Transition Bonds, referred to
herein as the bonds, in three tranches. AEP Texas Central Company is the seller, initial servicer and sponsor with regard to
the bonds. The bonds are senior secured obligations of the issuing entity supported by transition property which includes the
right to a special, irrevocable nonbypassable charge, known as a transition charge, paid by retail electric customers in the
service territory of the sponsor based on their consumption of electricity as discussed herein. The utility restructuring
provisions of the Public Utility Regulatory Act mandate that transition charges be adjusted annually, and the Public Utility
Commission of Texas further requires such true-ups to occur semi-annually (and permits such true-ups to occur more
frequently) if necessary, in each case to ensure the expected recovery of amounts sufficient to timely provide all scheduled
payments of principal and interest on the bonds, as described further in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying
prospectus, and the Public Utility Commission of Texas guarantees it will act pursuant to the financing order to ensure such
recoveries as described below. Credit enhancement for the bonds will be provided by such statutory true-up mechanisms as
well as by accounts held under the indenture.
The bonds represent obligations only of the issuing entity, AEP Texas Central Transition Funding III LLC, and do not
represent obligations of the sponsor or any of its affiliates other than the issuing entity. Please read “The Bonds—The
Transition Property,” “—The Collateral” and “Credit Enhancement” in this prospectus supplement. The bonds are secured by
the assets of the issuing entity, consisting principally of the transition property and funds on deposit in the collection account
for the bonds and related subaccounts. Please read “The Bonds—The Collateral,” “—The Transition Property” and “Credit
Enhancement” in this prospectus supplement. The bonds are not a debt or general obligation of the State of Texas, the Public
Utility Commission of Texas or any other governmental agency or instrumentality and are not a charge on the full faith and
credit or the taxing power of the State of Texas or any governmental agency or instrumentality.
The Public Utility Commission of Texas guarantees that it will act pursuant to its irrevocable financing order as
expressly authorized by the Texas Electric Utility Restructuring Act to ensure that expected transition charge revenues are
sufficient to pay on a timely basis scheduled principal and interest on the bonds. The Public Utility Commission of Texas’
obligations relating to the bonds, including the specific actions that it has guaranteed to take, are direct, explicit, irrevocable
and unconditional upon issuance of the bonds, and are legally enforceable against the Public Utility Commission of Texas,
which is a United States public sector entity.

All matters relating to the structuring and pricing of the bonds have been considered jointly by AEP Texas Central
Company and the Public Utility Commission of Texas or its designated representative.
Additional information is contained in the accompanying prospectus. You should read this prospectus supplement and
the accompanying prospectus carefully before you decide to invest in the bonds. This prospectus supplement may not be used
to offer or sell the bonds unless accompanied by the prospectus.Please review the
            prospectus and prospectus supplement (PDF).

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT

 





 


 


March 7,
2012





 

To the
Representatives named in Schedule I hereto
of the
Underwriters named in Schedule II hereto

 

Ladies and
Gentlemen:

 


1.           
Introduction .  AEP Texas Central Transition
Funding III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “
Issuer ”), proposes to issue and sell $800,000,000
aggregate principal amount of its Senior Secured Transition Bonds,
(the “ Bonds ”), identified in Schedule I
hereto.  The Issuer and AEP Texas Central Company, a
Texas corporation and the Issuer’s direct parent (“
TCC ”), hereby confirm their agreement with the
several Underwriters (as defined below) as set forth
herein.


 


The term “Underwriters” as used
herein shall be deemed to mean the entity or several entities named
in Schedule II hereto and any underwriter substituted as provided
in Section 7 hereof and the term “ Underwriter ”
shall be deemed to mean any one of such Underwriters.  If
the entity or entities listed in Schedule I hereto (the “
Representatives ”) are the same as the entity or
entities listed in Schedule II hereto, then the terms
“Underwriters” and “Representatives”, as
used herein, shall each be deemed to refer to such entity or
entities.  All obligations of the Underwriters hereunder
are several and not joint.  If more than one entity is
named in Schedule I hereto, any action under or in respect of this
underwriting agreement (“ Underwriting Agreement
”) may be taken by such entities jointly as the
Representatives or by one of the entities acting on behalf of the
Representatives and such action will be binding upon all the
Underwriters.


 


Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined
in this Underwriting Agreement shall have the meanings given to
them in the Indenture (as defined below).


 


2.           
Description of the Bonds .  The Bonds will be
issued pursuant to an indenture to be dated as of March 14, 2012,
as supplemented by one or more series supplements thereto (as so
supplemented, the “ Indenture ”), between the
Issuer and U.S. Bank National Association as indenture trustee (the
“ Indenture Trustee ”).  The Bonds
will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer and will be
supported by transition property (as more fully described in the
Financing Order relating to the Bonds, “ Transition
Property ”), to be sold to the Issuer by TCC pursuant to
the Transition Property Purchase and Sale Agreement, to be dated on
or about


 



 



 





 



 

March 14, 2012, between TCC and the
Issuer (the “ Sale Agreement ”).  The
Transition Property securing the Bonds will be serviced pursuant to
the Transition Property Servicing Agreement, to be dated on or
about March 14, 2012, between TCC, as servicer, and the
Issuer, as owner of the Transition Property sold to it pursuant to
the Sale Agreement (the “ Servicing Agreement
”).

 


3.           
Representations and Warranties of the Issuer
.  The Issuer represents and warrants to the several
Underwriters that:


 


(a)           The
Issuer and the Bonds meet the requirements for the use of Form S-3
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “
Securities Act ”).  The Issuer, in its
capacity as co-registrant and issuing entity with respect to the
Bonds, and TCC, in its capacity as co-registrant and as sponsor for
the Issuer, have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “ Commission ”) a registration statement on
such form on January 19, 2012 (Registration Nos. 333-179092
and 333-179092-01), as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto dated
February 27, 2012 and Amendment No. 2 thereto dated February
29, 2012, including a prospectus and a form of prospectus
supplement, for the registration under the Securities Act of up to
$800,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the
Bonds.  Such registration statement, as amended (“
Registration Statement Nos . 333-179092 and
333-179092-01”), has been declared effective by the
Commission and no stop order suspending such effectiveness has been
issued under the Securities Act and no proceedings for that purpose
have been instituted or are pending or, to the knowledge of the
Issuer, threatened by the Commission.  No transition
bonds registered with the Commission under the Securities Act
pursuant to Registration Statement Nos. 333-179092 and
333-179092-01 have been previously issued.  References
herein to the term “Registration Statement” shall be
deemed to refer to Registration Statement Nos. 333-179092 and
333-179092-01, including any amendment thereto, all documents
incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3
(“ Incorporated Documents ”) and any information
in a prospectus or a prospectus supplement deemed or retroactively
deemed to be a part thereof pursuant to Rule 430B (“ Rule
430B ”) under the Securities Act that has not been
superseded or modified.  “Registration
Statement” without reference to a time means the Registration
Statement as of the Applicable Time (as defined below), which the
parties agree is the time of the first contract of sale (as used in
Rule 159) for the Bonds, and shall be considered the
“Effective Date” of the Registration Statement relating
to the Bonds.  For the purpose of this definition,
information contained in a form of prospectus or prospectus
supplement that is deemed retroactively to be a part of the
Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 430B shall be considered to
be included in the Registration Statement as of the time specified
in Rule 430B.  The final prospectus and the final
prospectus supplement relating to the Bonds, as filed with the
Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, are
referred to herein as the “ Final Prospectus ”;
and the most recent preliminary prospectus and prospectus
supplement that omitted information to be included upon pricing in
a form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule
424(b) under the Securities Act and that was used after the initial
effectiveness of the Registration Statement and prior to the
Applicable Time (as defined below) is referred to herein as the
“ Pricing Prospectus ”.  The Pricing
Prospectus and the Issuer Free Writing Prospectuses identified in
Section B of Schedule III hereby considered together, are referred
to herein as the “ Pricing Package ”.

(b)           (i)
At the earliest time after the filing of the Registration Statement
that the Issuer or another offering participant made a bona fide
offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2) of the Securities Act)
of the Bonds and (ii) at the date hereof, the Issuer is not an
“ineligible issuer,” as defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act.


 


(c)           At
the time the Registration Statement initially became effective, at
the time of each amendment (whether by post-effective amendment,
incorporated report or form of prospectus) and on the Effective
Date relating to the Bonds, the Registration Statement, fully
complied, and the Final Prospectus, both as of its date and the
Closing Date, and the Indenture, at the Closing Date, will fully
comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended
(the “ Trust Indenture Act ”), and, in each
case, the applicable instructions, rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder; the Registration Statement, at each of the
aforementioned dates, did not and will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading; the Final Prospectus, both as of its date
and at the Closing Date, will not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
in which they were made, not misleading; and on said dates the
Incorporated Documents, taken together as a whole, fully complied
or will fully comply in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“ Exchange Act ”), and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Commission thereunder; provided that the
foregoing representations and warranties in this paragraph (c)
shall not apply to statements or omissions made in reliance upon
and in conformity with any Underwriter Information as defined in
Section 11(b) below or to any statements in or omissions from any
Statements of Eligibility on Form T-1 (or amendments thereto) of
the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture filed as exhibits to the
Registration Statement or Incorporated Documents or to any
statements or omissions made in the Registration Statement or the
Final Prospectus relating to The Depository Trust Company
(“DTC”) Book-Entry System that are based solely on
information contained in published reports of the DTC.


 


(d)           As
of the Applicable Time (as defined below), on the date of its
filing, if applicable, and on the Closing Date, the Pricing
Prospectus and each Issuer Free Writing Prospectus (as defined
below) (other than the Pricing Term Sheet, as defined in Section
5(b) below), did not and does not include any untrue statement of a
material fact nor when considered together, omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading (except that the principal amount of the Bonds, the
tranches, the initial principal balances, the scheduled final
payment dates, the final maturity dates, the expected average
lives, the Expected Amortization Schedule and the Expected Sinking
Fund Schedule described in the Pricing Prospectus were subject to
completion or change based on market conditions and the interest
rate, price to the public and underwriting discounts and
commissions for each tranche was not included in the Pricing
Prospectus).  The Pricing Package, at the Applicable
Time, and at all subsequent times through the completion of the
offer and the sale of the Bonds on the Closing Date did not include
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to


 



 



- 3 -





 



 


make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances in which they are made, not
misleading.  The two preceding sentences do not apply to
statements in or omissions from the Pricing Prospectus, the Pricing
Term Sheet or any other Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance
upon and in conformity with any Underwriter
Information.  “Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus” means any “issuer free writing
prospectus,” as defined in Rule 433(h), relating to the
Bonds, in the form filed or required to be filed with the
Commission or, if not required to be filed, in the form retained in
the Issuer’s records pursuant to Rule 433(g) of the
Securities Act.  References to the term “Free
Writing Prospectus” shall mean a free writing prospectus, as
defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act.  References
to the term “Applicable Time” mean 4:53 PM, eastern
time, on the date hereof, except that if, subsequent to such
Applicable Time, the Issuer, TCC and the Underwriters have
determined that the information contained in the Pricing Prospectus
or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus issued prior to such
Applicable Time included an untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading and the Issuer, TCC and the Underwriters
have agreed to terminate the old purchase contracts and have
entered into new purchase contracts with purchasers of the Bonds,
then “Applicable Time” will refer to the first of such
times when such new purchase contracts are entered
into.  The Issuer represents, warrants and agrees that it
has treated and agrees that it will treat each of the free writing
prospectuses listed on Schedule III hereto as an Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus, and that each such Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus has fully complied and will fully comply with the
applicable requirements of Rules 164 and 433, including timely
Commission filing where required, legending and record
keeping.


 


(e)           Each
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, as of its issue date and at all
subsequent times through the completion of the offer and sale of
the Bonds on the Closing Date or until any earlier date that the
Issuer notified or notifies the Representatives as described in the
next sentence, did not, does not and will not include any
information that conflicted, conflicts or will conflict with the
information then contained in the Registration
Statement.  If at any time following issuance of an
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus there occurred or occurs an event or
development as a result of which such Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information then
contained in the Registration Statement or included or would
include an untrue statement of a material fact or, when considered
together with the Pricing Prospectus, omitted or would omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that
subsequent time, not misleading, (i) TCC or the Issuer has promptly
notified or will promptly notify the Representatives and (ii) TCC
or the Issuer has promptly amended or will promptly amend or
supplement such Issuer Free Writing Prospectus to eliminate or
correct such conflict, untrue statement or omission.  The
foregoing two sentences do not apply to statements in or omissions
from any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in reliance upon and in
conformity with any Underwriter Information.


 


(f)           The
Issuer has been duly formed and is validly existing as a limited
liability company in good standing under the Limited Liability
Company Act of the State of Delaware, as amended, with full limited
liability company power and authority to

execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under this Underwriting Agreement, the Bonds, the Sale Agreement,
the Servicing Agreement, the Indenture, the LLC Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Administration Agreement and the other
agreements and instruments contemplated by the Pricing Prospectus
(collectively, the “ Issuer Documents ”) and to
own its properties and conduct its business as described in the
Pricing Prospectus; the Issuer has been duly qualified as a foreign
limited liability company for the transaction of business and is in
good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it
owns or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require
such qualification, except where failure to so qualify or to be in
good standing would not have a material adverse effect on the
business, properties or financial condition of the Issuer; the
Issuer has conducted and will conduct no business in the future
that would be inconsistent with the description of the
Issuer’s business set forth in the Pricing Prospectus; the
Issuer is not a party to or bound by any agreement or instrument
other than the Issuer Documents and other agreements or instruments
incidental to its formation; the Issuer has no material liabilities
or obligations other than those arising out of the transactions
contemplated by the Issuer Documents and as described in the
Pricing Prospectus; TCC is the beneficial owner of all of the
limited liability company interests of the Issuer; and based on
current law, the Issuer is not classified as an association taxable
as a corporation for United States federal income tax
purposes.


 


(g)           The
issuance and sale of the Bonds by the Issuer, the purchase of the
Transition Property by the Issuer from TCC and the consummation of
the transactions herein contemplated by the Issuer, and the
fulfillment of the terms hereof on the part of the Issuer to be
fulfilled, will not result in a breach of any of the terms or
provisions of, or constitute a default under the Issuer’s
certificate of formation or limited liability company agreement
(collectively, the “ Issuer Charter Documents
”), or any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust or other
agreement or instrument to which the Issuer is now a
party.


 


(h)           This
Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Issuer, which has the necessary limited liability
company power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Underwriting Agreement.


 


(i)           The
Issuer (i) is not in violation of the Issuer Charter Documents,
(ii) is not in default and no event has occurred which, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default, in the
due performance or observance of any term, covenant or condition
contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust or
other  agreement or instrument to which it is a party or
by which it is bound or to which any of its properties is subject,
except for any such defaults that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its business, property
or financial condition, and (iii) is not in violation of any law,
ordinance, governmental rule, regulation or court decree to which
it or its property may be subject, except for any such violations
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on its business, property or financial
condition.


 


(j)           The
Indenture has been duly authorized by the Issuer, and, on the
Closing Date, will have been duly executed and delivered by the
Issuer and will be a valid and

binding instrument, enforceable against the
Issuer in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability
thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
receivership, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or
affecting creditors’ or secured parties’ rights
generally and by general principles of equity (including concepts
of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing),
regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law; and limitations on enforceability of rights to indemnification
by federal or state securities laws or regulations or by public
policy.  On the Closing Date, the Indenture will (i)
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of
the Trust Indenture Act and (ii) conform in all material respects
to the description thereof in the Pricing Prospectus and Final
Prospectus.


 


(k)           The

to the Underwriters pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement and,
when executed by the Issuer and authenticated by the Indenture
Trustee in accordance with the Indenture and delivered to the
Underwriters against payment therefor in accordance with the terms
of this Underwriting Agreement, will constitute valid and binding
obligations of the Issuer entitled to the benefits of the Indenture
and enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their terms,
except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium or other
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ or secured
parties’ rights generally and by general principles of equity
(including concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and
fair dealing), regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law; and limitations on enforceability of rights to
indemnification by federal or state securities laws or regulations
or by public policy, and the Bonds conform in all material respects
to the description thereof in the Pricing Prospectus and Final
Prospectus.  The Issuer has all requisite limited
liability company power and authority to issue, sell and deliver
the Bonds in accordance with and upon the terms and conditions set
forth in this Underwriting Agreement and in the Pricing Prospectus
and Final Prospectus.


 


(l)           There
is no litigation or governmental proceeding to which the Issuer is
a party or to which any property of the Issuer is subject or which
is pending or, to the knowledge of the Issuer, threatened against
the Issuer that could reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, result in a material adverse effect on the
Issuer’s business, property or financial
condition.

authorization, consent or order of any public board or body (except
such as have been already obtained and other than in connection or
in compliance with the provisions of applicable blue-sky laws or
securities laws of any state, as to which the Issuer makes no
representations or warranties), is legally required for the
issuance and sale by the Issuer of the Bonds.


 


(n)           The
Issuer is not, and, after giving effect to the sale and issuance of

paragraph (c) shall not apply to statements or omissions made in
reliance upon and in conformity with any Underwriter Information or
to any statements in or omissions from any Statement of Eligibility

Prospectus conflicted or would conflict with the information then
contained in the Registration Statement or included or would
include an untrue statement of a material fact or, when considered

bound or to which any of its properties is subject, except for any
such defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a material adverse effect on the business, property or
financial condition of TCC and its subsidiaries considered as a
whole, or (iii) is not in violation of any law, ordinance,
governmental rule, regulation or court decree to which it or its
property may be subject, except for any such violations that would

effect on the business, property or financial condition of TCC and
its subsidiaries considered as a whole.


 


(k)           Except
as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, there is no
litigation or governmental proceeding to which TCC or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or to which any property of TCC or any of
its subsidiaries is subject or which is pending or, to the
knowledge of TCC, threatened against TCC or any of its subsidiaries
that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, result in a material adverse effect on the
Issuer’s business, property, or financial condition or on
TCC’s ability to perform its obligations under the Sale
Agreement and the Servicing Agreement.

terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium or
other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ or
secured parties’ rights generally and by general principles
of equity (including concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good
faith and fair dealing), regardless of whether considered in a

consent of the Representatives, and each Underwriter represents and
agrees that,, unless it obtains the prior consent of the Issuer and
TCC and the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any
offer relating to the Bonds that would constitute an Issuer Free
Writing Prospectus, or that would otherwise constitute a
“free writing prospectus,” required to be filed by the
Issuer or TCC, as applicable, with the Commission or retained by
the Issuer or TCC, as applicable, under Rule 433 under the
Securities Act; provided that the prior written consent of the
parties hereto shall be deemed to have been given in respect of the
Term Sheets and each other Free Writing Prospectus identified in
Schedule III hereto.

and the Issuer (or the Representatives at the direction of the
Issuer) will prepare a final pricing term sheet relating to the

Prospectus (as defined below).  “Written
Communication” has the same meaning as that term is defined
in Rule 405 under the Securities Act.


 


An “Underwriter Free Writing
Prospectus” means any free writing prospectus that contains
only preliminary or final terms of the Transition Bonds and is not
required to be filed by TCC or the Issuer pursuant to Rule 433 and
that contains information substantially the same as the information
contained in the Pricing Prospectus or Pricing Term Sheet

CUSIPs, coupon, yield, spread, benchmark, status and/or legal
maturity date of the Bonds, the weighted average life, expected
first and final payment dates, trade date, settlement date,

eligibility, legal investment status and payment window of one or
more classes of Bonds and (ii) a column or other entry showing the
status of the subscriptions for the Bonds, both for the Bonds as a
whole and for each Underwriter’s retention, and/or expected
pricing parameters of the Bonds).


 


(ii)           Each
Underwriter shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations
in connection with the use of Free Writing Prospectuses and Term
Sheets, including but not limited to Rules 164 and 433 under the
Securities Act.


 


(iii)           All
Free Writing Prospectuses provided to investors, whether or not
filed with the Commission, shall bear a legend including
substantially the following statement:


 


The Issuer has
filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the
SEC for the offering to which this communication
relates.  Before you invest, you should read the
prospectus in that registration statement and other documents the
Issuer has filed with the SEC for more complete information about
the Issuer and the offering.  You may get these documents
for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC web site at
www.sec.gov.  Alternatively, Issuer, any underwriter or
any dealer participating in the offering will arrange to send you
the base prospectus if you request it by calling toll free at
1-866-718-1649.


 



 



- 12 -





 



The Issuer and
the Representatives shall have the right to require additional
specific legends or notations to appear on any Free Writing
Prospectus, the right to require changes regarding the use of
terminology and the right to determine the types of information
appearing therein with the approval of, in the case of the Issuer,
Representatives and, in the case of the Representatives, the Issuer
(which in either case shall not be unreasonably
withheld).


 


(iv)           Each
Underwriter covenants with the Issuer and TCC that after the Final
Prospectus is available such Underwriter shall not distribute any
written information concerning the Bonds to an investor unless such
information is preceded or accompanied by the Final Prospectus or
by notice to the investor that the Final Prospectus is available
for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at
www.sec.gov.


 


(v)           Each
Underwriter covenants that if an Underwriter shall use an
Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus that contains information in
addition to (x) “issuer information”, including
information with respect to TCC, as defined in Rule 433(h)(2) or
(y) the information in the Pricing Package, the liability arising
from its use of such additional information shall be the sole
responsibility of the Underwriter using such Underwriting Free
Writing Prospectus unless the Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus
(or any information contained therein) was consented to in advance
by TCC; provided, however, that, for the avoidance of doubt, this
clause (v) shall not be interpreted as tantamount to the
indemnification obligations contained in Section 11(b)
hereof.


 


6.           
Purchase and Sale .  On the basis of the
representations and warranties herein contained, and subject to the
terms and conditions herein set forth, the Issuer shall sell to
each of the Underwriters, and each Underwriter shall purchase from
the Issuer, at the time and place herein specified, severally and
not jointly, at the purchase price set forth in Schedule I hereto,
the principal amount of the Bonds set forth opposite such
Underwriter’s name in Schedule II hereto.  The
Underwriters agree to make a public offering of the
Bonds.  The Issuer shall pay (in the form of a discount
to the principal amount of the offered Bonds) to the Underwriters a
commission equal to $3,200,000.


 


7.           
Time and Place of Closing .  Delivery of the Bonds
against payment of the aggregate purchase price therefor by wire
transfer in federal funds shall be made at the place, on the date
and at the time specified in Schedule I hereto, or at such other
place, time and date as shall be agreed upon in writing by the
Issuer and the Representatives.  The hour and date of
such delivery and payment are herein called the “ Closing
Date ”.  The Bonds shall be delivered to DTC or
to U.S. Bank National Association, as custodian for DTC, in fully
registered global form registered in the name of Cede & Co.,
for the respective accounts specified by the Representatives not
later than the close of business on the business day preceding the
Closing Date or such other time as may be agreed upon by the
Representatives.  The Issuer agrees to make the Bonds
available to the Representatives for checking purposes not later
than 1:00 P.M. New York Time on the last business day preceding the
Closing Date at the place specified for delivery of the Bonds in
Schedule I hereto, or at such other place as the Issuer may
specify.


 



 



- 13 -





 



If any Underwriter shall fail or refuse to
purchase and pay for the aggregate principal amount of Bonds that
such Underwriter has agreed to purchase and pay for hereunder, the
Issuer shall immediately give notice to the other Underwriters of
the default of such Underwriter, and the other Underwriters shall
have the right within 24 hours after the receipt of such notice to
determine to purchase, or to procure one or more others, who are
members of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority  (“ FINRA ”) (or, if not
members of the FINRA, who are not eligible for membership in the
FINRA and who agree (i) to make no sales within the United States,
its territories or its possessions or to persons who are citizens
thereof or residents therein and (ii) in making sales to comply
with the FINRA’s Conduct Rules) and satisfactory to the

with respect to Third-Party Collectors required to be taken by the
Servicer as set forth, if applicable, in any agreement with the
Servicer, the Financing Order, Tariff, other tariffs and any other
PUCT Regulations in effect from time to time and implement such
additional procedures and policies as are necessary to ensure that
the obligations of all Third-Party Collectors in connection with
Transition Charges are properly enforced in accordance with, if
applicable, the terms of any agreement with the Servicer, the
Financing Order, Tariff, other tariffs and any other PUCT
Regulations in effect from time to time.  Such procedures
and policies shall include the following:

addition to any actions required by the Tariff, PUCT Regulations or
other applicable law, the Servicer shall:

 


(i)           maintain
adequate records for promptly identifying and contacting each
Third-Party Collector;


 


(ii)          maintain
records of end-user Customers which are billed by Third-Party
Collectors to permit prompt transfer of billing responsibilities in
the event of default by such Third-Party Collectors;


 


(iii)         maintain
adequate records for enforcing compliance by all Third-Party
Collectors with their obligations with respect to Transition
Charges,


 



 



7





 



 


including
compliance with all Remittance Requirements, REP Credit
Requirements and REP Deposit Requirements; and


 


(iv)         provide
to each Third-Party Collector such information necessary for such
Third-Party Collector to confirm the Servicer’s calculation
of Transition Charges and remittances, including, if applicable,
charge-off amounts.


 


The Servicer
shall update the records described above no less frequently than
quarterly.


 

(b)           
Credit and Collection Policies .  The Servicer
shall, to the fullest extent permitted under the Financing Order,
impose such terms with respect to credit and collection policies
applicable to Third-Party Collectors as may be reasonably necessary
to prevent the then-current rating of the Transition Bonds from
being downgraded, withdrawn or suspended.  The Servicer
shall, in accordance with and to the extent permitted by the
Utilities Code, applicable PUCT Regulations and the terms of the
Financing Order, include and impose the above-described terms in
any tariffs filed under the Utilities Code which would allow REPs
or other utilities to issue single bills which include Transition
Charges to TCC’s Customers.  The Servicer shall
periodically review the need for modified or additional terms based
upon, among other things, (i) the relative amount of TC Payments
received through REPs relative to the Periodic Billing Requirement,
(ii) the historical payment and default experience of each REP and
(iii) such other credit and collection policies to which the REPs
are subject, and if permitted by applicable law, will set out any
such modified or additional terms in a supplemental tariff filed
with the PUCT.

 

(c)           
Monitoring of Performance and Payment by REPs

PUCT Regulations or other applicable law, the Servicer shall
undertake to do the following:

 


(i)           The
Servicer shall require each REP to pay all Transition Charges (less
any applicable charge-off allowances) billed to such REP in
accordance with the provisions of the Tariff, other tariffs and
PUCT Regulations (whether or not disputed).  The Servicer
shall monitor compliance by each REP with all Remittance
Requirements, REP Credit Requirements and REP Deposit Requirements
and take prompt action to enforce such requirements.


 


(ii)           Where
a REP is responsible for billing the Customers, the Servicer shall,
consistent with its customary billing practices, bill each
Applicable REP no less frequently than the billing cycle otherwise
applicable to such Customers.


 


(iii)           The
Servicer shall work with REPs to resolve any disputes using the
dispute resolution procedures established in the Tariff and any
PUCT Regulations, in accordance with the Servicing
Standard.


 

(d)           
Enforcement of REP Obligations .  The Servicer
shall, in accordance with the terms of the Tariff, ensure that each
REP remits all TC Payments which it is obligated to remit to the
Servicer.  In the event of any default by any REP, the
Servicer shall enforce all rights set forth in and take all other
steps permitted by, if applicable, the Financing Order, Tariff,
other tariffs and any other PUCT Regulations as it determines, in
accordance with the Servicing

reasonably necessary to ensure the prompt payment of TC Payments by
such REP and to preserve the rights of the Holders with respect
thereto, including, where appropriate, terminating the right of any
REP to bill and collect Transition Charges or petitioning the PUCT
to impose such other remedies or penalties as may be available
under the circumstances.  Any agreement entered into
between the Servicer and a defaulted REP will be limited to the
terms of this Agreement and will satisfy the Rating Agency
Condition.  In the event the Servicer has actual
knowledge that a REP is in default, including due to the downgrade
by the Rating Agencies of any party providing credit support for
such REP, the Servicer shall promptly notify a Responsible Officer
of the Indenture Trustee in writing of the same and, shall, if
applicable, instruct the Indenture Trustee either to:

 


(i)           withdraw
from such REP’s REP Deposit Account and deposit into the
Collection Account the lesser of (x) the amount of cash on deposit
in such REP Deposit Account and allocable to the Transition
Property at such time and (y) the amount of any Transition Charges
then due and payable by such REP; or


 


(ii)           make
demand under any letter of credit, guarantee or other credit
support up to the lesser of (x) the amount of such letter of
credit, guarantee or other credit support and (y) the amount of any
Transition Charges then due and payable by such REP, and forward
the amounts received, if any, as a result of such demand to the
Collection Account.


 

The Indenture
Trustee shall, within two (2) Business Days of receipt of such
written notice, withdraw such funds from the REP Deposit Account or
make demand under such credit support, as applicable, and deposit
such funds withdrawn or received, as applicable, into the
Collection Account.

 

(e)           
Maintenance of REP Deposit Accounts .  The
Servicer shall cause the entity acting as Indenture Trustee to
maintain one or more REP Deposit Accounts as described in
Section 8.02(g) of the Indenture.  The Servicer
shall provide written direction to the Indenture Trustee regarding
the allocation and release of funds on deposit in the REP Deposit
Accounts, as permitted or required by the Indenture, this
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement, or the Financing Order,
Tariff or PUCT Regulations.  The Indenture Trustee shall
be entitled to conclusively rely on any such written directions
from the Servicer, and the Indenture Trustee shall have no duty to
monitor the adequacy of amounts on deposit in any REP Deposit
Account..

 

(f)           
Affiliated Third-Party Collectors .  In performing
its obligations under this Section 3.05 , the Servicer shall
deal with any Third-Party Collectors which are Affiliates of the
Servicer on terms which are no more favorable in the aggregate to
such affiliated Third-Party Collector than those used by the
Servicer in its dealings with Third-Party Collectors that are not
affiliates of the Servicer.

the Retirement of the Transition Bonds, the Servicer shall identify
the need for Annual True-Up
 


 



9





 


 
Adjustments,
Mandatory Interim True-Up Adjustments, Optional Interim True-Up
Adjustments and Non-Standard True-Up Adjustments and shall take all
reasonable action to obtain and implement such True-Up Adjustments,
all in accordance with the following:

 

(a)           
Expected Amortization Schedule . The Expected Amortization
Schedule for the Transition Bonds is attached hereto as Schedule
4.01(a) .  If the Expected Amortization Schedule is
revised, the Servicer shall send a copy of such revised Expected
Amortization Schedule to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the
Rating Agencies promptly thereafter.

 

(b)           
True-Up Adjustments .

 


(i)           
Annual True-Up Adjustments and Filings .  Each
year no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first billing
cycle of March the Servicer shall:  (A) update the data
and assumptions underlying the calculation of the Transition
Charges, including projected electricity usage during the next
Calculation Period for each TC Customer Class and including
interest and estimated expenses and fees of the Issuer to be paid
during such period, the Weighted Average Days Outstanding and
write-offs; (B) determine the Periodic Payment Requirements and
Periodic Billing Requirement for the next Calculation Period based
on such updated data and assumptions; (C) determine the Transition
Charges to be allocated to each TC Customer Class during the next
Calculation Period based on such Periodic Billing Requirement and
the terms of the Financing Order, the Tariff and any other tariffs
filed pursuant thereto and in doing so the Servicer shall use the
method of allocating Transition Charges then in effect, including
as applicable, the result of the implementation of the most recent
Non-Standard True-Up Adjustment; (D) make all required notice and
other filings with the PUCT to reflect the revised Transition
Charges, including any Amendatory Tariff, and (E) take all
reasonable actions and make all reasonable efforts to effect such
Annual True-Up Adjustment and to enforce the provisions of the
Securitization Law and the Financing Order; provided ,
however , that if the Servicer determines that the
forecasted billing units for one or more of the TC Customer Classes
for an upcoming period decreases by more than 10% compared to the
billing units for the threshold period set forth in the Financing
Order, the Servicer shall implement a Non-Standard True-Up
Adjustment and, if such Non-Standard True-Up Adjustment shall be
made in the time period provided for Annual True-Up Adjustments
pursuant to this Section 4.01(b)(i) , such Non-Standard
True-Up Adjustment shall also qualify as an Annual True-Up
Adjustment for purposes of this Agreement.  The Servicer
shall implement the revised Transition Charges, if any, resulting
from such Annual True-Up Adjustment as of the Annual True-Up
Adjustment Date.


 


(ii)           
Non-Standard True-Up Adjustments and Filings .  In
the event that the Servicer determines that a Non-Standard True-Up
Adjustment is required, the Servicer shall, no later than ninety
(90) days prior to the first billing cycle of March of each year,

PUCT to reflect the revised Transition Charges, including any
Amendatory Tariff; and (C) take all reasonable actions and make all
reasonable efforts to effect such Non-Standard True-Up Adjustment
and to enforce the provisions of the Securitization Law and all
Financing Order.  The Servicer shall implement the
revised Transition Charges, if any, resulting from such
Non-Standard True-Up Adjustment on the Non-Standard True-Up
Adjustment Date.  For the avoidance of doubt, no Annual
True-Up Adjustment or Interim True-Up Adjustment shall be
considered a Non-Standard True-Up Adjustment solely because
Transition Charges are allocated under such Annual True-Up
Adjustment or Interim True-Up Adjustment in the same manner as in a
preceding Non-Standard True-Up Adjustment.


 


(iii)           
Mandatory Interim True-Up Adjustments and Filings
.  Within the 30-day period ending on September 1 of each
year, commencing September 1, 2012 and, if there are any Transition

months, nine months and one year after the last Scheduled Final
Payment Date (but in no event later than March 1, 2025), the
Servicer shall (A) update the data and assumptions underlying the
calculation of the Transition Charges, including projected
electricity usage during the next Calculation Period for each TC
Customer Class and including interest and estimated expenses and
fees of the Issuer to be paid during such period, the rate of
delinquencies and write-offs; (B) determine the Periodic Payment
Requirement and Periodic Billing Requirement for the next
Calculation Period based on such updated data and assumptions; and
(C) based upon such updated data and requirements, forecast whether
TC Collections together with available fund balances in the Excess
Funds Subaccount, will be sufficient, (i) to make on a timely basis
all scheduled payments of interest, principal and other amounts
payable in respect of each Outstanding Tranche of Transition Bonds
during such Calculation Period and (ii) to maintain the Capital
Subaccount at the Required Capital Level.  If the
Servicer determines that TC Charges will not be sufficient for such
purposes, the Servicer shall, no later than fifteen (15) days prior
to the end of each such thirty (30) day period (1) determine the
Transition Charges to be allocated to each TC Customer Class during
the next Calculation Period based on such Periodic Billing
Requirement and the terms of the Financing Order and the Tariff,
and in doing so the Servicer shall use the method of allocating
Transition Charges then in effect, including as applicable, the
result of the implementation of the most recent Non-Standard
True-Up Adjustment; (2) make all required notice and other filings
with the PUCT to reflect the revised Transition Charges, including
any Amendatory Tariff; and (3) take all reasonable actions and make
all reasonable efforts to effect such Interim True-Up Adjustment
and to enforce the provisions of the Securitization Law and the
Financing Order.

the Transition Bonds on a timely basis during such Calculation
Period; (b) to replenish any draws upon the Capital Subaccount;
and/or (c) generally to correct any under-collection or
over-collection in order to assure timely payment of Transition

Adjustments .  Whenever the Servicer files an
Amendatory Tariff with the PUCT or implements revised Transition
Charges with notice to the PUCT without filing an Amendatory Tariff
if permitted by the Financing Order, the Servicer shall send a copy
of such filing or notice (together with a copy of all notices and
documents which, in the Servicer’s reasonable judgment, are
material to the adjustments effected by such Amendatory Tariff or
notice) to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Rating
Agencies concurrently therewith.  If, for any reason any
revised Transition Charges are not implemented and effective on the
applicable date set forth herein, the Servicer shall notify the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and each Rating Agency by the end of
the second Servicer Business Day after such applicable
date.

Customers indicating additionally that the Transition Charges are
not owned by such Applicable REP (to the extent that such
Applicable REP does not include such information in the Bills

Applicable REP may from time to time use to communicate with its
respective Customers.

REP responsible for such costs, or the Applicable REP has otherwise
agreed to pay such costs, the Servicer shall pay from its own funds
all costs of preparation and delivery incurred in connection with
clauses (A) and (B) above, including printing and
postage costs as the same may increase or decrease from time to

requested by the Rating Agencies to the extent such information is

change in location.  The Servicer shall make available
for inspection, audit and copying to the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee or their respective duly authorized representatives,
attorneys or auditors the Transition Property Records at such times
during normal business hours as the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee
shall reasonably request and which do not unreasonably interfere
with the Servicer’s normal operations.  Nothing in
this Section 5.02(b) shall affect the obligation of the
Servicer to observe any applicable law (including any PUCT
Regulation) prohibiting disclosure of information regarding the
Customers, and the failure of the Servicer to provide access to
such information as a result of such obligation shall not
constitute a breach of this Section 5.02(b) .

 

(c)           
Release of Documents .  Upon instruction from the
Indenture Trustee in accordance with the Indenture, the Servicer
shall release any Transition Property Records to the Indenture
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee’s agent or the Indenture
Trustee’s designee, as the case may be, at such place or
places as the Indenture Trustee may designate, as soon as
practicable.  Nothing in this Section 5.02(c) shall
affect the obligation of the Servicer to observe any applicable law
(including any PUCT Regulation) prohibiting disclosure of
information regarding the Customers, and the failure of the
Servicer to provide access to such information as a result of such
obligation shall not constitute a breach of this Section
5.02(c) .

 

(d)           
Defending Transition Property Against Claims
.  The Servicer shall institute any action or proceeding
necessary to compel performance by each REP (at the earliest
possible time) and each party to the Intercreditor Agreement of any
of their respective obligations or duties under the Securitization
Law, the Financing Order or the Intercreditor Agreement with
respect to the Transition Property, and the Servicer agrees to take
such legal or administrative actions, including without limitation
defending against or instituting and pursuing
 


 



15





 


 
legal actions
and appearing or testifying at hearings or similar proceedings, as
may be reasonably necessary to block or overturn any attempts to
cause a repeal of, modification of or supplement to the
Securitization Law or the Financing Order.  The costs of
any action described in this Section 5.02(d) shall be
payable from TC Collections as an Operating Expense (and shall not
be deemed to constitute a portion of the Servicing Fee) in
accordance with the Indenture.  The Servicer’s
obligations pursuant to this Section 5.02(d) shall survive
and continue notwithstanding that payment of such Operating Expense
may be delayed pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (it being
understood that the Servicer may be required initially to advance
its own funds to satisfy its obligations hereunder).

 

(e)           
Additional Litigation to Defend Transition Property
.  In addition to the above, the Servicer shall, at its
own expense, institute any action or proceeding necessary to compel
performance by the PUCT or the State of Texas of any of their
respective obligations or duties under the Securitization Law or
the Financing Order with respect to the Transition Property, and to
compel performance by REPs with any of their respective obligations
or duties under the Tariff or any agreement with the Servicer
entered into pursuant to the Tariff.  In any proceedings
related to the exercise of the power of eminent domain by any
municipality to acquire a portion of TCC’s electric
distribution facilities, the Servicer shall assert that the court
ordering such condemnation must treat such municipality as a
successor to TCC under the Securitization Law and Financing
Order.

 

SECTION
5.03.                                
Custodian’s Indemnification .  The Servicer
as custodian shall indemnify the Issuer, any Independent Manager
and the Indenture Trustee (for itself and for the benefit of the
Holders) and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees and agents for, and defend and hold harmless each such
Person from and against, any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, payments and claims, and reasonable costs or
expenses, of any kind whatsoever (collectively, “
Indemnified Losses ”) that may be imposed on, incurred
by or asserted against each such Person as the result of any
negligent act or omission in any way relating to the maintenance
and custody by the Servicer, as custodian, of the Transition
Property Records; provided , however , that the
Servicer shall not be liable for any portion of any such amount
resulting from the willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence of
the Issuer, any Independent Manager or the Indenture Trustee, as
the case may be.

 

Indemnification under this Section 5.03
shall survive resignation or removal of the Indenture Trustee or
any Independent Manager and shall include reasonable out-of-pocket
fees and expenses of investigation and litigation (including
reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses).

 

SECTION
5.04.                                
Effective Period and Termination .  The
Servicer’s appointment as custodian shall become effective as
of the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect
until terminated pursuant to this Section 5.04
.  If the Servicer shall resign as Servicer in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement or if all of the rights and
obligations of the Servicer shall have been terminated under
Section 7.01 , the appointment of the Servicer as custodian
shall be terminated effective as of the date on which the
termination or resignation of the Servicer is
effective.  Additionally, if not sooner terminated as
provided above, the Servicer’s obligations as Custodian shall
terminate one year and one day after the date on which no
Transition Bonds are Outstanding.

SECTION
6.01.                                
Representations and Warranties of Servicer .  The
Servicer makes the following representations and warranties, as of
the Closing Date, and as of such other dates as expressly provided
in this Section 6.01 , on which the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee are deemed to have relied in entering into this Agreement
relating to the servicing of the Transition
Property.  The representations and warranties shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the sale of
any Transition Property and the pledge thereof to the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to the Indenture.

 

(a)           
Organization and Good Standing .  The Servicer is
duly organized and validly existing and is in good standing under
the laws of the State of Texas, with the requisite corporate or
other power and authority to own its properties and to conduct its
business as such properties are currently owned and such business
is presently conducted and to execute, deliver and carry out the
terms of this Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement, and had at
all relevant times, and has, the requisite power, authority and
legal right to service the Transition Property and to hold the
Transition Property Records as custodian.

 

(b)           
Due Qualification .  The Servicer is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing, and has obtained
all necessary licenses and approvals, in all jurisdictions in which
the ownership or lease of property or the conduct of its business
(including the servicing of the Transition Property as required by
this Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement) shall require such
qualifications, licenses or approvals (except where the failure to
so qualify would not be reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Servicer’s business, operations,
assets, revenues or properties or to its servicing of the
Transition Property).

 

(c)           
Power and Authority .  The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of the Servicer under its
organizational or governing documents and laws.

 

(d)           
Binding Obligation .  Each of this Agreement and
the Intercreditor Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Servicer enforceable against the Servicer in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and other laws
relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally from
time to time in effect and to general principles of equity
(including concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and
fair dealing), regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law.

 

(e)           
No Violation .  The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Intercreditor
Agreement (to the extent applicable to the Servicer’s
responsibilities thereunder) and the fulfillment of the terms of
each will not conflict with, result in any breach of any of the
terms and provisions of, nor constitute (with or without notice or
lapse of time) a default under, the organizational documents of the
Servicer, or any indenture or other agreement or instrument to
which the Servicer is a party or by which it or any of its property
is bound; nor result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon
any of its properties pursuant to the terms of any such indenture,
agreement or other instrument (other than any Lien
 


 



17





 


 
that may be
granted under the Basic Documents or any Lien created pursuant to
Section 39.309 of the Securitization Law); nor violate any existing
law or any existing order, rule or regulation applicable to the
Servicer of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the
Servicer or its properties.

 

(f)           
No Proceedings .  There are no proceedings pending
and, to the Servicer’s knowledge, there are no proceedings
threatened and, to the Servicer’s knowledge, there are no
investigations pending or threatened, before any Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction over the Servicer or its properties
involving or relating to the Servicer or the Issuer or, to the
Servicer’s knowledge, any other Person: (i) asserting the
invalidity of this Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents,
(ii) seeking to prevent the issuance of the Transition Bonds or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents, (iii) seeking any
determination or ruling that could reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the performance by the Servicer of
its obligations under, or the validity or enforceability of, this
Agreement, any of the other Basic Documents or the Transition Bonds
or (iv) seeking to adversely affect the federal income tax or state
income or franchise tax classification of the Transition Bonds as
debt.

 

(g)           
Approvals .  No governmental approval,
authorization, consent, order or other action of, or filing with,
any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution and delivery by the Servicer of this Agreement or the
Intercreditor Agreement, the performance by the Servicer of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the fulfillment by
the Servicer of the terms of each, except those that have been
obtained or made, those that the Servicer is required to make in
the future pursuant to Article IV and those that the
Servicer may need to file in the future to continue the
effectiveness of any financing statement filed under the
UCC.

 

(h)           
Reports and Certificates .  Each report and
certificate delivered in connection with the Issuance Advice Letter
or delivered in connection with any filing made to the PUCT by the
Issuer with respect to the Transition Charges or True-Up
Adjustments will constitute a representation and warranty by the
Servicer that each such report or certificate, as the case may be,
is true and correct in all material respects; provided ,
however , that to the extent any such report or certificate
is based in part upon or contains assumptions, forecasts or other
predictions of future events, the representation and warranty of
the Servicer with respect thereto will be limited to the
representation and warranty that such assumptions, forecasts or
other predictions of future events are reasonable based upon
historical performance (and facts known to the Servicer on the date
such report or certificate is delivered).

 

SECTION
6.02.                                
Indemnities of Servicer; Release of Claims .  (a)
The Servicer shall be liable in accordance herewith only to the
extent of the obligations specifically undertaken by the Servicer
under this Agreement.

 

(b)           The
Servicer shall indemnify the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee (for
itself and for the benefit of the Holders) and any Independent
Manager, and each of their respective trustees, officers,
directors, employees and agents (each, an “ Indemnified
Person ”) for, and defend and hold harmless each such
Person from and against, any and all Indemnified Losses imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against any such Person as a result of (i)
the Servicer’s
 


 



18





 


 
willful
misconduct, bad faith or negligence in the performance of its
duties or observance of its covenants under this Agreement or its
reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this
Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) the Servicer’s
breach of any of its representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement, (iii) any litigation
or related expenses relating to the Servicer’s status or
obligations as Servicer (other than any proceeding the Servicer is
required to institute under the Servicing Agreement) or (iv) any
finding that interest payable to a REP with respect to disputed
funds must be paid by the Issuer or from the Transition Property,
except to the extent of Indemnified Losses either resulting from
the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of such
Person seeking indemnification hereunder or resulting from a breach
of a representation or warranty made by such Person seeking
indemnification hereunder in any of the Basic Documents that gives
rise to the Servicer’s breach.

 

(c)           For
purposes of Section 6.02(b) , in the event of the
termination of the rights and obligations of TCC (or any successor
thereto pursuant to Section 6.03) as Servicer pursuant to
Section 7.01 , or a resignation by such Servicer pursuant to
this Agreement, such Servicer shall be deemed to be the Servicer
pending appointment of a successor Servicer pursuant to
Section 7.02 .

 

(d)           Indemnification
under this Section 6.02 shall survive any repeal of,
modification of, or supplement to, or judicial invalidation of, the
Securitization Law or the Financing Order and shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Indenture Trustee or any Independent
Manager or the termination of this Agreement and shall include
reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses of investigation and
litigation (including reasonable attorney’s fees and
expenses).

 

(e)           Except
to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement or the other
Basic Documents (including the Servicer’s claims with respect
to the Servicing Fee, reimbursement for any Excess Remittance,
reimbursement for costs incurred pursuant to Section 5.02(d)
and the payment of the purchase price of Transition Property), the
Servicer hereby releases and discharges the Issuer, any Independent
Manager and the Indenture Trustee, and each of their respective
officers, directors and agents (collectively, the “
Released Parties ”) from any and all actions, claims
and demands whatsoever, whenever arising, which the Servicer, in
its capacity as Servicer or otherwise, shall or may have against
any such Person relating to the Transition Property or the
Servicer’s activities with respect thereto other than any
actions, claims and demands arising out of the willful misconduct,
bad faith or gross negligence of the Released Parties.

 

(f)           Promptly
after receipt by an Indemnified Person of notice (or, in the case
of the Indenture Trustee, receipt of notice by a Responsible
Officer only) of the commencement of any action, proceeding or
investigation, such Indemnified Person shall, if a claim in respect
thereof is to be made against the Servicer under this Section
6.02 , notify the Servicer in writing of the commencement
thereof.  Failure by an Indemnified Person to so notify
the Servicer shall relieve the Servicer from the obligation to
indemnify and hold harmless such Indemnified Person under this
Section 6.02 only to the extent that the Servicer suffers
actual prejudice as a result of such failure. With respect to any
action, proceeding or investigation brought by a third party for
which indemnification may be sought under this Section 6.02
, the Servicer shall be entitled to
 


 



19





 


 
conduct and
control, at its expense and with counsel of its choosing that is
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, the defense of
any such action, proceeding or investigation (in which case the
Servicer shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and
expenses of any separate counsel retained by the Indemnified Person
except as set forth below); provided that the Indemnified Person
shall have the right to participate in such action, proceeding or
investigation through counsel chosen by it and at its own expense.
Notwithstanding the Servicer’s election to assume the defense
of any action, proceeding or investigation, the Indemnified Person
shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local
counsel), and the Servicer shall bear the reasonable fees, costs
and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the defendants in any
such action include both the Indemnified Person and the Servicer
and the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that
there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from
or additional to those available to the Servicer, (ii) the Servicer
shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person within a
reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action,
(iii) the Servicer shall authorize the Indemnified Person to employ
separate counsel at the expense of the Servicer or (iv) in the case
of the Indenture Trustee, such action exposes the Indenture Trustee
to a material risk of criminal liability or forfeiture or a
Servicer Default has occurred and is
continuing.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer
shall not be obligated to pay for the fees, costs and expenses of
more than one separate counsel for the Indemnified Persons other
than one local counsel, if appropriate.

 

(g)           The
Servicer shall indemnify the PUCT (for the benefit of Customers)
for, and defend and hold harmless against, any and all Indemnified
Losses that may be imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against
the PUCT, including any increase in the Servicing Fee that becomes
payable pursuant to Section 6.06 , as a result of a Servicer
Default resulting from the Servicer’s willful misconduct, bad
faith or negligence in performance of its duties or observance of
its covenants under this Agreement.  The indemnification
obligation set forth in this paragraph may be enforced by the PUCT
but is not enforceable by any REP or any Customer.  Any
indemnity payments made to the PUCT under this paragraph for the
benefit of Customers shall be remitted to the Indenture Trustee
promptly for deposit into the Collection Account.

 

SECTION
6.03.                                
Binding Effect of Servicing Obligations .  The
obligations to continue to provide service and to collect and
account for Transition Charges will be binding upon the Servicer
and any other entity that provides transmission and distribution
services or direct wire services to a Person that was a retail
customer of TCC located within TCC’s certificated service
area on May 1, 1999 (except for former customers not taking service
from TCC by reason of taking service from Sharyland Utilities, L.P.
pursuant to Commission Action in Docket No. 20292) or that became a
retail customer for electric services within such area after May 1,
1999 and is still located within such area, and to the successor of
any such other entity.  Any Person (a) into which the
Servicer may be merged, converted or consolidated and which is a
Permitted Successor, (b) that may result from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Servicer shall be a party
and which is a Permitted Successor, (c) that may succeed
