2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

Next Generation of ETF Investing

                Over the last two decades, investors have increasingly turned to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) seeking to benefit from a defined strategy, diversified exposure to stocks, tax efficiency and low costs. Today, we combine the potential benefits of ETFs with the advanced strategies of Goldman Sachs Asset Managment (GSAM).
            









What Are the Potential Benefits of ETFs?





ETFs have grown in popularity due to the many benefits they offer: intraday trading ease, relative transparency and a likelihood of tax efficiency—all typically at lower total cost than most actively managed mutual funds.
 











The Four Ts

We note that ETFs are not riskless investments, so investors can lose money. Please see the ETF Risk Disclosures for additional risk considerations in the end disclosures. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.
Goldman Sachs does not provide legal, tax or accounting advice to its clients. All investors are strongly urged to consult with their legal, tax, or accounting advisors regarding any potential transactions or investments. There is no assurance that the tax status or treatment of a proposed transaction or investment will continue in the future. Tax treatment or status may be changed by law or government action in the future or on a retroactive basis.










Exponential Growth of the ETF Market





Developed in the early 1990s with lower cost, transparency and tax efficiency in mind, today there are ETFs representing both broad and narrow sectors of the market, and hundreds of ways to diversify. With $2 trillion in investor assets, it’s safe to say that ETFs are here to stay.

Next Generation of Equity Index Investing

                GSAM has developed a series of ETFs built on smart beta1 principles—a transparent, rules-based strategy that goes beyond stocks’ market capitalization, resulting in a more economically intuitive way to invest.

Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs















Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs

 / 






















Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs





These ETFs are designed to track an ActiveBeta® Index, a proprietary performance-seeking methodology from Goldman Sachs, which tilts towards stocks based on four well-established drivers of performance, often referred to as factors.








The Four Factors














The Advantages of Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ Investing









Opportunity to Outperform the Market




To construct the ActiveBeta® Index, GSAM employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify and emphasize stocks within the market-cap weighted universe, potentially providing greater returns.
 









A Diversified Approach




Individual factors can be cyclical in the short run, which may lead to timing and performance challenges. Combining four complementary smart beta factors equally can potentially result in a more consistent investment experience over time.
 









Lower Cost




Not only are ActiveBeta™ ETFs a fraction of the price of most smart beta ETFs, they are also among the most competitively priced products on the market.2

Next Generation Fixed Income Investing

                GSAM now offers the next generation, smart beta Access ETFs that seek better risk-adjusted returns to help meet the needs of today’s fixed income investor.
            









Access ETFs by Goldman Sachs





GSAM’s Access ETFs can help investors build efficient fixed income portfolios. Going a step further than traditional market-value weighted methodology, a smart beta approach selects bonds based on liquidity and customized fundamentals.














The Advantages of Goldman Sachs Fixed Income Investing









Smarter Access to Bond Markets




The index employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify an investible universe, then eliminates issuers with relative deteriorating fundamentals to offer exposure to existing sector or market beta.
 









Seeks Smoother Performance, Less Volatility




As bond investors look for income and diversification, a smart beta approach seeks liquidity while minimizing exposure to factors historically associated with volatility and underperformance.
 









Lower Cost




Access ETFs are among the most competitively priced ETFs on the market. They also offer transparency and can alleviate some of the challenges of buying bonds in the over-the-counter market.3

Please see the end notes for expense ratio and other important disclosures. Category expense ratios represent category averages for all funds in the corporate bond category as defined by Morningstar.

Access to Top Insights

                GSAM developed the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which tracks insights from some of the leading thinkers in the hedge fund universe. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF seeks to track this index and provides exposure to hedge fund managers’ most important long equity ideas.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP)





The fund seeks to track the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which is constructed in accordance with a rules-based methodology derived from concepts previously developed by Goldman Sachs’ Global Investment Research division. The Index is designed to measure the performance of fundamentally-driven hedge fund managers' “Very-Important-Positions” — those positions that appear most frequently among their top 10 long equity holdings. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP) seeks to deliver these high-conviction ideas through the ease, transparency and liquidity of an ETF.









The Advantages of Investing in GVIP














The Fund is not a hedge fund and does not invest in hedge funds.
1. ETFs offer many benefits, including intraday trading, relative transparency and tax efficiency potential, all at typically lower expense ratios than most actively-managed mutual funds.

Access to the Treasury Market

                GSAM developed an ETF that provides access to Treasuries with a maturity of less than a year, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the US Government. Investors in the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF can gain easy access to Treasury markets while avoiding the operational and pricing complexities of US Treasury Auctions and over-the-counter market.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL)





The fund seeks to track the Citi US Treasury 0–1 Year Composite Select Index, which is designed to measure the performance of U.S. Treasury Obligations4 with a maximum remaining maturity of one year. The Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0–1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL) provides access to the Treasury market through a lower cost, convenient and transparent ETF. The fund benefits from the experience of the GSAM Liquidity Solutions team, providing trade execution, price negotiation and security selection in the short-term Treasury market.









The Advantages of Investing in GBIL










Any guarantee on U.S Treasury Obligations applies only to the underlying securities of the Fund if held to maturity and not to the value of the Fund’s shares.
Individual shares may only be purchased and sold in secondary market transactions through brokers; shares trade at market prices rather than NAV; shares may trade at a price greater than or less than NAV; and investors may incur commission costs when buying or selling shares.
The Fund is not a money market fund and does not attempt to maintain a stable net asset value.

Fund Objective

To seek total investment return, comprised of long-term capital appreciation and current income, through investment of at least 80% of its net assets in a diversified portfolio of equity securities.


Fund Strategy

Multi-managed fund that allocates its portfolio assets on an approximately equal basis among several independent investment management organizations (currently five in number) having different investment styles recommended and monitored by ALPS Advisors, Inc., the Fund's investment advisor.


Distribution Policy

Liberty All-Star Equity Fund, Inc.'s current policy, is to pay distributions on its common shares totaling approximately 8 percent of its net asset value per year, payable in four quarterly installments of 2 percent of the Fund's net asset value at the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the Friday prior to each quarterly declaration date. The fixed distributions are not related to the amount of the Fund's net investment income or net realized capital gains or losses and may be taxed as ordinary income up to the amount of the Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits.
If, for any calendar year, the total distributions made under the distribution policy exceed the Fund's net investment income and net realized capital gains, the excess will generally be treated as a non-taxable return of capital, reducing the shareholder's adjusted basis in his or her shares.
If the Fund's net investment income and net realized capital gains for any year exceed the amount  distributed under the distribution policy, the Fund may, in its discretion, retain and not distribute net realized capital gains and pay income tax thereon to the extent of such excess. The Fund retained such excess gains in 1993, 1996 and 1997.

*Cumulative Total Return
Returns for the Funds and the Averages are total returns, which include dividends, after deducting fund expenses. The Funds performance is calculated assuming that a shareholder reinvested all distributions and exercised all primary rights in the Funds rights offerings.
Past performance cannot predict future results. Performance will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of taxes that shareholders would pay on Fund distributions or the sale of Fund shares. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including loss of principal.

What is the Fund's dividend policy?
The current policy is to pay distributions on its shares totaling approximately 6 percent of its net asset value per year, payable in four quarterly installments of 1.5% of the Fund's net asset value at the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the Friday prior to each quarterly declaration date. The fixed distributions are not related to the amount of the Fund's net investment income or net realized capital gains or losses and may be taxed as ordinary income up to the amount of the Fund's current and accumulated earnings and profits. If, for any calendar year, the total distributions made under the distribution policy exceed the Fund's net investment income and net realized capital gains, the excess will generally be treated as a non-taxable return of capital, reducing the shareholder's adjusted basis in his or her shares. If the Fund's net investment income and net realized capital gains for any year exceed the amount distributed under the distribution policy, the Fund may, in its discretion, retain and not distribute net realized capital gains and pay income tax thereon to the extent of such excess.

The Liberty All-Star Equity Fund and Liberty All-Star Growth Fund, Inc. are both closed-end funds.  What does that mean?
A closed-end fund is one that has a fixed number of shares, which are bought and sold on a stock exchange through a broker or other financial intermediary. By contrast, most mutual funds are "open-ended" funds that continually offer new shares to investors and redeem shares when requested by the investor. The All-Star Funds are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, (Liberty All-Star Equity Fund's ticker symbol is USA and Liberty All-Star Growth Fund's ticker symbol is ASG). The Funds are priced just like any other stock traded on an exchange - that is, by the supply and demand for the stock. Open-ended mutual funds are not traded on stock exchanges; rather, purchases and redemptions are transacted at the net asset value by the fund sponsor.
For more information on closed-end funds, you can download the informational brochure: "Understanding the Advantages of Closed-End Funds".

How do I invest in the All-Star Funds? Can I purchase shares directly?
You would initially purchase shares through any financial services provider, such as a full service, online, or discount brokerage firm, that allows you to trade stocks. After your initial purchase, the shares may be transferred to the Funds' transfer agent, Computershare (1-800-542-3863). Once this is done, you may buy and sell shares directly through Computershare. When shares are registered with Computershare, shareholders are able to enroll in the Funds' Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Purchase Plan. This plan allows shareholders to reinvest the Funds' quarterly dividend payments and allows shareholders to purchase additional shares and sell existing shares.
back to the top


How can I find out the Funds' current net asset value?
The net asset value (NAV) of the All-Star Funds are updated daily on this Web site. You can find this information by clicking on our home page. You can also find the NAV using the symbol XUSAX for the All-Star Equity Fund and XASGX for the All-Star Growth Fund.
back to the top


I need to make a change or have questions concerning my account. Who should I contact?
To make changes to your account, you need to contact the brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee your shares are registered with. If your shares are registered with the Funds' transfer agent, Computershare, you can contact them directly at 1-800-542-3863. You can also access your account information through Computershare's website.
back to the top


Can my dividends be reinvested back into the Fund?
Yes. When shares are registered with Computershare, shareholders are able to enroll in the Funds' Automatic Dividend Reinvestment and  Direct Purchase Plan. This plan allows shareholders to reinvest the Funds' quarterly dividend payments and allows shareholders to purchase additional shares and sell existing shares. If your shares are registered with a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you will need to contact that firm regarding reinvestment of your dividends through the Funds' Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
back to the top


Can I get a prospectus for your funds?
We are happy to furnish you with a complete literature packet, however, because both the Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (NYSE: USA ) and the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (NYSE: ASG) are closed-end funds, they are not required to have a current prospectus. However, the literature in the packet will contain everything you need in order to help you make an informed decision about either, or both funds.

Activist Investors Have Targeted The Liberty All-Star Equity Fund - Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (NYSE:USA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Activist Investors Have Targeted The Liberty All-Star Equity FundJul.21.17 | About: Liberty All-Star (USA) George Spritzer, CFA Value, special situations, debtGeorge Spritzer on LinkedInSummarySteven N. Harris has submitted a shareholder proposal to have the fund self-tender for all outstanding shares.Saba Capital has also accumulated shares of the fund and has had recent success with Clough Capital closed-end funds.The USA discount is 12.6% which has narrowed recently, but the discount can easily go to single digits if the activists are successful. The Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA) has received a shareholder proposal from Steven N. Harris who is an activist investor. Mr. Harris is requesting the board of USA to authorize a self-tender offer for all outstanding shares of the Fund at or close to net asset value. If more than 50% of the Fund’s outstanding common shares are submitted for tender, the Board is requested to cancel the tender offer and take steps to cause the Fund to be liquidated or converted into an exchange traded fund (ETF) or an open-end mutual fund. The shareholder proposal is non-binding, but if a large number of shareholders vote in favor of the proposal, it puts a lot of pressure on the Board to authorize some form of tender offer or to take other steps to try to narrow the discount of the Fund. The Fund originally tried to omit this shareholder proposal from the proxy materials, but the SEC ruled that the proposal must be included. Here is a link to the letter sent by the SEC to the Fund. In the most recent SEC filing, only one shareholder owns over 5% of the outstanding shares. It is First Trust Portfolios, which owns 6.1% of the shares outstanding. These shares are spread over a large number of unit trusts, and it is not clear whether First Trust would vote these shares for or against the shareholder proposal. But there are many other well-known closed-end fund activists with smaller holdings in USA as of March 31, 2017, which will most likely support the shareholder proposal. On nasdaq.com, the USA institutional ownership is about 33% of the shares outstanding including the following investors that own more than one million shares and often vote in favor of activist shareholder proposals:   Investor Number of Shares of USA (as of March 31, 2017)     Karpus Management 8,036,686     RiverNorth Capital 6,925,510     Lazard Asset Management 6,533,317     1607 Capital Partners 2,785,622     Saba Capital Management 2,190,809     Relative Value Partners 2,034,624      Bulldog Investors Deschutes Portfolio Strat. Thomas J Herzfeld Adv.   1,571,531 1,085,900 1,051,395      Saba Capital Management has recently become much more active in closed-end fund activism. They recently started a closed-end fund ETF (CEFS) which seeks to outperform index-based closed-end fund products by actively trading the portfolio to capture the widening and narrowing of discounts to net asset value. I checked the latest portfolio of the Saba ETF and found that USA was one of the larger holdings at nearly 10% of the portfolio. Currently, the Saba ETF is still quite small with only $13 million in net assets, but it can give us an idea which closed-end funds are being targeted by activist investors. Liberty All-Star Equity Fund is an unleveraged equity closed-end fund with about $1.26 Billion in assets under management. The primary objective of the fund is to seek total investment return by investing at least 80% of the portfolio in equity securities. (Data below is sourced from the fund sponsor website www.all-starfunds.com unless otherwise stated.) USA is a multi-managed fund that allocates its portfolio assets among several independent investment management organizations that have different investment styles. The fund combines three "value-style" managers and two "growth-style" managers. ALP Advisors. Inc. is the fund's investment advisor and periodically shuffles the underlying management firms based on performance. ALP Advisors has currently allocated the fund's assets to the following five investment firms:   Investment Firm Style Managers   Aristotle Capital Management, LLC Value Howard Gleicher, CFA   Macquarie Investment Management Value D. Tysen Nutt, Jr.   Pzena Investment Management Value Richard S. Pzena, John J. Flynn & Benjamin S. Silver, CFA   Sustainable Growth Advisers, LP Growth George Fraise, Robert Rohn & Gordon Marchand, CFA   TCW Investment Management Company Growth Craig C. Blum, CFA   One disadvantage of this arrangement is that you have to pay two levels of management fees - part of the fee goes to ALP Advisors, which administers the fund and "manages" the underlying managers. And then each underlying manager gets a fee. But the total expense ratio for USA of 1.07% is not unreasonable and is in line with many other equity closed-end funds. This is mainly because the underlying managers get pretty small fees. ALP Advisors splits the investment management fee with the underlying asset managers. Because the total asset size is over $1.2 billion, all four rows in the table are currently used to compute the fee. Here is the investment fee structure:   Average Net Daily Assets Fee to Alpine Fee to Underlying Manager   First $400 million 0.40% 0.40%   Next $400 million 0.36% 0.36%   Next $400 million 0.324% 0.324%   Over $1.2 billion 0.292% 0.292%   It is unclear whether the "manager of manager" approach actually adds value in the long run. I know that Vanguard Investments has used this approach with some of their mutual funds, but they have had mixed results, and is moving more toward using less managers per fund. ALP Advisors must feel the need to justify its fee, so they have an incentive to change the underlying manager roster every few years. Here is an investment style spectrum that lays out how the portfolio assets were distributed among the five underlying managers as of the last year-end. Note how the P/E ratio and price/book value ratio for the total fund lines up pretty closely with the S&P 500 index. 

 The portfolio is largely domestic with some global exposure. Here is the sector breakdown and top 20 portfolio holdings as of May 31, 2017:   Information Technology 24.8%   Financials 16.5%   Health Care 15.1%   Consumer Discretionary 11.9%   Consumer Staples 8.6%   Energy 8.0%   Industrials 6.2%   Materials 3.3%   Real Estate 3.2%   Utilities 1.3%   Telecommunications 1.1%   

 Managed Distribution Policy  The current policy of USA is to pay about 8% of its net asset value per year, payable in four quarterly installments. These distributions are unrelated to the Fund's net investment income or net realized capital gains or losses. If the total distributions for a given year exceed the Fund's investment income and net realized capital gains, the excess will generally be treated as non-taxable return of capital. Alpha Is Generated by High Discount + Distributions The distribution rate of 8.91% along with the 12.6% discount allows investors to capture alpha by recovering a portion of the discount whenever a distribution is paid out. Whenever you recover NAV from a fund selling at a 12.6% discount, the percentage return is 1.00/ 0.874 or about 14.5%. So the discount recapture "alpha" generated from the 8.91% distribution is computed as: (0.0891)*(0.145)=0.0129 or about 1.29% a year in discount recapture. This is more than the 1.07% annualized baseline expense ratio, so you essentially get the fund management for free with an effective expense ratio of -0.22%. Note that this alpha capture occurs even if the discount remains, as long as the fund keeps paying out at the same managed distribution rate. And because of the activist involvement, you may also be able to capture more from the discount if the fund is ever converted into an ETF or an open-end mutual fund. Market Performance The long-term total return NAV performance record for USA has been below the average of its Large Growth peers. Since the fund's managers are changed periodically, it is quite possible that future market performance may improve. But overall, the main attraction of USA now are its discount and high managed distribution policy along with the activist involvement. Because of this, I would treat USA as more of a swing trade instead of a longer-term buy and hold.     USA NAV Performance Large Growth NAV Performance S&P 500   YTD +13.12% +17.54% +11.72%   1 Year +16.56% +20.20% +16.74%   3 Year +6.92% +6.63% +10.03%   5 Year +13.10% +14.04% +14.86%   10 year +4.10% +3.36% +7.06%   15 year +7.82% +8.10% +9.62%   Source: Morningstar Five-Year History Of Discount To Net Asset Value 

 Source: cefconnect Ticker: USA Liberty All-Star Equity Fund Pays Quarterly  Total Assets = $1.262 Billion Annual Distribution (Market) Rate = 8.91% Quarterly Distribution = $0.13 Annual Distribution = $0.52 Fund Expense ratio = 1.07% (Source: cefanalyzer) Discount to NAV = -12.61% Portfolio Turnover rate = 46% (Source: cefconnect) Average 3 month Daily Volume = 622,617 (Source: Yahoo Finance) Average Dollar Volume = $3.62 million No leverage used  The discount to NAV as of the close on July 20 is -12.6%. This is less than the 52-week average discount of -14.94%. The shorter-term three-month discount Z-score is +1.25, which means that the discount to NAV is a little over one standard deviation below the three-month average discount of -13.49%. (Source: cefanalyzer) Because it is an activist-driven play, USA may be a decent buy at current levels, although more active traders may want to wait for a discount level of 14%. It is liquid and very easy to trade. I would consider selling USA if the discount shrinks to 10% or less unless there is an actual open-ending announcement. USA is probably best purchased in a tax deferred IRA account because of its high distribution rate. Marketplace Service For Those Hunting For Yield In April 2016, we launched our marketplace service Yield Hunting: Alternative Income Investing dedicated to yield/income investors who wish to avoid the froth associated with most of the equity market. We encourage investors to utilize the free two-week trial in order to benefit from our yield opportunities within closed-end funds, business development companies, and other niche areas. George Spritzer's top investment ideas are being featured on Alpha Gen Capital's "Yield Hunting" marketplace service. The goal of the offering is to provide a "low-maintenance portfolio" with a yield in excess of 8% on a tax-equivalent basis with capital gain optionality. The core portfolio has generated a high-single-digit yield, while taking approximately half the risk of the S&P 500 on price and one-third on NAV.

Harris has submitted a shareholder proposal to have the fund self-tender for all outstanding shares.Saba Capital has also accumulated shares of the fund and has had recent success with Clough Capital closed-end funds.The USA discount is 12.6% which has narrowed recently, but the discount can easily go to single digits if the activists are successful. The Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA) has received a shareholder proposal from Steven N. Harris who is an activist investor. Mr. Harris is requesting the board of USA to authorize a self-tender offer for all outstanding shares of the Fund at or close to net asset value. If more than 50% of the Fund’s outstanding common shares are submitted for tender, the Board is requested to cancel the tender offer and take steps to cause the Fund to be liquidated or converted into an exchange traded fund (ETF) or an open-end mutual fund. The shareholder proposal is non-binding, but if a large number of shareholders vote in favor of the proposal, it puts a lot of pressure on the Board to authorize some form of tender offer or to take other steps to try to narrow the discount of the Fund. The Fund originally tried to omit this shareholder proposal from the proxy materials, but the SEC ruled that the proposal must be included. Here is a link to the letter sent by the SEC to the Fund. In the most recent SEC filing, only one shareholder owns over 5% of the outstanding shares. It is First Trust Portfolios, which owns 6.1% of the shares outstanding. These shares are spread over a large number of unit trusts, and it is not clear whether First Trust would vote these shares for or against the shareholder proposal. But there are many other well-known closed-end fund activists with smaller holdings in USA as of March 31, 2017, which will most likely support the shareholder proposal. On nasdaq.com, the USA institutional ownership is about 33% of the shares outstanding including the following investors that own more than one million shares and often vote in favor of activist shareholder proposals:   Investor Number of Shares of USA (as of March 31, 2017)     Karpus Management 8,036,686     RiverNorth Capital 6,925,510     Lazard Asset Management 6,533,317     1607 Capital Partners 2,785,622     Saba Capital Management 2,190,809     Relative Value Partners 2,034,624      Bulldog Investors Deschutes Portfolio Strat. Thomas J Herzfeld Adv.   1,571,531 1,085,900 1,051,395      Saba Capital Management has recently become much more active in closed-end fund activism. They recently started a closed-end fund ETF (CEFS) which seeks to outperform index-based closed-end fund products by actively trading the portfolio to capture the widening and narrowing of discounts to net asset value. I checked the latest portfolio of the Saba ETF and found that USA was one of the larger holdings at nearly 10% of the portfolio. Currently, the Saba ETF is still quite small with only $13 million in net assets, but it can give us an idea which closed-end funds are being targeted by activist investors. Liberty All-Star Equity Fund is an unleveraged equity closed-end fund with about $1.26 Billion in assets under management. The primary objective of the fund is to seek total investment return by investing at least 80% of the portfolio in equity securities. (Data below is sourced from the fund sponsor website www.all-starfunds.com unless otherwise stated.) USA is a multi-managed fund that allocates its portfolio assets among several independent investment management organizations that have different investment styles. The fund combines three "value-style" managers and two "growth-style" managers. ALP Advisors. Inc. is the fund's investment advisor and periodically shuffles the underlying management firms based on performance. ALP Advisors has currently allocated the fund's assets to the following five investment firms:   Investment Firm Style Managers   Aristotle Capital Management, LLC Value Howard Gleicher, CFA   Macquarie Investment Management Value D. Tysen Nutt, Jr.   Pzena Investment Management Value Richard S. Pzena, John J. Flynn & Benjamin S. Silver, CFA   Sustainable Growth Advisers, LP Growth George Fraise, Robert Rohn & Gordon Marchand, CFA   TCW Investment Management Company Growth Craig C. Blum, CFA   One disadvantage of this arrangement is that you have to pay two levels of management fees - part of the fee goes to ALP Advisors, which administers the fund and "manages" the underlying managers. And then each underlying manager gets a fee. But the total expense ratio for USA of 1.07% is not unreasonable and is in line with many other equity closed-end funds. This is mainly because the underlying managers get pretty small fees. ALP Advisors splits the investment management fee with the underlying asset managers. Because the total asset size is over $1.2 billion, all four rows in the table are currently used to compute the fee. Here is the investment fee structure:   Average Net Daily Assets Fee to Alpine Fee to Underlying Manager   First $400 million 0.40% 0.40%   Next $400 million 0.36% 0.36%   Next $400 million 0.324% 0.324%   Over $1.2 billion 0.292% 0.292%   It is unclear whether the "manager of manager" approach actually adds value in the long run. I know that Vanguard Investments has used this approach with some of their mutual funds, but they have had mixed results, and is moving more toward using less managers per fund. ALP Advisors must feel the need to justify its fee, so they have an incentive to change the underlying manager roster every few years. Here is an investment style spectrum that lays out how the portfolio assets were distributed among the five underlying managers as of the last year-end. Note how the P/E ratio and price/book value ratio for the total fund lines up pretty closely with the S&P 500 index. 

 The portfolio is largely domestic with some global exposure. Here is the sector breakdown and top 20 portfolio holdings as of May 31, 2017:   Information Technology 24.8%   Financials 16.5%   Health Care 15.1%   Consumer Discretionary 11.9%   Consumer Staples 8.6%   Energy 8.0%   Industrials 6.2%   Materials 3.3%   Real Estate 3.2%   Utilities 1.3%   Telecommunications 1.1%   

 Managed Distribution Policy  The current policy of USA is to pay about 8% of its net asset value per year, payable in four quarterly installments. These distributions are unrelated to the Fund's net investment income or net realized capital gains or losses. If the total distributions for a given year exceed the Fund's investment income and net realized capital gains, the excess will generally be treated as non-taxable return of capital. Alpha Is Generated by High Discount + Distributions The distribution rate of 8.91% along with the 12.6% discount allows investors to capture alpha by recovering a portion of the discount whenever a distribution is paid out. Whenever you recover NAV from a fund selling at a 12.6% discount, the percentage return is 1.00/ 0.874 or about 14.5%. So the discount recapture "alpha" generated from the 8.91% distribution is computed as: (0.0891)*(0.145)=0.0129 or about 1.29% a year in discount recapture. This is more than the 1.07% annualized baseline expense ratio, so you essentially get the fund management for free with an effective expense ratio of -0.22%. Note that this alpha capture occurs even if the discount remains, as long as the fund keeps paying out at the same managed distribution rate. And because of the activist involvement, you may also be able to capture more from the discount if the fund is ever converted into an ETF or an open-end mutual fund. Market Performance The long-term total return NAV performance record for USA has been below the average of its Large Growth peers. Since the fund's managers are changed periodically, it is quite possible that future market performance may improve. But overall, the main attraction of USA now are its discount and high managed distribution policy along with the activist involvement. Because of this, I would treat USA as more of a swing trade instead of a longer-term buy and hold.     USA NAV Performance Large Growth NAV Performance S&P 500   YTD +13.12% +17.54% +11.72%   1 Year +16.56% +20.20% +16.74%   3 Year +6.92% +6.63% +10.03%   5 Year +13.10% +14.04% +14.86%   10 year +4.10% +3.36% +7.06%   15 year +7.82% +8.10% +9.62%   Source: Morningstar Five-Year History Of Discount To Net Asset Value 

 Source: cefconnect Ticker: USA Liberty All-Star Equity Fund Pays Quarterly  Total Assets = $1.262 Billion Annual Distribution (Market) Rate = 8.91% Quarterly Distribution = $0.13 Annual Distribution = $0.52 Fund Expense ratio = 1.07% (Source: cefanalyzer) Discount to NAV = -12.61% Portfolio Turnover rate = 46% (Source: cefconnect) Average 3 month Daily Volume = 622,617 (Source: Yahoo Finance) Average Dollar Volume = $3.62 million No leverage used  The discount to NAV as of the close on July 20 is -12.6%. This is less than the 52-week average discount of -14.94%. The shorter-term three-month discount Z-score is +1.25, which means that the discount to NAV is a little over one standard deviation below the three-month average discount of -13.49%. (Source: cefanalyzer) Because it is an activist-driven play, USA may be a decent buy at current levels, although more active traders may want to wait for a discount level of 14%. It is liquid and very easy to trade. I would consider selling USA if the discount shrinks to 10% or less unless there is an actual open-ending announcement. USA is probably best purchased in a tax deferred IRA account because of its high distribution rate.

2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

Next Generation of ETF Investing

                Over the last two decades, investors have increasingly turned to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) seeking to benefit from a defined strategy, diversified exposure to stocks, tax efficiency and low costs. Today, we combine the potential benefits of ETFs with the advanced strategies of Goldman Sachs Asset Managment (GSAM).
            









What Are the Potential Benefits of ETFs?





ETFs have grown in popularity due to the many benefits they offer: intraday trading ease, relative transparency and a likelihood of tax efficiency—all typically at lower total cost than most actively managed mutual funds.
 











The Four Ts

We note that ETFs are not riskless investments, so investors can lose money. Please see the ETF Risk Disclosures for additional risk considerations in the end disclosures. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.
Goldman Sachs does not provide legal, tax or accounting advice to its clients. All investors are strongly urged to consult with their legal, tax, or accounting advisors regarding any potential transactions or investments. There is no assurance that the tax status or treatment of a proposed transaction or investment will continue in the future. Tax treatment or status may be changed by law or government action in the future or on a retroactive basis.










Exponential Growth of the ETF Market





Developed in the early 1990s with lower cost, transparency and tax efficiency in mind, today there are ETFs representing both broad and narrow sectors of the market, and hundreds of ways to diversify. With $2 trillion in investor assets, it’s safe to say that ETFs are here to stay.

Next Generation of Equity Index Investing

                GSAM has developed a series of ETFs built on smart beta1 principles—a transparent, rules-based strategy that goes beyond stocks’ market capitalization, resulting in a more economically intuitive way to invest.

Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs















Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs

 / 






















Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs





These ETFs are designed to track an ActiveBeta® Index, a proprietary performance-seeking methodology from Goldman Sachs, which tilts towards stocks based on four well-established drivers of performance, often referred to as factors.








The Four Factors














The Advantages of Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ Investing









Opportunity to Outperform the Market




To construct the ActiveBeta® Index, GSAM employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify and emphasize stocks within the market-cap weighted universe, potentially providing greater returns.
 









A Diversified Approach




Individual factors can be cyclical in the short run, which may lead to timing and performance challenges. Combining four complementary smart beta factors equally can potentially result in a more consistent investment experience over time.
 









Lower Cost




Not only are ActiveBeta™ ETFs a fraction of the price of most smart beta ETFs, they are also among the most competitively priced products on the market.2

Next Generation Fixed Income Investing

                GSAM now offers the next generation, smart beta Access ETFs that seek better risk-adjusted returns to help meet the needs of today’s fixed income investor.
            









Access ETFs by Goldman Sachs





GSAM’s Access ETFs can help investors build efficient fixed income portfolios. Going a step further than traditional market-value weighted methodology, a smart beta approach selects bonds based on liquidity and customized fundamentals.














The Advantages of Goldman Sachs Fixed Income Investing









Smarter Access to Bond Markets




The index employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify an investible universe, then eliminates issuers with relative deteriorating fundamentals to offer exposure to existing sector or market beta.
 









Seeks Smoother Performance, Less Volatility




As bond investors look for income and diversification, a smart beta approach seeks liquidity while minimizing exposure to factors historically associated with volatility and underperformance.
 









Lower Cost




Access ETFs are among the most competitively priced ETFs on the market. They also offer transparency and can alleviate some of the challenges of buying bonds in the over-the-counter market.3

Access to Top Insights

                GSAM developed the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which tracks insights from some of the leading thinkers in the hedge fund universe. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF seeks to track this index and provides exposure to hedge fund managers’ most important long equity ideas.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP)





The fund seeks to track the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which is constructed in accordance with a rules-based methodology derived from concepts previously developed by Goldman Sachs’ Global Investment Research division. The Index is designed to measure the performance of fundamentally-driven hedge fund managers' “Very-Important-Positions” — those positions that appear most frequently among their top 10 long equity holdings. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP) seeks to deliver these high-conviction ideas through the ease, transparency and liquidity of an ETF.









The Advantages of Investing in GVIP














The Fund is not a hedge fund and does not invest in hedge funds.
1. ETFs offer many benefits, including intraday trading, relative transparency and tax efficiency potential, all at typically lower expense ratios than most actively-managed mutual funds.

Access to the Treasury Market

                GSAM developed an ETF that provides access to Treasuries with a maturity of less than a year, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the US Government. Investors in the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF can gain easy access to Treasury markets while avoiding the operational and pricing complexities of US Treasury Auctions and over-the-counter market.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL)





The fund seeks to track the Citi US Treasury 0–1 Year Composite Select Index, which is designed to measure the performance of U.S. Treasury Obligations4 with a maximum remaining maturity of one year. The Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0–1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL) provides access to the Treasury market through a lower cost, convenient and transparent ETF. The fund benefits from the experience of the GSAM Liquidity Solutions team, providing trade execution, price negotiation and security selection in the short-term Treasury market.









The Advantages of Investing in GBIL










Any guarantee on U.S Treasury Obligations applies only to the underlying securities of the Fund if held to maturity and not to the value of the Fund’s shares.
Individual shares may only be purchased and sold in secondary market transactions through brokers; shares trade at market prices rather than NAV; shares may trade at a price greater than or less than NAV; and investors may incur commission costs when buying or selling shares.
The Fund is not a money market fund and does not attempt to maintain a stable net asset value.

Investments/Insurance: Not FDIC Insured • Not Bank Issued, Guaranteed or Underwritten • May Lose Value



Morningstar® is an independent service that rates mutual funds and other types of investments. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.



Automatic investment plans don't assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.



Asset allocation funds may change portfolio holding allocations on a frequent basis, resulting in high portfolio turnover and more brokerage commissions from an increased amount of the purchasing and selling of securities. The Fund may have a higher proportion of capital gains and a potentially lower return than a fund that does not have a reallocation policy.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
