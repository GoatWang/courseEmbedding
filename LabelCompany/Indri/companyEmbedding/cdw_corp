We’ve come a long way from the days when a computer was the size of a large room. In 1946, a computer needed an estimated 174 kilowatts to run; a modern 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro uses 43 watts—a more than 400,000% change. A tablet consumes even less.
As size and energy consumption have decreased, variety has increased. Businesses and consumers now have myriad options at their fingertips, with new features emerging every year. Need something portable? Try a notebook computer. Want something desk-bound but space-saving? You can browse all-in-one desktop computers or even thin clients. Just looking for something light? Try an ultrabook for a balance of power and weight. 
CDW knows your business has specific needs, which is why we carry a wide selection of computers from the industry’s top brands, including Apple,  Lenovo and HP. And don’t forget to check out our Deal of the Week for special discounts on everything from workstations to tablet PCs.

History[edit]
CDW was originally incorporated as "MPK Computing" by its founder Michael Krasny. It later became Computer Discount Warehouse and then simply CDW.[3]
In early 2006, CDW opened a 513,000-square-foot (47,700 m2) distribution center in North Las Vegas, Nevada. The Vernon Hills, Illinois distribution center is roughly 450,000 square feet (42,000 m2). In October 2006 CDW acquired Berbee, a top tier reseller of IBM, Cisco, and Microsoft products and services. It was CDW's second major acquisition after purchasing Micro Warehouse in September 2003.
On 12 October 2007, Chicago based private equity firms Madison Dearborn Partners and Providence Equity Partners completed a $7 billion acquisition of CDW.[4] It went public again through an initial public offering on the NASDAQ market on July 2, 2013 under the name CDW Corporation (the parent company since 2010).[3][5] CDW LLC and CDW Finance Corporation are wholly owned subsidiaries.[6]
CDW operates in Canada as CDW Canada Incorporated, based in Etobicoke, Ontario.[7] CDW Canada was recognized by the Great Place to Work Institute as one of the best workplaces in Canada in 2011, ranked 25th in the category of large and multinational companies.[8]
On 3 August 2015 the company announced that it had acquired the remaining 65 percent of Kelway Ltd., a London based multinational business with significant presence in the IT sector. Eight months earlier, CDW had bought a 35 percent stake in Kelway.[9]
Berbee Information Networks Corporation[edit]
Berbee Information Networks Corporation, an American company specializing in IT, was purchased by CDW in 2006. Prior to that it was a privately held company headquartered in Fitchburg, Wisconsin. Berbee was founded in 1993 by James G. Berbee and grew to over 300 million USD in revenue and more than 800 employees. Berbee's IT solutions included network infrastructure, systems and storage, productivity applications, communication and collaboration, application development, and security. Its data centers delivered hosted applications, co-location, and managed services. Berbee had offices in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. In October 2006, Berbee accepted an $175 million all-cash acquisition offer from CDW.[10] It became a division of CDW and is now known as CDW Advanced Technology Services. The Berbee Voice-Over IP software product group, creator of the InformaCast family of IP notification solutions, was spun off to form the new company Singlewire Software in April, 2009.
Non-profit[edit]
CDW Non-Profit, a sector founded in 2007, assists in providing affordable technology tools and services to associations, foundations, governmental departments, religious and social service organizations.[11] The Brookings Institution, Salvation Army, PCAOB, Aids Healthcare Foundation, The Metropolitan Museum of Art and American Heart Association are among some of their clients.[12]

History[edit]
CDW was originally incorporated as "MPK Computing" by its founder Michael Krasny. It later became Computer Discount Warehouse and then simply CDW.[3]
In early 2006, CDW opened a 513,000-square-foot (47,700 m2) distribution center in North Las Vegas, Nevada. The Vernon Hills, Illinois distribution center is roughly 450,000 square feet (42,000 m2). In October 2006 CDW acquired Berbee, a top tier reseller of IBM, Cisco, and Microsoft products and services. It was CDW's second major acquisition after purchasing Micro Warehouse in September 2003.
On 12 October 2007, Chicago based private equity firms Madison Dearborn Partners and Providence Equity Partners completed a $7 billion acquisition of CDW.[4] It went public again through an initial public offering on the NASDAQ market on July 2, 2013 under the name CDW Corporation (the parent company since 2010).[3][5] CDW LLC and CDW Finance Corporation are wholly owned subsidiaries.[6]
CDW operates in Canada as CDW Canada Incorporated, based in Etobicoke, Ontario.[7] CDW Canada was recognized by the Great Place to Work Institute as one of the best workplaces in Canada in 2011, ranked 25th in the category of large and multinational companies.[8]
On 3 August 2015 the company announced that it had acquired the remaining 65 percent of Kelway Ltd., a London based multinational business with significant presence in the IT sector. Eight months earlier, CDW had bought a 35 percent stake in Kelway.[9]
Berbee Information Networks Corporation[edit]
Berbee Information Networks Corporation, an American company specializing in IT, was purchased by CDW in 2006. Prior to that it was a privately held company headquartered in Fitchburg, Wisconsin. Berbee was founded in 1993 by James G. Berbee and grew to over 300 million USD in revenue and more than 800 employees. Berbee's IT solutions included network infrastructure, systems and storage, productivity applications, communication and collaboration, application development, and security. Its data centers delivered hosted applications, co-location, and managed services. Berbee had offices in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. In October 2006, Berbee accepted an $175 million all-cash acquisition offer from CDW.[10] It became a division of CDW and is now known as CDW Advanced Technology Services. The Berbee Voice-Over IP software product group, creator of the InformaCast family of IP notification solutions, was spun off to form the new company Singlewire Software in April, 2009.
Non-profit[edit]
CDW Non-Profit, a sector founded in 2007, assists in providing affordable technology tools and services to associations, foundations, governmental departments, religious and social service organizations.[11] The Brookings Institution, Salvation Army, PCAOB, Aids Healthcare Foundation, The Metropolitan Museum of Art and American Heart Association are among some of their clients.[12]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.
Zacks Style Scores Education - Learn more about the Zacks Style Scores


The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

History[edit]
CDW was originally incorporated as "MPK Computing" by its founder Michael Krasny. It later became Computer Discount Warehouse and then simply CDW.[3]
In early 2006, CDW opened a 513,000-square-foot (47,700 m2) distribution center in North Las Vegas, Nevada. The Vernon Hills, Illinois distribution center is roughly 450,000 square feet (42,000 m2). In October 2006 CDW acquired Berbee, a top tier reseller of IBM, Cisco, and Microsoft products and services. It was CDW's second major acquisition after purchasing Micro Warehouse in September 2003.
On 12 October 2007, Chicago based private equity firms Madison Dearborn Partners and Providence Equity Partners completed a $7 billion acquisition of CDW.[4] It went public again through an initial public offering on the NASDAQ market on July 2, 2013 under the name CDW Corporation (the parent company since 2010).[3][5] CDW LLC and CDW Finance Corporation are wholly owned subsidiaries.[6]
CDW operates in Canada as CDW Canada Incorporated, based in Etobicoke, Ontario.[7] CDW Canada was recognized by the Great Place to Work Institute as one of the best workplaces in Canada in 2011, ranked 25th in the category of large and multinational companies.[8]
On 3 August 2015 the company announced that it had acquired the remaining 65 percent of Kelway Ltd., a London based multinational business with significant presence in the IT sector. Eight months earlier, CDW had bought a 35 percent stake in Kelway.[9]
Berbee Information Networks Corporation[edit]
Berbee Information Networks Corporation, an American company specializing in IT, was purchased by CDW in 2006. Prior to that it was a privately held company headquartered in Fitchburg, Wisconsin. Berbee was founded in 1993 by James G. Berbee and grew to over 300 million USD in revenue and more than 800 employees. Berbee's IT solutions included network infrastructure, systems and storage, productivity applications, communication and collaboration, application development, and security. Its data centers delivered hosted applications, co-location, and managed services. Berbee had offices in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. In October 2006, Berbee accepted an $175 million all-cash acquisition offer from CDW.[10] It became a division of CDW and is now known as CDW Advanced Technology Services. The Berbee Voice-Over IP software product group, creator of the InformaCast family of IP notification solutions, was spun off to form the new company Singlewire Software in April, 2009.
Non-profit[edit]
CDW Non-Profit, a sector founded in 2007, assists in providing affordable technology tools and services to associations, foundations, governmental departments, religious and social service organizations.[11] The Brookings Institution, Salvation Army, PCAOB, Aids Healthcare Foundation, The Metropolitan Museum of Art and American Heart Association are among some of their clients.[12]

History[edit]
CDW was originally incorporated as "MPK Computing" by its founder Michael Krasny. It later became Computer Discount Warehouse and then simply CDW.[3]
In early 2006, CDW opened a 513,000-square-foot (47,700 m2) distribution center in North Las Vegas, Nevada. The Vernon Hills, Illinois distribution center is roughly 450,000 square feet (42,000 m2). In October 2006 CDW acquired Berbee, a top tier reseller of IBM, Cisco, and Microsoft products and services. It was CDW's second major acquisition after purchasing Micro Warehouse in September 2003.
On 12 October 2007, Chicago based private equity firms Madison Dearborn Partners and Providence Equity Partners completed a $7 billion acquisition of CDW.[4] It went public again through an initial public offering on the NASDAQ market on July 2, 2013 under the name CDW Corporation (the parent company since 2010).[3][5] CDW LLC and CDW Finance Corporation are wholly owned subsidiaries.[6]
CDW operates in Canada as CDW Canada Incorporated, based in Etobicoke, Ontario.[7] CDW Canada was recognized by the Great Place to Work Institute as one of the best workplaces in Canada in 2011, ranked 25th in the category of large and multinational companies.[8]
On 3 August 2015 the company announced that it had acquired the remaining 65 percent of Kelway Ltd., a London based multinational business with significant presence in the IT sector. Eight months earlier, CDW had bought a 35 percent stake in Kelway.[9]
Berbee Information Networks Corporation[edit]
Berbee Information Networks Corporation, an American company specializing in IT, was purchased by CDW in 2006. Prior to that it was a privately held company headquartered in Fitchburg, Wisconsin. Berbee was founded in 1993 by James G. Berbee and grew to over 300 million USD in revenue and more than 800 employees. Berbee's IT solutions included network infrastructure, systems and storage, productivity applications, communication and collaboration, application development, and security. Its data centers delivered hosted applications, co-location, and managed services. Berbee had offices in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. In October 2006, Berbee accepted an $175 million all-cash acquisition offer from CDW.[10] It became a division of CDW and is now known as CDW Advanced Technology Services. The Berbee Voice-Over IP software product group, creator of the InformaCast family of IP notification solutions, was spun off to form the new company Singlewire Software in April, 2009.
Non-profit[edit]
CDW Non-Profit, a sector founded in 2007, assists in providing affordable technology tools and services to associations, foundations, governmental departments, religious and social service organizations.[11] The Brookings Institution, Salvation Army, PCAOB, Aids Healthcare Foundation, The Metropolitan Museum of Art and American Heart Association are among some of their clients.[12]

History[edit]
CDW was originally incorporated as "MPK Computing" by its founder Michael Krasny. It later became Computer Discount Warehouse and then simply CDW.[3]
In early 2006, CDW opened a 513,000-square-foot (47,700 m2) distribution center in North Las Vegas, Nevada. The Vernon Hills, Illinois distribution center is roughly 450,000 square feet (42,000 m2). In October 2006 CDW acquired Berbee, a top tier reseller of IBM, Cisco, and Microsoft products and services. It was CDW's second major acquisition after purchasing Micro Warehouse in September 2003.
On 12 October 2007, Chicago based private equity firms Madison Dearborn Partners and Providence Equity Partners completed a $7 billion acquisition of CDW.[4] It went public again through an initial public offering on the NASDAQ market on July 2, 2013 under the name CDW Corporation (the parent company since 2010).[3][5] CDW LLC and CDW Finance Corporation are wholly owned subsidiaries.[6]
CDW operates in Canada as CDW Canada Incorporated, based in Etobicoke, Ontario.[7] CDW Canada was recognized by the Great Place to Work Institute as one of the best workplaces in Canada in 2011, ranked 25th in the category of large and multinational companies.[8]
On 3 August 2015 the company announced that it had acquired the remaining 65 percent of Kelway Ltd., a London based multinational business with significant presence in the IT sector. Eight months earlier, CDW had bought a 35 percent stake in Kelway.[9]
Berbee Information Networks Corporation[edit]
Berbee Information Networks Corporation, an American company specializing in IT, was purchased by CDW in 2006. Prior to that it was a privately held company headquartered in Fitchburg, Wisconsin. Berbee was founded in 1993 by James G. Berbee and grew to over 300 million USD in revenue and more than 800 employees. Berbee's IT solutions included network infrastructure, systems and storage, productivity applications, communication and collaboration, application development, and security. Its data centers delivered hosted applications, co-location, and managed services. Berbee had offices in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. In October 2006, Berbee accepted an $175 million all-cash acquisition offer from CDW.[10] It became a division of CDW and is now known as CDW Advanced Technology Services. The Berbee Voice-Over IP software product group, creator of the InformaCast family of IP notification solutions, was spun off to form the new company Singlewire Software in April, 2009.
Non-profit[edit]
CDW Non-Profit, a sector founded in 2007, assists in providing affordable technology tools and services to associations, foundations, governmental departments, religious and social service organizations.[11] The Brookings Institution, Salvation Army, PCAOB, Aids Healthcare Foundation, The Metropolitan Museum of Art and American Heart Association are among some of their clients.[12]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
