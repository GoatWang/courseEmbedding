"For too many consumers healthcare comes down to three hopes: I hope it's not serious, I hope I can see my doctor, and I hope it's paid for.  We are using technology to create new 24/7 on-demand care delivery models that extend the services of the health system and create new opportunities to serve patients at their time of need."
RALPH C. DERRICKSON
