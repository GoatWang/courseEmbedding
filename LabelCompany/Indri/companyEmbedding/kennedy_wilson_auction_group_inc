Why Buy At Auctions

A Win-Win Proposition for Buyers and Sellers
Real estate auctions provide great advantages for buyers and sellers.
For buyers, they determine the purchase price. Also, the auction’s open forum allows the buyer to know the true value of a property since they are seeing first-hand what others are willing to pay. For sellers, auctions accelerate the sales process and they have confidence knowing that buyers are prepared to buy.
How Buyers Benefit:

Buyers determine the purchase price and can often save money
Buyers make smart investments because competitive bidding reveals true market price
The buyer knows the seller is committed to sell
Buyers have the freedom to stop bidding at any time
Auctions eliminate uncertainty of long negotiation periods
Auctions reduce time to purchase property
Purchasing and closing dates are known
Buyers know they are competing on the same terms as all other buyers
Buyers receive comprehensive information on a property and available financing

How Sellers Benefit:

Property sells quickly, reducing long-term carrying costs
Pre-qualified bidders come prepared to buy
Assurance that property will be sold at true market value
Property is viewed by the largest number of people that are in the market to buy
Creates competition among buyers
Requires potential buyers to pre-qualify for financing
The seller knows exactly when the property will sell
Eliminates numerous and unscheduled showings
One-day bidding replaces lengthy time consuming negotiations
