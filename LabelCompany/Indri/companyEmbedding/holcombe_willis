Testing Placement Table- view cut-off scores and appropriate course placement for all test types. PERT Frequently Asked QuestionsClick any of the questions below to view the answer.






What are the required placement scores?

TESTING PLACEMENT TABLE- view cut-off scores and appropriate course placement for all test types. ​

If I initially tested using CPT, do I retest with CPT?

No, you will retest using the PERT.

Should Broward College continue to accept CPT (i.e., College Board ACCUPLACER) scores for placement purposes?

​Yes, the CPT will continue to be an authorized placement assessment as well as SAT and ACT, as indicated in State Board Rule 6A-10.0315, F.A.C.


How many questions will comprise the PERT?

​Each sub-test (i.e., reading, writing and mathematics) will be 30 questions.


How long will the PERT take students to complete?

​It is estimated that students will take 45 minutes to complete each sub-test.

Will placement testing procedures for English for Academic Purposes (EAP) change as a result of PERT?

​Currently, EAP placement procedures are determined by the college and this is expected to continue. EAP students who have taken the LOEP exam will advance to the PERT in accordance with established EAP procedures (PERT replaces the CPT). 


What test will Dual Enrollment students take?  

​Dual Enrolled students will take the PERT as of March 2011 forward.


Are students allowed to re-take the PERT immediately after the initial administration?

Will there be concordance with CPT, SAT and ACT for the PERT?

In addition, he was a former U.S. Marine Corps Captain before he was honorably discharged.
Career[edit]
Holcombe began his teaching career at Ford Junior High School in Brook Park, Ohio. He later joined Florida's State College System, serving as an English professor at Santa Fe College and Broward College, where he eventually became president in 1987.
