Description
BACKGROUND
 [0001]  1. Technical Field
  [0002]  The present disclosure relates to automatic vending machines.
  [0003]  2. Description of Related Art
  [0004]  Automatic vending machines allow customers to buy merchandise twenty four hours a day. When the customer retrieves the merchandise from the automatic vending machine, a helical element in a cabinet is rotated to push the merchandise out of the cabinet. However, a free end of the helical element may be warped or otherwise act to snag or catch on the merchandise, preventing delivery of the merchandise out of the cabinet. Therefore, there is room for improvement within the art.


BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
 [0005]  Many aspects of the embodiments can be better understood with reference to the following drawings. The components in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale, the emphasis instead being placed upon clearly illustrating the principles of the embodiments. Moreover, in the drawings, like reference numerals designate corresponding parts throughout the several views.
  [0006]   FIG. 1 is an exploded, isometric view of an automatic vending machine in accordance with an embodiment.
  [0007]   FIG. 2 is an isometric view of a pressing member of the automatic vending machine of FIG. 1.
  [0008]   FIG. 3 is an assembled view of the automatic vending machine of FIG. 1.
 
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 [0009]  The disclosure is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements. It should be noted that references to “an” or “one” embodiment in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references mean “at least one.”
  [0010]   FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate an automatic vending machine in accordance with an embodiment. The automatic vending machine comprises a cabinet 10, a pressing member 20, a helical element 40, and a driving member 50. For example, the driving member 50 may be a motor.
  [0011]  The cabinet 10 comprises a bottom plate 12, a mounting portion 14 extending from the bottom plate 12, and a rear plate 16 extending from the bottom plate 12. In one embodiment, the mounting portion 14 is substantially L-shaped, and the rear plate 16 is substantially perpendicular to the bottom plate 12. The driving member 50 is secured to the rear plate 16, and the driving member 50 comprises a rotating shaft 52. A first end of the helical element 40 is secured to the rotating shaft 52, so that the helical element 40 can be rotated by the driving member 50. A second end of the helical element 40 is located above the mounting portion 14.
  [0012]  The mounting portion 14 comprises a first flange 141 and a second flange 143 substantially perpendicular to the first flange 141. The first flange 141 and the bottom plate 12 are located on a same plane. A plurality of securing holes 1431 is defined in the second flange 143.
  [0013]  The pressing member 20 comprises a main post 22, a first securing portion 24 extending from a first end of the main post 22, and a second securing portion 26 extending from a second opposite end of the main post 22.
  [0014]  The first securing portion 24 comprises a first extending post 241, a second extending post 242, a third extending post 243, a fourth extending post 244, and a fifth extending post 245. The first extending post 241 extends downward relative to the main post 22. The second extending post 242 substantially perpendicular extends from first extending post 241. The third extending post 243 extends from the second extending post 242 and abuts the second extending post 242, so that the second extending post 242 and the third extending post 243 together define a first clipping portion 246. The fourth extending post 244 substantially perpendicular extends from third extending post 243. The fifth extending post 245 extends substantially perpendicular <fix all> from fourth extending post 241 and is substantially parallel to the third extending post 243. A second clipping portion 2451 extends downward from the fifth extending post 245.
  [0015]  The second securing portion 26 extends upward from the main post 22 and is hung on the rotating shaft 52. In one embodiment, a length of the main post 22 is substantially equal to a length between the rear plate 16 and the first flange 141, that is, the main post 22 is substantially as long as long as the helical element 40.
  [0016]   FIGS. 3-4 illustrate assembly of the automatic vending machine in accordance with an embodiment. In assembly, the pressing member 20 extends into the interior of the helical element 40, and the second securing portion 26 is clipped with the rotating shaft 52. The first clipping portion 246 and the second clipping portion 2451 are engaged in two of the plurality of securing holes 1431, so that the pressing member 20 is secured to the cabinet 10. The main post 22 is substantially parallel to the bottom plate 12 and bears down on the helical element 40, for preventing helical element 40 from becoming warped.
  [0017]  When the helical element 40 is rotated, the helical element 40 is rotated outside the pressing member 20, and the pressing member 20 does not prevent the free rotation of the helical element 40. Items of merchandise are thus supported along the length of the pressing member 20, and the presence of the pressing member 20 under the merchandise acts to stabilize the items of merchandise when being moved.
  [0018]  It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages have been set forth in the foregoing description of embodiments, together with details of the structures and functions of the embodiments, the disclosure is illustrative only and changes may be made in detail, especially in the matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts within the principles of the disclosure to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
