Citizens & Northern Bank
Has to be one of the most greedy banks I have seen! Online banking policy is about the worst.Online banking is always inaccurate,and when confronted about it ,the banks tells you to keep track of your account better,and still charge multiple fee's ! When you call you can almost here them laffing about it. not really ,but you get my point !
