Moissanite History & Facts
 What is Moissanite?Moissanite is a rare, naturally occurring mineral also known as silicon carbide, which was first discovered by the Nobel Prize-winning chemist Dr. Henri Moissan at the site of a massive meteorite strike in Arizona. This intriguing new stone was named moissanite in his honor, and Moissan spent the rest of his life attempting to recreate this rare mineral in his laboratory. It wasn't until the late 90's that scientists - working in a research laboratory located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina - developed the innovative thermal growing process that creates silicon carbide crystals. These crystals are fashioned into moissanite gemstones that rival any natural gemstone for fire and brilliance. These man-made gems are more durable than diamond, sapphire, ruby or emerald. Is moissanite a brand of diamond or a simulated diamond?No. Moissanite is not a substitute for diamond, either scientifically, chemically or emotionally. Charles & Colvard created moissanite is a unique gem with its own set of chemical and optical properties that exhibit more fire and brilliance than any other gemstone.

Moissanite Manufacturing
 How does Charles & Colvard create moissanite?Charles & Colvard is the original creator of moissanite. The process is lengthy, complicated and expensive, which limits the output - it takes two to three months for the creation of a single gem. Charles & Colvard's manufacturing process and years of experience in creating the gemstone currently makes us a leading source and global distributor of created moissanite. In creating moissanite, what steps are taken to ensure the product is of the highest quality?Years of development have led to a rigorous process for the production of created moissanite, which follows exacting specifications and very high standards of quality control. The Charles & Colvard Certificate of Authenticity certifies that every gem is an original product manufactured in meticulously controlled facilities by highly skilled specialists. Post production, all created moissanite undergoes stringent testing for quality and purity, along with numerous rounds of grading before being released for sale. Is moissanite an ideal cut stone?Carefully and precisely faceted, each Charles & Colvard created moissanite gemstone is cut according to the exact angles and proportions specific to moissanite to maximize its brilliance and enhance its incredible fire. How is moissanite graded for clarity?Charles & Colvard employs graduate gemologists certified by the Gemological Institute of America. Each Charles & Colvard gem is studied by trained grading specialists using a 10x jeweler's loupe for any inclusions that may affect moissanite's optical performance.

Moissanite Characteristics

How does moissanite compare to other gemstones on key gemological properties?


The chart below compares moissanite with other popular gemstones, including diamond, ruby, emerald and sapphire, on key characteristics such as hardness, fire and brilliance.

Brilliance
 What property of moissanite makes it sparkle with such exceptional brilliance?The most significant optical property affecting a gemstone's brilliance, or sparkle, is the refractive index or RI. The RI of moissanite ranges from 2.65 to 2.69, meaning it displays more brilliance than diamond (with an RI of 2.42) or any other popular gemstone. Will the brilliance of moissanite ever fade?No. Charles & Colvard provides a Limited Lifetime Warranty which guarantees that every Charles & Colvard created moissanite gemstone will maintain its brilliance and fire forever.

Fire (Dispersion)
 What gives moissanite its fire?A gemstone's fire is determined by a gemological property called dispersion. Dispersion refers to the prism effect that occurs when pure white light enters a non-opaque object, breaks into spectral (rainbow) colors, and reflects back to the viewer. Moissanite's dispersion is 0.104, which exceeds that of any gemstone, including diamond, ruby, sapphire and emerald. Do other gemstones have more fire than Moissanite?Moissanite's fire exceeds that of any popular gemstone, including diamond, ruby, sapphire and emerald. Fire can be measured scientifically; with a dispersion of 0.104, moissanite has 2.4 times the fire of diamond. No other gemstone or jewel compares to Charles and Colvard Created Moissanite® with regard to fire. Will a moissanite gemstone ever lose its fire?No. Charles & Colvard provides a Limited Lifetime Warranty which guarantees that every Charles & Colvard created moissanite gemstone will maintain its fire and brilliance forever.

Color & Clarity
 Will moissanite fade or change color over time?No. There are no likely situations in which the color of moissanite will be permanently changed. Moissanite does undergo a temporary color change when exposed to extreme heat from a jeweler's torch during jewelry repair, but with proper bench techniques there will be no lasting damage, and the stone will return to its normal color once it cools. Is moissanite graded on the GIA diamond color grading scale?There are three grades of moissanite available today: colorless (D-E-F range), near-colorless (G-H-I range) and with faint hues of color (J-K range). Does moissanite have inclusions?Yes. Moissanite can have needle-like inclusions that can be seen under 10x magnification. However, they are not visible to the naked eye and do not affect the clarity of the stone. It's worth noting that nearly every gem has some sort of inclusion. They are unique characteristics, which occur in the formation of the crystalline structure.

Hardness (Resistance to Scratching) & Toughness (Resistance to Breaking)
 Is moissanite resistant to scratching?Yes. Moissanite is durable, tough and extremely resistant to scratching and abrasion. With a hardness of 9.25, moissanite is harder than all other gemstones except diamond. Charles & Colvard provides a Limited Lifetime Warranty that protects against damage to the stone. Does moissanite break easily?No. Moissanite is one of the toughest known gemstones. Studies in high pressure research have shown that moissanite is highly resistant to breaking and chipping. Charles & Colvard provides a Limited Lifetime Warranty that protects against damage to the stone.   Is moissanite heat resistant?Yes. Moissanite exhibits more heat resistance than many other gemstones, including diamond. Tests prove that at 2000ºF - higher than the equivalent intensity of a house fire - moissanite gems remain intact and as brilliant as the day they were created. This heat tolerance makes moissanite unlikely to suffer damage during jewelry repair.

Identifying Moissanite

How can moissanite be distinguished from other colorless gemstones?


There are five (5) methods:

Determine if doubling of facet junctions is visible through magnification.
Use a jeweler’s loupe to examine the girdle of the stone.  Forever One™ and Forever Brilliant® moissanite stones approximately 4.0mm and larger are engraved on the girdle for easy identification.
Examine for needle-like inclusions, typically perpendicular to the table facet, which are visible in moissanite under 10x loupe magnification.
Examine for specific refractive and gravity indices.
Have a trained gemologist or jeweler use a testing device specifically designed to distinguish moissanite from diamond.



Purchasing Moissanite
 What is the difference between Forever One ™, Forever Brilliant® and Forever Classic™ moissanite?Charles & Colvard Forever One moissanite is a triumph of art, science and sustained effort. The structural configuration of this new moissanite material is what yields its unsurpassed, colorless (D-E-F) quality. While chemically it is still silicon carbide (SiC), and its optical and hardness properties remain the same, it is the stacking of SiC material in the manufacturing process that makes Forever One moissanite unlike any of its predecessors. Through its research and development efforts working with Forever One, Charles & Colvard has developed a second grade of Forever One, in G-H-I quality*. This near colorless gemstone emits a faint, icy hue compared to its Forever Brilliant predecessor, which yields a warm hue. This new, near-colorless gemstone is only currently available in limited quantities on the Charles & ColvardÂ® e-commerce website, www.charlesandcolvard.com.  Forever Brilliant moissanite falls within the prized, near-colorless G-H-I range. Forever Brilliant was developed through improvements to the crystal growing process from the original brand of Charles & Colvard created moissanite also known as Forever Classic. Forever Classic offers subtle color shades in the J - K range of the industry color scale, with faint undertones of green, yellow or gray. Forever One D-E-F, Forever Brilliant and Forever Classic moissanite gemstones and jewelry will continue to be made available to wholesale distributors, manufacturers, retailers, TV shopping networks and designers.  *Based on the Gemological Institute of America's diamond grading scale. Are fancy cuts available?Yes. Moissanite is available in various shapes and sizes. The most popular cut continues to be the round brilliant cut, and fancy cuts such as Asscher, cushion, oval and square brilliant are available as well. Why is moissanite sold by millimeter rather than by carat weight?The carat is the traditional unit of measurement for a diamond's weight. Moissanite is not measured in carats because it weighs approximately 10 percent less than diamond. For example, a 6.5mm round diamond would weigh 1.0ct, while a 6.5mm round moissanite would weigh 0.88ct. The two stones would be the same size - 6.5mm in diameter. All stones for sale are listed with their size in millimeters and the diamond equivalent weight (DEW) in carats. Will moissanite retain its value over time?Due to its rarity and unrivaled beauty, Charles & Colvard created moissanite is expected to retain or increase its value over time.

Moissanite Repairs & Care
 How should I care for my moissanite jewelry?You may clean moissanite the same way you would diamond or any other fine gemstone. As with any fine jewelry item, an ultrasonic cleaner can be used. However, it is best to be gentle with your valuable treasures. You can also clean your moissanite jewelry using a commercial (non-acid based) jewelry cleaner or with mild soap and water using a soft toothbrush. Can moissanite withstand repairs and sizing?Yes. Moissanite is an extremely stable material. It is durable, tough and highly resistant to scratching, abrasion, breaking and chipping. Its high heat tolerance makes moissanite very unlikely to experience damage during jewelry repair. Can moissanite gemstones be re-set into new jewelry?Yes. Resetting your moissanite gemstone(s) into a new piece of jewelry can be done by an experienced jeweler. Jewelry designers and manufacturers create their jewelry collections featuring many Charles & Colvard created moissanite using techniques very similar to those practiced by bench jewelers. Can I engrave my moissanite stone?Yes. You can engrave your moissanite stone after your purchase, after all, it is now a part of your personal story. Please be aware that any engraving done post-purchase on the stone will void Charles & Colvard's Limited Lifetime Warranty.

Charles & Colvard Warranty




             Artfully crafted, socially responsible, eternally brilliant. Charles & Colvard is the original creator of moissanite and is dedicated to offering environmentally and ethically responsible choices in the fine jewelry industry. We've been creating moissanite for over 20 years and have spent this time tirelessly refining the way  we produce this  beautiful, man-made gemstone. From our original, classic gems to our unrivaled Forever One gemstones, we're dedicated to creating better products and developing better techniques to enhance the stunning brilliance of our moissanite. Our customers expect, and deserve, nothing less.  Forever One is the epitome of created moissanite. It's formed from a specific structural configuration of silicon carbide and was previously only offered in one grade, colorless. Our new, near-colorless grade gemstone is also cut from this same high quality material, ensuring that no matter what Forever One grade you choose, your stone will be more brilliant than any other gemstone.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 02/01/1998
            

                BBB has determined that Charles & Colvard, Ltd meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Charles & Colvard, Ltd has received 5 out of 5 stars based on 1 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Moissanite History & Facts
 What is Moissanite?Moissanite is a rare, naturally occurring mineral also known as silicon carbide, which was first discovered by the Nobel Prize-winning chemist Dr. Henri Moissan at the site of a massive meteorite strike in Arizona. This intriguing new stone was named moissanite in his honor, and Moissan spent the rest of his life attempting to recreate this rare mineral in his laboratory. It wasn't until the late 90's that scientists - working in a research laboratory located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina - developed the innovative thermal growing process that creates silicon carbide crystals. These crystals are fashioned into moissanite gemstones that rival any natural gemstone for fire and brilliance. These man-made gems are more durable than diamond, sapphire, ruby or emerald. Is moissanite a brand of diamond or a simulated diamond?No. Moissanite is not a substitute for diamond, either scientifically, chemically or emotionally. Charles & Colvard created moissanite is a unique gem with its own set of chemical and optical properties that exhibit more fire and brilliance than any other gemstone.

Moissanite Manufacturing
 How does Charles & Colvard create moissanite?Charles & Colvard is the original creator of moissanite. The process is lengthy, complicated and expensive, which limits the output - it takes two to three months for the creation of a single gem. Charles & Colvard's manufacturing process and years of experience in creating the gemstone currently makes us a leading source and global distributor of created moissanite. In creating moissanite, what steps are taken to ensure the product is of the highest quality?Years of development have led to a rigorous process for the production of created moissanite, which follows exacting specifications and very high standards of quality control. The Charles & Colvard Certificate of Authenticity certifies that every gem is an original product manufactured in meticulously controlled facilities by highly skilled specialists. Post production, all created moissanite undergoes stringent testing for quality and purity, along with numerous rounds of grading before being released for sale. Is moissanite an ideal cut stone?Carefully and precisely faceted, each Charles & Colvard created moissanite gemstone is cut according to the exact angles and proportions specific to moissanite to maximize its brilliance and enhance its incredible fire. How is moissanite graded for clarity?Charles & Colvard employs graduate gemologists certified by the Gemological Institute of America. Each Charles & Colvard gem is studied by trained grading specialists using a 10x jeweler's loupe for any inclusions that may affect moissanite's optical performance.

Moissanite Characteristics

How does moissanite compare to other gemstones on key gemological properties?

Brilliance
 What property of moissanite makes it sparkle with such exceptional brilliance?The most significant optical property affecting a gemstone's brilliance, or sparkle, is the refractive index or RI. The RI of moissanite ranges from 2.65 to 2.69, meaning it displays more brilliance than diamond (with an RI of 2.42) or any other popular gemstone. Will the brilliance of moissanite ever fade?No. Charles & Colvard provides a Limited Lifetime Warranty which guarantees that every Charles & Colvard created moissanite gemstone will maintain its brilliance and fire forever.

Fire (Dispersion)
 What gives moissanite its fire?A gemstone's fire is determined by a gemological property called dispersion. Dispersion refers to the prism effect that occurs when pure white light enters a non-opaque object, breaks into spectral (rainbow) colors, and reflects back to the viewer. Moissanite's dispersion is 0.104, which exceeds that of any gemstone, including diamond, ruby, sapphire and emerald. Do other gemstones have more fire than Moissanite?Moissanite's fire exceeds that of any popular gemstone, including diamond, ruby, sapphire and emerald. Fire can be measured scientifically; with a dispersion of 0.104, moissanite has 2.4 times the fire of diamond. No other gemstone or jewel compares to Charles and Colvard Created Moissanite® with regard to fire. Will a moissanite gemstone ever lose its fire?No. Charles & Colvard provides a Limited Lifetime Warranty which guarantees that every Charles & Colvard created moissanite gemstone will maintain its fire and brilliance forever.

Color & Clarity
 Will moissanite fade or change color over time?No. There are no likely situations in which the color of moissanite will be permanently changed. Moissanite does undergo a temporary color change when exposed to extreme heat from a jeweler's torch during jewelry repair, but with proper bench techniques there will be no lasting damage, and the stone will return to its normal color once it cools. Is moissanite graded on the GIA diamond color grading scale?There are three grades of moissanite available today: colorless (D-E-F range), near-colorless (G-H-I range) and with faint hues of color (J-K range). Does moissanite have inclusions?Yes. Moissanite can have needle-like inclusions that can be seen under 10x magnification. However, they are not visible to the naked eye and do not affect the clarity of the stone. It's worth noting that nearly every gem has some sort of inclusion. They are unique characteristics, which occur in the formation of the crystalline structure.

Hardness (Resistance to Scratching) & Toughness (Resistance to Breaking)
 Is moissanite resistant to scratching?Yes. Moissanite is durable, tough and extremely resistant to scratching and abrasion. With a hardness of 9.25, moissanite is harder than all other gemstones except diamond. Charles & Colvard provides a Limited Lifetime Warranty that protects against damage to the stone. Does moissanite break easily?No. Moissanite is one of the toughest known gemstones. Studies in high pressure research have shown that moissanite is highly resistant to breaking and chipping. Charles & Colvard provides a Limited Lifetime Warranty that protects against damage to the stone.   Is moissanite heat resistant?Yes. Moissanite exhibits more heat resistance than many other gemstones, including diamond. Tests prove that at 2000ºF - higher than the equivalent intensity of a house fire - moissanite gems remain intact and as brilliant as the day they were created. This heat tolerance makes moissanite unlikely to suffer damage during jewelry repair.

Identifying Moissanite

How can moissanite be distinguished from other colorless gemstones?


There are five (5) methods:

Determine if doubling of facet junctions is visible through magnification.
Use a jeweler’s loupe to examine the girdle of the stone.  Forever One™ and Forever Brilliant® moissanite stones approximately 4.0mm and larger are engraved on the girdle for easy identification.
Examine for needle-like inclusions, typically perpendicular to the table facet, which are visible in moissanite under 10x loupe magnification.
Examine for specific refractive and gravity indices.
Have a trained gemologist or jeweler use a testing device specifically designed to distinguish moissanite from diamond.



Purchasing Moissanite
 What is the difference between Forever One ™, Forever Brilliant® and Forever Classic™ moissanite?Charles & Colvard Forever One moissanite is a triumph of art, science and sustained effort. The structural configuration of this new moissanite material is what yields its unsurpassed, colorless (D-E-F) quality. While chemically it is still silicon carbide (SiC), and its optical and hardness properties remain the same, it is the stacking of SiC material in the manufacturing process that makes Forever One moissanite unlike any of its predecessors. Through its research and development efforts working with Forever One, Charles & Colvard has developed a second grade of Forever One, in G-H-I quality*. This near colorless gemstone emits a faint, icy hue compared to its Forever Brilliant predecessor, which yields a warm hue. This new, near-colorless gemstone is only currently available in limited quantities on the Charles & ColvardÂ® e-commerce website, www.charlesandcolvard.com.  Forever Brilliant moissanite falls within the prized, near-colorless G-H-I range. Forever Brilliant was developed through improvements to the crystal growing process from the original brand of Charles & Colvard created moissanite also known as Forever Classic. Forever Classic offers subtle color shades in the J - K range of the industry color scale, with faint undertones of green, yellow or gray. Forever One D-E-F, Forever Brilliant and Forever Classic moissanite gemstones and jewelry will continue to be made available to wholesale distributors, manufacturers, retailers, TV shopping networks and designers.  *Based on the Gemological Institute of America's diamond grading scale. Are fancy cuts available?Yes. Moissanite is available in various shapes and sizes. The most popular cut continues to be the round brilliant cut, and fancy cuts such as Asscher, cushion, oval and square brilliant are available as well. Why is moissanite sold by millimeter rather than by carat weight?The carat is the traditional unit of measurement for a diamond's weight. Moissanite is not measured in carats because it weighs approximately 10 percent less than diamond. For example, a 6.5mm round diamond would weigh 1.0ct, while a 6.5mm round moissanite would weigh 0.88ct. The two stones would be the same size - 6.5mm in diameter. All stones for sale are listed with their size in millimeters and the diamond equivalent weight (DEW) in carats. Will moissanite retain its value over time?Due to its rarity and unrivaled beauty, Charles & Colvard created moissanite is expected to retain or increase its value over time.

Moissanite Repairs & Care
 How should I care for my moissanite jewelry?You may clean moissanite the same way you would diamond or any other fine gemstone. As with any fine jewelry item, an ultrasonic cleaner can be used. However, it is best to be gentle with your valuable treasures. You can also clean your moissanite jewelry using a commercial (non-acid based) jewelry cleaner or with mild soap and water using a soft toothbrush. Can moissanite withstand repairs and sizing?Yes. Moissanite is an extremely stable material. It is durable, tough and highly resistant to scratching, abrasion, breaking and chipping. Its high heat tolerance makes moissanite very unlikely to experience damage during jewelry repair. Can moissanite gemstones be re-set into new jewelry?Yes. Resetting your moissanite gemstone(s) into a new piece of jewelry can be done by an experienced jeweler. Jewelry designers and manufacturers create their jewelry collections featuring many Charles & Colvard created moissanite using techniques very similar to those practiced by bench jewelers. Can I engrave my moissanite stone?Yes. You can engrave your moissanite stone after your purchase, after all, it is now a part of your personal story. Please be aware that any engraving done post-purchase on the stone will void Charles & Colvard's Limited Lifetime Warranty.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
