Early life and education[edit]
Abbasi was born in Lahore, Pakistan in 1956 and moved to various cities with his father, an air force official, before reaching the United States in 1974 to attend college at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[10] Abbasi graduated with honors and obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 1978. He later earned his masters in the same field in 1980.[11][12]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Abbasi began his professional career as a product manager for Professional Computer Resources in 1980. He developed financial modeling software and ERP applications there before launching his own company, Outlook Software, Inc.[13][14]
Oracle[edit]
Abbasi joined Oracle while the company was a startup in 1982, as the manager of Midwestern Sales.[15][16] Following his success in sales, Abbasi became manager of user interface development in 1984 where he created Oracle's first application programming tool, SQL*Forms.[17] The software was first introduced in 1985 and was used by over 90 percent of all Oracle DBMS shops by 1990.[17]
Abbasi also launched the software tools division at Oracle, which includes application development tools, business intelligence tools, e-business portal tools and pharmaceutical and Internet learning applications.[18] He helped grow the tools division of the company from its initial launch to generating revenues of $3.75 billion during his tenure with the company.[19] By 1989, he was named the vice-president of Tools and Multi-media for the company.[20] Abbasi was promoted further in 1994 to senior vice-president of Tools Product Division.[21] From 2001 until his retirement from the company in 2003, Abbasi held the role of senior vice president in both the Tools and Education divisions.[22]
He retired from Oracle in 2003 after 20 years and is credited with helping the company grow from a 30 employee startup with $4 million in revenue, to a company with more than 40,000 employees and revenue near $10 billion.[6][7]
Informatica[edit]
In 2004, Abbasi joined the software company, Informatica, as chief executive officer. Before Abbasi joined the company it had reported negative product license growth in 10 of the prior 12 quarters. Under his leadership, Informatica streamlined its operations by cutting its analytic application software development and focusing on the data warehousing component of its business.[23] The decision was controversial at the time with resistance among employees and on the board,[24] but Abbasi refocused the company on a narrower set of products, while evangelizing the broader use of data integration across the enterprise. The company grew its core market, eventually increasing its revenue from $219 million in fiscal 2004 to $455 million in 2008. Informatica's 20 percent growth rate over this period was 2.5 times the average for the software industry.
During the recession, Abbasi urged the company's salespeople to focus on smaller business-critical deals rather than waiting to close bigger ones that might not materialize. The company concluded 2009 with $456 million in sales with an increase in revenue for each of the first three quarters of the year. Abbasi led the company through the recession with it experiencing 10 percent revenue growth and 20 percent non-GAAP net income growth, while non-GAAP operating margins expanded 3% to an annual record 25%.[25] The company's growth also allowed hiring and expansion to continue through the recession.[16]
In 2010, Informatica reached a revenue of $650 million a nearly 300% increase over the revenue the company had experienced when Abbasi became CEO and a 31% increase from the year before. That same year Abbasi helped the company to grow its sales outside of North America to 36% of its business.[26]
In 2014, after ten years of Abbasi's leadership, Informatica reached $1 billion in sales.[27] In April 2015, Informatica announced that shareholders had approved the acquisition by Permira funds and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for $5.3 billion or roughly $48 a share.[28][29][30] After the deal was completed, Abbasi stepped down as CEO and remained with the company as chairman.[29] During his tenure as CEO the company's customer base increased from around 2,100 in 2004,[31] to over 5,000 in 2014, employee count during this same time grew from 837[32] to 3,664.[33] The company's annual profitability increased by over 850 percent and its stock appreciated over 800 percent during the same time period.[26]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2003, Abbasi and his wife, Sara, created a $2.5 million endowment for a program in Islamic studies at Stanford University.[34] The program included graduate fellowships, research, a new library, stronger language courses at advanced levels, and regular public events such as lectures by eminent scholars. At the same time, Stanford alumna Lysbeth Warren made a gift of US$2 million for a new professorship on Islam. Stanford matched both gifts with a grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, bringing the total endowment for the program and professorship to US$9 million.[35]
The Abbasis established the Sohaib and Sara Abbasi Professorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to help the university maintain its position as a national leader in computer science. They also founded the Sohaib and Sara Abbasi Computer Science Fellowship to allow students, preferably from Pakistan, to attend the institution.[36][37]
Abbasi also played a key role in establishing the Oracle Academic Initiative in Pakistan, which has trained hundreds of professionals.[38]
Recognition[edit]
During his tenure with Informatica, Abbasi received several awards for his performance. Abbasi won the Chairman of the Year Award from the American Business Awards in 2010[39] and was ranked second by Institutional Investor's annual survey of software company CEO's in 2010 and 2011.[40][41] In 2013, Bloomberg ranked Abbasi second on its Top 20 list of technology leaders.[42] In 2014, according to Forbes, Abbasi was one of the top 5 best CEOs to work for in the Enterprise Software business in 2014.[43]

Early life and education[edit]
Abbasi was born in Lahore, Pakistan in 1956 and moved to various cities with his father, an air force official, before reaching the United States in 1974 to attend college at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[10] Abbasi graduated with honors and obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 1978. He later earned his masters in the same field in 1980.[11][12]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Abbasi began his professional career as a product manager for Professional Computer Resources in 1980. He developed financial modeling software and ERP applications there before launching his own company, Outlook Software, Inc.[13][14]
Oracle[edit]
Abbasi joined Oracle while the company was a startup in 1982, as the manager of Midwestern Sales.[15][16] Following his success in sales, Abbasi became manager of user interface development in 1984 where he created Oracle's first application programming tool, SQL*Forms.[17] The software was first introduced in 1985 and was used by over 90 percent of all Oracle DBMS shops by 1990.[17]
Abbasi also launched the software tools division at Oracle, which includes application development tools, business intelligence tools, e-business portal tools and pharmaceutical and Internet learning applications.[18] He helped grow the tools division of the company from its initial launch to generating revenues of $3.75 billion during his tenure with the company.[19] By 1989, he was named the vice-president of Tools and Multi-media for the company.[20] Abbasi was promoted further in 1994 to senior vice-president of Tools Product Division.[21] From 2001 until his retirement from the company in 2003, Abbasi held the role of senior vice president in both the Tools and Education divisions.[22]
He retired from Oracle in 2003 after 20 years and is credited with helping the company grow from a 30 employee startup with $4 million in revenue, to a company with more than 40,000 employees and revenue near $10 billion.[6][7]
Informatica[edit]
In 2004, Abbasi joined the software company, Informatica, as chief executive officer. Before Abbasi joined the company it had reported negative product license growth in 10 of the prior 12 quarters. Under his leadership, Informatica streamlined its operations by cutting its analytic application software development and focusing on the data warehousing component of its business.[23] The decision was controversial at the time with resistance among employees and on the board,[24] but Abbasi refocused the company on a narrower set of products, while evangelizing the broader use of data integration across the enterprise. The company grew its core market, eventually increasing its revenue from $219 million in fiscal 2004 to $455 million in 2008. Informatica's 20 percent growth rate over this period was 2.5 times the average for the software industry.
During the recession, Abbasi urged the company's salespeople to focus on smaller business-critical deals rather than waiting to close bigger ones that might not materialize. The company concluded 2009 with $456 million in sales with an increase in revenue for each of the first three quarters of the year. Abbasi led the company through the recession with it experiencing 10 percent revenue growth and 20 percent non-GAAP net income growth, while non-GAAP operating margins expanded 3% to an annual record 25%.[25] The company's growth also allowed hiring and expansion to continue through the recession.[16]
In 2010, Informatica reached a revenue of $650 million a nearly 300% increase over the revenue the company had experienced when Abbasi became CEO and a 31% increase from the year before. That same year Abbasi helped the company to grow its sales outside of North America to 36% of its business.[26]
In 2014, after ten years of Abbasi's leadership, Informatica reached $1 billion in sales.[27] In April 2015, Informatica announced that shareholders had approved the acquisition by Permira funds and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for $5.3 billion or roughly $48 a share.[28][29][30] After the deal was completed, Abbasi stepped down as CEO and remained with the company as chairman.[29] During his tenure as CEO the company's customer base increased from around 2,100 in 2004,[31] to over 5,000 in 2014, employee count during this same time grew from 837[32] to 3,664.[33] The company's annual profitability increased by over 850 percent and its stock appreciated over 800 percent during the same time period.[26]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2003, Abbasi and his wife, Sara, created a $2.5 million endowment for a program in Islamic studies at Stanford University.[34] The program included graduate fellowships, research, a new library, stronger language courses at advanced levels, and regular public events such as lectures by eminent scholars. At the same time, Stanford alumna Lysbeth Warren made a gift of US$2 million for a new professorship on Islam. Stanford matched both gifts with a grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, bringing the total endowment for the program and professorship to US$9 million.[35]
The Abbasis established the Sohaib and Sara Abbasi Professorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to help the university maintain its position as a national leader in computer science. They also founded the Sohaib and Sara Abbasi Computer Science Fellowship to allow students, preferably from Pakistan, to attend the institution.[36][37]
Abbasi also played a key role in establishing the Oracle Academic Initiative in Pakistan, which has trained hundreds of professionals.[38]
Recognition[edit]
During his tenure with Informatica, Abbasi received several awards for his performance. Abbasi won the Chairman of the Year Award from the American Business Awards in 2010[39] and was ranked second by Institutional Investor's annual survey of software company CEO's in 2010 and 2011.[40][41] In 2013, Bloomberg ranked Abbasi second on its Top 20 list of technology leaders.[42] In 2014, according to Forbes, Abbasi was one of the top 5 best CEOs to work for in the Enterprise Software business in 2014.[43]

Informatica CEO Sohaib Abbasi Showcases Innovations For The Age of Engagement







Informatica CEO Sohaib Abbasi Showcases Innovations For The Age of Engagement
Unveils Product Strategy to Enable Customers to Master All Things Data
Informatica World, Las Vegas, May 12, 2015 – Informatica Corporation (Nasdaq:INFA), the world’s number one independent provider of data integration software, today showcased key innovations in the Informatica Intelligent Data Platform (IDP) to integrate, prepare, master and secure data. In the new computing age of engagement, the world of data expands beyond transaction data in database applications and in cloud services to include interaction data in social media, in mobile apps and in the Internet of Things (IoT). Speaking to 2,500 attendees at the sold out 16th annual Informatica World conference in Las Vegas, chairman and chief executive officer, Sohaib Abbasi, outlined the product innovation strategy to power the Data Ready Enterprise in the new age of engagement.
Watch Informatica World 2015 keynotes here: http://infa.media/INFA15YT
“As the purpose of computing evolves from the age of productivity to the age of engagement, four technology trends are disrupting the computing platform,” said Abbasi. “First, the economics of cloud is disrupting the computing infrastructure; second, the diversity of social media and the Internet of Things are disrupting the data infrastructure; third, the richness of big data is disrupting the analytics infrastructure; and fourth, the perimeter-less world of pervasive computing is disrupting the security infrastructure. Each disruptive trend opens up an exciting new opportunity: hybrid cloud integration, next-generation data integration, Internet of master data and data security intelligence.”
Abbasi showcased key innovations, including: Project Atlantic for cloud integration, Project Sonoma and Rev for next-generation data integration and preparation, Social360 for the Internet of master data and Secure@Source for data security intelligence and analytics.
Informatica Project Atlantic for Cloud Integration
In the new age of engagement, more machine interaction data is being captured by mobile apps, websites and the IoT. Project Atlantic uses genetic algorithms to automatically infer the structure and semantics of machine interaction data, and integrate such data with structured transaction data. Project Atlantic will be integrated with Informatica Cloud and IDP to integrate data – transaction and machine interaction – in the cloud or on-premise.
Informatica Project Sonoma for Big Data Integration
Designed for big data projects, Project Sonoma will improve the agility of data scientists while enabling better governance by IT. For big data projects, with growing volumes and varieties of interaction data, organizations are increasingly adopting Hadoop-based data lakes. Using Project Sonoma, developers will be able to productively find, ingest, prepare, provision, secure and govern data – transaction and interaction – managed in Hadoop data lakes. 
Informatica Rev for Business User Data Preparation
Designed for self-service by business users, Informatica Rev simplifies data preparation with guided recommendations for tasks such as curating, combining and enriching data. Using Rev, business users simply merge data from multiple sources and standardize and prepare the data for analysis in visualization tools. To operationalize data preparation tasks by business users, Informatica Rev will automatically generate mappings for IT developers to administer.
Social360 for Internet of Master Data
Informatica MDM now offers Social360 to view master data, relationships and associated interactions, including social media feeds and media mentions. By matching transactions with social relationships, Informatica MDM can identify the top influencers among the most valuable customers. Designed to run natively on Hadoop, Informatica Big Data Relationship Management identifies household and social relationships across billions of records representing millions of people. 
Informatica Secure@Source
Designed to mitigate the risk of data breaches in traditional databases and Hadoop, Secure@Source defines a new category, Data Security Intelligence and Analytics. Secure@Source mitigates the risks of breaches by detecting, classifying and monitoring the risks associated with proliferation and usage of sensitive data. Last month, Secure@Source won the gold award for the best new security product at the security industry’s premier event, the RSA conference.

Sohaib Abbasi (born August 14, 1956) is a business executive, computer scientist and philanthropist. He is the former chairman and chief executive of Informatica having served in the roles from 2004 until 2015.[2][3] During his tenure as CEO, Abbasi helped to grow the company's revenue from $219 million to over $1 billion, and to increase the value of stock by over 800 percent.[4]He was also a member of the executive committee of Oracle Corporation and led Oracle Tools and Oracle Education as senior vice president.[5][6] He retired from these roles in 2003 after 20 years with the company and is credited with helping to grow the company from a startup into an industry leader.[7]Abbasi joined the board of directors for the software company, Red Hat Inc. in 2011.[8]Early life and educationAbbasi was born in Lahore, Pakistan in 1956 and moved to various cities with his father, an air force official, before reaching the United States in 1974 to attend college at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.[9] Abbasi graduated with honors and obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 1978. He later earned his masters in the same field in 1980.[10][11]CareerEarly careerAbbasi began his professional career as a product manager for Professional Computer Resources in 1980. He developed financial modeling software and ERP applications there before launching his own company, Outlook Software, Inc.[12][13]OracleAbbasi joined Oracle while the company was a startup in 1982, as the manager of Midwestern Sales.[14] Following his success in sales, Abbasi became manager of user interface development in 1984 where he created Oracle's first application programming tool, SQL*Forms.[15] The software was first introduced in 1985 and was used by over 90 percent of all Oracle DBMS shops by 1990.[15]Abbasi also launched the software tools division at Oracle, which includes application development tools, business intelligence tools, e-business portal tools and pharmaceutical and Internet learning applications.[16] He helped grow the tools division of the company from its initial launch to generating revenues of $3.75 billion during his tenure with the company.[17] By 1989, he was named the vice-president of Tools and Multi-media for the company.[18] Abbasi was promoted further in 1994 to senior vice-president of Tools Product Division.[3] From 2001 until his retirement from the company in 2003, Abbasi held the role of senior vice president in both the Tools and Education divisions.[3]He retired from Oracle in 2003 after 20 years and is credited with helping the company grow from a 30 employee startup with $4 million in revenue, to a company with more than 40,000 employees and revenue near $10 billion.[7]InformaticaIn 2004, Abbasi joined the software company, Informatica, as chief executive officer. Before Abbasi joined the company it had reported negative product license growth in 10 of the prior 12 quarters. Under his leadership, Informatica streamlined its operations by cutting its analytic application software development and focusing on the data warehousing component of its business.[21] The decision was controversial at the time with resistance among employees and on the board,[3] but Abbasi refocused the company on a narrower set of products, while evangelizing the broader use of data integration across the enterprise. The company grew its core market, eventually increasing its revenue from $219 million in fiscal 2004 to $455 million in 2008. Informatica's 20 percent growth rate over this period was 2.5 times the average for the software industry.During the recession, Abbasi urged the company's salespeople to focus on smaller business-critical deals rather than waiting to close bigger ones that might not materialize. The company concluded 2009 with $456 million in sales with an increase in revenue for each of the first three quarters of the year. Abbasi led the company through the recession with it experiencing 10 percent revenue growth and 20 percent non-GAAP net income growth, while non-GAAP operating margins expanded 3% to an annual record 25%.[23] The company's growth also allowed hiring and expansion to continue through the recession.[14]In 2010, Informatica reached a revenue of $650 million a nearly 300% increase over the revenue the company had experienced when Abbasi became CEO and a 31% increase from the year before. That same year Abbasi helped the company to grow its sales outside of North America to 36% of its business.[24]In 2014, after ten years of Abbasi's leadership, Informatica reached $1 billion in sales.[25] In April 2015, Informatica announced that shareholders had approved the acquisition by Permira funds and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for $5.3 billion or roughly $48 a share.[3][27][3] After the deal was completed, Abbasi stepped down as CEO and remained with the company as chairman.[27] During his tenure as CEO the company's customer base increased from around 2,100 in 2004,[4] to over 5,000 in 2014, employee count during this same time grew from 837[4] to 3,664.[4] The company's annual profitability increased by over 850 percent and its stock appreciated over 800 percent during the same time period.[24]PhilanthropyIn 2003, Abbasi and his wife, Sara, created a $2.5 million endowment for a program in Islamic studies at Stanford University.[4] The program included graduate fellowships, research, a new library, stronger language courses at advanced levels, and regular public events such as lectures by eminent scholars. At the same time, Stanford alumna Lysbeth Warren made a gift of US$2 million for a new professorship on Islam. Stanford matched both gifts with a grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, bringing the total endowment for the program and professorship to US$9 million.[4]The Abbasis established the Sohaib and Sara Abbasi Professorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to help the university maintain its position as a national leader in computer science. They also founded the Sohaib and Sara Abbasi Computer Science Fellowship to allow students, preferably from Pakistan, to attend the institution.[4][4]Abbasi also played a key role in establishing the Oracle Academic Initiative in Pakistan, which has trained hundreds of professionals.[4]RecognitionDuring his tenure with Informatica, Abbasi received several awards for his performance. Abbasi won the Chairman of the Year Award from the American Business Awards in 2010[4] and was ranked second by Institutional Investor's annual survey of software company CEO's in 2010 and 2011.[4][38] In 2013, Bloomberg ranked Abbasi second on its Top 20 list of technology leaders.[39] In 2014, according to Forbes, Abbasi was one of the top 5 best CEOs to work for in the Enterprise Software business in 2014.[40]
