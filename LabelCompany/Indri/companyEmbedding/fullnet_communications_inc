What is FullSpeed?
FullSpeed is an Internet Accelerator for your dial-up internet connection. 
The main  bottleneck to browsing the internet over dial-up is 
the slow speed of a modem connection.
The FullSpeed client is a program that you install on your computer. When it is 
running, the client will automatically compress text and images downloaded by 
your web browser for you. Compressed content is smaller content; therefore, your 
modem will download it faster and your web pages will load noticeably faster.
The actual speedup ratio varies, depending on how graphic-intensive the typical 
website you visit is. On average, with typical web browsing you can expect 
websites to come up between three and five times faster.Text compresses very well, 
and depending on the text in question it can download 
anywhere from one to 50 times faster. A typical speed increase for text on web 
pages is about 5-10 times faster.
FullSpeed accelerates image downloading too, but since these are already 
optimized files, they cannot compress as well as text. By attempting to optimize 
the image further, its compression ratio can increase. These compressed images 
may look a little grainier than the original ones but download noticeably 
faster! With FullSpeed�s default settings, images download an average of 2-3 
times faster with only a slight cost in image clarity. You can adjust the 
speed/quality ratio to your preferences and retain the option to switch back to 
the original images.
Please note that the text and image speed increase only applies to files 
downloaded through a web browser (HTTP). FullSpeed does not affect files 
downloaded or uploaded by FTP, HTTPS, and file sharing programs or streaming 
audio/video.
FullSpeed also includes a basic pop-up killer, which prevents most types of 
popup ads. It also has the ability as to block 'Flash' advertising that floats 
on top of text articles.
[Back to Top]
What gets accelerated?
FullSpeed compresses the following in order to 
send the information to your computer faster:

Web pages -  HTML markup,JavaScript, xml and style sheetst 
Graphics including JPEG and GIF images Flash content
Email - SMTP and POP (including file attachments!) and is compatible with any IMAP or POP3/SMTP client, including Microsoft�Outlook 
Express and Netscape� Mail and FTP
Text

What will not be accelerated?
Although FullSpeed is able to compress many different types of online data, 
there are a few which cannot be accelerated:

Streaming media, audio and video files 
Secure pages, such as those used for online banking and credit card forms

Additional Features
Other value-added features of the accelerator software include:

Pop-Up Blocker - block annoying pop-up advertisements while surfing! 
Banner-Ad Blocking - Stop the ads, and surf faster! 
Integrated Diagnostic Support Tool
Privacy management

[Back to Top]
Is it really free?
Yes.  FullSpeed is completely FREE for all new and existing FullNet members!
[Back to Top]
How does it work?
With traditional dial-up methods, the text and graphics that make up web 
pages get sent from the server to you over your phone line. Because of the large 
amount of data required to be sent, this process can be painfully slow. 
FullSpeed compresses this data using a proprietary technology and sends it over 
your existing dial-up phone line. This compression process allows a smaller 
amount data to be sent -- sometimes more than five times less -- making the download time of 
your web pages and your online experience that much faster. As an added download 
time reducer, FullSpeed stores elements of the web sites you visit frequently, 
eliminating the need to re-download them every time you visit these sites.

"Person to Person - Satisfaction and Service are Our Business"

Colocation Services -



Oklahoma Facilities-Based CLEC - Telco Grade NOC (Network Operations Center) 
    - Direct Access To SBC and Other Telecommunications Providers 
    Within Our Facilities.
The 
    second floor of the Bank of Oklahoma Building, 201 Robert S. Kerr Ave, Suite 
    210, Oklahoma City, OK, is now ready to provide your company with customized 
    telecommunications space and diverse, flexible service options to fulfill the 
    requirements of your business. FullNet's broad-based infrastructure and time-tested 
    backbone changes the paradigm of colocation services delivery in the state of 
    Oklahoma when compared to other "carrier neutral" sites.
FullNet Communications, Inc. is an Integrated Communications Provider engaged 
    in consumer and business Internet services, including dial-up, dedicated in 
    selected cities around Oklahoma, and web hosting. Since the installation of our 
    telephone switch, we are able to provide dialup Internet access to additional 
    areas of Oklahoma, including many rural areas, and voice services 
    to small and medium size businesses in the Oklahoma City and Tulsa areas.


FullNet's co-location space was designed for a wide range of potential customers. 
    Examples of current clients include a large CLEC occupying 500 square feet of 
    caged space, a large e-commerce client with more than 30 servers, web hosting 
    companies co-locating one or more web servers and companies hosting web pages 
    on our own web servers.
FullNet has its own fiber facilities going to the SBC CO (Central 
    Office) in downtown Oklahoma City. Using this facility, we can fulfill your 
    bandwidth needs (from T-1's to OC-48's to dark fiber) to the CO, where you can 
    connect up to SBC or many other carriers. Also, within our building are over 
    20 telecommunications providers who you can directly connect with, including 
    Williams, MCI WorldCom, and NTS.


Our facility is ideal for telecommunications providers, existing national/regional 
    ISPs or web hosting companies. Our 2,200 square foot NOC (which can be expanded 
    to over 10,000 square feet) is designed to offer a unique approach to the demand 
    for a telco- grade, carrier-neutral co-location facility in which to house the 
    switches, computers, routers, or modems needed to expand or have a presence 
    in Oklahoma. FullNet will customize your space to fit your needs and your budget.
Call 1-800-FullNet and request our rate 
    and fee structure, which will allow you to calculate the cost of the investment 
    for your company's space.
FullNet Co-Location Key Benefits -


Security - Staffed 24 x 365 with personalized electronic access 
Fire Protection - FM200 system 
Power - AC and DC with battery and generator backup available 
Flexible Space - You rent only the space you need, with options for later 
      expansion 
Shared Infrastructure -- Spreads the cost associated with the need for 
      state-of-the-art benefits and features to operate telco space; reduces the 
      capital expenditures while outsourcing mission critical functions 
Full Service - FullNet can provide you space and power, bandwidth, internet 
      access, web hosting, systems consulting, systems monitoring, server purchase 
      and installation, and telephone service, many on a wholesale 
      or retail basis 
Non-Compete - Although FullNet can provide a wide variety of products 
      and services to each of its customers, we will provide you with assurances 
      that your customers remain with you. 








Limited Time Opportunity - Check Us Out!
Call us today at 1-800-FullNet. We will fly two to three members of your 
    company to Oklahoma City to check out our facility. The number of persons invited 
    will be based on the amount of space desired. If you decide to colocate with 
    FullNet, FullNet will pay all expenses for the trip. If you decide otherwise, 
    FullNet will provide local transportation, three meals per day per person, and 
    hotel accommodations (for two nights) and you pay for the airfare. All that 
    is required is that you sign an agreement with us outlining this offer and write 
    us a check for the airfare, which will go into an escrow account. This offer 
    is based upon potential tenants who qualify both technically and financially.*
FullNet Communications retains the right to withdraw this offer
    at any time without notice to all parties whom: have not signed an agreement, do
    not or cannot provide funds for the designated escrow account, or do not meet
    pre-determined technical or financial qualifications.
