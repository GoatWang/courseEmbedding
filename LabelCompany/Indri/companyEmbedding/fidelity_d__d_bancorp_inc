Fidelity D & D Bancorp, Inc. Reports 2016 Financial Results
BY GlobeNewswire— 10:54 AM ET 02/01/2017


DUNMORE, Pa., Feb.  01, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fidelity D & D Bancorp, Inc. (FDBC)  and its banking subsidiary Fidelity Deposit and Discount Bank, announced net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $7.7 million, or $3.13 diluted earnings per share, compared to $7.1 million, or $2.90 diluted earnings per share, for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The $0.6 million, or 8%, improvement resulted from strategic growth which expanded net interest income by $1.6 million, or 7%, and other income by $0.5 million.  The Company continued to focus on its relationship management strategy achieving $42.9 million, or 6%, growth in average earning assets during 2016.  This growth was funded by a $43.7 million increase in average deposits and a $5.4 million increase in average shareholders’ equity partially offset by a $6.8 million reduction in average borrowings.  Other expenses increased $0.6 million combined with a $1.0 million larger provision for income taxes partially reduced the revenue growth.  Return on average assets (ROA) was 1.02% for 2016 and 1.00% for 2015.  During the same periods, return on average equity (ROE) was 9.64% and 9.55%.
“Fidelity Bank’s 2016 results demonstrated quality and consistent growth in earnings and the balance sheet as we continued to focus on our strategic priority of relationship management,” stated Daniel J. Santaniello, President and Chief Executive Officer.  “In 2016, the company produced strong growth in loans, deposits, non-interest income, and capital, while returning more capital to our shareholders than the prior year.  I am very proud of the Fidelity Banker’s commitment to partnering with clients to help achieve their financial success.” Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 increased $0.2 million, or 11%, to $2.0 million from $1.8 million for the same 2015 quarter.  The improvement stemmed from producing $0.4 million in additional net interest income, a $0.3 million increase in other income and a $0.2 million reduction in the provision for loan losses partially offset by $0.5 million higher other expenses.  Earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.83 and $0.74 for the quarters ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  ROA and ROE were 1.06% and 9.92%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 0.99% and 9.48%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2015. The Company’s total assets increased $63.5 million, or 9%, to $792.9 million at December 31, 2016 from $729.4 million at December 31, 2015.  A $42.9 million net increase in the loan portfolio, $4.8 million increase in securities and $13.6 million increase in cash balances made up the bulk of the asset growth.  Excluding the $49.4 million temporary escrow deposit received at the end of 2016, total deposits grew $33.4 million, or 5%.  Shareholders’ equity increased $4.3 million, or 6%, and short-term borrowings were reduced by $24.0 million.  Net interest income was $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $1.6 million increase over the $23.5 million earned for the year ended December 31, 2015.  An increase of $34.1 million in average loans and leases mitigated the lower yields earned in the loan portfolio and generated $1.0 million more interest income.  Higher investment portfolio yields with an additional $6.4 million in average investments contributed another $0.4 million in interest income.  In conjunction with the higher interest income, stable deposit costs with lower average borrowings at lower interest rates saved $0.2 million in interest expense.  As a result of the higher earnings on a larger average portfolio of earning assets, net interest margin was 3.72% for 2016, or 2 basis points higher, than the 3.70% recorded for 2015. Net interest income was $6.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $6.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.  The $0.4 million, or 6%, increase resulted from a higher level of interest-earning assets.  This led to a four basis point improvement in the net interest margin to 3.73% for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 3.69% for the same 2015 quarter. The provision for loan losses was $50 thousand lower in 2016 than 2015.  The decrease in the provision was primarily due to a lower level of non-performing loans.  The ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans was 1.23% and 1.61% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Net charge-offs as a percentage of total average loans for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 0.21% compared to 0.13 % for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The allowance for loan losses was $9.4 million at December 31, 2016, or 1.57% of total loans, compared to $9.5 million, or 1.71% of total loans, at December 31, 2015. The provision for loan losses was $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, a $0.2 million decrease compared to $0.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.  During the last quarter of 2015, a single large commercial real estate loan was moved to non-accrual status requiring a higher provision.  This loan was resolved in June 2016. Total other income recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $8.0 million, an increase of $0.5 million, or 6%, from the $7.5 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Other income increased due to $0.4 million more deposit service charges, $0.2 million in additional interchange fees and $82 thousand more fees from financial services that offset $0.2 million fewer gains on loan sales and $71 thousand less gains on securities when compared to 2015. Total other income increased $0.3 million, or 14%, to $2.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $1.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.  Increases of $0.1 million in deposit fees, $49 thousand in loan fees and $60 thousand more gains on loan sales were partially offset by $54 thousand fewer gains on security sales for the three months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2015. Other expenses increased to $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.6 million from $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Increases within this category included a $1.1 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, a $0.4 million increase in data processing expense and $0.2 million in PA shares tax expense.  These increases were partially offset by a $0.6 million FHLB prepayment fee, which was paid in 2015 for the early payoff of long-term debt which did not recur in 2016.  Also partially offsetting the increases was a $0.3 million decrease in advertising and marketing expenses for 2016 when compared to 2015 along with a decrease of $0.1 million in professional services. Other expenses increased $0.5 million, or 11%, to $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $5.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2015.  The increase was due to a $0.5 million in additional salaries and employee benefits expense, $67 thousand more premises and equipment expense and $75 thousand higher data processing expenses.  These increases were partially offset by $84 thousand lower FDIC assessment costs and $61 thousand less automated transaction processing expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2016, provision for income taxes increased by $1.0 million.  This change resulted from an audit adjustment reducing 2015 income tax expense by $0.4 million plus a higher level of taxable income in 2016.  Fidelity D & D Bancorp, Inc. (FDBC) has built a strong history as trusted advisors to the customers served by The Fidelity Deposit and Discount Bank, and is proud to be an active member of the community of Northeastern Pennsylvania.  The Company serves Lackawanna and Luzerne Counties through The Fidelity Deposit and Discount Bank’s 10 community banking office locations providing personal and business banking products and services, including wealth management assistance through fiduciary activities with the Bank’s full trust powers; as well as offering a full array of asset management services.  The Bank provides 24 hour, 7 day a week service to customers through branch offices, online at www.bankatfidelity.com, and through the Customer Care Center at 800-388-4380.  The Bank's deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to the full extent permitted by law.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

About Environmental, Social & Governance Summary (ESG)



GMI ESG Ratings


GMI AGR® Score & Rating






GMI ESG Ratings
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Flags:  GMI Ratings publishes Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings on over 6,000 companies worldwide. These ratings provide an independent assessment of the sustainable investment value of public companies.  The ESG Ratings model is based on a carefully crafted and applied list of KeyMetrics® that result in an overall ESG concern level as expressed by Red (High Concern), Yellow (Average Concern), and Green (Low Concern) flags.  Unlike traditional ESG risk models, GMI's rating methodology is designed to identify risks most likely to affect equity valuations. Specifically, these ratings reflect actual corporate behaviors rather than policies or affirmations of intent to adhere to best ESG practices. Further, unlike other models with evenly weighted metrics, we assign context-sensitive relative weightings to our key metrics, based on market, regional, ownership or sector differences.  Individual company scores are then assigned as a percentile rank, ranging from 1 (worst ranked) to 100 (best) on the basis of these KeyMetrics® and then converted to the Red, Yellow or Green flag designation.
Company Reports:  In addition to a company's overall risk rating, ESG reports also include an industry rating based on a comparison between the company's risk levels in each ESG component area relative to its industry peers.  Further, the ESG analysis serves as a summary of behavioral events that contributed to the company's overall risk level.

 More About GMI



GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating
The GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating is widely recognized as an indicator of the confidence level surrounding a company's management and reported financials.
Scores range from 0 to 100, and correspond to a risk classification for each company ranging from "Very Aggressive" to "Conservative." The AGR Score is a percentile ranking among the approximately 8,000 companies rated by GMI. Through continued back-testing, GMI has demonstrated a strong correlation between its quarterly AGR Score and the likelihood of adverse events, including securities class action litigation, financial restatements, regulatory enforcement actions, and stock price declines.
				Thus, a company's AGR Score can help investors looking to manage risk or enhance investment performance. GMI forensically analyzes the financial reporting and governance practices of over 8,000 North American-based publicly traded companies.
About GMI
GMI is an independent risk research firm which provides a statistically modeled assessment of corporate integrity. Founded in 2002 in direct response to the growing number of scandals, lawsuits and investor losses resulting from fraudulent corporate behavior, the firm identifies potential high-risk company accounting and governance activity, which in turn has been historically correlated to stock price declines, securities class-action litigation, and material financial restatements. The product of GMI's analysis is a unique risk measure - the AGR Score which can be used by investors as a way to more effectively manage corporate risk.

 Mutual funds 
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
 
 Life insurance and variable annuities 

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, Member NYSE, SIPC and/or Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., distribute fixed and variable insurance products issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, New York, NY, and certain third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with Fidelity Investments.
 
 Workplace savings plans 
Some of the funds and services described on the Fidelity Sites may not be available or appropriate in a workplace savings plan. Check with your employer for information on any investment restrictions associated with your 401(k), 401(a), 403(b), or 457 savings plan, or nonqualified deferred compensation plan at work. Or, if your workplace savings plan is already with Fidelity, call your toll-free retirement benefits line or log on to Fidelity NetBenefits® to find out more about the investment options available to you in your workplace savings plan.
If you hold Fidelity Advisor Fund assets outside of your employer-sponsored retirement plan, accounts with such assets are not included in the list of Fidelity accounts.
Company Stock Funds are not mutual funds and are unmanaged, non-diversified investment options. The value of your investment in the Company Stock Fund is affected by the performance of the company and the overall stock market, as well as the amount and performance of any short term investments held by the fund.
Managed Income Funds, Commingled Pools and individually managed options, such as Strategies, are not mutual funds. Although individual investment contracts purchased for a managed income fund are backed by the issuer of the debt, units of the fund are not guaranteed by the manager, Plan sponsor or insured by the FDIC.
A summary of the benefits provided under a workplace savings plan is contained in the Summary Plan Description for the plan. Full details are provided in the official plan document, which governs the operation of the plan. In the event that the content of a Fidelity Site or any oral representations made by any person regarding the plan conflict with or are inconsistent with the provisions of the governing plan document, the provisions of the governing plan documents are controlling. The information presented on a Fidelity Site is not intended to create, nor is it to be construed to create, a contract between (1) an employer or a Fidelity Entity and (2) any one of the employer’s employees or other plan participants. Each employer reserves the right to amend, modify, suspend, replace or terminate any of its plans, policies or programs, in whole or in part, including any level or form of coverage, by appropriate company action, without the consent or concurrence of persons affected.

Units of the College Savings Plan Portfolios are municipal securities and may be subject to market volatility and fluctuation.
Please carefully consider the Plan's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. For this and other information on any 529 College Savings Plan managed by Fidelity, contact Fidelity for a free Fact Kit, or view online. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

1Cerulli Associates’ The Cerulli Edge®—Retirement Edition, Q2 2016, based on an industry survey of firms reporting total IRA assets administered for Q1 2016.
2A distribution from a Roth IRA is tax-free and penalty-free, provided the five-year aging requirement has been satisfied and one of the following conditions is met: age 59½, disability, qualified first-time home purchase, or death.
3Highly rated funds are defined as those funds that have a 4- or 5-Star Morningstar rating. For each fund, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM metric each month by subtracting the return on a 90-day U.S. Treasury Bill from the fund’s load-adjusted return for the same period, and then adjusting this excess return for risk. The top 10% of funds in each broad asset class receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Although gathered from reliable sources, data completeness and accuracy cannot be guaranteed by Morningstar. 
4Other fees and expenses applicable to continued investment are described in the fund’s current prospectus. 
5All Fidelity ATM withdrawal fees will be waived for your Fidelity Cash Management Account. In addition, your account will automatically be reimbursed for all ATM fees charged by other institutions while using a Fidelity Visa® Gold Check Card linked to your account, at any ATM displaying the Visa®, Plus® or Star® logos. The reimbursement will be credited to your Fidelity Cash Management Account the same day the ATM fee is debited from the account. Please note, there is a foreign transaction fee of one percent that is not waived, which will be included in the amount charged to your account. The Fidelity Visa® Gold Check Card is issued by PNC Bank, NA and administered by BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company, which are not affiliated with Fidelity Investments. The third-party trademarks appearing herein are the property of their respective owners.
The Fidelity Cash Management Account is a brokerage account designed for spending and cash management. It is not intended to serve as your main account for securities trading. Customers interested in securities trading should consider a Fidelity Account®.
6The Cash Balance in the Fidelity Cash Management Account is swept to an FDIC-insured interest bearing account at a Program Bank. The deposit at the Program Bank is not covered by SIPC. The deposit is eligible for FDIC insurance subject to FDIC insurance coverage limits. All assets of the account holder at the depository institution will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit. For more information about FDIC insurance coverage, please visit the FDIC website at FDIC.gov or call 877-ASK-FDIC. As referenced in the FDIC-Insured Deposit Sweep Disclosure Document for the Fidelity Cash Management Account, customers are responsible for monitoring their total assets at the Program Bank to determine the extent of available FDIC insurance. All FDIC insurance coverage is in accordance with FDIC rules. Go to Fidelity.com/FCMACoreBanks to see a list of eligible Program Banks, and the FDIC Disclosure Document.
7Move a qualifying amount of assets to a Fidelity IRA. Match subject to applicable limits.
Active Trader Pro® is automatically made available to customers trading 36 times or more in a rolling 12-month period. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, please contact Active Trader Services at 800-564-0211 to request access.
Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information.  Read it carefully.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
