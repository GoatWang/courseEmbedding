Cellcom (Hebrew: סלקום‎‎) (TASE: CEL, NYSE: CEL) is an Israeli telecommunications company.[3] Founded in 1994, most of the company's business is centered on wireless service. Its current CEO is Nir Sztern, who was appointed on 1 January 2012.[4] As of June 2016, Cellcom had 2.812 million subscribers.[5]

History[edit]
Cellcom's entry into the Israeli market caused a revolution in wireless services in the country as it offered service at rates which were a fraction of those charged by Pelephone, which until Cellcom's launch held a monopoly on cellular services in Israel. Its launch was not without problems though and during 1995, Cellcom subscribers experienced widespread service disruptions of unknown origin. After an intensive investigation the cause was finally traced to a software bug in Motorola's MicroTAC Alpha handsets – which were ubiquitous on its network at the time.[6] Nevertheless, its attractive rates led to a huge demand for the company's services and within a few years it had accumulated over a million subscribers.[7]
As of the end of the third quarter of 2012, it had around 3.4 million customers, the largest of the Israeli mobile providers in terms of customer base size. The vast majority of active voice clients are on its GSM network while data usage is spread across networks of different technologies.[citation needed].

Cellcom initially operated a TDMA network nationwide in the 850 MHz band but after winning tenders for GSM-1800 frequencies it began offering GSM services, and eventually sought to replace the 850 MHz TDMA frequencies it owns with standard 900 MHz GSM frequencies but Pelephone and Partner petitioned the Ministry of Communications to deny this for technical reasons. This put Cellcom at a disadvantage since though most of its users had converted to GSM, they were not able to make use of the lower frequency's better in-building penetration and greater cell reach.[citation needed]
With its entry into 3G wireless services, Cellcom demonstrated the first mobile video call in Israel.[8] Since the beginning of 2006, Cellcom has been deploying a 3G UMTS-2100 network nationwide which by the end of 2007 covered than 87% of the population.[citation needed] Cellcom was the first in Israel to launch an HSDPA network (also called "Generation 3.5") nationwide.[citation needed]
In 2011, Cellcom began to deploy UMTS services in the 850 MHz band, employing unused capacity in that frequency range since it had very few TDMA customers remaining.[citation needed] The Israeli Ministry of Communications has approved Cellcom's plan to shut down the TDMA-850 network on 31 December 2011.[citation needed] In August 2014 Cellcom launched an LTE network in the 1800MHz band.

Controversy[edit]
In 2009 Cellcom launched an ad campaign showing Israel Defense Forces soldiers playing football across the Israeli West Bank barrier.[9] Ahmad Tibi, an Arab-Israeli member of the Knesset, called on Cellcom to withdraw the commercial.[10] At a rally in Bil'in, protesters were sprayed with tear gas.[11]
A major service outage across the country on December 1, 2010 impacted on Cellcom's Q4 results.[12] The company decided to refund customers with one week's worth of calls and messages although the customers never actually received their refund, says Daniel Martinez of The Jerusalem Post.[13]

Cellcom (Hebrew: סלקום‎‎) (TASE: CEL, NYSE: CEL) is an Israeli telecommunications company.[3] Founded in 1994, most of the company's business is centered on wireless service. Its current CEO is Nir Sztern, who was appointed on 1 January 2012.[4] As of June 2016, Cellcom had 2.812 million subscribers.[5]

History[edit]
Cellcom's entry into the Israeli market caused a revolution in wireless services in the country as it offered service at rates which were a fraction of those charged by Pelephone, which until Cellcom's launch held a monopoly on cellular services in Israel. Its launch was not without problems though and during 1995, Cellcom subscribers experienced widespread service disruptions of unknown origin. After an intensive investigation the cause was finally traced to a software bug in Motorola's MicroTAC Alpha handsets – which were ubiquitous on its network at the time.[6] Nevertheless, its attractive rates led to a huge demand for the company's services and within a few years it had accumulated over a million subscribers.[7]
As of the end of the third quarter of 2012, it had around 3.4 million customers, the largest of the Israeli mobile providers in terms of customer base size. The vast majority of active voice clients are on its GSM network while data usage is spread across networks of different technologies.[citation needed].
Network[edit]
Cellcom initially operated a TDMA network nationwide in the 850 MHz band but after winning tenders for GSM-1800 frequencies it began offering GSM services, and eventually sought to replace the 850 MHz TDMA frequencies it owns with standard 900 MHz GSM frequencies but Pelephone and Partner petitioned the Ministry of Communications to deny this for technical reasons.

In 2011, Cellcom began to deploy UMTS services in the 850 MHz band, employing unused capacity in that frequency range since it had very few TDMA customers remaining.[citation needed] The Israeli Ministry of Communications has approved Cellcom's plan to shut down the TDMA-850 network on 31 December 2011.[citation needed] In August 2014 Cellcom launched an LTE network in the 1800MHz band.

Controversy[edit]
In 2009 Cellcom launched an ad campaign showing Israel Defense Forces soldiers playing football across the Israeli West Bank barrier.[9] Ahmad Tibi, an Arab-Israeli member of the Knesset, called on Cellcom to withdraw the commercial.[10] At a rally in Bil'in, protesters were sprayed with tear gas.[11]
A major service outage across the country on December 1, 2010 impacted on Cellcom's Q4 results.[12] The company decided to refund customers with one week's worth of calls and messages although the customers never actually received their refund, says Daniel Martinez of The Jerusalem Post.[13]

Cellcom Israel Ltd. Announces Agreement To Purchase Golan Telecom

Nov 05, 2015, 00:54 ET
		  		  								
						 from   Cellcom Israel Ltd. 











 
















































 

 




















 


NETANYA, Israel, Nov. 5, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Cellcom Israel Ltd. (NYSE:   CEL) (TASE: CEL) (hereinafter: the "Company") announced today that the Company entered an agreement (the "Agreement" with Golan Telecom Ltd., or Golan, and its shareholders for the purchase of 100% of the shares of Golan, an Israeli cellular operator,  for the sum of NIS 1.17 billion ("Purchase Price").
Golan is one of the four other Mobile Network Operators ("MNO") operating in Israel in addition to Cellcom Israel. It launched operations in 2012 with a strong brand recognized for low-cost services, and primarily provides cellular services to approximately 900,000 customers (as of November 2015), with a comparatively low churn.  Golan is expected to end 2015 with total revenues exceeding NIS 500 million1. 
The Purchase Price represents an Enterprise Value, or EV2 of NIS 1 billion for Golan and EV/Adjusted EBITDA multiple of approximately 5.0, based on Golan's forecasted Adjusted EBITDA for 2015 (NIS 204 million)3. 
Ami Erel, the Company's Chairman of the Board, said: "In the last few years, Cellcom Group has repeatedly proven its ability to increase its service offerings, going from a cellular only operator to a full service communications group, with cellular, fixed line, internet and TV offerings, and succeeding despite the fierce competition. 
The acquisition of Golan Telecom will allow us to add a low-cost brand to our portfolio, and I'm confident that Cellcom's management will be able to successfully combine Golan's operations as the Company's low cost brand. I thank the Company's controlling shareholders for their unrelented support and assistance in enhancing value for the Cellcom Group."
Nir Sztern, the Company's CEO said: "The acquisition of Golan Telecom is another important step in making Cellcom Israel a leading telecommunications group that brings high value at attractive prices to Israeli consumers. In the last year, we revolutionized the fixed line market by introducing a new TV service alongside highly attractive prices in triple play/packages and fixed line wholesale services. 
We intend to maintain Golan Telecom as an independent company and can assure all Golan Telecom's customers that we will honor all of their present agreements. We look forward to welcoming all of Golan's employees to the Cellcom Group family.
Transaction Details
The main provisions of the Agreement include:

In consideration of 100% of Golan's shares, the Company shall pay Golan's shareholders the Purchase Price, subject to certain  receivables and payables  adjustments and adjustments due to specified material adverse events with respect to Golan that are specified in the agreement; 
Up to NIS 400 million out of the Purchase Price shall be paid in the form of a mandatorily convertible 5 year note issued to the sellers by the Company.  The note shall be repaid through the issuance of ordinary shares of the Company, with a value equal to the principal amount of the note (the number of shares to be computed based on the Company's average share trading price in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange shortly after the Closing Date, minus a certain discount). The sellers may request conversion or assign the note at any time after the second anniversary of the Closing Date.  Until conversion, the note will entitle its holder to a fixed deferred amount equal to 3.5% of the principal per annum paid semi-annually and other customary adjustments. Upon conversion or maturity, the Company may elect, at its sole discretion, to repay the sellers by the equivalent market value of the shares, rather than issue the shares. Golan's shareholders will receive limited customary registration rights in relation to such shares. 
Golan shall continue to purchase national roaming services from the Company, until the earlier of the Closing Date or the valid termination of the Agreement, including due to the lapse of 12 months from the Agreement date without closing (the "Expiration Date") and as of January 2016, shall increase its monthly payment to the Company to approximately NIS 21 million (the "Monthly Consideration"). Generally after the Expiration Date, Cellcom shall no longer receive national roaming revenues. As previously disclosed, Golan has been paying us less than it is required to pay under the national roaming services agreement.  The parties agreed to extend the payment date for such difference, fixed at NIS 600 million, until the earlier of the valid termination of the Agreement or the lapse of 12 months from signing, if no closing is reached by then. The Company shall also be entitled to a NIS 100 million positive adjustment to its working capital. 
The Agreements contains generally customary representations, covenants, indemnification arrangements, closing conditions and termination terms. Specific closing conditions include the receipt of the approvals of the Israeli Ministry of Communications and the Antitrust Commissioner, and absence of a material adverse change, as defined in the Agreement.  The agreement can be terminated by either party if closing does not occur by the Expiration Date.
Before approving the transaction, our Board of Directors considered, among others, external opinions by external financial consultants regarding Golan's valuation and the Company's ability to fulfill its liabilities, including its liabilities towards its debentures holders and lenders, after the consummation of the Transaction and concluded that the Transaction is for the benefit of the Company and there is no reasonable concern that following the consummation of the Transaction the Company shall not be able to fulfill its liabilities, including towards its debenture holders and lenders. 
The Company will publish a presentation describing Golan's key performance parameters and description of the contemplated transaction which shall be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on Form 6-K and via the MAGNA online platform ("MAGNA") of the Israel Securities Authority ("ISA") today . A Copy of the presentations can be accessed through the enclosed link. https://www.cellcom.co.il/globalassets/pdf/Acquisition_of_Golan_presentation.pdf
The Company intends to finance the Purchase Price through a combination of equity and debt, which may include a rights offering.  We currently expect that in addition to the NIS 400 million convertible note, we would issue approximately NIS 200 million of equity and the remainder from internal sources and a debt financing.

For details of Golan's operating environment and risks related thereto see the Company's 2014 annual report under "Item 3. Key Information – D. Risk Factors – Risks Related to our Business" and "Item 4. Information on the Company – B. Business Overview –Competition" which includes, inter alia, general information describing the market in which both the Company and Golan operate.
Forward looking statement 
The information included in this press release contains, or may be deemed to contain, forward-looking statements (as defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Israeli Securities Law, 1968). Said forward-looking statements, relating to the purchase of Golan Telecom, our financing plans in connection therewith and the anticipated impact that the acquisition will have on our company are subject to uncertainties and assumptions, including the risk factors contained in our Form 20-F as well as:  the receipt of the regulators' approvals to a sale of Golan; market conditions and their effect on Golan's results of operation and the impact of such a sale on the market; capital market conditions, which could impact our financing plans.
