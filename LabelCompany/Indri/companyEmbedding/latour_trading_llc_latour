Latour Trading LLC Enters Settlement with Securities and Exchange Commission over Market Structure Rule Violations
Sep 30 15
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Latour Trading LLC with violating SEC rules designed to ensure safe and efficient markets. Latour agreed to a settlement in which it will pay a $5 million civil penalty and more than $3 million of disgorgement of gross trading profits, rebates paid to it by exchanges, and prejudgment interest. An SEC investigation found that Latour violated the SEC rules the Market Access Rule and Regulation National Market System over a nearly four-year period in which Latour sent millions of non-compliant orders to U.S. exchanges. According to the order: Latour shared portions of its electronic trading infrastructure with its parent company, Tower Research. Some Tower Research employees could change the computer code without Latours knowledge or approval. Latours procedures to prevent such changes from having unintended effects on Latours trading proved inadequate. In June 2011, Tower Research made a coding change that introduced an error into the shared infrastructure and, as a result, Latour sent millions of orders to exchanges that did not comply with the requirements of Regulation NMS. Some of these orders were executed, which led to Latour receiving gross trading profits and also rebates paid by stock exchanges. Latour lacked direct and exclusive control over its financial and regulatory risk management controls as required by the SECs Market Access Rule and did not have adequate post-trade surveillance tools to detect its non-compliant trades. After learning of the error, Latour corrected many of the issues by October 2012 and addressed the rest by August 2014. According to the SECs order, from October 2010 through August 2014, Latour sent approximately 12.6 million orders for more than 4.6 billion shares that did not comply with the requirements of Regulation NMS. The orders at issue were intermarket sweep orders (ISO's), which trading centers may immediately execute at prices that might otherwise appear to violate Rule 611 of Regulation NMS. Rule 611 generally requires trades to be executed at the best available displayed price, but trading centers may execute ISOs immediately based on the ISO routers obligation to send additional orders to execute against any better-priced displayed quotations. Chiefly because of the coding problem, Latours ISO's did not meet the requirements and caused more than 1.1 million trade-throughs (trades executed at a price worse than the best available price) and more 1.7 million locked or crossed markets (when the national best bid equals or exceeds the national best offer). Latour also sent non-compliant ISOs as a result of incorrectly relying on information about orders that Latour had previously sent. In addition to violations of the Market Access Rule, the SEC's order also finds that Latour violated Rule 611(c) of Regulation NMS because it did not take reasonable steps to establish that its ISO's complied with Reg NMS.

Latour Trading LLC Statement re: SEC Settlement

						 from   Latour Trading LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, Sept. 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Today the SEC announced a settlement with Latour Trading LLC in which Latour consented to the entry of an order relating to Latour's failure to comply with certain regulatory obligations related to its use of intermarket sweep orders ("ISOs").  
As described in the Commission's order, these issues arose predominantly from a software coding error that affected the systems that Latour used to route ISOs.  Latour also made a series of changes to its ISO routing logic that, under certain circumstances, caused it to send ISOs to the market that did not comply with the requirements of Regulation NMS.  
Latour fully remediated these issues by August 2014.  The Firm has also enhanced its systems and controls to detect and avert similar issues.  
The Firm is pleased to put this matter behind us.  We take our regulatory obligations seriously and are committed to complying with all rules and regulations applicable to our businesses.

Latour Trading Charged With Market Structure Rule Violations
High-Frequency Trading Firm to Pay More Than $8 Million to Settle Charges
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
          2015-221
        

          Washington D.C.,           Sept. 30, 2015—
        

	The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Latour Trading LLC with violating SEC rules designed to ensure safe and efficient markets. Latour, a high-frequency proprietary trading firm, agreed to a settlement in which it will pay a $5 million civil penalty and more than $3 million of disgorgement of gross trading profits, rebates paid to it by exchanges, and prejudgment interest.

	An SEC investigation found that Latour violated the SEC rules – the Market Access Rule and Regulation National Market System – over a nearly four-year period in which Latour sent millions of non-compliant orders to U.S. exchanges.  According to the order:


		Latour shared portions of its electronic trading infrastructure with its parent company, Tower Research.  Some Tower Research employees could change the computer code without Latour’s knowledge or approval.  Latour’s procedures to prevent such changes from having unintended effects on Latour’s trading proved inadequate. 

		In June 2011, Tower Research made a coding change that introduced an error into the shared infrastructure and, as a result, Latour sent millions of orders to exchanges that did not comply with the requirements of Regulation NMS.  Some of these orders were executed, which led to Latour receiving gross trading profits and also rebates paid by stock exchanges. 

		Latour lacked “direct and exclusive control” over its financial and regulatory risk management controls as required by the SEC’s Market Access Rule and did not have adequate post-trade surveillance tools to detect its non-compliant trades. 

		After learning of the error, Latour corrected many of the issues by October 2012 and addressed the rest by August 2014.


	"Automated trading systems can pose significant risks to the market and must be designed and implemented correctly," said Andrew Ceresney, Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division.  “Firms that do not have control over their trading systems can undermine the integrity of our markets by sending millions of orders that violate SEC and stock exchange rules that promote fair and orderly trading, like Latour did in this case.” 

	According to the SEC’s order, from October 2010 through August 2014, Latour sent approximately 12.6 million orders for more than 4.6 billion shares that did not comply with the requirements of Regulation NMS.  The orders at issue were intermarket sweep orders (ISOs), which trading centers may immediately execute at prices that might otherwise appear to violate Rule 611 of Regulation NMS.  Rule 611 generally requires trades to be executed at the best available displayed price, but trading centers may execute ISOs immediately based on the ISO router’s obligation to send additional orders to execute against any better-priced displayed quotations.  Chiefly because of the coding problem, Latour’s ISOs did not meet the requirements and caused more than 1.1 million trade-throughs (trades executed at a price worse than the best available price) and more 1.7 million locked or crossed markets (when the national best bid equals or exceeds the national best offer).   Latour also sent non-compliant ISOs as a result of incorrectly relying on information about orders that Latour had previously sent.  In addition to violations of the Market Access Rule, the SEC’s order also finds that Latour violated Rule 611(c) of Regulation NMS because it did not take reasonable steps to establish that its ISOs complied with Reg NMS. 

	Robert A. Cohen, co-Chief of the Enforcement Division’s Market Abuse Unit added, “Market structure violations can have a real if sometimes subtle impact on our markets.  Latour received executions and collected exchange rebates that it should not have and that other market participants might have received if not for Latour’s non-compliant orders.”

	Without admitting or denying the findings, Latour consented to the SEC’s order, which requires it to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of Section 15(c)(3) of the Exchange Act and Rule 15c3-5 thereunder and Rule 611(c) of Regulation NMS.  Latour agreed to pay a $5 million penalty, disgorgement of $2,784,875 of gross trading profits and exchange-paid rebates, plus prejudgment interest of $268,564.



	The SEC’s investigation was conducted by William Max Hathaway, Fuad Rana, Ainsley Kerr, and Carolyn Welshhans of the Enforcement Division’s Market Abuse Unit.  The case was supervised by Mr. Cohen.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Chicago Board Options Exchange in this matter.

HFT Co. Latour Fined $16M For Mismanaging Capital Buffer



        By Cara Salvatore



					Law360, New York (September 17, 2014,  2:19 PM EDT) -- The SEC registered a landmark $16 million fine Wednesday against high-frequency trading giant Latour Trading LLC for failures connected to its capital cushion, which the agency says Latour repeatedly miscalculated by as much as $37 million for two years — a mistake facilitated by high volume, according to a top official.The fine against Latour was the agency's first enforcement against an HFT firm, SEC Enforcement Director Andrew Ceresney told reporters. The company repeatedly miscalculated its risk-based holdbacks, called “haircuts,” leaving its net capital as much...

High speed trader Latour says software coding problem led to SEC fine
30 September 2015  |  1623 views  |  0
Source: Latour
Today the SEC announced a settlement with Latour Trading LLC in which Latour consented to the entry of an order relating to Latour's failure to comply with certain regulatory obligations related to its use of intermarket sweep orders ("ISOs").

	As described in the Commission's order, these issues arose predominantly from a software coding error that affected the systems that Latour used to route ISOs. Latour also made a series of changes to its ISO routing logic that, under certain circumstances, caused it to send ISOs to the market that did not comply with the requirements of Regulation NMS. Latour fully remediated these issues by August 2014. The Firm has also enhanced its systems and controls to detect and avert similar issues. The Firm is pleased to put this matter behind us. We take our regulatory obligations seriously and are committed to complying with all rules and regulations applicable to our businesses.

Who Is 'Latour Trading' And How Dare They Upstage Goldman?












          by Tyler Durden

SHARES






















As long-term readers recall, the observation of Goldman's dominant presence in the NYSE's weekly program trading reports by Zero Hedge back in early 2009 was one of the key drivers that set in motion the backlash against algorithmic trading and HFT which back in 2009 was the pinnacle of fringe topics and has since become a daily talking point and market scapegoat du jour on days when stocks are down (but never up). It also drew attention to Goldman's prop trading division which Zero Hedge was the first and only vocal opponent of, and has since been demolished courtesy of the Volcker Rule, an event which both Moody's and Alliance Bernstein now say could cost the bank dearly in top and bottom line, yet which Goldman told us on the record "represents approximately 10% of this year’s reported net revenue." Guess it was more, huh... Yet the same NYSE weekly program trading update indicates that Goldman, up until now a monolith in NYSE program trading, has just lost its crown in that field as well. The new king. A firm called Latour Trading, which in the last week traded 484.6 million shares in principal strategies. Which begs the question: just who is this Latour Trading which dares to upstage the firm that does god's work on earth. Alas, their website has been less than forthright. Inquiring minds certainly want to know.

I don't understand...  Revenue does not mean profit.  Volume traded does not mean profit either.... 
This reminds me of Groupon, where they can claim almost half a billion dollar in revenue, except still net negative.  Regardless, thanks to Earl of Chiswick info, it is evident that NYSE/ARCA "floor" members are just a fascade...  There is no point having a floor any more, everything is electronic.

sorry to nitpick, but you should improve your proofreading.  this headline asks the very interesting question "who" is latour trading, but in the body of the piece you write "how" instead of "who".  yeah, we all know what you meant, but this happens a lot, and it doesn't reflect well on your outstanding website.

David Faucon - "person credited with designing SocGen's original HFT program." Left SocGen with 4 others to go to Tower -- last SocGen HFT guy to leave was dumb enough to actually try and take the HFT code with him. So............ he developed HFT program for large French Bank -- so we know he knows how to use leverage (lots of leverage) and he should be adept at hiding trades ... should make for interesting story line

Mark traded there for 4 1/2 years and built sophisticated tools used to analyze the markets. In the spring of 1998, he left Credit Suisse First Boston to set up Tower Research Capital LLC. Mr. Gorton's professional and educational background provides an unusual combination of math skills and financial knowledge to create and orchestrate the trading strategies utilized at Tower."

Listen up boys, girls, and Chairsatans. 
Tower Research Capital, according to the NFA, has 5 people of 10 listed with 10% or more financial interest [ http://www.nfa.futures.org/BasicNet/Details.aspx?entityid=GKhDZYk5r5s%3d ]. They are as follows: 
William Chuang - David Faucon - John Martello - Nicolas Niquet - David Wichs . 
Now, I'm just some 19 year old peon with an interest in the kind of financial porn that ZH puts out, so some fellow ZH'ers will have to help me with a few things.
When you go to each of these guy's pages, towards the bottom it gives two dates along with 'Principal Pending' and 'Principal Approved.' From what I can gather, this signals when they begin their affiliation with the firm, but again, I need some help navigating this financial speak. But oddly enough, all of these guys got on board (I think?) with Tower recently all within weeks of one another. 
Chuang - Pending - 5/9/2011     Approved - 6/2/2011
Faucon - Pending - 5/9/2011      Approved - 5/25/2011
Martello - Pending - 5/31/2011      Approved - 6/21/2011
Niquet - Pending - 8/16/2011    Approved - 9/2/2011
Wichs - Approved - 4/28/2011
Wichs with Tower Research Capital Europe - Pending - 4/16/2004 Approved - 7/19/2004
Curiously enough, Gorton himself does not have a 10% more interest in Tower. In fact, Chuagn, Faucon, Martello, and Niquet all have a 10% or more interest but have all been there the shortest amount of time. Who, I wonder, had such high stakes before these stooges came along?
I've also managed to dig up Latour's address and phone number. Their address is 10th floor, 377 Broadway, New York, NY 10013. The phone number is (212) 219-6000. 
Surprisingly enough, Tower Research lists themselves at the same address, except on the 11th floor. And the phone number? You guessed it - (212) 219-6000. 
So the two are literally on top of each other. And it also seems, at least to me, that whoever is pulling the strings at Tower is doing the same at Latour.
The plot thickens yet again when it is discovered that Lime Brokerage also had the same number on the list as Latour (admittedly, it is listed as (212) 219-600, but the lack of a single digit does not mislead the hounds). The page which Lime and Latour's phone numbers listed on, when clicked through google, lead straight to the NYSE page. But thanks to cache, we still have the archives of the internet. Oddly enough, the page was last updated on October 1st, 2011 (presumably when it was rerouted or destroyed). Why, then, is Lime's phone number --a mere 9 days later-- (212) 824-5000? Shell companies galore, or what? I'm still new to all of this, so again, help me out. 
I've also found a site that shows their SEC filings, but you've got to be a member to see them. So if any ZH'ers are a member of MarketBrief, follow the link and let us know what you find ( http://marketbrief.com/latour-trading-llc?secwatch ).

Having the same phone number is eaxy to explain. Oftentimes new businesses start out sharing a phone/desk/secretary with other small businesses until they do well enough to afford their own.

Go talk with Nicolas Mascio, he can help shed some light on them.  He handled 106R transfers for Latour in 2009.

How can Latour, with $400 million and some change, compete with GS at all?
Also, from the statement:
"Latour Trading LLC (the “Company”) is limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Tower Research Capital Investments LLC (the “Parent”). Tower Research Capital LLC is the managing member (“Managing Member”) of the Company. The Company’s operations consist primarily of proprietary trading in, but not limited to, equities and futures markets in the United States
  The Company is a broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and is a member of the CBOE Stock Exchange (“CBSX”), which is its designated examining authority."
So they do prop trading, but what else besides equities and futures? 
To anyone with legal experience, are they only required to disclose that they trade in equities and futures while legally being able to trade in other instruments? The whole "but not limited to" leaves a lot of room to squirm. 
Also, the phone number that was listed by NYSE does not match up to the one filed to the SEC, which is (917) 388-8619. This is a cell phone number. Who runs a $400 million operation from a cell phone?! Or is this standard industry procedure or something?

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
