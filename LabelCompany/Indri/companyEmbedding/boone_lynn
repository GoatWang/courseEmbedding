Bookkeeper® for Spray Use in Single Item Treatments


























The American Institute for Conservation


Bookkeeper� for Spray Use in Single Item
Treatments
Terry Boone, Lynn Kidder and Susan
Russick
Introduction
The investigation into a new non-aqueous deacidification system
for use in single item treatments was based on the premise that
deacidification benefits paper based materials and that a
conservator's acceptance of these benefits can be compromised by
dissatisfaction with currently available non-aqueous methods. The
decision to explore the efficacy of the Bookkeeper spray system was
supported by encouraging results in the Bookkeeper Mass
Deacidification System research1.
The goals were to clarify the extent of benefits and risks
associated with Bookkeeper and to develop a protocol for selection,
testing and treatment of rare and special collection materials.

Several tests were developed while working closely with Dr.
Chandru Shahani, Chief, Preservation Research and Testing Division,
Ken Harris, Preservation Projects Director, and the Library's
Preservation Research and Testing Laboratory staff. These tests were
designed to determine the efficacy of the product when applied by
spray to single items through measurement of the quantity of
alkaline reserve deposited by the spray, the uniformity of the spray
application, the speed and extent of the reaction, the amount of
penetration or migration possible, and any effect on media.

The Decision to Deacidify
Although much information and knowledge exists regarding the
benefits and risks of deacidification, many conservators have not
found it easy to interpret and use that information in a consistent
manner. Conservators are responsible for the immediate and long term
consequences of deacidification treatments, and naturally have
reservations about performing treatments which cause unacceptable
alterations in the object even though treatment may prolong the life
of the object. Physical and chemical alterations are direct
consequences of treatment; therefore the intention is to use methods
which provide the highest level of benefit while posing the least
amount of risk to the object. In the past, potential negative
effects of deacidification have manifested themselves as yellowing,
textural change or color shift. Understandably, reluctance to
deacidify leads some conservators to rely on good housing and
storage in lieu of deacidification. These remedies may be
appropriate for specific situations; however, they are only partial
solutions and do not provide maximum benefit for many objects.
Treatment decisions require accountability and need to thoroughly
address the real consequences, including the long term costs of
partial or sub-optimal treatment solutions. The Bookkeeper spray
product is a viable option because testing shows that the chemistry
appears to work as theorized with few unwanted side effects.

The treatment referred to as "deacidification" actually describes
two different situations: one, the removal of acids, by-products and
neutralization of remaining acids, and two, the deposit of an
alkaline material which neutralizes the acids and leaves an alkaline
reserve. When the need for deacidification is indicated as part of a
treatment strategy the conservator must choose between aqueous and
non-aqueous methods. In either system, water is necessary for
deacidification to occur. The most benefit to the cellulose chain
can be gained from aqueous processes because through immersion,
water soluble acids and their by-products are actually washed from
the paper at the same time that neutralization and deposit of an
alkaline reserve occurs. Where aqueous treatment is not possible,
neutralization and deposit of an alkaline reserve can still be
achieved using a non-aqueous process. Non-aqueous systems all rely
on the natural moisture content of the paper and ambient humidity to
allow the neutralization reaction to proceed. There are several
non-aqueous deacidification systems available. All of these pose
concerns for the object, the conservator and the environment.
Additionally, some of the chemicals are costly and face government
restrictions on usage and disposal. Various formulations have been
known to leave an odor or visible surface deposit, cause changes in
media solubility or color, cause discoloration of paper, or alter
the feel and drape of a sheet. (Bookkeeper does not leave an odor on
treated objects, but in some cases a velvety feel is evident when
handling treated paper.) Furthermore, the unpredictable effects of
application method and equipment also influence the conservator's
willingness to deacidify. A particular concern has been the question
of "preferential aging", or spots and streaks caused by uneven
deposits which age at different rates and are thought to create
areas of varying strength and weakness. Aging tests looking for
evidence of application methods on preferential effects have not
been completed as of this publication.

In 1993 and 1994 the Library contracted with a team of technical
experts to evaluate the effects of deacidification with the
Bookkeeper mass system. Standard Library of Congress blue test books
and a wide variety of bound volumes representing typical Library
collection materials were treated by immersion in Bookkeeper. The
blue books were then examined, aged and tested for physical
endurance. The testing showed that Bookkeeper deposited an adequate
alkaline reserve and the treated samples sustained greater fold
endurance and tear strength compared to untreated samples.
Evaluation of the book components of every test volume (cover,
materials, titling, binding, paper, media, etc.) revealed a uniform
deposit and no unacceptable evidence of treatment. Since 1995, about
150,000 books at the Library of Congress have been treated with the
mass process. The Bookkeeper Spray system has been in use for the
last few years on a wide range of collection materials at a growing
number of institutions worldwide.

The Bookkeeper non-aqueous deacidification method uses a
non-toxic, inert liquid (perfluoroalkane), containing sub-micron
sized particles of magnesium oxide with the addition of a surfactant
( a perfluoropolyether derivative) to aid in the dispersion of the
particles. When the product is sprayed onto the object, the carrier
and surfactant rapidly evaporate and magnesium oxide particles
remain lodged in the paper fibers. The acid neutralization process
begins, in theory, when ambient moisture or water inherent in the
paper reacts with the magnesium oxide to form magnesium
hydroxide.

Methodology

Fig, 1. Bookkeeper Spray System

The Bookkeeper Spray System consists of an air compressor, and a
two gallon metal container connected to a six foot hose attached to
a metal spray gun that produces a flat 70 ¡ fan of spray (fig. 1). The primary area of spray deposit is about
six inches wide, bordered by approximately two inches of lighter
pattern on either side.

The medium spraying technique used in all the tests was designed
to replicate a conservator's standard treatment approach. Working in
the fume hood, the spraying parameters were defined as follows: all
spraying traveled across the paper in a horizontal pattern at a rate
of approximately 2 inches per second, at a distance of 8-10 inches
from the object. The technique is to overlap at the edges of the arc
in order to create an overall even application. The spraying began
and ended off the object. The "light" spray was defined as spraying
half the amount of time of the medium application, and the "heavy"
spray was two applications of the medium.

Because each of the tests had a separate methodology and results,
each will be discussed briefly with conclusions summarized at the
end.

Fig. 2b. Alkaline Reserve of Sprayed Samples of
Blue Book Papers vs. Samples Immersed in Mass System

A test was designed to quantify how much magnesium was deposited
with spray applications. A comparison with the results from the mass
immersion system would allow one to extrapolate longevity
expectations for treated objects. Test procedure was to select four
papers from the standard blue test books that the Library of
Congress had prepared for testing mass deacidification. The papers,
Whatman chromatography, Clearspring offset, alum rosin sized, and
newsprint, all had a pre-treatment pH below 7. Fiber content
respectively included cotton, softwood Kraft, and chemical and
mechanical wood pulp. The samples were sprayed on both sides with
light, medium and heavy applications. pH was measured and alkaline
reserve titrated using TAPPI standard procedure #T553 PM-92 (fig. 2a). Figure 2b shows
that the sprayed alkaline reserve deposit was comparable to the mass
immersion samples. The vertical axis represents increased percentage
of alkaline reserve expressed in terms of CaCO3 and each
set of columns represents one of the four papers. A medium spray
deposited close to 1% alkaline reserve on the four sample
papers.

Uniformity of Deposit Test
Two tests were designed to visually evaluate the degree of
uniformity of the spray deposit. Test "A" was simply to spray
samples of black paper with light and heavy applications and compare
them with a sample which was individually immersed. The lightly
sprayed sample showed no visual evidence of treatment. The sample
which was heavily sprayed remained uniform overall but no longer
appeared as densely black as the unsprayed sample. Particles were
not distinctly visible on the sprayed samples, because when properly
dispersed they are too small to be seen under low
magnification2.

Test "B" was designed to reveal the pattern of magnesium deposit
created by the spray nozzle. It was assumed that paper impregnated
with a pH indicator solution would instantly record the spray
pattern during application . Indicator papers were created by
immersing standard Whatman chromatography paper in brilliant yellow
indicator solution. In the acidic phase (below 6.6) this indicator
is bright yellow and appears red-orange when alkaline (above pH
7.8). The indicator paper samples were sprayed with Bookkeeper
solution on both sides with a medium application.


Fig. 3. Color Change in Treated and Humidified
Indicator Paper

After spraying the treated indicator samples remained yellow and
did not undergo the anticipated color shift indicating alkalinity.
The samples were then placed between blotters and stored at room
temperature for a few days to allow inherent moisture in the paper
and ambient humidity to cause the change, but still no change was
observed. The decision was made to accelerate the process by
humidifying the samples to reveal the spray pattern. Within 5-15
minutes in a warm water passive humidity chamber, the color changed
gradually, ultimately reaching the red-orange color in about an hour
(fig. 3). A relatively even spray pattern was
evident during the early stages of humidification. However, as
humidification progressed, the pattern disappeared and the sheet
became a solid color. Occasional areas of variable quantities of
deposit (such as those caused by drips and sputters) were not
visible on the fully humidified samples.

Speed and Extent of Neutralization Reaction Test

Fig. 4. Comparison of Colorimeter Readings of
Humidified and Unhumidified Treated Samples

The 1994 report states that "the chemistries leading to acid
neutralization are poorly understood and occur over some indefinite
time period following the treatment"3. The color change in the brilliant yellow
indicator paper to orange is a pH sensitivity reaction The lack of a
change suggests that if neutralization occurs the pH of the paper is
less than or equal to 6.6. Significant moisture (passive
humidification in this instance) had to be introduced in order to
cause the pH change in these alkaline sensitive test materials. A
test was designed to measure the speed and extent of the
neutralizing action because the expected color change did not appear
to be occurring in the indicator papers without exposure to
additional moisture. The Minolta Chroma Meter CR-221 was used to
record color change over time because changes in the unhumidified
samples were so subtle. Six groups of indicator papers were tested,
some sprayed with the product on one side and some on both sides.
Half of the samples were humidified and half were not. Dramatic
color change occurred in treated samples which had been humidified,
while there was no visual evidence of change in those that had not
been humidified. Figure 4 compares results of
two different samples, one humidified and the other not, where the
colorimeter readings were taken before treatment and over a five
week period after humidification. The measured color change over
time was insignificant in the unhumidified samples. Humidification
definitely accelerated the rate and the extent of the color change
in the samples. There was a sharp initial increase in redness at the
time of humidification which then leveled off and remained fairly
constant.


Fig. 5. Comparison of Front and Back of Humidified
Single Sample Treated on Front Only

Figure 5 compares the colorimeter readings
from the front and back of a single sheet which was treated only on
the front and then humidified. While a dramatic increase in redness
occurred on the treated side, there was also a significant increase
in redness on the untreated side. Penetration from the treated side
of the sample through to the untreated side was unexpected since the
magnesium is felt to be too large to move into the paper itself.
Observation of what might indicate penetration led to the
development of the next test.

Fig. 7b. Alkaline Reserve of Japanese Paper Block
Samples


The fourth test was designed to determine the degree of
penetration of Bookkeeper into the paper. Two sets of sample blocks
were made, one of acidic newsprint (ca 1970's) and one of acidified
Japanese paper (ca. 1990's). The newsprint blocks were made by
layering six sheets wet out with water then pressed together. The
Japanese blocks were made up of nine sheets, also wet out and
pressed together. When dried, the blocks were sprayed with the
Bookkeeper product on one side. The blocks were then edge trimmed
and cut into twelve sample blocks. The samples were humidified for
one hour, or 24 hour periods, or not at all. After humidification,
the sample blocks were dried under pressure in order to keep the
layers in contact with each other, then they were disassembled, and
each layer was titrated separately for alkaline reserve and pH (fig.
6, 6a and fig. 7, 7a).

Both sample groups showed significant alkaline reserve in the top
layer, some alkaline reserve in the second layer and a corresponding
rise in the respective pH. Initial test results of the Japanese
paper blocks show a significant alkaline reserve on the second layer
as well as measurable amounts on layers three and four. Due to time
constraints the number of our samples was limited and therefore
additional data needs to be collected before further conclusions are
drawn regarding Japanese papers.

The newsprint samples showed significant alkaline reserve in the
top layer, two of the samples showed a measurable alkaline reserve
in the second layer and all samples had an elevated pH in the top
and second layers. These numbers indicate penetration of the
alkaline material through the first layer of newsprint.

There was no significant difference between the alkaline reserves
and pH Values between the one hour humidified and unhumidified
samples, which indicates penetration occurred at the time of
application. However the 24 hour humidification did cause change,
resulting in lower alkaline reserves and pH

Values. The lower alkaline reserve results are significant
because they indicate that the alkaline reserve has been partially
used, yet a measurable amount remains in the sample. The pH level in
the top layer has correspondingly been slightly reduced, but remains
comparable to that of the samples which were not humidified and
those which received an hour of humidification.

A wide range of media has already been tested in the mass project
(fig. 8). Although the Bookkeeper product has
not been found to cause bleeding or sinking of any media, pH related
color shifts are of course possible. The one example of a pH color
shift that was observed was in the mass immersion process where a
blue highlighter marker turned green (without humidification) as a
result of treatment with Bookkeeper. In these final tests media was
selected which was specific to rare materials, including some known
to be alkaline sensitive (fig. 9). All were
commercially produced watercolor or gouache except for the gamboge
and copper acetate/verdigris, which were made following historic
recipes. Bookkeeper was applied to samples as follows: no
application, light on one side, light on both sides, heavy on one
side, heavy on both sides or immersed. When treated on only one side
the Bookkeeper was sprayed directly onto the media side of the
sample. Again, sample groups were humidified either for one hour or
24 hours or not at all.

Results showed that some of the darker colors which had received
a heavier application appeared to be very slightly grayer or hazier
than the same colors which got light and medium applications. This
effect is not specifically a change in the media, but the result of
white deposit on a dark or solid colored field. Most of the samples
did not undergo a noticeable change, with the exception of gamboge.
Samples of gamboge which were treated but not humidified remained
yellow. After humidification, gamboge displayed a textbook example
of a pH color shift. It was interesting to note that the color shift
to orange was complete on the sample which had Bookkeeper lightly
applied on both sides and on those with the heavier applications,
yet the samples which were lightly treated on one side and
humidified were still very true to the original yellow color.

Additional media and papers which have been treated are listed in
Appendix 1.

Conclusions and Recommendations for Use
To summarize, the intention was to determine the efficacy of the
product when applied by spray to single items, to measure the
quantity of alkaline reserve deposited by the spray, the uniformity
of the spray application, the speed and extent of the reaction, the
amount of penetration or migration possible and any effect on media.
In general it appeared that the equipment applied the product
effectively, uniformly and deposited an adequate alkaline reserve,
and produced minimal effect on a wide range of media. It also
appeared from this work that the product penetrated into the test
papers, and that humidity played a role in the process of using the
alkaline reserve.


Fig. 10. Selection for Treatment with
Bookkeeper

A conservator would consider the needs of the object when
interpreting any test results and incorporating the information into
actual treatment (fig. 10). Tests showed that
the system will deposit an adequate alkaline reserve when applied to
most papers using a medium spray, but of course, the spraying
technique should be customized to the paper and media. For example,
a more open paper like Japanese, whether by fiber formation, or
breakdown of size or age, will be penetrated more easily than a
paper of greater weight, harder surface or fresher size.

In order to obtain the most significant alkaline reserve and
penetration it is recommended that most papers be sprayed on both
sides. Penetration occurs as a result of wetness at the time of
spraying and the spray should be applied with this in mind.
Post-treatment humidification is a step to consider because it
accelerates the acid neutralization process, but tests showed that
measurable deacidification will occur to some extent even without
humidification.

The behavioral evidence of the chemistry of Bookkeeper on pH
sensitive media allows the conservator greater latitude in treatment
decisions.

Bookkeeper poses minimal risk to most of the media that was
tested. However, it is clear that in order to witness potential pH
color shifts both Bookkeeper and moisture must be applied. The risk
of color shift is greatly reduced if less of the product is used, or
if it is applied to the verso. Bookkeeper has been applied
successfully to most papers, however the product is somewhat evident
on dark colors and highly calendered papers. Layering on lightly
would be an option when the color or surface quality of the paper or
media will cause a deposit to be more visible. Documentation of
objects treated with Bookkeeper is important since future treatment
or water emergencies may result in color shift.

Although Bookkeeper is non-toxic, fine particulates are involved
which may result in lung or eye irritations, and the use of gloves
and the fume hood are recommended for this reason. Because of the
rapid drying time, low reactivity, and non-toxic nature of the
carrier, items may be removed from the fume hood immediately after
spraying. Batched treatments or bound materials may be stacked or
closed without fear of distortion or offsetting.

More extensive testing of media treated with Bookkeeper will
allow expanded protocol for selection. Research needs to be
undertaken on potential reactions with graphite, metallic printing
inks, and other media conservators encounter in their work.

While Bookkeeper will not solve all non-aqueous deacidification
problems, the Bookkeeper spray system provides a safe, effective and
easily used method which causes virtually no evident harm to the
environment, the user and the object.

2. Because the alkaline
deposit resulting from mass immersion appears uniform on white paper
before and after accelerated aging, by visual observation and with
magnification it seemed possible that immersion of a single sheet
would provide a similarly uniform deposit. When immersed and air
dried, the product puddled on the paper, resulting in a blotchy
appearance and a visible white deposit. When viewed under .8-64X
magnification, clumps of magnesium particles were evident along the
tidal edge of the puddling on the immersed sample.
