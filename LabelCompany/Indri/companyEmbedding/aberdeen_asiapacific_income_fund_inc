		                                    Aberdeen Asia-Pacific Income Fund, Inc. (NYSE MKT: FAX)
Aims to provide monthly income by investing primarily in locally researched Asian and Australian debt securities.





















								Investment Objective




The Fund’s principal investment objective is to seek current income. The Fund may also achieve incidental capital appreciation.
Investment Policies
To achieve its investment objectives, the Fund normally invests at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in Asian debt securities, Australian debt securities and New Zealand debt securities.
The information contained above provides only a brief summary description of the Fund's investment objective and investment policies.
For more detailed information on the specific risks associated with this Fund, please view the Fund’s Important Risk Considerations.

Factsheet
Commentary

Risk Considerations
International investing entails special risk considerations, including currency fluctuations, lower liquidity, economic and political risks, and differences in accounting methods; these risks are generally heightened for emerging market investments.
Concentrating investments in the Asia-Pacific region subjects the Fund to more volatility and greater risk of loss than geographically diverse funds.
Fixed income securities are subject to certain risks including, but not limited to: interest rate (changes in interest rates may cause a decline in the market value of an investment), credit (changes in the financial condition of the issuer, borrower, counterparty, or underlying collateral), prepayment (debt issuers may repay or refinance their loans or obligations earlier than anticipated), and extension (principal repayments may not occur as quickly as anticipated, causing the expected maturity of a security to increase)

Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited (the "Investment Manager"), Aberdeen Asset Management Limited (the "Investment Adviser"), Aberdeen Asset Managers Limited (the "Sub-Adviser") and Aberdeen Asset Management Inc. (the "Administrator") are each a subsidiary of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC ("Aberdeen PLC").  On March 6, 2017, the Boards of Standard Life plc and Aberdeen PLC announced that they had reached an agreement on the terms of a merger ("Merger"). The Boards of each of Standard Life plc and Aberdeen PLC believe that the Merger has a compelling strategic and financial rationale through combining complementary strengths to create a world-class investment group. The Merger is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2017, subject to various conditions and terms, including regulatory approvals. The portfolio management team for the Fund is not expected to change as a result of the Merger.  In addition, the agreements that the Fund has with Aberdeen PLC's subsidiary companies, the services provided by such companies, and the fees charged for those services are not expected to change as a result of the Merger.
Closed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges. The Fund's investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value (NAV) of the fund's portfolio. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.
Total return figures with distributions reinvested at the dividend reinvestment price are stated net-of-fees and represents past performance.  Past performance is not indicative of future results, current performance may be higher or lower.  Holdings are subject to change and are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities shown.  Inception date April 25, 1986.

Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited (the "Investment Manager"), Aberdeen Asset Management Limited (the "Investment Adviser"), Aberdeen Asset Managers Limited (the "Sub-Adviser") and Aberdeen Asset Management Inc. (the "Administrator") are each a subsidiary of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC ("Aberdeen PLC").  On March 6, 2017, the Boards of Standard Life plc and Aberdeen PLC announced that they had reached an agreement on the terms of a merger ("Merger"). The Boards of each of Standard Life plc and Aberdeen PLC believe that the Merger has a compelling strategic and financial rationale through combining complementary strengths to create a world-class investment group. The Merger is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2017, subject to various conditions and terms, including regulatory approvals. The portfolio management team for the Fund is not expected to change as a result of the Merger.  In addition, the agreements that the Fund has with Aberdeen PLC's subsidiary companies, the services provided by such companies, and the fees charged for those services are not expected to change as a result of the Merger.
Closed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges. The Fund's investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value (NAV) of the fund's portfolio. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.

								Aberdeen Asia-Pacific Income Fund, Inc.
As home to the world's first, second, and fourth most populous countries, we believe the Asia-Pacific region should be on every investor's radar. But the sector holds long-term opportunities beyond China, India, and Indonesia. Investors know to look for opportunities both large and small but can get overwhelmed in places where change is the only constant. Aberdeen's years of studied involvement throughout the Far East helps us see it holistically and sift through the noise.
Open your world with the Aberdeen Asia-Pacific Income Fund.

Credit Quality Breakdown













As of May 31, 2017.
Generally the credit ratings range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). Where bonds held in the Fund are rated by multiple rating agencies (Moody’s, S&P and Fitch), the lower of the ratings is used. This may not be consistent with data from the benchmark provider. Quality distribution represents ratings of the underlying securities held within the Fund, and not ratings of the Fund itself. Compositions are subject to change.

Field Report
Investment idea: Aberdeen Asia-Pacific Income Fund, Inc. (FAX)



 
Similar to other emerging markets in Aberdeen Asset Management's portfolio, Asia-Pacific is an unfamiliar region shrouded in myth. The area holds more than its fair share of potential investment opportunities. It’s only a matter of distinguishing fact from fiction.
The Aberdeen Asia-Pacific Income Fund, Inc. (FAX) seeks to offer investors good yield through corporate and government bonds, backed by solid fundamentals, leverage and sustainable growth.
Breaking down the myths in Asia-Pacific
One common misconception is that China is the only economy that matters in Asia. Not only have we already seen growth in China slow down, but India’s economy is now growing even faster than China. With a population of more than 1.2 billion, India is now on the verge of becoming the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.1 Another overlooked Asia-Pacific region is Indonesia, which is rich in resources and the world’s fourth most populous country. Both of these regions play a significant role in the Aberdeen Asia-Pacific Income Fund, Inc.
High political risk is another myth in the Asia-Pacific region. Countries in the region are at various stages of political and economic development, making high political risk a generalization that simply doesn’t hold true in our view. Singapore, for example, has maintained a sovereign rating of AAA2 for years because its government hasn’t added to its budget deficit since the 1980s. Its currency is also tied closely to the Aberdeen Asia-Pacific Income Fund. In other countries tied to the fund, such as Indonesia, South Korea and the Philippines, sovereign ratings are currently on the rise.

Ratings from ‘AA’ to ‘CCC’ may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. The investment grade category is a rating from AAA to BBB-.

Important information
Indexes are unmanaged and have been provided for comparison purposes only. No fees or expenses are reflected. You cannot invest directly in an index.
Closed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges. The Fund’s investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value (NAV) of the fund’s portfolio. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Foreign securities are more volatile, harder to price and less liquid than U.S. securities. They are subject to different accounting and regulatory standards, and political and economic risks. These risks are enhanced in emerging market countries. Concentrating investments in the Asia-Pacific region subjects the Fund to more volatility and greater risk of loss than geographically diverse funds.
Equity stocks of small and mid-cap companies carry greater risk, and more volatility than equity stocks of larger, more established companies.
Fixed income securities are subject to certain risks including, but not limited to: interest rate (changes in interest rates may cause a decline in the market value of an investment), credit (changes in the financial condition of the issuer, borrower, counterparty, or underlying collateral), prepayment (debt issuers may repay or refinance their loans or obligations earlier than anticipated), and extension (principal repayments may not occur as quickly as anticipated, causing the expected maturity of a security to increase).

Business Continuity Management & Disaster Recovery Programs
There can be no assurance that the Board will maintain the Fund's distribution rate at a particular level, or that the Board will continue a managed distribution policy. Additionally, distributions may include return of capital as well as net investment income and capital gains. If the Fund's investments do not generate sufficient income, the Fund may be required to liquidate a portion of its portfolio to fund these distributions. If the Fund's distributions consist of a large amount of return of capital, it may result in a deterioration of the Fund's assets.

Nuveen Covered Call Closed-End Funds 
For income-oriented investors who are seeking the growth and diversification potential of equities, but who desire higher income and reduced volatility, covered call closed-end funds (also known as equity option closed-end funds) can be an attractive diversifying portfolio opportunity.



Covered Call Strategies for Today's Income Investors 
Nuveen's covered call closed-end funds have been designed to meet the income, risk, and diversification needs of income-oriented investors. Combining a traditional equity portfolio strategy of persistently selling covered calls, then monetizing the long-term expected total returns into quarterly cash distributions, results in the strong potential for a diversifying, higher-yielding and more stable investment.

Nasdaq

DJIA

Nuveen Dow 30SM DynamicOverwrite Fund (DIAX)



What are covered call strategies?
							Covered call strategy funds invest in a portfolio of stocks, and sell call options on either individual stocks or stock indices, for the purpose of enhancing total return, reducing volatility, and providing a measure of downside protection over time.  The fund receives a premium from the buyer of the call option, and must sell or deliver the underlying stock (or cash, in the case of a stock index call option) if the call option is exercised by the buyer.  The value of the stocks that are linked to call options sold, relative to the value of full stock portfolio, is termed the Option Overwrite percentage.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
