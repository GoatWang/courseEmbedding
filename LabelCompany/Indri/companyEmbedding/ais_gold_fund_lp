U.S. Global Investors - What's Driving Gold?


























What’s Driving Gold Today?





Cause
Effects
Possible Ramifications



Low or Negative Interest Rates
When real interest rates are low (or negative), investors turn away from paper assets with declining value and turn toward assets with real value, like gold. 
More Demand for Gold
Higher Gold Prices


Central Bank Policy
For the past several years, central banks around the world have switched from being net sellers to net buyers of gold.
Gold Viewed as Currency
Higher Gold Prices


Growth in World Money Supply
Central banks around the world are focused on stimulative monetary policies to encourage growth.
Declining Confidence in Paper Money
Higher Gold Prices


Lack of New Discoveries in Gold Mines
Gold miners have experienced increased labor costs and taxes, resulting in a higher replacement cost per ounce of gold.
Stagnant Production and Reduced Supply
Higher Gold Prices


China and India “Chindia” Have Strong Cultural Affinity for Gold
Growing middle classes in the world’s most populous countries fuel gold buying for weddings and seasonal gifts.
Increased Spending Power Correlated with Gold Buying 
Higher Gold Prices


There is no guarantee that factors described above will result in higher gold prices.

Expense ratios as stated in the most recent prospectus. The Adviser of the World Precious Minerals Fund has voluntarily limited total fund operating expenses (exclusive of acquired fund fees and expenses of 0.05%, extraordinary expenses, taxes, brokerage commissions and interest, and advisory fee performance adjustments) to not exceed 1.90%. With the voluntary expense waiver amount of 0.15%, total annual expenses after reimbursement were 1.81%. U.S. Global Investors, Inc. can modify or terminate the voluntary limit at any time, which may lower a fund’s yield or return.

Performance data quoted above is historical. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Results reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings. For a portion of periods, the fund had expense limitations, without which returns would have been lower. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. The principal value and investment return of an investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance does not include the effect of any direct fees described in the fund’s prospectus (e.g., short-term trading fees of 0.05%) which, if applicable, would lower your total returns. Performance quoted for periods of one year or less is cumulative and not annualized. Obtain performance data current to the most recent month-end at www.usfunds.com or 1-800-US-FUNDS. High double-digit returns are attributable, in part, to unusually favorable market conditions and may not be repeated or consistently achieved in the future.
Please consider carefully a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. For this and other important information, obtain a fund prospectus by visiting www.usfunds.com or by calling 1-800-US-FUNDS (1-800-873-8637). Read it carefully before investing. Foreside Fund Services, LLC, Distributor. U.S. Global Investors is the investment adviser.
Gold, precious metals, and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme. The prices of gold, precious metals, and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. We suggest investing no more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio in these sectors.
Diversification does not protect an investor from market risks and does not assure a profit.
The NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index is a modified market capitalization weighted index comprised of publicly traded companies involved primarily in the mining for gold and silver.  The index benchmark value was 500.0 at the close of trading on December 20, 2002.
        
Morningstar Ratings are based on risk-adjusted return. The Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Past performance does not guarantee future results. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Ratingä based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)

 AIS Gold Fund LP
 AIS Capital Management LLC


Company Overview 


AIS (Applied Intelligence Strategies) is a registered investment advisor, CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) and CPO (Commodity Pool Operator) that provides discretionary management of stocks, bonds and futures portfolios for individuals, trusts, retirement plans, IRA rollover accounts, foundations, endowments, and major U.S. brokerage firms. The AIS Group consists of two companies that offer several different investment styles: 

(1) AIS Futures Management which offers the MAAP strategy and 

(2) AIS Capital Management which offers the Gold, TAAP and Capital Growth strategies.


Fund Strategy 


The AIS Gold Strategy invests in a combination of gold and other precious metals bullion and futures contracts, and equities of companies engaged in gold or other precious metals mining. While the fund has the ability to be 100% invested in cash equivalents, the combined value of all positions will usually be two times that of the equity and may at times be leveraged up to three times the available equity. AIS employs discretion and input from its proprietary systematic trading systems in the timing of purchases and sales and the determination of leverage for the strategy.

A QUICK OVERVIEW





AIS IN DETAIL





THE AIS DIFFERENCE





MANUFACTURING MARVELS











Environmental Sustainability

                    At AIS, we have always been a leader in Lean Manufacturing. We strive to eliminate waste from our manufacturing processes every step of the way - the way Mother Nature intended. By manufacturing products with a high recycled content, that are SCS Indoor Advantage Gold certified, and designed for future re-use, our goal is to support a healthy, sustainable natural environment, for present and future generations. And, it doesn't end there – we have a partnership with ANEW; offering our clients a way to repurpose unwanted office furniture. Many of our products have been level® certified, as we maintain the ANSI/BIFMA e3-2014e Furniture Sustainability Standard through our company’s culture and processes.  At AIS we're always working to find a better way, a more sustainable approach. It's a journey we are committed to.
                
Take-back Solution for Surplus Office Furniture
AIS has partnered with ANEW to provide a take-back solution for surplus office furniture and materials. This partnership provides AIS clients with a means to repurpose their furniture, fixtures and architectural materials, diverting the items from landfill. All captured materials are donated to public agencies and charities within a 50 mile radius, benefiting the local communities to which the furniture resided.
ANEW, a 501 (c)(3) non-profit organization, provides companies with sustainable alternatives for their surplus furniture and other items with the priority of matching it to non-profits, public agencies and underserved communities while avoiding landfill. This simple practice furthers corporate citizenship, social responsibility and environmental sustainability. With a nationwide reach of service providers and project managers, ANEW is a single point resource, coordinating the removal of all surplus in any condition from the interior built environment, conducting community outreach to charities and others, then reporting the results and metrics of every project. In its 9 years of existence ANEW has diverted 13.5 million pounds from landfill, serving over 800 organizations in 20 countries. ANEW educates through action, transforming corporate surplus into community service.

    Opportunities in Gold Research
  Bottom-up, fundamental research is critical
  AIS focuses solely on companies (among other variables):
     In “safe haven” areas
     In mining-friendly jurisdictions
     With higher-grade deposits
     Who do not hedge production
     With low production costs per ounce, to maximize cash flow
  Portfolio companies must have attractive valuations

    Declining World Gold Supply
 The number of major gold discoveries made per year
 is shrinking
 New finds are significantly smaller than earlier ones
 Average gold grade of these discoveries has declined,
 and is now half of what it was in 1980
 In addition to this decline in discovery quality, overall
 productivity is slipping: global mine production has
 been steadily dropping since 2001

    The Impact of Government on Inflation
Producer Prices (1720- December 2009)

1000
                Prior to 1951, price inflation occurred during
                wars and other times of shortage. After the
                event ended, prices deflated back to where
                they had been. Since 1951, our government

U.S. Global Investors - What's Driving Gold?


























What’s Driving Gold Today?





Cause
Effects
Possible Ramifications



Low or Negative Interest Rates
When real interest rates are low (or negative), investors turn away from paper assets with declining value and turn toward assets with real value, like gold. 
More Demand for Gold
Higher Gold Prices


Central Bank Policy
For the past several years, central banks around the world have switched from being net sellers to net buyers of gold.
Gold Viewed as Currency
Higher Gold Prices


Growth in World Money Supply
Central banks around the world are focused on stimulative monetary policies to encourage growth.
Declining Confidence in Paper Money
Higher Gold Prices


Lack of New Discoveries in Gold Mines
Gold miners have experienced increased labor costs and taxes, resulting in a higher replacement cost per ounce of gold.
Stagnant Production and Reduced Supply
Higher Gold Prices


China and India “Chindia” Have Strong Cultural Affinity for Gold
Growing middle classes in the world’s most populous countries fuel gold buying for weddings and seasonal gifts.
Increased Spending Power Correlated with Gold Buying 
Higher Gold Prices


There is no guarantee that factors described above will result in higher gold prices.

Expense ratios as stated in the most recent prospectus. The Adviser of the World Precious Minerals Fund has voluntarily limited total fund operating expenses (exclusive of acquired fund fees and expenses of 0.05%, extraordinary expenses, taxes, brokerage commissions and interest, and advisory fee performance adjustments) to not exceed 1.90%. With the voluntary expense waiver amount of 0.15%, total annual expenses after reimbursement were 1.81%. U.S. Global Investors, Inc. can modify or terminate the voluntary limit at any time, which may lower a fund’s yield or return.

Performance data quoted above is historical. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Results reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings. For a portion of periods, the fund had expense limitations, without which returns would have been lower. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. The principal value and investment return of an investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance does not include the effect of any direct fees described in the fund’s prospectus (e.g., short-term trading fees of 0.05%) which, if applicable, would lower your total returns. Performance quoted for periods of one year or less is cumulative and not annualized. Obtain performance data current to the most recent month-end at www.usfunds.com or 1-800-US-FUNDS. High double-digit returns are attributable, in part, to unusually favorable market conditions and may not be repeated or consistently achieved in the future.
Please consider carefully a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. For this and other important information, obtain a fund prospectus by visiting www.usfunds.com or by calling 1-800-US-FUNDS (1-800-873-8637). Read it carefully before investing. Foreside Fund Services, LLC, Distributor. U.S. Global Investors is the investment adviser.
Gold, precious metals, and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme. The prices of gold, precious metals, and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. We suggest investing no more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio in these sectors.
Diversification does not protect an investor from market risks and does not assure a profit.
The NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index is a modified market capitalization weighted index comprised of publicly traded companies involved primarily in the mining for gold and silver.  The index benchmark value was 500.0 at the close of trading on December 20, 2002.
        
Morningstar Ratings are based on risk-adjusted return. The Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Past performance does not guarantee future results. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Ratingä based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)
