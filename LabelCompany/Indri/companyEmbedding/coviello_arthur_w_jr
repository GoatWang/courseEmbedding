Keynote summary by Gaspar Modelo-Howard
The State of Security
Arthur W. Coviello, Jr., Chairman, RSA, The Security Division of EMC
Mr. Coviello opened his keynote with a quote from Nicholas Negroponte: “Internet is the most overhyped, yet underestimated phenomenon in history”. This statement, Mr. Coviello argues, it is still true today. And to determine the state of security, one does not have to look beyond the state of the Internet.
The growth of the Internet has driven the evolution of computing in the last few decades. Computing has gone through radical transformations: from its early days with mainframes, to computers, moving later to networks in the 80s and then to the rise of the Internet and the World Wide Web in the mid 90s. We are currently experiencing a confluence of technologies and trends (cloud computing, big data, social media, mobile, consumerization of IT) that make clear that the next transformation of computing is well underway and creating new challenges to security. Coviello contended the past evolution of IT infrastructure gives clear signals to the fast and deep changes security should continue to experience in the future. As an example and in just a couple of years, the IT industry has moved from 1 exabyte of data to 1.8 zettabytes, from the iPod to the iPad, from 513M to over 2B Internet users, from speeds of 100kbps to 100Mbps, and from AOL to Facebook (which would be the 3rd largest country in the world, by considering its number of users as population).
Coviello then used an interesting analogy to explain the impact in security of the continuous growth of the Internet, and therefore the need to better empower security. Imagine that the Internet is a highway system that is experiencing an exponential growth in the number of cars that use it. The highway system then needs to increase the number of lanes of existing roads, add new roads, and provide better ways for cars to access the system. But all this growth also increases the number and complexity of accidents on the roads. Then, security needs to grow accordingly to better manage (prevent, detect, and respond) the new scenario of potential accidents.
Looking at the security world, things have also changed dramatically over the years. Not long ago there were tens of thousands of viruses and their corresponding signatures, where as now there are tens of millions. Organized crime and spying online is a very real threat today that was not really happening in 2001. The scenario is then more difficult today for security practitioners to protect their networks. Stuxnet opened a new threat era for security. We have long moved away from the times of script kiddies. The new breed of attackers include: (1) non-state actors, like terrorists and anti-establishment vigilantes; (2) criminals, that act like a technology company by expanding their market around the world to distribute their products and services, and have sophisticated supply chains; and (3) nation-state actors, which are stealth and sophisticated, difficult to detect, well-resourced, and efficient.
Coviello briefly explained the high profiled breach experienced by RSA in 2011. They were attacked by two advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. From the steps taken, it is very clear that a lot of research on the company was made before the attacks. Phishing email was used to get inside their networks, sending the messages to a carefully selected group of RSA employees. The messages included an Excel attachment that contained a zero-day exploit (Adobe Flash vulnerability), which installed a backdoor when triggered. The attackers knew what they wanted, and went low and slow. The attack went on for 2 weeks, with RSA staying two to three hours behind the attackers’ moves. The attackers were able to ex-filtrate information from the networks, but RSA ultimately determined that no loss was produced to the company from the attack. As for the experience, Coviello acknowledged that is still not a good idea for a security company to get breached.
We are past the tipping point, were physical and virtual worlds could be separated. Additionally, the confluence of technologies and trends is creating more ‘open’ systems. The security industry is challenged as the open systems are more difficult to secure (than close systems, each under a single domain). We need to secure what in a way can’t be controlled. It is then not difficult to explain what has happened recently, in terms of breaches. In 2011, many high-profiled attacks occurred (in what others have labeled as the ‘Year of the Security Breach’) to big organizations like Google, Sony, RSA, PBS, BAH (Booz, Allen, Hamilton), Diginotar, and governmental entities such as the Japanese Parliament and the Australian Prime Minister.
Coviello argued that vendors and manufacturers must stop the linear approach used in the security industry to keep adding layer after layer of security control mechanisms. Security products should not be silos. We need to educate computer users, but keeping in mind that people make mistakes. After all we are humans. Our mindset must change from playing defense, as protection from perimeter does not work alone. Also, security practitioners and technologists must show an ability for big picture thinking and having people skills.
We need to get leverage from all security products, therefore the need to move away from the security silos architecture. Fortunately, the age of big data is arriving to the security world. Coviello provided a definition to big data: collecting datasets from numerous sources, at a large scale, and to produce actionable information from analyzing the datasets. The security objective is then to reduce the window of vulnerabilities for all attacks. The age of big data should also promote the sharing of information, which unfortunately is currently a synonym for failure. Organizations do not work together to defend against attacks.
Mr. Coviello calls for the creation of multi-source intelligence products. They must be risk-based, as there are different types of risks and should consider the different vulnerabilities, threats, and impacts affecting each organization. The intelligence products should be agile, having deep visibility of the protected system. They should detect anomalies in real time and the corresponding responses should be automated in order to scale and be deployed pervasively. Unfortunately today, systems are a patchwork of security products, focusing only on compliance. Finally, the intelligence products should have contextual capabilities. The ability to succeed against attacks depends on having the best available information, not only security logs. Such information should come from numerous sources, not only internals.
The Q&A session included several interesting questions, after the stimulating talk. The first one asked about the possible impediments to achieve the goals outlined in the talk. Coviello pointed out three potential roadblocks. First, the lack of awareness regarding the impact of a security situation by the top board of the organization. Top management should understand that security problems are the responsibility of the whole company, not just the IT department. Second, ignoring the requirement to follow a risk based approach when making security decisions and developing strategies. Third, is important that security programs grow as organizations increasingly rely on their IT systems.
A question was made regarding the asymmetric threat that security practitioners face and what can be done about it. Coviello pointed out the need to work around risk analysis in order to reduce the potential risks faced by organizations. It should be understood that the digital risk cannot be reduced any more than the physical risk. So organizations should get more sophisticated on the analytics, following a risk-based approach.
A member of the audience pointed out that several federal cybersecurity policies are based on the concept of defense in depth. Such concept is not driven by risks, which ultimately might raise costs to organizations required to comply with policies and regulations. Coviello agreed that if a risk-based approach is not followed, security programs might not achieve cost effectiveness. He also mentioned that defense in depth is sometimes misunderstood as it is not a layering mechanism to implement cybersecurity. It should encompass information sharing among organizations and even countries. He offered an example, calling for ISPs to play a more aggressive role and work with organizations to stop the threat from botnets.
A final question was made regarding the push by elected officials to use electronic voting, especially in small counties that might lack the resources to protect those systems. How to make elected officials understand the risk faced when using electronic voting, when such authorities usually do not have the capability to secure the voting system? Coviello sounded less than enthusiastic about electronic voting. But more importantly, he said there is a need to aggregate the security expertise and services so it can be outsourced to small and medium-sized organizations. The security industry should follow on the steps of the software and hardware industries, offering outsourcing services and products.

Purdue CERIAS Researchers Find Vulnerability in Google Protocol

[This is posted on behalf of the three students listed below. This is yet another example of bad results when speed takes precedence over doing things safely. Good work by the students! --spaf]
As a part of an INSuRE project at Purdue University, PhD Information Security student Robert Morton and seniors in Computer Science Austin Klasa and< Daniel Sokoler conducted an observational study on Google’s QUIC protocol (Quick UDP Internet Connections, pronounced quick). The team found that QUIC leaked the length of the password potentially allowing eavesdroppers to bypass authentication in popular services like Google Mail or G-mail. The team named the vulnerability Ring-Road and is currently trying to quantify the potential damage.
During the initial stages of the research, the Purdue team found that the Internet has been transformed over the last five years with a new suite of performance improving communication protocols such as SPDY, HTTP/2 and QUIC. These new protocols are being rapidly adopted to increase the speed and performance of applications on the Internet. More than 10% of the top 1 Million websites are already using some of these technologies, including many of the 10 highest traffic sites.
While these new protocols have improved speed, the Purdue team focused on determining if any major security issues arose from using QUIC. The team was astonished to find that Google's QUIC protocol leaks the exact length of sensitive information when transmitted over the Internet. This could allow an eavesdropper to learn the exact length of someone's password when signing into a website. In part, this negates the purpose of the underlying encryption, which is designed to keep data confidential -- including its length.
In practice, the Purdue team found QUIC leaks the exact length of passwords into commonly used services such as Google's E-mail or G-mail. The Purdue team than created a proof-of concept exploit to demonstrate the potential damage:
Step 1 - The team sniffed a target network to identify the password length from QUIC.
Step 2 - The team optimized a password dictionary to the identified password length.
Step 3 - The team automated an online attack to bypass authentication into G-mail.
The Purdue team believes the root cause of this problem came when Google decided to use a particular encryption method in QUIC: the Advanced Encryption Standard Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM). AES-GCM is a mode of encryption often adopted for its speed and performance. By default, AES-GCM cipher text is the same length as the original plaintext. For short communications such as passwords, exposing the length can be damaging when combined with other contextual clues to bypass authentication, and therein lies the problem.Conclusion
In summary, there seems to be an inherent trade-off between speed and security. As new protocols emerge on the Internet, these new technologies should be thoroughly tested for security vulnerabilities in a real-world environment. Google has been informed of this vulnerability and is currently working to identify a patch to protect their users. As Google works to create a fix, we recommend users and system administrators to disable QUIC in Chrome and their servers by visiting this link. We also recommend -- independent of this issue -- that users consider enabling two step verification with their G-mail accounts, for added protection, as described here. The Purdue team will be presenting their talk and proof-of-concept exploit against G-mail at the upcoming CERIAS Symposium on 18 April 2017.Additional Information

Time passes, and we lose friends

[Note: update added March 15]
2017 has gotten off to a bad start for the security community…and to me, personally.
First, we lost Kevin Ziese. I met Kevin over two decades ago, when he was involved in computer investigations with the Air Force. I got involved with a couple of investigations, as it was a new field and I had some connections with the Air Force at the time. Kevin later served as a UN Weapons Inspector in Iraq after the first Gulf War. He was at the Pentagon on 9/11. He served in our military with distinction. Later, he was involved with intrusion detection research, and became one of the principals in Wheelgroup, which was acquired by Cisco. He had a significant career in cyber, and made a number of seminal contributions to the field that most current practitioners have never heard about.
Kevin was very creative and an able investigator, but what I remember most about him was his incredible enthusiasm and sense of humor. In all our interactions, I can’t recall him being anything other than upbeat, and with great insight. I regularly crossed paths with him at IDS and computer crime workshops, and in activities for the Air Force. He was also generous with his time, and he found ways to visit Purdue several times to give talks to my students.
I hadn’t seen Kevin for a few years, and was vaguely planning on visiting him in the next year or so. We were overdue to catch up. We had been keeping in touch electronically, and his death was a huge — and sad — surprise to me.
Kevin introduced me, electronically, to Howard Schmidt in the early 1990s, after Howard joined AFOSI. We exchanged email and phone calls for several years until we spoke on a conference panel together and finally met in person. Early on, we discovered we were in sync on a number of things, and continued to enjoy our correspondence and occasional meetings through his time at Microsoft. When he moved to his position at the White House (the first time) in 2002, I visited several times to join in conversations on how to fix some of the cyber security problems of the country. One time, he hosted my family for a Saturday morning breakfast in the West Wing staff dining room, and was so very kind to my young daughter — answering her questions with tremendous patience. Thereafter, we continued to interact in his various roles, and on through his time at the Obama White House. Whenever I’d get to Washington, we’d get together for a conversation, and sometimes a beer.
Twice, Howard came to Purdue to speak in our annual CERIAS Security Symposium. Each time, he told me in confidence that he had decided to leave his position at the White House, and his visit to me each time had cemented his decision. (Thereafter, I got a note from someone who worked with Howard suggesting that I stop inviting critical personnel to speak at Purdue!)
I have so many stories about my times with Howard and they are all good. He was always supportive and positive, and he was always trying to find a way to make things better for others. He also never let his seniority and distinctions get in the way of helping others. For instance, I fondly recall when the EWF was starting its Women of Influence awards, and they asked Howard and me serve as judges for the first awards. However, to keep with the spirit of the awards (and the restriction on judges), we had to be declared as “honorary women.” Howard and I agreed, even when told that we might need to show up at the awards in skirts and heels as part of the process! We laughed about that in later years — that the reason the awards made it into subsequent years was because we weren’t asked to do that! (And we did view it as an honor.)
The last time I saw Howard was in late 2015, when we both appeared on a panel at a meeting at a government agency. For the last 2 years we kept up with occasional social media and email — sort of the reverse of how we met. Howard’s passing last month was untimely and a shock to any of us, especially so close to Kevin’s.
I attended Howard’s funeral and memorial service last Friday. It was important to many of us to see off an old friend. While there, I got to spend time with one of my oldest and dearest friends, Becky Bace, the “Den Mother of Cyber Security.” Becky was an old friend of Howard’s, too, having met him slightly before I did. (Becky was also a friend of Kevin.) I first met Becky in 1991, at one of the old (now defunct) National Security Conferences. We immediately hit it off, with discussion about mutual interests in security and crazy humor. Becky was the person who got me to move my primary research focus to security, and provided funding for my first security research project in intrusion detection. She involved me in the intrusion detection “guru” workshops she held, and introduced me to others in the field — Becky knew everybody, it seemed.
Over the course of the next 25+ years, Becky and I became good friends, and colleagues in a number of cybersec activities. We served on boards and panels together. We consulted for some of the same companies. She also made sure to introduce some of my students to people working in the field, both to help them enhance their research, and to get researchers to learn about some of the cutting-edge things we were doing in the university. We often called each other to share notes and occasionally gossip that we didn’t want to put in email. Becky regularly visited CERIAS to speak and mentor students. She was especially helpful in mentoring some of our women students and faculty. “Infomom” was bright, funny, and incredibly networked.
I have so many stories about Becky. There was never a time together where we didn’t laugh about something…many things…but also develop some new insight or connection that one of us could use. And every time we were together, we were spinning ideas for how I could find something new to do to break out of the rut I’m often in at the university, and for her to explore as a new career path: I wanted to do more in the commercial world, and she wanted to have an impact in the academic space.
Becky and I both were quite devastated by Howard’s passing, and the funeral was both a very sad time, and a chance to share more laughs with each other with stories about our times with Howard. Thus, it was all the more shock to learn, less than 4 days after I last saw her, that Becky had died suddenly.
In the space of six weeks, I have lost three friends and colleagues, each of whom I have known for over two decades, and one of whom was one of my closest friends. Time passes, and we all have finite time here. Nonetheless, it is always too soon for the people we care about. And it is too soon to lose the people who have spent so much time and effort trying to make the world better for the rest of us.
It is also sobering that these three were people my age. It reminds me that time is passing rather than some entity purposely making the stairs steeper for me each year.
It also reminds me of one of the reasons I have spent my career to date in higher education — it is one of the few vocations where there is some real hope of replacing ourselves, and doing so with better quality than what we are ourselves. But as much as we may try, we will not see any like Kevin, Howard, and Becky again. To paraphrase a mutual friend, if there is a heaven it is going to be much more secure and much more fun than it was before.
RIP, friends.

Another Surprise for Spaf

2016 has been a year of setbacks and challenges for me, including being ousted as executive director of CERIAS. Rather than dwell on those issues, I have tried to stay focused on the future and move forward. Thankfully, some good things have come along and the year is going to close out on several positive notes. My last blog post noted recounted being informed that I am to receive the 2017 IFIP Kristian Beckman Award as one such positive item.
Today was the announcement of another pleasant surprise — I have been named as a Sagamore of the Wabash. This is the most significant civilian award from the state of Indiana. The award is in recognition of three decades of leadership in cyber security, and service to organizations in the state, including my leadership at CERIAS, work with local companies, and support of government and law enforcement.
As noted in  the Purdue press release,I want to thank all the colleagues and students, past and present, who have worked with me over those many years. What we have accomplished only occurred because of our collective efforts; one individual can usually effect only a small amount of change. It is as a group that we have had a tremendous impact. It is gratifying to see their individual successes, too — some of my most gratifying experiences have been when former students tell me that what I helped them to learn was an important component of their success.
Some of my friends may be amused by an irony present in my now having two certificates on my office wall, one signed by George W. Bush and one by Mike Pence, but none from anyone in the Clinton or Obama administrations. (If you don’t understand that irony, move along.) However, irony is not new to me — I’ve repeatedly been recognized internationally for my research and leadership, but actually penalized by some at the university — including within my own department — for those same activities. I haven’t done any of what I do for recognition, though. My goal is to help ensure that the world is a better, safer place as a result of my actions. Even if no one notices, I will continue to do so. For years I had a sign above my desk with a quote by Mark Twain: Always do right. This will gratify some people and surprise the rest. I no longer have the sign, but I still live the words.
I also want to note (as I have several times recently) that as I get these “lifetime achievement” types of recognitions, I don’t want people to think that the problems are solved, or that I am planning on retiring. Far from it! The problem space has gotten larger and more complex, and the threats are more severe and imminent. I certainly am not bored with what I do, and I think I have some good experience and ideas to apply. I’m not sure what I’ll do next (or where) but, I don’t intend to step to the sidelines! Another of my favorite aphorisms was stated by Archimedes: Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the Earth. If I can find the resources (offers?) and the right place to work (suggestions?), I plan on continuing to move things a bit.
Best wishes to you all for a wonderful holiday season, and a great start to 2017!

It Was A Good Monday

Mondays. There are many reasons Monday have a bad reputation. Few of us would claim to like Mondays.
My Monday earlier this week got off to a poor start. I was traveling to attend a workshop (a good one, on ethics in cyber) and staying, yet again, at a hotel. As sometimes happen when I travel, I wasn’t sleeping well. I awoke shortly after 3am and couldn’t get back to sleep. Being the compulsive gadget user I am, I checked my email on my cellphone. There, I saw a new message posted from Europe that made my Monday quite a bit better. (Unfortunately, it didn’t help me get back to sleep.) Actually, as I write this on Wednesday, I’m still pretty happy, as well as better rested.
The email informed me that I am the 2017 IFIP TC-11 recipient of the Kristian Beckman Award. IFIP is the International Federation of Information Processing Societies, and the Beckman Award is one of the top recognitions in the field. Many of the previous recipients of this honor have been mentors and heroes of mine.
As noted on their WWW site, IFIP is recognized by the UN, and it represents IT societies from 56 countries/regions, covering five continents with a total membership of over half a million. TC-11 is the subgroup (technical committee) devoted to security and privacy protection in information processing systems.
The Kristian Beckman Award is presented annually, starting in 1993. According to the web site, "The objective of the award is to publicly recognize an individual, not a group or organisation, who has significantly contributed to the development of information security, especially achievements with an international perspective." The letter noted my achievements in research, education, and service; my creation and leadership of CERIAS; my guidance and mentorship of students developing security tools in widespread use; and my work as Academic Editor then Editor-in-Chief of Computers & Security, the oldest journal in the field of information security.
The award will be formally presented at 32nd International Conference on ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection (IFIP SEC 2017) in Rome, in May 2017. I will be presenting an invited plenary address as part of the award.
I am honored to be named as a recipient of this award. I have worked with IFIP TC-11 on various things over the last 25 years, including as a subcommittee chair (TC 11.4), as a member of several other groups, and serving as editor of Computers & Security, which is recognized as the official journal for TC-11. Along with ACM, ISSA, (ISC)2, IFIP is a significant force in research and education in cyber security.

I have been quite fortunate in my career. With the Beckman Award, I believe I have now been recognized with every major cyber security award, including the National Computer System Security Award; ISSA Hall of Fame; Harold F. Tipton Award; Cyber Security Hall of Fame; SANS Lifetime Achievement Award; Outstanding Contribution Award from ACM SIGSAC; the Joseph Wasserman Award from ISACA. I haven’t done all this on my own — I have been fortunate enough to work with some outstanding students, colleagues, and staff. I will always be grateful for their collegial support.
I would also like to note that many of these awards can be seen as "lifetime" awards. Although the administrators and some of my colleagues at Purdue think I’m no longer functional, I want to assure everyone else that I’m not done yet — I still have some ideas to pursue, possibly another book or two to write, and more students to teach and advise!
Now, if only I could get enough sleep on a regular basis…but I’m willing to wake up for news like this! And no, I still don’t particularly like Mondays.

Passing of a Cyber Securty Pioneer

Stephen T. Walker recently died. He was the founder of the pioneering Trusted Information Systems, a prime force behind the establishment of the NCSC (now the Commericial Solutions Center, but also the producer of the Rainbow Series), and he was the recipient of the first National Computer Security Systems Award  His obituary lists his many notable accomplishments and awards. Steve was a major influencer (and mentor) in the field of cyber security for decades.
I only recall meeting Steve once, and I am poorer for not having had more contact with him.
If you work in cyber security, you should read his obituary and ponder the contributions that have led to the current state of the field, and how little we have credited people like Steve with having had a lasting influence.

Gigamon Appoints Security Veteran Arthur W. Coviello Jr. to Board of DirectorsSANTA CLARA, Calif., April 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Gigamon Inc. (NYSE: GIMO), the industry leader in traffic visibility solutions, announced today that Arthur (Art) W. Coviello Jr. is joining its board of directors. Art brings over 30 years of security, financial and operational management experience. He is recognized for his many achievements including his two-decade career at RSA. As CEO of RSA and later as an EVP at EMC (which acquired RSA in 2006), he oversaw RSA's growth from $25 million in 1995 to $1 billion in 2014.  
"Art Coviello is one of the most recognized and influential pioneers who defined the cybersecurity industry," said Corey Mulloy, chairman of the Gigamon Board of Directors. "His deep understanding of the market and proven experience will play a critical role in driving the Company's  leadership as pervasive visibility transcends into core security, cloud and virtualized environments."
Coviello currently sits on the board of directors at EnerNOC, Inc., a provider of energy intelligence software and services, and Synchrony Financial. He also serves as a venture partner at Rally Ventures and plays key roles in national and international cybersecurity initiatives.
"Gigamon is on the cusp of transforming the security market as traditional security architectures cannot keep up with the increasing loads of traffic and network performance demands," said Art Coviello. "I'm excited about the company, its leadership team and innovative visibility platform that will become the  foundation of modern security and cloud infrastructures. The opportunity to build and grow Gigamon to its full potential is an adventure not to miss."
