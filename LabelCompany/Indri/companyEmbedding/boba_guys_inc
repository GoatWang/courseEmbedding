Our menu is ever-evolving, but everything we serve shares one common trait: it's all made with next-level quality ingredients.For our milk teas, we use only the finest ingredients: Straus Family Creamery organic milk accompanied with in house-brewed heirloom premium tea from the world's finest tea purveyors. Our syrup is housemade which means you'll see no signs of powders and artificial syrups. We also use Grade A balls (we just like saying that). Plus, our almond jelly and grass jelly are made from scratch, if you prefer jelly over balls.

Our Mission


WHAT WE STAND FOR







When we were building Boba Guys, we wrote three simple words down that forever anchored us in our business strategy: quality, passion, and transparency. Over time, it's evolved into three core values that every Boba Guy and Boba Gal stands for.  We Stand for QualityFood is our craft. Our drinks are deconstructed so we can use small batch methods when possible and the finest of ingredients. We strive for the best and work towards it every day. We are BallsyCall us crazy, but we believe in changing the way people see boba and tea. That starts with being transparent, above and beyond what you would expect from normal businesses. It also means we dare to try new things. You'll never know what will come from us next. We Give a DamnWe source responsibly, pride ourselves on customer service, and care about what you think. We give 100% in everything we do: whether it's making a cup of tea, sweeping the floors, or milking a cow.

Pure Milk Tea













































Why Pure Milk Tea?We’re former “startup guys” ourselves and we’ve been dogfooding this product and refining it for the past 6 months. Here’s how a typical day at work goes for us.You wake up in the morning and you either down a cup of coffee from a gurgling coffee machine (or if you’re lucky, they have third wave coffee at the office). That’s around 120mg of caffeine. You’re set.But maybe you decided to go big at lunch and now that rotisserie chicken has you feeling a little sleepy. You start to yawn around 2pm. You’re pushing commits a lot less often. You’re blinking at odd intervals. Midday doldrums. You need caffeine! But here’s the thing, another 120mg of caffeine is too much! You’ll crash and it’ll be even worse. That’s where Pure Milk Tea™ comes in.Pure Milk Tea™ is made with high quality loose leaf tea, Straus Organic Milk and our own homemade syrup. No powders, no preservatives. Brewed fresh right here in San Francisco. It’s 45mg of caffeine, just enough to keep you going and focused, and is delicious to boot.







I want it For my office. How do I get it?Fill this form out and we'll get in touch!

Would a Trump Self-Pardon Precipitate a Constitutional Crisis?



Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf argues that if President Trump were to pardon himself, that action itself would not cause a constitutional crisis, but other actions Trump has already taken have already placed us far along a road to a constitutional crisis.

Would a Trump Self-Pardon Precipitate a Constitutional Crisis?



Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf argues that if President Trump were to pardon himself, that action itself would not cause a constitutional crisis, but other actions Trump has already taken have already placed us far along a road to a constitutional crisis.

The Boba Guys’ Jasmine Milk Tea with Honey Boba

         By John Birdsall | Published on Saturday, February 9, 2013
 / Edit Post





















San Francisco’s Boba Guys made us this wonderfully aromatic milk tea (with Hong Kong toast) as a Chinese New Year treat. Read the full story here.
JASMINE MILK TEA WITH HONEY BOBABy Andrew Chau and Bin Chen, The Boba Guys
Difficulty: Easy | Time: 1 hour 15 minutes |  Makes: 4 servings
Taiwanese-style bubble milk tea gets a remake with good milk and flowery jasmine tea. Use the best-quality boba (tapioca pearls) you can find. Cook the raw boba in plenty of water for 35 minutes at a rolling boil, then turn off the flame and let the boba sit in the water for another 20 minutes.
INGREDIENTS •  5 cups filtered water • 2 tablespoons loose-leaf jasmine tea  • 1/2 cup white sugar  • 1/2 cup light brown sugar  • 1 cup cooked boba (see boiling instructions above)  • 4 tablespoons honey • 1 cup half-and-half (preferably organic, from grass-fed cows)
INSTRUCTIONS 1. Make the tea: Bring 4 cups of the water to a boil, let it sit for 1 minute (the temperature should be 170 degrees Fahrenheit), then add the tea leaves and steep for 8 minutes. Strain.
2. Make the simple syrup: Combine the remaining cup of water and the white and brown sugar in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer a few minutes, till the sugars are dissolved.
3. Steep the boba: In a small bowl, combine the cooked boba, 1/2 cup of the simple syrup, and the honey. Soak at least 30 minutes, and up to 3 hours.
4. Assemble the drink: To a cocktail shaker, add 4 cups of tea, 1 cup of simple syrup, the half-and-half, the honey-soaked boba, and a small handful of ice cubes. Shake till mixed, and pour into a serving glass with a wide straw.

Milk Tea — Tea People

Milk Tea
How To Make Milk Tea(The Boba Guys way)




Many claim that adding milk to a premium tea would be a disgrace, but we’re here to show you how milk can elevate your regular brew. Here at Tea People, we got our start making Taiwanese boba milk tea at Boba Guys. After endless experimenting, we figured out how to craft the perfect cup of milk tea; equally sweet, creamy and rich in tea flavor. Check out our video on how to make a classic cup of milk tea featuring Benj, our resident tea geek, and our hand-blended Boba Guys Blend No. 1.







Milk plays especially well with our Boba Guys Blend No. 1 because it's three different types of black teas blended together. The milk may change the mouth feel of your sip, making it more decadent but the black tea flavor is still able to shine through.Think of black tea like coffee; some people take it straight up, bold n' black, but everyone loves a good latte! At Boba Guys, we found some other great teas that play equally as well with milk too, like our jasmine and Indian chai!

We grew up drinking milk tea and to this day are still obsessed about it. We started Boba Guys as a way to share the milk tea we remember from our childhood (only this time with fresh ingredients; none of the powdered stuff).We use only the finest ingredients: Straus Family Creamery organic milk accompanied with homebrewed heirloom organic tea from Five Mountains. Our syrup and almond jelly is homemade and we use Grade A balls. (We just like saying that. )
