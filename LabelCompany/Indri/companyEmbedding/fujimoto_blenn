Enterprise Value is a firm valuation proxy that approximates current market value of a company. It is typically used to determine takeover or merger price of a firm. Unlike Market Cap, this measure takes into account the entire liquid asset, outstanding debt, and exotic equity instruments that company has on its balance sheet. When takeover occurs, the parent company will have to assume the target company's liabilities but will take possession of all cash and cash equivalents.More...PeersCentral Pacific Related Equities
