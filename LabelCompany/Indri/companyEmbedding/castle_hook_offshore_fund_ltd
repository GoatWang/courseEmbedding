Castle Harlan And Other Equity Owners Of Shelf Drilling, Ltd. Support $225 Million Purchase Of Three Premium Jackup Rigs









PR Newswire




Jul 11, 2017 8:00 AM EDT













 




























































  NEW YORK, July 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Castle Harlan, the New York private equity investment firm, said it and its equity partners, CHAMP Private Equity and Lime Rock Partners, supported Shelf Drilling, Ltd. in purchasing three premium jackup rigs located in the Middle East. The acquisition of the rigs is a continuation of Shelf Drilling's fit-for-purpose strategy of solely focusing on shallow water drilling, and further expands Shelf Drilling's leading market presence in one of its key operating regions.  Shelf Drilling is a leading international shallow-water offshore drilling contractor engaged in the provision of equipment and services for the drilling, completion and workover of offshore oil and natural gas wells. Shelf Drilling completed the purchase and delivery in May of two of the three rigs - the West Resolute and the West Triton. The rigs have been renamed Shelf Drilling Resourceful and Shelf Drilling Tenacious, respectively. The third jackup rig - the West Mischief - is expected to be delivered to the Company during Q3 2017 upon completion of its current contract.  Following the purchase and delivery of all three rigs, Shelf Drilling's fleet will increase from 37 to 40 rigs. Shelf Drilling financed the purchase through a US$225 million equity issuance listed on the Norwegian OTC list, and began trading under the ticker "SHLF" as of May 5, 2017. "We are continuing to enhance the value of the company and its offerings to customers, and we will add rigs to Shelf Drilling's fleet when the price is attractive. These three rigs are especially suitable because they have a strong operating track record in the region and can reach deep into the sea floor where significant oil and gas deposits are found," said David Pittaway, Senior Managing Director of Castle Harlan.

Concerns over safety of 2.25pc 'savings bond'

Best-buy bonds offered by Castle Trust pay much more than rivals – but is your 
  capital protected? 














Castle Trust's Fortress bond is claimed to have protection from the FSCS Photo: Getty

 Savers are being warned that best-buy fixed-term bonds that pay much better rates than their nearest rivals may not be all that they seem.  The bonds are offered by Castle Trust and pay 2.25pc for a one-year term and 2.75pc if you tie your money up for two years. These rates are much higher than the best available elsewhere – 2pc over one year and 2.35pc over two, from Punjab National Bank and Investec respectively.  But although Castle Trust describes its products as "fixed-rate bonds" in its advertising, they are actually very different from what most savers understand by the term – and carry much less protection from the official compensation scheme if things go wrong.  In fact, some experts question whether savers would be compensated at all if Castle Trust were to go bust, despite the company's claim that the bonds, which are called "Fortress Bonds", are covered by the statutory safety net.  What is different about the Castle Trust bonds?

 Castle Trust is not a bank and the Fortress bonds are not deposits. This means that they do not qualify for the normal £85,000 protection offered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), the state-backed safety net.  Instead, by buying its bonds you are lending money to Castle Trust to help it fund its business. Normally, this type of bond is regarded as an investment and as a result your money is at risk and there is no recourse to the FSCS.  However, Castle Trust has adopted a refinement to this means of borrowing money that, it claims, does confer FSCS cover. Specifically, the company has devised a complicated two-tier structure that involves an in-house "fund manager". It is this subsidiary that is selling bonds to the public – and this type of company, Castle Trust says, does qualify for FSCS protection, although at the reduced level of £50,000 applicable to investments as opposed to deposits.  So if Castle Trust itself goes bust, it cannot repay the fund management business, which is therefore unable to repay investors. The fund management business is then in default and savers will be able to claim redress from the FSCS, Castle Trust said.  Why should savers be wary?  There are two potential problems. First, savers must remember that the normal £85,000 FSCS limit for savings bonds does not apply and the most they will get back in the event of default is £50,000.  Second, several bond experts in the City of London cast doubt on whether the FSCS would pay out at all.  "This is blatantly a violation of the intention behind the FSCS – and it won't work," said one. "In my opinion if the company goes bust the FSCS won't pay out."  The FSCS said claims were dealt with on a case-by-case basis and the outcome would depend on the specific terms and conditions of the product.  What does Castle Trust say?  The company said it had sought legal advice that its bonds did qualify for FSCS protection. Sean Oldfield, the head of Castle Trust, said: "We appreciate that the structure of our fixed-rate bonds is different to the conventional savings products offered by deposit takers such as banks and building societies. That said, each customer has £50,000 of protection from the FSCS.  "When our products reach maturity we will pay back the original principal invested plus the fixed-rate return in exactly the same way a conventional savings product would have done."  richard.evans@telegraph.co.uk   • Investment tips every week by email – sign up here   • For more investment news and ideas, bookmark telegraph.co.uk/investing or like us at facebook.com/telegraphinvesting
