Kingsway Announces Acquisition of HVAC Warranty Business

May 22, 2013, 20:05 ET
		  		  							
						 from   Kingsway Financial Services Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 



TORONTO, May 22, 2013 /PRNewswire/ - (TSX: KFS, NYSE:   KFS) Kingsway Financial Services Inc. ("Kingsway" or
 the "Company") and its subsidiary, 1347 Capital LLC, announced today
 that the Company has finalized the purchase of certain tangible and
 intangible assets of Trinity Warranty Corporation ("Trinity"). Trinity,
 based in Lombard, Illinois, is a provider of warranty products and
 maintenance support to consumers and businesses in the heating,
 ventilation, air conditioning ("HVAC") and refrigeration industry.  The
 tangible and intangible assets of Trinity are being acquired for total
 consideration consisting of cash and future contingent payments.
 Kingsway expects the business to be accretive to cash flows.


"We believe Trinity has a compelling value proposition in serving HVAC
 manufacturers, distributors and consumers in its role as a third-party
 administrator of warranty products, and we are excited that it is
 joining the Kingsway family," said Larry G. Swets, Jr., Kingsway's
 President and Chief Executive Officer.


About the Company


Kingsway is a holding company functioning as a merchant bank with a
 focus on long-term value-creation.  The Company owns or controls stakes
 in several insurance industry assets and utilizes its subsidiaries,
 1347 Advisors LLC and 1347 Capital LLC, to pursue opportunities acting
 as an advisor, an investor and a financier. The common shares of
 Kingsway are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York
 Stock Exchange under the trading symbol "KFS."

 meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of
 the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are not historical facts, and

 differ materially from those expected and projected. Words such as
 "expects", "believes", "anticipates", "intends", "estimates", "seeks"
 and variations and similar words and expressions are intended to

 statements relate to future events or future performance, but reflect
 Kingsway management's current beliefs, based on information currently

 limitation, our potential inability to complete current or future
 acquisitions successfully, our inability to successfully implement our
 restructuring activities, and our inability to adequately estimate and
 provide for an appropriate level of reserving at our insurance company
 subsidiaries. For information identifying important factors that could
 cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the
 forward looking statements, please refer to the section entitled "Risk
 Factors" in the Company's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K and its

 Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company
 disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward
 looking statements whether as a result of new information, future
 events or otherwise.

1347 Capital Corp. Stockholders Approve Its Business Combination With Limbach Holdings, LLC; Company Expects To Close Transaction On July 20, 2016






Business Wire




Jul 19, 2016 4:01 PM EDT













 




























































  1347 Capital Corp. (OTCQB:TFSCU, TFSC, TFSCW, TFSCR) ("1347 Capital" or the "Company") today announced that at today's special meeting in lieu of annual meeting of stockholders, the Company's stockholders approved the previously announced business combination (the "Business Combination") between the Company and Limbach Holdings, LLC. The Business Combination is expected to close on July 20, 2016.  In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company's name will change to "Limbach Holdings, Inc." and its common stock and warrants are expected to continue to be quoted on the OTCQB under the symbols "LMB" and "LMBW," respectively.   Forward-Looking Statements   This press release includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected and projected. Words such as "expects," "believes," "anticipates," "intends," "estimates," "seeks" and variations and similar words and expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations that are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual events, performance or results to differ materially from the events, performance and results discussed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement; (2) the outcome of any legal proceedings that have been, and any other legal proceedings that may be, instituted against 1347 Capital, Limbach or others following announcement of the Merger Agreement and transactions contemplated therein, including the lawsuit filed against the Company on May 10, 2016 by Robert Garfield on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated public holders of 1347 Capital's common stock (as described in the Prospectus); (3) the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement due to the failure to satisfy the conditions to closing in the Merger Agreement; (4) delays in obtaining, adverse conditions contained in, or the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or complete regulatory reviews required to complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (5) the risk that the proposed transaction disrupts current plans and operations as a result of the announcement and consummation of the transactions described herein; (6) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with suppliers and obtain adequate supply of products and retain its key employees; (7) costs related to the proposed business combination; (8) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (9) the possibility that Limbach may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and (10) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the proxy statement/prospectus/information statement relating to the proposed business combination, including those under "Risk Factors" therein, and other filings with the SEC by 1347 Capital. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and the Company and Limbach undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
