Investment Insights Video: Responding to Rising Interest Rates

Posted on July 25, 2013  by  brinkercapital 

Reply 


In May, Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, announced the possibility that they will begin tapering in the upcoming months. As that notion looms, so too does the prospective of rising interest rates.
We sat down with Bill Miller, Chief Investment Officer, and Jeff Raupp, Senior Portfolio Manager to discuss how Brinker is prepared to respond to the upcoming policy changes.  In this installment of Investment Insights, Bill and Jeff will give financial advisors and investors a clearer understanding of the tools available to Brinker Capital and how our portfolios can manage the impending environment of rising interest rates.
 






Products and Solutions are Not Interchangeable Terms

Posted on November 14, 2012  by  brinkercapital

In an attempt to appear as holistic financial service providers, many advisors have stopped using the word product.   Solutions is the new phrase darling.
Now a retirement solutions cloak drapes annuity sales. Income protection solutions describe disability insurance.  It all sounds remarkably client-centric and needs based oriented, but often the advisor is simply recommending a product that fulfills a niche need.
The term product has gotten a bad rap because theoretically:


Clients live happily ever after with solutions providers but have limited expectations of product salespeople.  They consider a product sales person as one-dimensional professional who meets a need then moves on to the next client.



Products are implicit commission generating vehicles, whereas solutions are holistic and in the client’s best interest.



The products have not changed.  The sales, servicing and payment to the advisor have not changed.  The only difference in many cases is that whenever the client is in earshot, products are referred to as solutions.
The approach might work when writing brochure copy, but it leaves gaping holes in a client’s quest to achieve financial goals.
Product and solution are not interchangeable terms.  A product may solve a problem, or it may be just one component to a solution.  More often than not, a solution involves more than one product and includes other services or features.
Brinker Capital’s income solutions, for example, go well beyond product.  Both our Crystal Diversified Income Strategy and our Destinations Balanced Income Strategy have income distribution features.
We also offer customized income distribution services.  We deliver “paychecks” to clients for a specified period, while managing reserves to cover their long-term capital growth needs.  We also generate reports that include a spending analysis and notify clients if their portfolios are in jeopardy of falling short of stated goals.
You can only offer solutions when you analyze client needs holistically and extend your offering to include products, services and technology that address the problem on all levels.
Our Destinations, Crystal Suite, Personal Portfolios and Core Asset Manager products all solve specific client needs.  On the other hand, our Personal Distribution Strategy, Dollar Value Averaging, and Asset Class Strategies are holistic solutions that combine product, services and technologies that address client problems on all levels.





Staying Ahead of the Curve Despite Recent Volatility

Posted on June 4, 2012  by  brinkercapital 

Reply 


After a strong surge in global financial markets in the first quarter of 2012, risk assets – equities, commodities, corporate credit – have sold off thus far in the second quarter. Uncertainties over global growth and Europe have reentered markets. At Brinker Capital, we are not surprised that some of the euphoria is being worked off. We would not be surprised to see further consolidation.
Several of our fundamental and technical indicators were showing signs of concern earlier this spring. At the end of the first quarter, the various Brinker discretionary portfolios reduced exposure to risk assets. Future signposts suggest the volatility could continue.
For those of you who follow our market outlook and quarterly portfolio calls, this might be familiar material. Some of the indicators we monitor were flashing warning signals:

Event risk – European elections, particularly in France and Greece, along with stalling reform initiatives in Spain and Italy.
Market fundamentals – economic indicators such as consumer and CEO confidence and economic surprises appeared to be peaking. The S&P 500 appeared to have discounted a lot of good news in valuations.
Sentiment – though investors maintained bullish sentiment (low levels of short interest), corporate insiders were selling stock in 2012, a change from insider purchases seen last fall.

As a result, we reduced risk exposures across our various discretionary portfolios.

Destinations and Personal Portfolios reduced exposure to risk assets and were positioned underweight risk compared to a neutral positioning.
Crystal Strategy I reduced its portfolio beta from positive to now a modestly negative beta by reducing risk and adding inverse exposures designed to rise in falling markets.

We will continue to monitor the following signposts over the near term and actively manage our broadly diversified portfolios as appropriate.

U.S. – Fed meetings later in June and prospects for further Quantitative Easing. Later this summer, we need progress on addressing the massive fiscal cliff to be reached early in 2013, regardless of the outcome in November elections.
Europe – second round of Greek elections on June 17 and progress (or absence thereof) regarding further European integration (bank deposit guarantee, adding capital to weak banks, stabilization in bond yields).
China – further, but moderate, monetary and fiscal stimulus, enough to avert a hard landing, but not enough to bail out weak global growth or produce sizzling China growth. The government is happy to see cooling in property markets.

Brinker Capital Launches its First Destinations Collective Investment 
      Trust in Partnership with The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America®




New Solution Builds upon Brinker Capital’s 10 years as a Retirement 
      Plan Service provider, and over 20 years as the provider of 
      Destinations’ disciplined investment process






February 17, 2016 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



BERWYN, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Brinker Capital, a leading investment management firm, today announced 
      the launch of its new Destinations Collective Investment Trust (CIT) 
      solution in partnership with The Guardian Insurance & Annuity Company, 
      Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Guardian Life Insurance Company 
      of America® (Guardian). Through this partnership, Brinker 
      Capital expands its distribution and offers retirement advisors enhanced 
      investment strategies that include a blend of mutual funds and exchange 
      traded funds (ETFs).
    


      Building on the company’s 20 years of success within Destinations, a 
      comprehensive investment management program, Brinker Capital’s 
      Destinations CIT is a collective investment trust solution featuring 
      five professionally managed risk-based portfolios, offering investment 
      strategies ranging from conservative to aggressive, that blend of mutual 
      funds and ETFs. Each portfolio utilizes a multi-asset class approach and 
      targets a specific investment objective.
    

      “For 20 years, diversification, innovation, and active management served 
      as the basis for our investment products, and the new CIT allows us to 
      bring our proven investment products to qualified retirement plans 
      through a large and prestigious partner such as Guardian,” said Roddy 
      Marino, EVP of National Accounts and Distribution at Brinker Capital. 
      “This partnership is particularly special because it launches during 
      another important milestone for Brinker Capital—our 10-year anniversary 
      of Retirement Plan Services.”
    

      Brinker Capital’s Destinations CIT will be available through two 
      Guardian retirement plans: The Guardian Choice® and The 
      Guardian Advantage®. In addition, Guardian will offer Brinker 
      Capital’s Destinations ETFh as part of its Guardian Edge retirement plan.
    

      “Guardian is committed to helping our clients reach their long-term 
      financial goals by offering a variety of investment options to address 
      their diverse needs,” said Douglas Dubitsky, Vice President at Guardian 
      Retirement Solutions™. “This new offering represents each 
      organization’s strong commitment to provide multiple managed account 
      QDIA options to the small plan market space and help participants reach 
      their long-term investment goals.”
    

      Brinker Capital Destinations CIT offers five professionally managed 
      risk-based model portfolios that serve as Qualified Default Investment 
      Alternative, (QDIA) options:

Start Preamble
        
        
        
        February 14, 2017.
        
          AGENCY:
Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”).
ACTION:
Notice of an application for an order under section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Act”) for an exemption from sections 12(d)(1)(A), (B), and (C) of the Act and under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act for an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and (2) of the Act. The requested order would permit certain registered open-end investment companies to acquire shares of certain registered open-end investment companies, registered closed-end investment companies, business development companies, as defined in section 2(a)(48) of the Act, and unit investment trusts (collectively, “Underlying Funds”) that are within and outside the same group of investment companies as the acquiring investment companies, in excess of the limits in section 12(d)(1) of the Act.
Applicants:
Brinker Capital Destinations Trust, a Delaware statutory trust that is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company with multiple series, and Brinker Capital, Inc., a Delaware Corporation registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
DATES:

Filing Dates: The application was filed on December 8, 2016 and amended on February 1, 2017.
Hearing or Notification of Hearing:
An order granting the requested relief will be issued unless the Commission orders a hearing. Interested persons may request a hearing by writing to the Commission's Secretary and serving applicants with a copy of the request, personally or by mail. Hearing requests should be received by the Commission by 5:30 p.m. on March 14, 2017 and should be accompanied by proof of service on the applicants, in the form of an affidavit, or, for lawyers, a certificate of service. Pursuant to Rule 0-5 under the Act, hearing requests should state the nature of the writer's interest, any facts bearing upon the desirability of a hearing on the matter, the reason for the request, and the issues contested. Persons who wish to be notified of a hearing may request notification by writing to the Commission's Secretary.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or for an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm, or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Summary of the Application
1. Applicants request an order to permit (a) a Fund [1] 
           (each a “Fund of Funds”) to acquire shares of Underlying Funds [2] 
           in excess of the limits in sections 12(d)(1)(A) and (C) of the Act and (b) the Underlying Funds that are registered open-end investment companies or series thereof, their principal underwriters and any broker or dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to sell shares of the Underlying Fund to the Fund of Funds in excess of the limits in section 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act.[3] 

           Applicants also request an order of exemption under Start Printed Page 11252sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act from the prohibition on certain affiliated transactions in section 17(a) of the Act to the extent necessary to permit the Underlying Funds to sell their shares to, and redeem their shares from, the Funds of Funds.[4] 
           Applicants state that such transactions will be consistent with the policies of each Fund of Funds and each Underlying Fund and with the general purposes of the Act and will be based on the net asset values of the Underlying Funds.
2. Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the terms and conditions stated in the application. Such terms and conditions are designed to, among other things, help prevent any potential (i) undue influence over an Underlying Fund that is not in the same “group of investment companies” as the Fund of Funds through control or voting power, or in connection with certain services, transactions, and underwritings, (ii) excessive layering of fees, and (iii) overly complex fund structures, which are the concerns underlying the limits in sections 12(d)(1)(A), (B), and (C) of the Act.
3. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions, from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if the exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to grant an order permitting a transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) if it finds that (a) the terms of the proposed transaction are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment company involved; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Section 6(c) of the Act permits the Commission to exempt any persons or transactions from any provision of the Act if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

Footnotes

1.
     Applicants request that the order apply to each existing and future series of Brinker Capital Destinations Trust and to each existing and future registered open-end investment company or series thereof that is advised by Brinker Capital, Inc. or its successor or by any other investment adviser controlling, controlled by or under common control with Brinker Capital, Inc. or its successor and is part of the same “group of investment companies” as Brinker Capital Destinations Trust (each, a “Fund”). For purposes of the requested order, “successor” is limited to an entity that results from a reorganization into another jurisdiction or a change in the type of business organization. For purposes of the request for relief, the term “group of investment companies” means any two or more registered investment companies, including closed-end investment companies and business development companies, that hold themselves out to investors as related companies for purposes of investment and investor services.

        Back to Citation
      


2.
     Certain of the Underlying Funds have obtained exemptions from the Commission necessary to permit their shares to be listed and traded on a national securities exchange at negotiated prices and, accordingly, to operate as an exchange-traded fund (“ETF”).

        Back to Citation
      


3.
     Applicants do not request relief for Funds of Funds to invest in reliance on the order in business development companies and registered closed-end investment companies that are not listed and traded on a national securities exchange.

        Back to Citation
      


4.
     A Fund of Funds generally would purchase and sell shares of an Underlying Fund that operates as an ETF through secondary market transactions rather than through principal transactions with the Underlying Fund. Applicants nevertheless request relief from section 17(a) to permit a Fund of Funds to purchase or redeem shares from the ETF. A Fund of Funds will purchase and sell shares of an Underlying Fund that is a closed-end fund through secondary market transactions at market prices rather than through principal transactions with the closed-end fund. Accordingly, applicants are not requesting section 17(a) relief with respect to transactions in shares of closed-end funds (including business development companies).
