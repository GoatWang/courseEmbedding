InvestmentPhilosophy




Black Diamond was founded in 1995 with a bedrock investment philosophy that has remained consistent over the past 20 years and continues to guide the firm today. The philosophy encompasses the following key principles:
Focus on Areas of Expertise – Black Diamond’s management team and investment professionals have decades of experience in the credit, distressed debt and private equity markets and have particular expertise in underwriting, trading, restructuring and managing controlled distressed investments. The company applies its superior intellectual capital, investment experience and restructuring know-how to inform its focused approach to carefully selected debt securities that offer both structural protection and substantial underlying assets. This focused approach to investing emphasizes Black Diamond’s competitive advantages and enables it to provide superior returns to its investors, which at the end of the day is the firm’s primary focus.
Managing Risk – Black Diamond maintains a rigorously disciplined credit analysis process which is designed to protect its investments from excessive downside risk. The company reinforces this process by informing its bottoms up credit analysis approach to investing with extensive macro credit market analysis, ensuring that it can navigate the risks associated not only with its individual investments, but also the broader market.
Seizing Opportunity – Black Diamond believes that many of the best investment opportunities arise from volatility in the market and in individual companies (stressed and distressed situations). With this in mind, Black Diamond maintains a discipline when it comes to the deployment of capital, but it is tenacious when an appealing investment has been identified.
Alignment of Interests – Black Diamond is dedicated to providing superior returns and a client experience that treats its investors as true partners. In doing so, Black Diamond believes that it is only successful if its interests are fully aligned with the interests of its various investors. As such, a single-minded focus on the investor underpins every investment decision the company makes.

Reichold and Polynt complete merger


May 19, 2017
By Iris Dorbian






Reichold and Polynt have closed their previously announced merger. The newly combined company will focus on being a specialty chemicals provider with a significant presence in North America, Europe and Asia. Black Diamond Capital Management and Investindustrial are backers in this new company.
PRESS RELEASE
GREENWICH, Conn., May 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Reichhold and Polynt are pleased to announce the closing of the combination announced last year, after having received all regulatory approvals. The new Polynt-Reichhold (or “the Group”) is a global company in the Intermediates, Coating and Composite Resins, Thermoset Compounds, Gel-coats and niche Specialties with more than €2 billion in revenues. Black Diamond Capital Management, L.L.C. (“Black Diamond”) and Investindustrial are equal investors in the new Group.
This combination enhances the Group’s leading position as a global, vertically-integrated specialty chemicals player, with significant presence in North America, Europe, and Asia, based on Reichhold’s global scale, extensive product portfolio and R&D competencies, now further reinforced by Polynt with the successful integration of PCCR and CCP in the last five years. The Group’s excellence in serving customers around the world will be further strengthened by the merger of best-in-class innovation and a customer oriented approach.
Black Diamond’s Managing Principal, Stephen H. Deckoff, commented on the transaction: “We are pleased with the final outcome of this combination as it brings together two leading specialty chemical businesses with global footprints. The combination provides the opportunity to capitalize on increased scale, complementary manufacturing and product development capabilities and significant synergies to compete successfully in the marketplace going forward.” 





“We intend to quickly align the cultures within the combination to support our global leadership position, better serve our customers and create value for our shareholders,” added Rosario Valido, President and CEO of the new Group. “With 44 plants across the world the Company will be the closest to the local needs of its customers and the just-in-time suppliers of specialty chemicals in the geographies in which they have operations. Our aim is to grow our business together with our customers and to drive the quality of our products toward the highest expectations of the industry.”

The LaPlace operations are primarily located outside of New Orleans with an additional rolling mill in Harriman, TN and three strategically located stocking depots in Tulsa, OK, Chicago, IL and Pittsburgh, PA.  The LaPlace and Harriman facilities are leading producers of light structural shapes and merchant bar quality products.  The Vinton facility, located near El Paso, TX, is a leading producer of rebar for the construction industry and grinding media for the mining industry.

"These facilities operated as a part of independent companies in the past and we look forward to coupling that entrepreneurial background with Black Diamond's prior experience to expand the customer and product base."
The acquisition is expected to close in early April. Jones Walker has served as legal counsel to Black Diamond in connection with this acquisition. Calibre Group provided advisory services in connection with a broad range of union related matters.
