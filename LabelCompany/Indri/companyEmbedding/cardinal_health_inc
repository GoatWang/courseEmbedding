Cardinal Health to Acquire Leading Patient Product Portfolio from Medtronic for $6.1 Billion


Apr 18, 2017

Download this Press Release ()

- Increases Cardinal Health's product breadth in consumable medical products- Creates additional geographic scale and scope and expands existing channel reach into the operating room and long-term care

DUBLIN, Ohio, April 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Medtronic's Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses for $6.1 billion in cash. The purchase price does not include cash tax benefits of at least $100 million. The acquisition is expected to be financed with a combination of $4.5 billion in new senior unsecured notes and existing cash. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of Cardinal Health's fiscal year 2018, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory clearances.  
The Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses encompass 23 product categories across multiple market settings, including numerous industry-leading brands, such as Curity, Kendall, Dover, Argyle and Kangaroo, which are used in nearly every U.S. hospital.  Total revenues for the businesses were $2.3 billion for the 12 months ending October 2016 with more than 70 percent of total sales in the U.S. 
Cardinal Health expects the acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP1 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by more than $0.21 per share in fiscal 2018, which includes approximately $100 million of inventory step-up costs during the first few quarters following closing. This is net of estimated incremental annual financing-related interest expense of up to $0.39, subject to change based on the company's ultimate bond pricing and tax rate. The company expects the acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by more than $0.55 per share in fiscal 2019, and increasingly accretive thereafter. By the end of fiscal 2020, the company assumes synergies will exceed $150 million annually. 
"We are thrilled about today's announcement, as this well-established product line is complementary to our medical consumables business and fits naturally into our customer offering. For this reason, this product portfolio has been on our radar for many years," said George S. Barrett, Cardinal Health chairman and CEO. "We distribute some of these products today and have been collaborative partners with the leadership of this business. Given the current trends in healthcare, including aging demographics and a focus on post-acute care, this industry-leading portfolio will help us further expand our scope in the operating room, in long-term care facilities and in home healthcare, reaching customers across the entire continuum of care.
"We're also looking forward to welcoming the more than 10,000 employees across these businesses who share our dedication to serving customers and their patients by providing high-quality products and services."  
Once the transaction is complete, the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses will become part of Cardinal Health's Medical segment, which is led by Don Casey, the segment's chief executive officer.
"Not only is this portfolio complementary to our existing suite of products, it enables us to build further scale on our established global platforms," said Casey. "We are familiar with the talented team who will be joining us and have worked closely with many of them in the past. We believe this will help us execute an efficient and seamless integration after the transaction closes. These leading products perfectly complement Cardinal Health's position in a value-based world, bringing additional reach and breadth that build on our existing strengths."   
Cardinal Health plans to issue long-term debt to finance the transaction and has obtained a commitment letter from Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC to provide a $4.5 billion unsecured bridge loan.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Perella Weinberg Partners LP served as Cardinal Health's financial advisors on this transaction, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Jones Day served as its legal advisors.
For more information on the acquisition, visit the Investor Relations page at ir.cardinalhealth.com. 




Conference Call
Please also reference an additional release issued today by Cardinal Health entitled, "Cardinal Health updates fiscal 2017 guidance; provides early outlook for future fiscal years."
Cardinal Health will host a webcast and a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern to discuss both of today's announcements. To access the call and corresponding slide presentation, go to the Investor Relations page at ir.cardinalhealth.com. The call also can be accessed by dialing 913-312-1502, passcode #2495375. There is no pre-registration for the call; however, participants are advised to dial into the call at least 10 minutes prior to the start time.
Presentation slides and an audio replay will be archived on the website after the conclusion of the meeting. The audio replay will be available until Tuesday, April 25 at 12 p.m. Eastern at 719-457-0820, passcode #2495375.
Non-GAAP financial measures (including footnote)
Footnote (1) Expected accretion to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects: (A) earnings from continuing operations, excluding (1) LIFO charges/(credits), (2) restructuring and employee severance, (3) amortization and acquisition-related costs, (4) impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets, (5) litigation (recoveries)/charges, net, and (6) loss on extinguishment of debt, each net of tax, (B) divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 
Cardinal Health presents non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations on a forward-looking basis. The most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. Cardinal Health is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measure, because Cardinal Health cannot reliably forecast LIFO charges/(credits), restructuring and employee severance, amortization and acquisition-related costs (which Cardinal Health expects to increase significantly as a result of the acquisition of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses), impairments and (gain)/loss on disposal of assets and litigation (recoveries)/charges, net, which are difficult to predict and estimate. Please note that the unavailable reconciling items could significantly impact Cardinal Health's future financial results. These items could cause earnings per share and the accretion to earnings per share to differ materially from the company's non-GAAP expectations.  
About Cardinal Health

History[edit]
Founded in 1971 as Cardinal Foods by Robert D. Walter, the company was initially a food wholesaler. After acquiring the Bailey Drug Company in 1979, it began wholesaling drugs as Cardinal Distribution, Incorporated. The company went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1983 and subsequently began a long string of acquisitions and mergers. In 1988, Walter sold Cardinal Health's food operations to Roundy's.[7] From 1991 to 1996, the company’s sales grew from $1.2 billion to $8.9 billion.[8] In a case study for Harvard Business Review, Mary Teagarden describes Cardinal Health in this period as "one of a handful of large U.S. companies that had achieved earnings-per-share growth in excess of 20 percent for 15 years straight."[9]The company changed its name to Cardinal Health in 1994 and became the third-largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in the United States.[7][10]
R. Kerry Clark, a former executive and vice chairman at Procter & Gamble, was appointed president and CEO in April 2006, with Robert D. Walter retaining Chairmanship of the board.[11] In September 2008, the company announced Clark and Walter would retire and George S. Barrett would become the chairman and CEO.[12][13]
Cardinal Health completed the spin-off of its clinical and medical products and nuclear businesses into an independent medical technology company called CareFusion in 2009 with David Schlotterbeck as CEO.[14][15] Cardinal Health is now traded on the NYSE under symbol CAH.[16] As of July 2016, it is ranked 21 on the Fortune 500 list with FY2016 annual revenue of $102.5 billion.[17] The firm employs 34,000 people worldwide.[18]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 1995, Medicine Shoppe International (St. Louis, est. 1970), the country's largest franchise of retail pharmacies, was acquired. The merger represented the first non-distribution acquisition by Cardinal Health.[19] The following year, the company acquired Pyxis Corporation, a company that developed automated pill dispensers for hospitals, for $867 million.[20]
In a 1997 competition between Cardinal Health and McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health planned to purchase Bergen, to which McKesson responded with a bid to purchase Amerisource. Instead, Amerisource and Bergen merged into AmerisourceBergen.[21] Later that year, Cardinal Health completed the acquisition of Owen Healthcare, the second-largest provider of pharmacy management services in the U.S. at the time.[22]
In 1999, the firm acquired the Chicago-based medical products manufacturer and distributor, Allegiance Healthcare (formerly a division of Baxter Healthcare). Allegiance made surgical drapes, gloves, and gowns, and distributed customized arrangements of medical supplies (called "custom sterile packs" and "procedure-based delivery systems").[23] During 2001, the company spent approximately $30 billion on acquisitions, including Bindley Western Industries, wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals based in Indianapolis.[19]
In April 2006, Cardinal Health purchased Niagara Falls-based ParMed Pharmaceuticals for $40.1 million. ParMed's focus of selling medicine in smaller quantities complements Cardinal Health's distribution to bigger hospital and drug store chains. In June 2007, the firm announced the completion of a tender offer for VIASYS Healthcare.[24]
In June 2010, Cardinal Health announced plans to expand its presence in specialty pharmaceutical services with an agreement to purchase Healthcare Solutions Holding for $517 million.[25] In December 2010, the company acquired Kinray, one of the last independent pharmaceutical wholesalers in the United States, increasing Cardinal Health's presence in the independent pharmacy market by 40 percent.[26] Kinray had annual revenue of over $3.5 billion, and served about 2,000 independent retail pharmacy customers.[26] From 2010 to 2014, Cardinal Health acquired 18 companies including Yong Yu, a Chinese drug distributor. Cardinal Health teamed up with CVS to form Red Oak Sourcing, the largest generic drug sourcing operation in the United States, in July 2014, when the companies started buying generic drugs around the world to sell in U.S. markets.[5]
In March 2015, Cardinal Health signed an agreement to acquire Johnson & Johnson's Cordis (medical) division, a cardiology and endovascular device manufacturer, for $1.94 billion. Cordis' largest market is in the United States, but the manufacturer employs approximately 3,000 people around the world and 70 percent of its sales are international.[27][28] The acquisition was completed on October 4, 2015. [29]
Controversy[edit]
Restatements[edit]
In September 2004, Cardinal Health announced to restate past results for fiscal 2001, 2002, 2003 and the first three quarters of 2004 downward, after an accounting review and an ongoing federal investigation. In 2005, in connection with the Audit Committee's conclusions reached in September and October 2004, the company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to its fiscal 2004 and prior historical consolidated financial statements.[30] According to the Wall Street Journal, "Analysts called the restatement decision troubling, yet limited in scope."[31]
DEA investigation into Oxycodone diversion[edit]
See also: Drug diversion
In 2008, Cardinal Health agreed to pay $34 million in civil penalties to settle DEA allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders of hydrocodone. The fine followed a 10-month DEA suspension of a Lakeland, Florida distribution facility and two others in New Jersey and Washington.[32] On February 2, 2012, the Drug Enforcement Administration again suspended the license of the firm's Lakeland distribution center to distribute controlled substances on charges that it had allowed four Florida pharmacies to purchase excessive amounts of controlled substances, in particular oxycodone.[33] Cardinal Health obtained a restraining order against the suspension, but the suspension was upheld on February 29 by a Federal district court because the court agreed with the DEA that Cardinal Health's activities represented an "imminent danger to the public."[34] The company stated that it blocked two of the pharmacies, (Brooks Pharmacy in Bonita Springs, Florida, and Gulf Coast Medical in Panama City, Florida), and notified the corporate owners of the two pharmacies that were part of national chains, two CVS stores in Sanford, Florida.[33]
In February 2012, Joseph Rannazzisi, chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Office of Diversion Control, issued immediate suspension orders against Cardinal's supply of oxycodone to suspected pill mills.[35] Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole then called Rannazzisi to a meeting at Justice Department headquarters where Cole warned him “it made good sense to listen to what Cardinal had to say”.[35] Rannazzisi was fired from the drug diversion office in August 2015.[35] Cardinal was never fined.[35]
Cardinal, alongside McKesson Corporation, and AmerisourceBergen, spent $13 million lobbying Congress to pass Congressman Tom Marino's "Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act".[35] The bill, which increases the burden of proof enforcers need to show against drug distributors, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in April 2016.[36]
Cardinal Health Foundation[edit]
The Cardinal Health Foundation is the charitable arm of Cardinal Health. The company makes annual product donations of over $9 million through international relief organizations and provides up to $1,000 in matching funds for every Cardinal Health employee that makes a charitable donation.[37] In 2008, the foundation established its E3 Grant Program.[38] Over the past seven years, the Foundation has invested more than $7.15 million in funding to 241 hospitals, health systems or other health-related organizations.[1]
Cardinal Health also supports organizations such as Ronald McDonald House Charities, and was named Benefactor of the Year at the 2011 Corporate Caring Awards.[37] In 2015, the foundation contributed $3 million to the Solutions for Patient Safety project, which has raised over $11 million nationally for efforts to improve safety initiatives in children’s hospitals.[39]

History[edit]
Founded in 1971 as Cardinal Foods by Robert D. Walter, the company was initially a food wholesaler. After acquiring the Bailey Drug Company in 1979, it began wholesaling drugs as Cardinal Distribution, Incorporated. The company went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1983 and subsequently began a long string of acquisitions and mergers. In 1988, Walter sold Cardinal Health's food operations to Roundy's.[7] From 1991 to 1996, the company’s sales grew from $1.2 billion to $8.9 billion.[8] In a case study for Harvard Business Review, Mary Teagarden describes Cardinal Health in this period as "one of a handful of large U.S. companies that had achieved earnings-per-share growth in excess of 20 percent for 15 years straight."[9]The company changed its name to Cardinal Health in 1994 and became the third-largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in the United States.[7][10]
R. Kerry Clark, a former executive and vice chairman at Procter & Gamble, was appointed president and CEO in April 2006, with Robert D. Walter retaining Chairmanship of the board.[11] In September 2008, the company announced Clark and Walter would retire and George S. Barrett would become the chairman and CEO.[12][13]
Cardinal Health completed the spin-off of its clinical and medical products and nuclear businesses into an independent medical technology company called CareFusion in 2009 with David Schlotterbeck as CEO.[14][15] Cardinal Health is now traded on the NYSE under symbol CAH.[16] As of July 2016, it is ranked 21 on the Fortune 500 list with FY2016 annual revenue of $102.5 billion.[17] The firm employs 34,000 people worldwide.[18]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 1995, Medicine Shoppe International (St. Louis, est. 1970), the country's largest franchise of retail pharmacies, was acquired. The merger represented the first non-distribution acquisition by Cardinal Health.[19] The following year, the company acquired Pyxis Corporation, a company that developed automated pill dispensers for hospitals, for $867 million.[20]

Instead, Amerisource and Bergen merged into AmerisourceBergen.[21] Later that year, Cardinal Health completed the acquisition of Owen Healthcare, the second-largest provider of pharmacy management services in the U.S. at the time.[22]
In 1999, the firm acquired the Chicago-based medical products manufacturer and distributor, Allegiance Healthcare (formerly a division of Baxter Healthcare). Allegiance made surgical drapes, gloves, and gowns, and distributed customized arrangements of medical supplies (called "custom sterile packs" and "procedure-based delivery systems").[23] During 2001, the company spent approximately $30 billion on acquisitions, including Bindley Western Industries, wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals based in Indianapolis.[19]
In April 2006, Cardinal Health purchased Niagara Falls-based ParMed Pharmaceuticals for $40.1 million. ParMed's focus of selling medicine in smaller quantities complements Cardinal Health's distribution to bigger hospital and drug store chains. In June 2007, the firm announced the completion of a tender offer for VIASYS Healthcare.[24]

History[edit]
Founded in 1971 as Cardinal Foods by Robert D. Walter, the company was initially a food wholesaler. After acquiring the Bailey Drug Company in 1979, it began wholesaling drugs as Cardinal Distribution, Incorporated. The company went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1983 and subsequently began a long string of acquisitions and mergers. In 1988, Walter sold Cardinal Health's food operations to Roundy's.[7] From 1991 to 1996, the company’s sales grew from $1.2 billion to $8.9 billion.[8] In a case study for Harvard Business Review, Mary Teagarden describes Cardinal Health in this period as "one of a handful of large U.S. companies that had achieved earnings-per-share growth in excess of 20 percent for 15 years straight."[9]The company changed its name to Cardinal Health in 1994 and became the third-largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in the United States.[7][10]
R. Kerry Clark, a former executive and vice chairman at Procter & Gamble, was appointed president and CEO in April 2006, with Robert D. Walter retaining Chairmanship of the board.[11] In September 2008, the company announced Clark and Walter would retire and George S. Barrett would become the chairman and CEO.[12][13]
Cardinal Health completed the spin-off of its clinical and medical products and nuclear businesses into an independent medical technology company called CareFusion in 2009 with David Schlotterbeck as CEO.[14][15] Cardinal Health is now traded on the NYSE under symbol CAH.[16] As of July 2016, it is ranked 21 on the Fortune 500 list with FY2016 annual revenue of $102.5 billion.[17] The firm employs 34,000 people worldwide.[18]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 1995, Medicine Shoppe International (St. Louis, est. 1970), the country's largest franchise of retail pharmacies, was acquired. The merger represented the first non-distribution acquisition by Cardinal Health.[19] The following year, the company acquired Pyxis Corporation, a company that developed automated pill dispensers for hospitals, for $867 million.[20]
In a 1997 competition between Cardinal Health and McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health planned to purchase Bergen, to which McKesson responded with a bid to purchase Amerisource. Instead, Amerisource and Bergen merged into AmerisourceBergen.[21] Later that year, Cardinal Health completed the acquisition of Owen Healthcare, the second-largest provider of pharmacy management services in the U.S. at the time.[22]
In 1999, the firm acquired the Chicago-based medical products manufacturer and distributor, Allegiance Healthcare (formerly a division of Baxter Healthcare). Allegiance made surgical drapes, gloves, and gowns, and distributed customized arrangements of medical supplies (called "custom sterile packs" and "procedure-based delivery systems").[23] During 2001, the company spent approximately $30 billion on acquisitions, including Bindley Western Industries, wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals based in Indianapolis.[19]
In April 2006, Cardinal Health purchased Niagara Falls-based ParMed Pharmaceuticals for $40.1 million. ParMed's focus of selling medicine in smaller quantities complements Cardinal Health's distribution to bigger hospital and drug store chains. In June 2007, the firm announced the completion of a tender offer for VIASYS Healthcare.[24]
In June 2010, Cardinal Health announced plans to expand its presence in specialty pharmaceutical services with an agreement to purchase Healthcare Solutions Holding for $517 million.[25] In December 2010, the company acquired Kinray, one of the last independent pharmaceutical wholesalers in the United States, increasing Cardinal Health's presence in the independent pharmacy market by 40 percent.[26] Kinray had annual revenue of over $3.5 billion, and served about 2,000 independent retail pharmacy customers.[26] From 2010 to 2014, Cardinal Health acquired 18 companies including Yong Yu, a Chinese drug distributor. Cardinal Health teamed up with CVS to form Red Oak Sourcing, the largest generic drug sourcing operation in the United States, in July 2014, when the companies started buying generic drugs around the world to sell in U.S. markets.[5]
In March 2015, Cardinal Health signed an agreement to acquire Johnson & Johnson's Cordis (medical) division, a cardiology and endovascular device manufacturer, for $1.94 billion. Cordis' largest market is in the United States, but the manufacturer employs approximately 3,000 people around the world and 70 percent of its sales are international.[27][28] The acquisition was completed on October 4, 2015. [29]
Controversy[edit]
Restatements[edit]
In September 2004, Cardinal Health announced to restate past results for fiscal 2001, 2002, 2003 and the first three quarters of 2004 downward, after an accounting review and an ongoing federal investigation. In 2005, in connection with the Audit Committee's conclusions reached in September and October 2004, the company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to its fiscal 2004 and prior historical consolidated financial statements.[30] According to the Wall Street Journal, "Analysts called the restatement decision troubling, yet limited in scope."[31]
DEA investigation into Oxycodone diversion[edit]
See also: Drug diversion
In 2008, Cardinal Health agreed to pay $34 million in civil penalties to settle DEA allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders of hydrocodone. The fine followed a 10-month DEA suspension of a Lakeland, Florida distribution facility and two others in New Jersey and Washington.[32] On February 2, 2012, the Drug Enforcement Administration again suspended the license of the firm's Lakeland distribution center to distribute controlled substances on charges that it had allowed four Florida pharmacies to purchase excessive amounts of controlled substances, in particular oxycodone.[33] Cardinal Health obtained a restraining order against the suspension, but the suspension was upheld on February 29 by a Federal district court because the court agreed with the DEA that Cardinal Health's activities represented an "imminent danger to the public."[34] The company stated that it blocked two of the pharmacies, (Brooks Pharmacy in Bonita Springs, Florida, and Gulf Coast Medical in Panama City, Florida), and notified the corporate owners of the two pharmacies that were part of national chains, two CVS stores in Sanford, Florida.[33]
In February 2012, Joseph Rannazzisi, chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Office of Diversion Control, issued immediate suspension orders against Cardinal's supply of oxycodone to suspected pill mills.[35] Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole then called Rannazzisi to a meeting at Justice Department headquarters where Cole warned him “it made good sense to listen to what Cardinal had to say”.[35] Rannazzisi was fired from the drug diversion office in August 2015.[35] Cardinal was never fined.[35]
Cardinal, alongside McKesson Corporation, and AmerisourceBergen, spent $13 million lobbying Congress to pass Congressman Tom Marino's "Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act".[35] The bill, which increases the burden of proof enforcers need to show against drug distributors, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in April 2016.[36]
Cardinal Health Foundation[edit]
The Cardinal Health Foundation is the charitable arm of Cardinal Health. The company makes annual product donations of over $9 million through international relief organizations and provides up to $1,000 in matching funds for every Cardinal Health employee that makes a charitable donation.[37] In 2008, the foundation established its E3 Grant Program.[38] Over the past seven years, the Foundation has invested more than $7.15 million in funding to 241 hospitals, health systems or other health-related organizations.[1]
Cardinal Health also supports organizations such as Ronald McDonald House Charities, and was named Benefactor of the Year at the 2011 Corporate Caring Awards.[37] In 2015, the foundation contributed $3 million to the Solutions for Patient Safety project, which has raised over $11 million nationally for efforts to improve safety initiatives in children’s hospitals.[39]

Welcome to Cardinal Health’s Product Information website
This site is intended for Cardinal Health’s customers to provide immediate access to the most current Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS/SDS). This database also contains ValueLink® Directions for Use (DFU) or Instructions for Use (IFU) that are provided by the manufacturer with full-case or box quantities of the products.

The venture was named Red Oak Sourcing and began operations in July 2014.[6]

History[edit]
Founded in 1971 as Cardinal Foods by Robert D. Walter, the company was initially a food wholesaler. After acquiring the Bailey Drug Company in 1979, it began wholesaling drugs as Cardinal Distribution, Incorporated. The company went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1983 and subsequently began a long string of acquisitions and mergers. In 1988, Walter sold Cardinal Health's food operations to Roundy's.[7] From 1991 to 1996, the company’s sales grew from $1.2 billion to $8.9 billion.[8] In a case study for Harvard Business Review, Mary Teagarden describes Cardinal Health in this period as "one of a handful of large U.S. companies that had achieved earnings-per-share growth in excess of 20 percent for 15 years straight."[9]The company changed its name to Cardinal Health in 1994 and became the third-largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in the United States.[7][10]
R. Kerry Clark, a former executive and vice chairman at Procter & Gamble, was appointed president and CEO in April 2006, with Robert D. Walter retaining Chairmanship of the board.[11] In September 2008, the company announced Clark and Walter would retire and George S. Barrett would become the chairman and CEO.[12][13]
Cardinal Health completed the spin-off of its clinical and medical products and nuclear businesses into an independent medical technology company called CareFusion in 2009 with David Schlotterbeck as CEO.[14][15] Cardinal Health is now traded on the NYSE under symbol CAH.[16] As of July 2016, it is ranked 21 on the Fortune 500 list with FY2016 annual revenue of $102.5 billion.[17] The firm employs 34,000 people worldwide.[18]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 1995, Medicine Shoppe International (St. Louis, est. 1970), the country's largest franchise of retail pharmacies, was acquired. The merger represented the first non-distribution acquisition by Cardinal Health.[19] The following year, the company acquired Pyxis Corporation, a company that developed automated pill dispensers for hospitals, for $867 million.[20]
In a 1997 competition between Cardinal Health and McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health planned to purchase Bergen, to which McKesson responded with a bid to purchase Amerisource. Instead, Amerisource and Bergen merged into AmerisourceBergen.[21] Later that year, Cardinal Health completed the acquisition of Owen Healthcare, the second-largest provider of pharmacy management services in the U.S. at the time.[22]
In 1999, the firm acquired the Chicago-based medical products manufacturer and distributor, Allegiance Healthcare (formerly a division of Baxter Healthcare). Allegiance made surgical drapes, gloves, and gowns, and distributed customized arrangements of medical supplies (called "custom sterile packs" and "procedure-based delivery systems").[23] During 2001, the company spent approximately $30 billion on acquisitions, including Bindley Western Industries, wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals based in Indianapolis.[19]
In April 2006, Cardinal Health purchased Niagara Falls-based ParMed Pharmaceuticals for $40.1 million. ParMed's focus of selling medicine in smaller quantities complements Cardinal Health's distribution to bigger hospital and drug store chains. In June 2007, the firm announced the completion of a tender offer for VIASYS Healthcare.[24]
In June 2010, Cardinal Health announced plans to expand its presence in specialty pharmaceutical services with an agreement to purchase Healthcare Solutions Holding for $517 million.[25] In December 2010, the company acquired Kinray, one of the last independent pharmaceutical wholesalers in the United States, increasing Cardinal Health's presence in the independent pharmacy market by 40 percent.[26] Kinray had annual revenue of over $3.5 billion, and served about 2,000 independent retail pharmacy customers.[26] From 2010 to 2014, Cardinal Health acquired 18 companies including Yong Yu, a Chinese drug distributor. Cardinal Health teamed up with CVS to form Red Oak Sourcing, the largest generic drug sourcing operation in the United States, in July 2014, when the companies started buying generic drugs around the world to sell in U.S. markets.[5]
In March 2015, Cardinal Health signed an agreement to acquire Johnson & Johnson's Cordis (medical) division, a cardiology and endovascular device manufacturer, for $1.94 billion. Cordis' largest market is in the United States, but the manufacturer employs approximately 3,000 people around the world and 70 percent of its sales are international.[27][28] The acquisition was completed on October 4, 2015. [29]
Controversy[edit]
Restatements[edit]
In September 2004, Cardinal Health announced to restate past results for fiscal 2001, 2002, 2003 and the first three quarters of 2004 downward, after an accounting review and an ongoing federal investigation. In 2005, in connection with the Audit Committee's conclusions reached in September and October 2004, the company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to its fiscal 2004 and prior historical consolidated financial statements.[30] According to the Wall Street Journal, "Analysts called the restatement decision troubling, yet limited in scope."[31]
DEA investigation into Oxycodone diversion[edit]
See also: Drug diversion
In 2008, Cardinal Health agreed to pay $34 million in civil penalties to settle DEA allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders of hydrocodone. The fine followed a 10-month DEA suspension of a Lakeland, Florida distribution facility and two others in New Jersey and Washington.[32] On February 2, 2012, the Drug Enforcement Administration again suspended the license of the firm's Lakeland distribution center to distribute controlled substances on charges that it had allowed four Florida pharmacies to purchase excessive amounts of controlled substances, in particular oxycodone.[33] Cardinal Health obtained a restraining order against the suspension, but the suspension was upheld on February 29 by a Federal district court because the court agreed with the DEA that Cardinal Health's activities represented an "imminent danger to the public."[34] The company stated that it blocked two of the pharmacies, (Brooks Pharmacy in Bonita Springs, Florida, and Gulf Coast Medical in Panama City, Florida), and notified the corporate owners of the two pharmacies that were part of national chains, two CVS stores in Sanford, Florida.[33]
In February 2012, Joseph Rannazzisi, chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Office of Diversion Control, issued immediate suspension orders against Cardinal's supply of oxycodone to suspected pill mills.[35] Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole then called Rannazzisi to a meeting at Justice Department headquarters where Cole warned him “it made good sense to listen to what Cardinal had to say”.[35] Rannazzisi was fired from the drug diversion office in August 2015.[35] Cardinal was never fined.[35]
Cardinal, alongside McKesson Corporation, and AmerisourceBergen, spent $13 million lobbying Congress to pass Congressman Tom Marino's "Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act".[35] The bill, which increases the burden of proof enforcers need to show against drug distributors, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in April 2016.[36]
Cardinal Health Foundation[edit]
The Cardinal Health Foundation is the charitable arm of Cardinal Health. The company makes annual product donations of over $9 million through international relief organizations and provides up to $1,000 in matching funds for every Cardinal Health employee that makes a charitable donation.[37] In 2008, the foundation established its E3 Grant Program.[38] Over the past seven years, the Foundation has invested more than $7.15 million in funding to 241 hospitals, health systems or other health-related organizations.[1]
Cardinal Health also supports organizations such as Ronald McDonald House Charities, and was named Benefactor of the Year at the 2011 Corporate Caring Awards.[37] In 2015, the foundation contributed $3 million to the Solutions for Patient Safety project, which has raised over $11 million nationally for efforts to improve safety initiatives in children’s hospitals.[39]

History[edit]
Founded in 1971 as Cardinal Foods by Robert D. Walter, the company was initially a food wholesaler. After acquiring the Bailey Drug Company in 1979, it began wholesaling drugs as Cardinal Distribution, Incorporated. The company went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1983 and subsequently began a long string of acquisitions and mergers. In 1988, Walter sold Cardinal Health's food operations to Roundy's.[7] From 1991 to 1996, the company’s sales grew from $1.2 billion to $8.9 billion.[8] In a case study for Harvard Business Review, Mary Teagarden describes Cardinal Health in this period as "one of a handful of large U.S. companies that had achieved earnings-per-share growth in excess of 20 percent for 15 years straight."[9]The company changed its name to Cardinal Health in 1994 and became the third-largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in the United States.[7][10]
R. Kerry Clark, a former executive and vice chairman at Procter & Gamble, was appointed president and CEO in April 2006, with Robert D. Walter retaining Chairmanship of the board.[11] In September 2008, the company announced Clark and Walter would retire and George S. Barrett would become the chairman and CEO.[12][13]
Cardinal Health completed the spin-off of its clinical and medical products and nuclear businesses into an independent medical technology company called CareFusion in 2009 with David Schlotterbeck as CEO.[14][15] Cardinal Health is now traded on the NYSE under symbol CAH.[16] As of July 2016, it is ranked 21 on the Fortune 500 list with FY2016 annual revenue of $102.5 billion.[17] The firm employs 34,000 people worldwide.[18]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 1995, Medicine Shoppe International (St. Louis, est. 1970), the country's largest franchise of retail pharmacies, was acquired. The merger represented the first non-distribution acquisition by Cardinal Health.[19] The following year, the company acquired Pyxis Corporation, a company that developed automated pill dispensers for hospitals, for $867 million.[20]
In a 1997 competition between Cardinal Health and McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health planned to purchase Bergen, to which McKesson responded with a bid to purchase Amerisource. Instead, Amerisource and Bergen merged into AmerisourceBergen.[21] Later that year, Cardinal Health completed the acquisition of Owen Healthcare, the second-largest provider of pharmacy management services in the U.S. at the time.[22]
In 1999, the firm acquired the Chicago-based medical products manufacturer and distributor, Allegiance Healthcare (formerly a division of Baxter Healthcare). Allegiance made surgical drapes, gloves, and gowns, and distributed customized arrangements of medical supplies (called "custom sterile packs" and "procedure-based delivery systems").[23] During 2001, the company spent approximately $30 billion on acquisitions, including Bindley Western Industries, wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals based in Indianapolis.[19]
In April 2006, Cardinal Health purchased Niagara Falls-based ParMed Pharmaceuticals for $40.1 million. ParMed's focus of selling medicine in smaller quantities complements Cardinal Health's distribution to bigger hospital and drug store chains. In June 2007, the firm announced the completion of a tender offer for VIASYS Healthcare.[24]
In June 2010, Cardinal Health announced plans to expand its presence in specialty pharmaceutical services with an agreement to purchase Healthcare Solutions Holding for $517 million.[25] In December 2010, the company acquired Kinray, one of the last independent pharmaceutical wholesalers in the United States, increasing Cardinal Health's presence in the independent pharmacy market by 40 percent.[26] Kinray had annual revenue of over $3.5 billion, and served about 2,000 independent retail pharmacy customers.[26] From 2010 to 2014, Cardinal Health acquired 18 companies including Yong Yu, a Chinese drug distributor. Cardinal Health teamed up with CVS to form Red Oak Sourcing, the largest generic drug sourcing operation in the United States, in July 2014, when the companies started buying generic drugs around the world to sell in U.S. markets.[5]
In March 2015, Cardinal Health signed an agreement to acquire Johnson & Johnson's Cordis (medical) division, a cardiology and endovascular device manufacturer, for $1.94 billion. Cordis' largest market is in the United States, but the manufacturer employs approximately 3,000 people around the world and 70 percent of its sales are international.[27][28] The acquisition was completed on October 4, 2015. [29]
Controversy[edit]
Restatements[edit]
In September 2004, Cardinal Health announced to restate past results for fiscal 2001, 2002, 2003 and the first three quarters of 2004 downward, after an accounting review and an ongoing federal investigation. In 2005, in connection with the Audit Committee's conclusions reached in September and October 2004, the company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to its fiscal 2004 and prior historical consolidated financial statements.[30] According to the Wall Street Journal, "Analysts called the restatement decision troubling, yet limited in scope."[31]
DEA investigation into Oxycodone diversion[edit]
See also: Drug diversion
In 2008, Cardinal Health agreed to pay $34 million in civil penalties to settle DEA allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders of hydrocodone. The fine followed a 10-month DEA suspension of a Lakeland, Florida distribution facility and two others in New Jersey and Washington.[32] On February 2, 2012, the Drug Enforcement Administration again suspended the license of the firm's Lakeland distribution center to distribute controlled substances on charges that it had allowed four Florida pharmacies to purchase excessive amounts of controlled substances, in particular oxycodone.[33] Cardinal Health obtained a restraining order against the suspension, but the suspension was upheld on February 29 by a Federal district court because the court agreed with the DEA that Cardinal Health's activities represented an "imminent danger to the public."[34] The company stated that it blocked two of the pharmacies, (Brooks Pharmacy in Bonita Springs, Florida, and Gulf Coast Medical in Panama City, Florida), and notified the corporate owners of the two pharmacies that were part of national chains, two CVS stores in Sanford, Florida.[33]
In February 2012, Joseph Rannazzisi, chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Office of Diversion Control, issued immediate suspension orders against Cardinal's supply of oxycodone to suspected pill mills.[35] Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole then called Rannazzisi to a meeting at Justice Department headquarters where Cole warned him “it made good sense to listen to what Cardinal had to say”.[35] Rannazzisi was fired from the drug diversion office in August 2015.[35] Cardinal was never fined.[35]
Cardinal, alongside McKesson Corporation, and AmerisourceBergen, spent $13 million lobbying Congress to pass Congressman Tom Marino's "Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act".[35] The bill, which increases the burden of proof enforcers need to show against drug distributors, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in April 2016.[36]
Cardinal Health Foundation[edit]
The Cardinal Health Foundation is the charitable arm of Cardinal Health. The company makes annual product donations of over $9 million through international relief organizations and provides up to $1,000 in matching funds for every Cardinal Health employee that makes a charitable donation.[37] In 2008, the foundation established its E3 Grant Program.[38] Over the past seven years, the Foundation has invested more than $7.15 million in funding to 241 hospitals, health systems or other health-related organizations.[1]
Cardinal Health also supports organizations such as Ronald McDonald House Charities, and was named Benefactor of the Year at the 2011 Corporate Caring Awards.[37] In 2015, the foundation contributed $3 million to the Solutions for Patient Safety project, which has raised over $11 million nationally for efforts to improve safety initiatives in children’s hospitals.[39]

History[edit]
Founded in 1971 as Cardinal Foods by Robert D. Walter, the company was initially a food wholesaler. After acquiring the Bailey Drug Company in 1979, it began wholesaling drugs as Cardinal Distribution, Incorporated. The company went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1983 and subsequently began a long string of acquisitions and mergers. In 1988, Walter sold Cardinal Health's food operations to Roundy's.[7] From 1991 to 1996, the company’s sales grew from $1.2 billion to $8.9 billion.[8] In a case study for Harvard Business Review, Mary Teagarden describes Cardinal Health in this period as "one of a handful of large U.S. companies that had achieved earnings-per-share growth in excess of 20 percent for 15 years straight."[9]The company changed its name to Cardinal Health in 1994 and became the third-largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in the United States.[7][10]
R. Kerry Clark, a former executive and vice chairman at Procter & Gamble, was appointed president and CEO in April 2006, with Robert D. Walter retaining Chairmanship of the board.[11] In September 2008, the company announced Clark and Walter would retire and George S. Barrett would become the chairman and CEO.[12][13]
Cardinal Health completed the spin-off of its clinical and medical products and nuclear businesses into an independent medical technology company called CareFusion in 2009 with David Schlotterbeck as CEO.[14][15] Cardinal Health is now traded on the NYSE under symbol CAH.[16] As of July 2016, it is ranked 21 on the Fortune 500 list with FY2016 annual revenue of $102.5 billion.[17] The firm employs 34,000 people worldwide.[18]
Acquisitions[edit]
In 1995, Medicine Shoppe International (St. Louis, est. 1970), the country's largest franchise of retail pharmacies, was acquired. The merger represented the first non-distribution acquisition by Cardinal Health.[19] The following year, the company acquired Pyxis Corporation, a company that developed automated pill dispensers for hospitals, for $867 million.[20]
In a 1997 competition between Cardinal Health and McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health planned to purchase Bergen, to which McKesson responded with a bid to purchase Amerisource. Instead, Amerisource and Bergen merged into AmerisourceBergen.[21] Later that year, Cardinal Health completed the acquisition of Owen Healthcare, the second-largest provider of pharmacy management services in the U.S. at the time.[22]
In 1999, the firm acquired the Chicago-based medical products manufacturer and distributor, Allegiance Healthcare (formerly a division of Baxter Healthcare). Allegiance made surgical drapes, gloves, and gowns, and distributed customized arrangements of medical supplies (called "custom sterile packs" and "procedure-based delivery systems").[23] During 2001, the company spent approximately $30 billion on acquisitions, including Bindley Western Industries, wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals based in Indianapolis.[19]
In April 2006, Cardinal Health purchased Niagara Falls-based ParMed Pharmaceuticals for $40.1 million. ParMed's focus of selling medicine in smaller quantities complements Cardinal Health's distribution to bigger hospital and drug store chains. In June 2007, the firm announced the completion of a tender offer for VIASYS Healthcare.[24]
In June 2010, Cardinal Health announced plans to expand its presence in specialty pharmaceutical services with an agreement to purchase Healthcare Solutions Holding for $517 million.[25] In December 2010, the company acquired Kinray, one of the last independent pharmaceutical wholesalers in the United States, increasing Cardinal Health's presence in the independent pharmacy market by 40 percent.[26] Kinray had annual revenue of over $3.5 billion, and served about 2,000 independent retail pharmacy customers.[26] From 2010 to 2014, Cardinal Health acquired 18 companies including Yong Yu, a Chinese drug distributor. Cardinal Health teamed up with CVS to form Red Oak Sourcing, the largest generic drug sourcing operation in the United States, in July 2014, when the companies started buying generic drugs around the world to sell in U.S. markets.[5]
In March 2015, Cardinal Health signed an agreement to acquire Johnson & Johnson's Cordis (medical) division, a cardiology and endovascular device manufacturer, for $1.94 billion. Cordis' largest market is in the United States, but the manufacturer employs approximately 3,000 people around the world and 70 percent of its sales are international.[27][28] The acquisition was completed on October 4, 2015. [29]
Controversy[edit]
Restatements[edit]
In September 2004, Cardinal Health announced to restate past results for fiscal 2001, 2002, 2003 and the first three quarters of 2004 downward, after an accounting review and an ongoing federal investigation. In 2005, in connection with the Audit Committee's conclusions reached in September and October 2004, the company made certain reclassification and restatement adjustments to its fiscal 2004 and prior historical consolidated financial statements.[30] According to the Wall Street Journal, "Analysts called the restatement decision troubling, yet limited in scope."[31]
DEA investigation into Oxycodone diversion[edit]
See also: Drug diversion
In 2008, Cardinal Health agreed to pay $34 million in civil penalties to settle DEA allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders of hydrocodone. The fine followed a 10-month DEA suspension of a Lakeland, Florida distribution facility and two others in New Jersey and Washington.[32] On February 2, 2012, the Drug Enforcement Administration again suspended the license of the firm's Lakeland distribution center to distribute controlled substances on charges that it had allowed four Florida pharmacies to purchase excessive amounts of controlled substances, in particular oxycodone.[33] Cardinal Health obtained a restraining order against the suspension, but the suspension was upheld on February 29 by a Federal district court because the court agreed with the DEA that Cardinal Health's activities represented an "imminent danger to the public."[34] The company stated that it blocked two of the pharmacies, (Brooks Pharmacy in Bonita Springs, Florida, and Gulf Coast Medical in Panama City, Florida), and notified the corporate owners of the two pharmacies that were part of national chains, two CVS stores in Sanford, Florida.[33]
In February 2012, Joseph Rannazzisi, chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Office of Diversion Control, issued immediate suspension orders against Cardinal's supply of oxycodone to suspected pill mills.[35] Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole then called Rannazzisi to a meeting at Justice Department headquarters where Cole warned him “it made good sense to listen to what Cardinal had to say”.[35] Rannazzisi was fired from the drug diversion office in August 2015.[35] Cardinal was never fined.[35]
Cardinal, alongside McKesson Corporation, and AmerisourceBergen, spent $13 million lobbying Congress to pass Congressman Tom Marino's "Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act".[35] The bill, which increases the burden of proof enforcers need to show against drug distributors, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in April 2016.[36]
Cardinal Health Foundation[edit]
The Cardinal Health Foundation is the charitable arm of Cardinal Health. The company makes annual product donations of over $9 million through international relief organizations and provides up to $1,000 in matching funds for every Cardinal Health employee that makes a charitable donation.[37] In 2008, the foundation established its E3 Grant Program.[38] Over the past seven years, the Foundation has invested more than $7.15 million in funding to 241 hospitals, health systems or other health-related organizations.[1]
Cardinal Health also supports organizations such as Ronald McDonald House Charities, and was named Benefactor of the Year at the 2011 Corporate Caring Awards.[37] In 2015, the foundation contributed $3 million to the Solutions for Patient Safety project, which has raised over $11 million nationally for efforts to improve safety initiatives in children’s hospitals.[39]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
