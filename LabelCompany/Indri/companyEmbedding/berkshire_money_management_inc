About Berkshire Money Management

In 2001 Berkshire Money Management (BMM) set up offices in Pittsfield, MA. The firm grew quietly, at least “quietly” outside the office walls. But within the walls BMM was making a lot of noise growing its financial newsletter, the Navigator, to upwards of 16,000 subscribers. BMM’s investment management business grew as subscribers asked us to begin managing their investment portfolios. The firm grew rapidly and in 2004 BMM sold the newsletter business and, for a few years, closed the door to new clients.
In 2007, in anticipation of the financial crisis, we took action. We began shorting the market (i.e. made investments that could profit if the stock market fell) while protecting our client’s money through defensive investments. As a result, there was a huge response from our current clients asking us if we would manage more of their money, and the money of their friends and relatives. In 2008 we came to realize that there was a tremendous demand for investment managers who adjusted portfolios to reflect changing client needs and goals, so we hired more people and opened our doors to new clients.
BMM gravitates away from the traditional age-based asset-allocation recommendations of the financial industry (ex. “100 minus your age equals the amount of equities you should own…”), and we also gravitate away from the traditional theories of long-term investing (ex. “the stock market will always come back…”) and diversification (“own a little bit of everything, but not too much…”).
First, while age is important, it is not the main factor. While time is a leading risk measurement, the marketplace better defines what is or what is not risky. (For example, some might think that owning a short-term Treasury-bond fund is “safe” or “conservative” – that is until the Fed raises rates and the fund loses money.)
Second, while BMM accepts the premise of long-term investing we believe that we add value to your portfolio by identifying potential market corrections and by making the necessary adjustments.
Third, while diversification is of the utmost importance, there is no need to own something just for the sake of following an industry mantra of owning a little bit of everything. (Why own something that is losing money? And why not own more of something that is going up?)
Most importantly, we apply our investment philosophies in a manner to accomplish your goals.  At Berkshire Money Management, we’re not just investing for you, we are investing for something, for what you want to accomplish.  The end result is a portfolio strategy that has led to long-term relationships with valued clients, and at the same time, reduced risk. We invite you to explore this website to learn more, and if you have questions, please feel free to reach out to us.
Warm Regards,





Allen Harris, CEPA, CEO & Chief Investment Officer

Estate Planning Most people understand they should get tax advice and align legal structures to prepare assets for their heirs. We go a step beyond and begin preparing your heirs for your assets.









Estate Planning, Part 1Part 2 – Legal IssuesPart 3 – Health Care 

 Prepare Your Heirs.
Many families hire legal counsel to prepare the relevant documents, and leave it at that. Often, this isn’t enough, and what remains is a major communication gap. It has not been uncommon for families who “believed” they were well-prepared to find that they were not. It isn’t always the documents. And it isn’t always financial; often times there are emotional connections that become more important than a monetarily equitable distribution of assets.
Preparing heirs is a function of the estate planning process. No matter how large or how modest, everyone has an estate and wants to control how it is given to the people and organizations they care most about. To ensure that your wishes and legacy are carried out, you need to provide specific instructions stating whom you want to receive what, and when in detail. This ensures that the least amount is paid in taxes, legal fees, and court costs, and also helps to avoid family interpretations of what is equitable, and intended. We are here and experienced in helping you connect your intentions with your other preparations as well as answering the questions that haven’t even occurred to you yet.

2017 Mid-Year Outlook 
June 28, 2017June 28, 2017 by BMM 


Small Business Optimism Helps Large Cap Companies The U.S. economic expansion is now eight years old and has a chance of being the longest on record, surpassing the decade long run of the 1990s. The U.S. stock market is expensive, but continued strong corporate earnings growth is keeping valuations in check, allowing for continued stock gains in the presence of low inflation and a slow-going Fed. Stock market volatility has been largely absent for years. A shallow stock market correction of 5-10% is all but inevitable as the natural tendency of all things is to revert to the mean. The…


 



Markets in pullback mode 
June 17, 2017June 20, 2017 by Bill Schmick 


Technology stocks continued to consolidate while the Dow made new highs and the S&P 500 Index hovered just below historical highs. Throw in the fact that the markets are notoriously slow and biased to the downside during the summer months, and you have a recipe for further consolidation. That does not necessarily mean that we will see some sharp and painful correction in stocks. My regular readers understand that the averages could simply move sideways for a month or two before resuming their upward climb. However, within those averages, individual stocks and sectors could experience much deeper declines. Take the…

We are a country divided. Washington is paralyzed. Half the country considers our president a joke and any and all legislation is dead on arrival, according to the TV talking heads. Social media is filled with outrage and despair. As a result, Americans are supposedly wringing their hands, or worse, hiding under the covers. Don’t you believe it! To hear the media tell it, on one side of this nation are the ultra-left, tree-hugging liberals, who want government to do everything by taking from the rich and giving to the poor. On the other side, are the red-necked conservatives, who…




FOMO fuels the markets 
June 10, 2017June 20, 2017 by Bill Schmick 


The fear of missing out (or FOMO) has supported the stock market averages this week. Although it appeared that the indexes simply marked time, appearances can be deceiving.   We made new record highs again this week as investors piled into stocks on any sign of weakness. The fear that stocks will go ever higher fueled those who are underweighted in equities to buy, buy buy. The S&P 500 Index has reached the lower end of my target (2,443) but could easily spike to 2,475, which is at the top of my range. In bull markets, and this one certainly qualifies,…




As of tomorrow, putting a client’s needs first becomes law

Despite a bitterly contested battle by brokers, banks and insurance companies to kill it, the on-again, off-again Department of Labor Fiduciary rule becomes effective June 9, 2017. Investors should cheer the news. That’s right; it is no longer just a slogan that slick marketers use to woo unsuspecting retail investors into their fee-based, commission-based, fee-sharing web of duplicity and immoral behavior. Since I am already a fiduciary, I tried over the years to advise readers on what is in their best interests since their advisers certainly were not. The new law changes all that. If your advisor, broker, wealth manager,…




Markets are still on a roll

Additional gains propelled stocks higher this week with all three averages closing at record highs once again. Despite the fact that more and more experts are warning of a possible fall in the averages, investors continue to pile into stocks. Should you?   The short answer is no, wait for that decline, unless you have no exposure to the stock market. That would be hard for me to believe if you have been reading my column regularly. My readers also know that the threat of a pullback hangs over the market all the time since we can expect as many…




Elder care in an age of confusion

Many Americans confess that they are confused when faced with the myriad of Medicare choices available to them. Others are simply not planning, nor saving enough to meet the challenge of health care costs in old age. In response, a whole new industry has sprung up nationwide. It’s called Life Care Planning, an off-shoot and a natural progression for those practicing Elder Law. What, you may ask, is Elder Law and why has it become so important? Attorneys that practice elder law are essentially advocates for the elderly and their loved ones. They routinely handle a range of legal issues…




Markets climb higher 
May 27, 2017June 20, 2017 by Bill Schmick 


In the absence of any earth-shaking news, stocks tend to follow the recent trend. That trend, since the election has been up, so… The question to ask: when we can logically expect that trend to change? As readers may recall, my target for the S&P 500 Index is somewhere between 2,443 and 2,475, which I expect we will hit before the end of the second quarter. This week, we broke 2,400, regaining everything that was lost in last Wednesday’s 2% downdraft. Now, that 2,400 price level should act as a support for the bulls. “Are you still bullish?” asked one…




Are you ready for a 20% correction? 
May 26, 2017June 20, 2017 by Bill Schmick 


As the stock market makes new highs, investors tend to get greedy. They also begin to believe that what has happened in the recent past will continue to happen in the future. Actually, history shows the exact opposite. It is time to give the potential downside some thought. Hope burns brightly in the equity markets right now. Many on Wall Street believe that the Republican-dominated Congress, led by Donald Trump, “The working man’s president,” will usher in a golden era of strong economic growth and robust financial markets. The problem is that politics and investments make for strange bedfellows. At…

Don’t Flinch 
 by BMM 



March 25, 2015
Surprise!
·         The heightened level of analyst optimism felt at the beginning of the year has proved to not be warranted.
·         Corporate earnings have disappointed this quarter.
·         The direction of the US dollar was predicted, but the pace of the ascent has been surprising.
Click here to view PDF version
The economic news this year hasn’t been that good, but the stock market absorbed it with two tiny corrections (five percent in January, and three percent in March).  The Citi Economic Surprise Index (ESI), which essentially tracks expected economic numbers versus actual numbers, keeps on showing us that the heightened level of analyst optimism felt at the beginning of the year was not warranted. The ESI recently reached its lowest level since July 2012.
We’re not too surprised at some of the surprises. For example, in our 2015 Economic Outlook, we wrote “BMM has found that analysts are not very good at predicting earnings per share, but we are confident in our ability of figuring out how much consensus estimates will move… Consensus estimates for S&P 500 operating EPS growth will grow from around 9.3% in 2014 to 13.7% in 2015…(but we think that) EPS growth will probably be in the low-eight’s to high-nine’s for 2015.”  So that earnings have been disappointing this quarter wasn’t news to us.
The good news is the potential for new upside surprises in regards to earnings.  A calculation called the “guidance spread” measures the difference between the percentage of companies raising guidance and lowering guidance. The spread for the most recent quarter has come in at its lowest since the final two quarters of 2008, at the end of the financial crisis.  Admittedly, we may be relying as much on hope as we are on data, but the proverbial bar has now been set low enough for actual corporate earnings to begin hurdling over expectations in a quarter or two.
What was news to us was the pace of the dollar’s increase.  In our 2015 Economic Outlook, we argued that “with much of the developed nation in an easing policy, a normalization of U.S. interest rates should continue to drive the U.S. dollar higher due to interest rate divergences.”  So the direction was obvious to us.  The magnitude and pace, however, was outside of the range of any forecast we saw or considered. 
The strengthening dollar can be a blessing, and it can be a curse.  On the plus-side, a stronger dollar pushes down the price of oil and other commodities, helps keep inflation in check, and improves terms of international trade.  On the minus-side, US corporate profit margins could be squeezed as they cut the price of their products abroad.
That list could get a lot longer for both pluses and minuses, but they are also technical and we’ll spare you from that here. The point is that arguments can be made for the desire of either a strong or a weak dollar. However, our analysis indicates that it is not only the value of the US dollar that matters for growth, but also the pace of appreciation.  Against major currencies, the dollar value has increased over thirteen percent over the past six months, the most since February 2009. Historically, such fast increases have been associated with below-trend economic growth. The bulk of the negative impact comes from export-oriented manufacturing, which has actually contracted in the past when the dollar has appreciated so quickly.
The dollar’s strength comes from growth and interest rate differentials between the US and the rest of the world.  Given that we don’t expect those differences to abate, we expect the strength to continue. The strength of the US dollar will weigh on net exports this quarter.  Since 1980 there have been eleven cases of the dollar appreciating by at least five percent over six months.  On average, net exports were not a big subtraction from GDP growth in the first two quarters, but increasingly subtracted from growth in the third to sixth quarters. 
 
No Recession Means Only Short-Duration Corrections
•             Job gains span almost industries, regions, and pay scales.
•             Neither households nor businesses are overleveraged.
•             The banking system is strong.
So far this year, the price of oil has sunk, earnings have disappointed, the dollar has rocketed, and it seems like the Fed may raise interest rates sometime this year.  In isolation, any of these events could cause problems for the stock market.  But they are not occurring in isolation – they’re all happening at the same time; all while valuations could be argued as stretched (not lofty, but stretched) and optimism has been increasing (often a contrary indicator).  Given all of this as a backdrop, the risks of the biggest correction since 2011 seem more than plausible. But don’t flinch – the market remains far from the bubble conditions that could be expected at the end of a secular (i.e. long-term) bull run.  Any correction that occurs – whether it is big or small – will only prove to be a cyclical occurrence that will reset valuations and ultimately refresh the secular bull. 
Following the advice of “don’t flinch” will be hard for any of us if a stock market drop of any meaningful magnitude does occur. That’s not a commentary on the next correction; it’s a comment regarding any and all corrections and the human reaction.  A drop in stock market prices often triggers an emotional response, and that response is panic in the form of selling.  But the more appropriate reaction might be to switch from bonds to stocks, or, to be more nuanced, from one asset class or sector of stocks to another.
The point is that any pullback should be short-lived.  Like the five-percent pullback in January, and all the other pullbacks since March 2009, the next correction of any magnitude will likely be forgotten merely months after an eventual bottom.  Corrections in non-recessionary times happen in the matter of months (often too quick to make a meaningful defensive change to a portfolio) and typically bounce back in a time period that mirrors about twice the duration of the decline (so not that long).  However, during a recession, market declines grind on much longer and also take a lot more time to recover in price.  A recession would make us flinch.  But don’t flinch, because we just can’t make the case for a recession.
At six years, the current U.S. economic expansion is already longer than the average expansion since World War II, and is yet to show signs of deterioration.  In fact, the likelihood is that this will be one of the longer economic expansions in history.  The breadth of job growth is rarely ever as strong; aside from the energy sector, job gains are occurring in all industries, regions, and pay scales.  But as robust as hiring has been, the labor market still has slack.  That slack is good news, for now, as expansions typically end when the economy overheats (i.e. the labor market is at full employment and businesses are running beyond capacity), inflation pressures develop and interest rates become high, thus exposing overleveraged households and businesses.  This expansion is far from that; this expansion has room to run.
Core inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is rather flat (and not likely to pick up, given the drop in oil prices and the rising dollar).  And although the Fed will likely raise interest rates this year, it is seen as more a process of “normalization” and it will be a long time before rates get back to anything looking familiar.  Not to mention that weakness in Europe’s economy and their responding version of quantitative easing will pressure down US interest rates.
Also, there is no indication of households or businesses being overleveraged.  Households owe about $1 trillion less today (or almost 10% less) than they did at the peak of their indebtedness in 2008.  Less debt combined with lower interest rates has significantly reduced household debt service burdens.  In fact, the share of disposable income that households must pay to make debt payments is as low as it has been since the Federal Reserve started tracking that measure in 1980. As you would suspect, as a result, delinquency rates on household debts are about as low as they get in the best of economic times (which, in turn, helps keep businesses flush with cash). 
Now, it is important to note that households are still borrowing, and still spending (which is important to keep the economy moving).  But the borrowing is more cautious than it was prior to the Great Recession – for example, auto and student lending is strong, but credit card and home equity lending is softer. 
And corporate profitability has never been stronger, and businesses’ capacity to service their debts is excellent.  The quick ratio (the ratio of liquid assets to short-term liabilities) is almost fifty percent, about double its long-term average.  And the interest coverage ratio (the ratio of interest payments to corporate cash flow) is still falling even though it’s already near record lows. Businesses are borrowing more aggressively than households, and that’s a good sign.  Corporate bond issuance has been robust and commercial & industrial (C & I) lending by banks is expanding at a double-digit pace.  C & I lending is among the most reliable lagging indicators. And while we obviously prefer leading indicators, that amount of lending is proof that the economic expansion is solid.
Bottom Line:  The pace and ascent of the US dollar’s rise is not something to disregard.  An argument can be made for the desire of either a strong or a weak dollar. However, our analysis indicates that it is not only the value of the US dollar that matters for growth, but also the pace of appreciation.  Historically, such fast increases have been associated with below-trend economic growth. The bulk of the negative impact comes from export-oriented manufacturing, which has actually contracted in the past when the dollar has appreciated so quickly. For quite some time large-cap stocks have been favored over small- and mid-capitalization stocks.  This may be the trigger for some reallocation from large-caps to something a bit smaller.
So far this year, the price of oil has sunk, earnings have disappointed, the dollar has rocketed, and it seems like the Fed may raise interest rates sometime this year.  In isolation, any of these events could cause problems for the stock market.  But they are not occurring in isolation – they’re all happening at the same time; all while valuations could be argued as stretched (not lofty, but stretched) and optimism has been increasing (often a contrary indicator).  Given all of this as a backdrop, the risks of the biggest correction since 2011 seem more than plausible.  But given the likelihood of a continued US economic expansion, any correction – no matter the size – should play out in the matter of a few months and be the proverbial pause that refreshes before the stock market continues its path of a secular bull market.  Given that, when said correction does occur the appropriate reaction might be to switch from bonds to stocks, or, to be more nuanced, from one asset class or sector of stocks to another.

The Extra Mile 


Scott C. Little, Vice President
I really do know my customers.
Last Thanksgiving, a client emailed me, asking to transfer funds to another account of hers—electronically. But we can’t do that by email. So, I let her know I’d need to call her. We verify some personal information, but she’s in some kind of train or subway station and it’s too loud. She says she’ll call me back. But something in her voice sounded “off” to me. So, when I hang up—I call her work number. And she’s there. It wasn’t her. I explain that someone has her information is trying to get into her accounts—walk her through who to call and what to do to protect herself, right now. And then, I wait to see if the other woman will call me back—as she said she would.
She does. And caller ID not only shows my client’s cell phone number—but somehow, she gives me all the information needed to make an electronic transfer—and more. Enough in fact, that someone at a large financial firm could have easily, and legitimately, transferred her money. My client would have been devastated. But, because I knew her well enough to recognize her voice, it didn’t work. I was so relieved that I stopped this from ruining her holiday season.

Zack Marcotte
Trust me, I do this every day.
A client told me he had recently changed jobs and asked if I would roll over his 401(k)—into an existing Roth account. I asked if he knew whether his original 401(k) had been a traditional, or a Roth. Was he sure? He was a little gruff at my complicating something so simple. But I really encouraged him to call his 401(k) company and verify it, first. Because I suspected it was most likely a traditional 401(k)—which would have rather large tax ramifications for him that he wasn’t considering. Wouldn’t you know it? He called me—on my day off—he was obviously grateful that I had stopped him and asked the right questions. It had indeed been a traditional 401(k) and I had just saved him a costly mistake. I came into work and opened a traditional IRA for him right then. It was worth an afternoon of vacation time to garner that kind of appreciation.

Bill Schmick
That’s why it’s called customer care.
A family client of mine, led by an 82-year old widow and grandmother, gave me an opportunity to really reach out beyond just business. Over time, I grew to know the family and this lady rather well, and had come to appreciate our conversations. As her health had been failing, we’d naturally talked about her financial situation and plans, but I also just checked in regularly—just to catch up. Over time, she became housebound with limited mobility, under 24-hour nursing care.
One day, she mentioned that being cooped up all day wasn’t so bad, but she did miss playing her opera and classical music DVDs. Apparently her caregiver wasn’t a fan and she just couldn’t manage loading or pressing the buttons by herself, any longer. When I hung up the phone, I ordered ALEXA. Then I called her daughter, knowing that her husband (a computer guy) would be able to hook it up in his mother-law’s room. This would allow her to listen to whatever she wanted, whenever she wanted by voice command. She called me in tears to thank me. What could be better than that?

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

Electro Savings Credit Union


                                            Electro Savings approve loans under a different set of rules to African Americans than Caucasian customers!  I was 7% above their threshold and when I asked to add a cosigner the answer was still NO!   DO NOT PATRONIZE!

SEFCU


                                            After getting fed-up with SEFCU’s “nickel-and-dime” fee structure and lack of branches/ATMs in my area, I decided to close my account in April 2017. Fast forward to July 25, 2017 when I receive a collection notice for fees due ($175). Access to my online...show more

                                            The online banking portal provides inaccurate information and the customer service people really don't care.

PenFed Credit Union


                                            Applied for a credit card and was denied based on what they said was a loss from a personal loan in 1978. I have never had an account with PenFed, so I questioned the accuracy of this denial. Considering, as a business owner, my scores are well north of 700, I thought this...show more

                                            Oh my goodness! He is awesome! After looking for a house and working with several different mortgage companies we were ready to give up.

Amazon.com Store Card


                                            IF I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO I WOULD! Amazon/Synchrony Bank will cut your limit out of no where, even when making monthly payments.

                                            When I refinanced my car with them I had a great experience.

                                with customers and resolve their problems. Turn lemons to lemonade: if a complaint
                                posts and you resolve the problem, the complaint is removed and the customer is
                                asked to leave a positive comment. WeCare subscribers get advance notice when a
                                negative comment is submitted, plus a quarantine period before it posts – time to
                                make contact and resolve the problem, so the complaint never posts. And there's
                                more.

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

What Is Budgeting?








 



Budgeting refers to the process of determining how you are going to spend your money. Using software like Quicken can help you track your spending so you can make sure you're on target for your financial goals. And, if you fall behind, you can make changes to your budget and readjust your spending habits.
Budgeting Is a Guide
Your budget for any particular time period is a guide for how you want to spend your money so that you can achieve your financial goals -- both in the short-term and the long-term. When you set up a budget, you can see where your money could go, and then you get to decide in advance which options are most important for you. For example, if you don't have a budget, that snazzy new outfit or top-of-the-line grill might catch your attention in the store and get you to buy it even though you should be putting your money elsewhere. However, if you have a budget, and you know you want to prioritize saving for a new car or a house down payment, you can turn down impulse purchases because you know the money is already earmarked for something more important.
Gathering Necessary Information
To make a budget, you need to know your income and your expenses. Income includes not only your paycheck, but also any other money you receive, such as rent from a rental property or interest on a bank account. Your expenses include anything you spend money on, such as housing, food, clothing, insurance, entertainment and travel. To make an accurate budget, it helps to have several months worth of your past spending documented so you can make realistic predictions about how much you spend in each category. If you haven't tracked your spending in the past, just use your best estimate and adjust it as needed as you get more information.
Budgets Are for Everyone
Budgeting is something that everyone, regardless of income or net worth, can benefit from. No matter how much money you make, you can always go bankrupt if you spend more than you bring in. However, budgets are also very personal, in that you decide which goals are most important to you. For example, one person might put a high value on driving an expensive car and be willing to work an extra job or cut back on other expenses to have one, while another person might be content to drive a used car into the ground to save up for a special vacation.
Budgeting Is a Process
As much as some people might prefer to set their budget and forget about it, good financial planning requires you to reevaluate your spending over time and adjust your budget accordingly. For example, if you change jobs so that your commute is shorter each day, you may be able to reduce the amount you have budgeted for gas costs and increase your retirement savings. Or, if the cost of food goes up, you may have to cut back on the amount of times you eat out each month.

What Is Money Management?








 



Money management refers to how you handle all aspects of your finances, from making a budget for where each paycheck goes to setting long-term goals to picking investments that will help you to reach those goals. Money management is not just about saying "no" to any purchase, but developing a plan that allows you to say "yes" to the things that are most important to you. Any amount of money can prove to be too little if you don't have good money management skills.
Knowing Where You're At
The start of good money management requires you to know where you're at in terms of assets (things you own) and liabilities (amounts you owe). Your assets include your bank accounts, investment accounts, retirement accounts and property, like your house and car. Your liabilities include your credit card balances, student loans, car loans, mortgages and other debts. When you subtract your assets from your liabilities, you get your net worth. If your liabilities are more than your assets, your net worth is negative. But, with good money management, you can change that.
Setting Your Goals
Your goals dictate how you manage your money. It's easy to overlook your long-term goals in favor of just trying to figure out which bills get paid today. However, by setting goals, you can give clarity to which expenses are necessary and which ones you can cut out. There isn't a universal "right" and "wrong" when it comes to your spending goals, but it takes effort to attain them. If it's your dream to have a car that costs $25,000, you have to make more spending cuts than someone who only wants to spend $10,000 on a car.
Creating and Adjusting Your Budget
Creating a budget helps you stay on top of managing your money because you earmark certain amounts for certain expenses. For example, you might limit yourself to $200 for entertainment each month after accounting for other basic necessities and debt payments. However, your budget can be a moving target over time. If you realize you can buy groceries on sale and save $50 a month, you might increase your entertainment budget to $225 and add $25 to your savings budget. Alternatively, if you get a pay raise, budget that raise into your savings rather than adding it to discretionary spending amounts.
Managing Multiple Accounts
As you save for different goals, you will likely have money in multiple accounts. For example, you might keep your emergency fund in a separate savings account so you aren't tempted to tap it for an impulse purchase. Also, you can use an IRA or 401(k) plan to keep your retirement nest egg separate from your other money. You'll also use different strategies for goals with different time horizons. You might be able to be more aggressive investing in stocks and bonds with funds in your retirement account if you won't need the money for 30 years. On the other hand, you will want an account with out any risk, such as a savings account, for your emergency fund because you could need that money at any time. A software program, such as Quicken, can help you keep track of your various accounts to make sure you're staying on track with your spending and savings goals.

What is Retirement Planning?








 



Retirement planning is the process of setting goals for your retirement years and then creating a plan to fulfill those goals. Executing a retirement plan requires most people to put aside some of their current income for long-term savings and investment. You can use tax-sheltered vehicles, such as traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and employer pension plans, to fund part of your retirement plan with pre-tax dollars.
Living and Working Longer
Early in the process, you'll want to decide at what age you'd like to retire. It might be a rough estimate at this point, subject to change as the years roll by. Many people today are living and working longer than those in previous generations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in 2012 that the U.S. population's average life expectancy rose to a record high of 78.8 years. Gallup polls show that in 2014, the average American expects to retire at age 62, up from the 2002 figure of age 59. Actual retirement ages have also crept up during this period, from 63 to 66 years of age.
Setting Goals
You'll need to make an educated guess about the percentage of your pre-retirement annual income to save for your post-retirement years, a figure known as the "replacement rate." A 2013 research paper from Morningstar Investment Management indicated that the usual replacement rate of 70 to 80 percent may be too high by as much as 20 percent. Your individual replacement rate depends on several factors, including your earning power while working and your desired lifestyle after retirement.
Lifetime Planning
Armed with estimates of your retirement age and your replacement ratio, you can start formulating a long-term plan that shows how much you'll have to set aside each year to meet your retirement goals. Quicken's Lifetime Planner tool helps you determine the size of your retirement nest egg and the amount you can withdraw each year so that the money lasts through your expected lifetime. You can include other sources of retirement income, such as Social Security and company pensions. Quicken Lifetime Planner provides long-term planning facilities that can help you organize the information in an easy-to-understand format and track progress toward your goals.
Explore Your Options
You might want to explore different options when setting up your retirememt plan. You can work out variations of your plan in which you change your income estimates, the amount you save and invest each year, your expected rate of return on your investments, your retirement age or other factors. For example, you can experiment with the age at which you start receiving Social Security payments. You're eligible for these payments at age 62, but the longer you postpone these, the more you'll eventually get each month. You get the maximum payment if you wait until age 70 to begin drawing your Social Security payments. Another option is retiring in stages, gradually shifting from full-time employment to part-time work that you can do at home, such as writing or consulting. You might also need to adjust your assumptions about your post-retirement lifestyle.
