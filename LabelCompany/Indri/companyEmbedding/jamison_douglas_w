ORIG3N: Early Stage Company Building Early Revenue


	By: DOUGLAS W. JAMISON | 
	March 10, 2015 | 
	No Comments
Early stage investing is not just about money – at this stage, we also put a lot of “sweat equity” into our portfolio companies. However, ORIG3N is the first to ask for our blood. They recently came by our office to take small samples of our blood to help build a biobank of stem cells for use in research and possible future medical treatments.
Through its Life Capsule program, ORIG3N is a fantastic example of how an early stage technology company can build its business, get its technology into broader use quickly, and create an early revenue stream.

How America Can Save the Smaller IPO


	By: DOUGLAS W. JAMISON | 
	February 24, 2015 | 
	No Comments
In my last post, which grew out of my keynote conversation at the 2014 SNS Predictions Dinner, I touched on the sea-change that has occurred in the IPO market since the year 2000, where the smaller IPO of, say Intel in 1971, has given way to the mega IPOs of Google and Uber.

Why We Need to Go Back to the Small IPO


	By: DOUGLAS W. JAMISON | 
	February 17, 2015 | 
	No Comments
When Intel went public in 1971, it wasn’t the behemoth that it is today. It was a tiny little company raising a very little bit of money in a public offering. Same with Amgen, or Genentech. Today they’re monster companies, built over 30- to 40-year time periods, but their initial public offerings (IPOs) were relatively small.

What if we could go back in time, and I gave you an opportunity to make an early stage investment in the Harris & Harris Group portfolio company BioVex, right as it was being founded? BioVex developed a new potential treatment for cancer and was purchased by Amgen in 2011 for up to $1 billion….

Taking a Very Different Approach to Early Stage Investing


	By: DOUGLAS W. JAMISON | 
	August 12, 2014 | 
	No Comments
I was discussing our investment in Metabolon with someone recently, when I realized how well Metabolon exemplifies our unique approach to early stage investing. There is a tendency in the venture capital world to follow, lemming-like, into copy-cat deals that target whatever happens to be the hot industry — social media being the latest example….

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREVenture Investing In Scienceby Jamison, Douglas W./ Waite, Stephen R./ Anderson, Mark (Frw)Over the past decade, software companies have increasingly monopolized the flow of venture capital, starving support for scientific research and its transformative discoveries. New medicines, cheaper and faster personal computers, and other life-changing developments all stem from deep investment in science. In the past, these funds have led to steam engines, light bulbs, microprocessors, 3D printers, and even the Internet. In Venture Investing in Science, the venture capitalist Douglas W. Jamison and the investment author Stephen R. Waite directly link financial support to revolutionary advancements in physics, computers, chemistry, and biology and make a passionate case for continued investing to meet the global challenges of our time.Clean air and water, cures for intractable diseases, greener public transportation, cheaper and faster communication technologies these are the rich opportunities awaiting venture capital investment today. Jamison and Waite focus on how early-stage companies specializing in quantum computing, graphene chips, and precision medicine struggle for funding, proposing a plan to bring the small IPO back to market to energize deep scientific investment. Commercializing science-based innovation also reactivates the economic dynamism that once defined American dominance in science and technology research. These partnerships have the potential to create legacies, not to mention lift millions out of poverty and secure the public good.Investments & Securities, Applied SciencesCondition: NewHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

Jamison, Chairman, CEO and Managing Director of Harris & Harris Group, Inc. (TINY), Interviews with The Wall Street TranscriptWall Street TranscriptJune 25, 2013ReblogShareTweetShare67 WALL STREET, New York - June 25, 2013 - The Wall Street Transcript has just published its Business Development Companies Report offering a timely review of the sector to serious investors and industry executives. This special feature contains expert industry commentary through in-depth interviews with public company CEOs and Equity Analysts. The full issue is available by calling (212) 952-7433 or via The Wall Street Transcript Online.Topics covered: Consistent BDC Dividend Yield - BDC Risk/Reward Profile - Higher Dividend Yields - Business Development Companies Historical OverviewCompanies include: Harris & Harris Group, Inc. (TINY) and many more.In the following excerpt from the Business Development Companies Report, the CEO and Managing Director of Harris & Harris Group, Inc. (TINY) discusses company strategy and the outlook for this vital industry:TWST: Can you talk a little bit about benchmarking and how you measure your performance?Mr. Jamison: Harris & Harris Group thinks about its performance in the context of realizing returns on its investments and growing its net assets over time. We are early-stage venture investors, so we don't plan month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter, but we think about realized growth over years. As a public company, we believe that if we are able to do that over a period of time and at a compound annual growth rate that is competitive in the marketplace, that we should be able to interest investors in Harris & Harris Group. But investors have to think in longer time periods than traders currently think to understand Harris & Harris Group.Recently, Harris & Harris Group has had a few really high-quality successes. BioVex was a $1 billion acquisition by Amgen. The successful IPO of Solazyme in 2011 has been a very good investment return for Harris & Harris Group. Just last week, we announced our most recent return, the successful sale of Xradia. Xradia will potentially return about $15 million on our $4 million investment. Harris & Harris Group, as an early-stage venture investor, has been quite successful over the last decade, when most venture capital firms have not been able to return the money that was invested in them.TWST: How would you explain your interest in quantum computing with the announcement regarding D-Wave and its novel way of making quantum computers?Mr. Jamison: D-Wave is probably one of the most exciting companies in the portfolio. It's maturing and developing very well. D-Wave is a classic early-stage investment in that the probability of success was low when we first invested, but the return potential could be exceedingly high if it is able to execute on its business plan.D-Wave has been executing on its business plan. D-Wave has produced the world's first commercial...For more of this interview and many others visit the Wall Street Transcript - a unique service for investors and industry researchers - providing fresh commentary and insight through verbatim interviews with CEOs, portfolio managers and research analysts.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
