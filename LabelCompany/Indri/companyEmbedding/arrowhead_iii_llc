Healthy Inspiration for Every Day









Buddy Up
Research shows that partnering with a friend on your wellness journey helps increase motivation, accountability and results.









Swap Out Sodas
A 12 oz soda contains roughly 9 tsps of added sugar. Replacing one with sparkling water each day can cut more than 65 cups of sugar in a year!








Healthy Hydration
One 0.5L bottle of sparkling water contains about ⅓ the daily recommended amount of water.












Cheers To Zero Cal
Simply swapping out a 5 oz glass of wine for a sparkling water can save roughly 125 calories.









Kick Start Your Morning
When you start hydrated it’s easier to stay hydrated. Begin your day with a bottle of refreshing sparkling water.








Freshen Up Your Cup
Add fresh fruit to your sparkling water to give it a kick of color and an extra splash of flavor.













Simple Steps
Work a little extra exercise into your day by taking the stairs instead of the elevator or by having a walking meeting.









Make Habits Stick
Overly ambitious goals can often lead to discouragement. Start with small, specific goals that are easier to achieve.








Portion Pointer
If you want to avoid extra calories, eat from smaller plates and bowls to naturally limit portion size.

Commitment to California | Arrowhead® Brand Spring Water



















































			Menu 




Home









Committed to our home state
The ARROWHEAD brand started in California over 120 years ago. For decades, we’ve worked hard to respect and care for the brand’s mountain spring sources and their surrounding environments. We take our time researching, evaluating, and carefully selecting mountain springs that can be managed for long-term sustainability.



San Bernardino Mountains, CA, 2015
Near Arrowhead Spring








From one generation to the next
Our team of natural resource managers and field experts care for our spring sources and their surroundings so that Arrowhead will be enjoyed for generations to come.











Protecting Nature is Second Nature
See how we’re doing right by nature from our springs to our bottles.



Water Stewardship
We take pride in the care we provide for our mountain spring sources and surrounding local waterways.



Recycling and Reducing
We’re committed to using post-consumer recycled plastic in our most popular sized bottles throughout California.



Community Commitment
We collaborate with local groups to help empower communities throughout California to become water stewards and to take pride in their local environment. 





Water Stewardship




We are for water
Being responsible to California means maintaining our springs for long-term sustainability. That’s why we have a team of experts dedicated to watching over each one of our 13 spring sources. We also partner with local groups like the Inland Empire Waterkeeper to care for the Upper Santa Ana River Watershed and other local waterways.
Learn More










Recycling and Reducing





Our packaging promise
Since 1994, we have reduced the amount of plastic in our half-liter bottles by 60%. And since 2016, thanks to the high recycling rate of California residents and our partnership with CarbonLITE, 9 out of 10 of our bottles made in California incorporate 50% post-consumer recycled plastic content (rPET). This recent change increases the amount of recycled material used in ARROWHEAD bottles by 40%.

San Bernadino Mountains, CA, 2015
Near Arrowhead Spring







Why Plastic is a resource
All plastic is not created equal.  Some plastic, like the durable #1 PET (called rPET when recycled), is inherently reusable and can be more easily recycled and reused without losing its functionality. By using rPET in our bottles, we can have a measurable impact on reducing our production of greenhouse gases and reducing the amount of plastic in landfills.



One of the most commonly used plastics for single-use products.



91.6% less energy is needed to make rPET vs. virgin (or entirely new) plastics.



The energy saved by recycling one PET bottle will power a computer for 25 minutes.


For more information about the recycling process and plastics check out the GOOD guide to recycling.

Jordan E. Rosenfeld, Andrew Janik, “Recycling Plastic is Surprisingly Complex. Here’s What Happens After the Bin.” WWW.GOOD.IS December 1, 2015








Facilities and Distribution
An important step in reducing our environmental impact is improving the energy and water efficiency at our facilities. We’ve already made a lot of changes, and will continue to look for more innovative ways to conserve at our bottling plants.




The two wind turbines at our bottling plant in Cabazon, California provide 30% of the facility’s power.






Cabazon Bottling Facility, CA, 2015



Here's how we're making a positive impact:



Conserving Water
New technology in our California bottling plants will save approximately 55 million gallons of water per year starting in 2016.



Increasing Fuel Efficieny
We added 20 alternative fuel powered trucks to the fleet in California this year.



Lowering Emissions
At our Cabazon facility, we have reduced CO2 emissions by 7,320 tons, saving the equivalent of approximately 1,897 acres of trees.





Community Commitment




Meet your Neighbors
We’ve highlighted a few of our team members to show what it means to work for the ARROWHEAD brand. Their passion for community efforts, respect for nature and high standard for quality demonstrate what it means to be “Arrowhead Proud”.

Our Partnerships In California
In 2015, we donated more than 3 million bottles of ARROWHEAD to communities in need throughout the state. For us, being an active member of the community goes beyond donations. It also means working together with other local groups who share similar values and goals. We’re proud to call the following organizations our partners:






Southern California  Mountains Foundation
The Southern California Mountains Foundation (SCMF) is a non-profit organization that aims to connect communities with public land and foster life-long commitments to environmental stewardship. We have been partners for over 20 years, and recently donated 90 acres of land in the Angeles Oaks area of the San Bernardino Mountains to the Foundation to contribute to their ongoing efforts. Learn More







Cucamonga Valley Water District
The Cucamonga Valley Water District is dedicated to providing high quality, safe and reliable water services. Throughout the years, we’ve been able to sponsor their educational Environmental Learning Center, festivals, and internship programs. In 2016, we invested in a groundwater treatment project that will help increase the availability and reliability of local water supplies for the community. Learn More







American River Headwater Restoration with The Nature Conservancy
The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is a leading conservation organization whose mission is to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends. TNC is co-leading a forest and watershed restoration and research effort in the headwaters of the American River—the watershed that is the primary drinking water source for Sacramento. The goal is to manage the forests to reduce the risk of wildfire and help safeguard water quality, potentially increasing water quantity. We look forward to working with the multiple groups who have joined forces on this important effort. Learn More

Commitment to California | Arrowhead® Brand Spring Water



















































			Menu 




Home









Committed to our home state
The ARROWHEAD brand started in California over 120 years ago. For decades, we’ve worked hard to respect and care for the brand’s mountain spring sources and their surrounding environments. We take our time researching, evaluating, and carefully selecting mountain springs that can be managed for long-term sustainability.



San Bernardino Mountains, CA, 2015
Near Arrowhead Spring








From one generation to the next
Our team of natural resource managers and field experts care for our spring sources and their surroundings so that Arrowhead will be enjoyed for generations to come.











Protecting Nature is Second Nature
See how we’re doing right by nature from our springs to our bottles.



Water Stewardship
We take pride in the care we provide for our mountain spring sources and surrounding local waterways.



Recycling and Reducing
We’re committed to using post-consumer recycled plastic in our most popular sized bottles throughout California.



Community Commitment
We collaborate with local groups to help empower communities throughout California to become water stewards and to take pride in their local environment. 





Water Stewardship




We are for water
Being responsible to California means maintaining our springs for long-term sustainability. That’s why we have a team of experts dedicated to watching over each one of our 13 spring sources. We also partner with local groups like the Inland Empire Waterkeeper to care for the Upper Santa Ana River Watershed and other local waterways.
Learn More










Recycling and Reducing





Our packaging promise
Since 1994, we have reduced the amount of plastic in our half-liter bottles by 60%. And since 2016, thanks to the high recycling rate of California residents and our partnership with CarbonLITE, 9 out of 10 of our bottles made in California incorporate 50% post-consumer recycled plastic content (rPET). This recent change increases the amount of recycled material used in ARROWHEAD bottles by 40%.

Near Arrowhead Spring







Why Plastic is a resource
All plastic is not created equal.  Some plastic, like the durable #1 PET (called rPET when recycled), is inherently reusable and can be more easily recycled and reused without losing its functionality. By using rPET in our bottles, we can have a measurable impact on reducing our production of greenhouse gases and reducing the amount of plastic in landfills.



One of the most commonly used plastics for single-use products.



91.6% less energy is needed to make rPET vs. virgin (or entirely new) plastics.



The energy saved by recycling one PET bottle will power a computer for 25 minutes.


For more information about the recycling process and plastics check out the GOOD guide to recycling.

Jordan E. Rosenfeld, Andrew Janik, “Recycling Plastic is Surprisingly Complex. Here’s What Happens After the Bin.” WWW.GOOD.IS December 1, 2015








Facilities and Distribution
An important step in reducing our environmental impact is improving the energy and water efficiency at our facilities. We’ve already made a lot of changes, and will continue to look for more innovative ways to conserve at our bottling plants.




The two wind turbines at our bottling plant in Cabazon, California provide 30% of the facility’s power.






Cabazon Bottling Facility, CA, 2015



Here's how we're making a positive impact:



Conserving Water
New technology in our California bottling plants will save approximately 55 million gallons of water per year starting in 2016.



Increasing Fuel Efficieny
We added 20 alternative fuel powered trucks to the fleet in California this year.



Lowering Emissions
At our Cabazon facility, we have reduced CO2 emissions by 7,320 tons, saving the equivalent of approximately 1,897 acres of trees.





Community Commitment




Meet your Neighbors
We’ve highlighted a few of our team members to show what it means to work for the ARROWHEAD brand. Their passion for community efforts, respect for nature and high standard for quality demonstrate what it means to be “Arrowhead Proud”.

Arrowhead Products | History












































































Arrowhead Products was founded in 1937 as Arrowhead Rubber Company.  In 1942, Arrowhead Rubber conceived the idea of rubber coated fabric ducting which gave birth to "Airtron" products.  This rapidly became the company’s most important product during WWII.

In 1944, Arrowhead Rubber Company was sold to National Motor Bearing.  In 1951, Arrowhead Rubber began designing and producing high-altitude pressure suits called "G.U.S." (Garment, Upper Stratosphere).  The suit was also worn 
            by Hollywood actor Lee Marvin in a movie titled, "Man in Orbit."




In 1956, Federal Mogul purchased National Motor Bearing and changed the name of the company from Arrowhead Rubber Company to Arrowhead Products.  In 1960, the company moved from its Signal Hill location to Los Alamitos.  And, in 1962 being a pioneer in the space industry, Arrowhead Products was awarded the prime contract from NASA to design and manufacture the entire propellant system First Stage Apollo Booster Rocket.
In 1983, Arrowhead Products was sold to Vesper Corporation now called Industrial Manufacturing Company based out of Brecksville, OH
Our legacy continues for future generations.

During the warranty period, Arrowhead Products allows warranty returns to the factory for repair or replacement of any part which is in non-conformance to its specifications.    If you are not sure the part is warrantable, please contact a customer service representative to get answers to your questions prior to shipping, doing so will prevent delays at receiving and expedite your orders and claims. 
 Once a part is received, Arrowhead Products will either accept or deny warranty based on initial testing and inspection of the part down to the component level.  Customer-induced damage resulting from misuse, mishandling, missing components, or modification to such parts is considered a non-warrantable condition and therefore warranty will be denied. Refurbishment or upgrading of a product to the latest specification is considered non-warranty and will be re-configured to a Repair Service transaction.  Arrowhead Products is not responsible for any damage to the product during transportation to our facility.  Please insure that parts are properly packaged for their journey to Arrowhead.
 Arrowhead Products rigorously tests all its products to ensure optimum quality and reliability.   However, in the event of a failure, return the part to Arrowhead Products for evaluation and testing.   If warranty is accepted, the customer will be notified of the acceptance and Arrowhead will repair the unit (or replace at its option) at no cost to the customer.  Further, warranty repairs will be returned to customer freight pre-paid.  If after evaluation and testing the customer’s reason for removal or failure symptom can not  duplicated (unit passes test), it will be reported as “No Fault Found” (NFF) and a Bench Test Fee of $485.00 will apply.
 If warranty is accepted on a returned part, any replaced or repaired sub-component, will carry a ninety (90) day warranty or the remainder of the initial factory warranty period, whichever is longer.
3. REPAIR AND OVERHAUL R&O
For non-warranty repairs or services, Arrowhead Products offers a wide range of repair solutions for those components which may require minor refurbishment on up to major damage correction.  After receiving inspection, Arrowhead Products will examine the returned parts and send customer a quote for the repairs.   Repair work will only commence on the part when a signed quote approval or a Purchase/Repair order has been received.
3.1 EVALUATION FEES
Arrowhead Products standard Bench Test/Evaluation fee is $485.00.   This fee will apply to transactions determined to be No Fault Found (NFF), or that the unit is outside of repairable limits, or deemed Beyond Economical Repair (BER).   Parts may be returned in “As Is” condition with No Work Performed or they may be scrapped on site per customer’s written request.  Parts returned to customer for either of the instances mentioned in this paragraph will be shipped at customer freight expense.  Arrowhead Products, at its discretion, may decide not to repair a non-warranty part.
3.2 EXPEDITE AND AOG REPAIRSArrowhead Products offers Expedite services for critically needed parts for an additional charge.  Please contact a customer service representative for more information.  To avoid delays, be sure to have on hand all pertinent information including part number, mfr date, condition, and detailed information as to the reason for removal or squawk.
3.3 INSULATED PRODUCTS EVALUATION NOTICE
Please note:  Certain Arrowhead parts require the careful removal of the outer insulation/covering in order to evaluate, test to arrive at a quotation for customers.    Please note that once it is removed the material is discarded and cannot be salvaged or re-applied.  This operation is a standard part of the evaluation process as the insulation material can not be retained on the part after testing.  Therefore, instances where insulated products are returned at the customer's request without actual repair work  work performed, may or may not have the original insulation material intact.

Healthy Inspiration for Every Day









Buddy Up
Research shows that partnering with a friend on your wellness journey helps increase motivation, accountability and results.









Swap Out Sodas
A 12 oz soda contains roughly 9 tsps of added sugar. Replacing one with sparkling water each day can cut more than 65 cups of sugar in a year!








Healthy Hydration
One 0.5L bottle of sparkling water contains about ⅓ the daily recommended amount of water.












Cheers To Zero Cal
Simply swapping out a 5 oz glass of wine for a sparkling water can save roughly 125 calories.









Kick Start Your Morning
When you start hydrated it’s easier to stay hydrated. Begin your day with a bottle of refreshing sparkling water.








Freshen Up Your Cup
Add fresh fruit to your sparkling water to give it a kick of color and an extra splash of flavor.













Simple Steps
Work a little extra exercise into your day by taking the stairs instead of the elevator or by having a walking meeting.









Make Habits Stick
Overly ambitious goals can often lead to discouragement. Start with small, specific goals that are easier to achieve.








Portion Pointer
If you want to avoid extra calories, eat from smaller plates and bowls to naturally limit portion size.

Commitment to California | Arrowhead® Brand Spring Water



















































			Menu 




Home









Committed to our home state
The ARROWHEAD brand started in California over 120 years ago. For decades, we’ve worked hard to respect and care for the brand’s mountain spring sources and their surrounding environments. We take our time researching, evaluating, and carefully selecting mountain springs that can be managed for long-term sustainability.



San Bernardino Mountains, CA, 2015
Near Arrowhead Spring








From one generation to the next
Our team of natural resource managers and field experts care for our spring sources and their surroundings so that Arrowhead will be enjoyed for generations to come.











Protecting Nature is Second Nature
See how we’re doing right by nature from our springs to our bottles.



Water Stewardship
We take pride in the care we provide for our mountain spring sources and surrounding local waterways.



Recycling and Reducing
We’re committed to using post-consumer recycled plastic in our most popular sized bottles throughout California.



Community Commitment
We collaborate with local groups to help empower communities throughout California to become water stewards and to take pride in their local environment. 





Water Stewardship




We are for water
Being responsible to California means maintaining our springs for long-term sustainability. That’s why we have a team of experts dedicated to watching over each one of our 13 spring sources. We also partner with local groups like the Inland Empire Waterkeeper to care for the Upper Santa Ana River Watershed and other local waterways.
Learn More










Recycling and Reducing





Our packaging promise
Since 1994, we have reduced the amount of plastic in our half-liter bottles by 60%. And since 2016, thanks to the high recycling rate of California residents and our partnership with CarbonLITE, 9 out of 10 of our bottles made in California incorporate 50% post-consumer recycled plastic content (rPET). This recent change increases the amount of recycled material used in ARROWHEAD bottles by 40%.

San Bernadino Mountains, CA, 2015
Near Arrowhead Spring







Why Plastic is a resource
All plastic is not created equal.  Some plastic, like the durable #1 PET (called rPET when recycled), is inherently reusable and can be more easily recycled and reused without losing its functionality. By using rPET in our bottles, we can have a measurable impact on reducing our production of greenhouse gases and reducing the amount of plastic in landfills.



One of the most commonly used plastics for single-use products.



91.6% less energy is needed to make rPET vs. virgin (or entirely new) plastics.



The energy saved by recycling one PET bottle will power a computer for 25 minutes.


For more information about the recycling process and plastics check out the GOOD guide to recycling.

Jordan E. Rosenfeld, Andrew Janik, “Recycling Plastic is Surprisingly Complex. Here’s What Happens After the Bin.” WWW.GOOD.IS December 1, 2015








Facilities and Distribution
An important step in reducing our environmental impact is improving the energy and water efficiency at our facilities. We’ve already made a lot of changes, and will continue to look for more innovative ways to conserve at our bottling plants.




The two wind turbines at our bottling plant in Cabazon, California provide 30% of the facility’s power.

Here's how we're making a positive impact:



Conserving Water
New technology in our California bottling plants will save approximately 55 million gallons of water per year starting in 2016.



Increasing Fuel Efficieny
We added 20 alternative fuel powered trucks to the fleet in California this year.



Lowering Emissions
At our Cabazon facility, we have reduced CO2 emissions by 7,320 tons, saving the equivalent of approximately 1,897 acres of trees.

It also means working together with other local groups who share similar values and goals. We’re proud to call the following organizations our partners:






Southern California  Mountains Foundation
The Southern California Mountains Foundation (SCMF) is a non-profit organization that aims to connect communities with public land and foster life-long commitments to environmental stewardship. We have been partners for over 20 years, and recently donated 90 acres of land in the Angeles Oaks area of the San Bernardino Mountains to the Foundation to contribute to their ongoing efforts.

American River Headwater Restoration with The Nature Conservancy
The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is a leading conservation organization whose mission is to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends. TNC is co-leading a forest and watershed restoration and research effort in the headwaters of the American River—the watershed that is the primary drinking water source for Sacramento. The goal is to manage the forests to reduce the risk of wildfire and help safeguard water quality, potentially increasing water quantity. We look forward to working with the multiple groups who have joined forces on this important effort. Learn More

Commitment to California | Arrowhead® Brand Spring Water



















































			Menu 




Home









Committed to our home state
The ARROWHEAD brand started in California over 120 years ago. For decades, we’ve worked hard to respect and care for the brand’s mountain spring sources and their surrounding environments. We take our time researching, evaluating, and carefully selecting mountain springs that can be managed for long-term sustainability.

From one generation to the next
Our team of natural resource managers and field experts care for our spring sources and their surroundings so that Arrowhead will be enjoyed for generations to come.











Protecting Nature is Second Nature
See how we’re doing right by nature from our springs to our bottles.



Water Stewardship
We take pride in the care we provide for our mountain spring sources and surrounding local waterways.



Recycling and Reducing
We’re committed to using post-consumer recycled plastic in our most popular sized bottles throughout California.



Community Commitment
We collaborate with local groups to help empower communities throughout California to become water stewards and to take pride in their local environment. 





Water Stewardship




We are for water
Being responsible to California means maintaining our springs for long-term sustainability. That’s why we have a team of experts dedicated to watching over each one of our 13 spring sources. We also partner with local groups like the Inland Empire Waterkeeper to care for the Upper Santa Ana River Watershed and other local waterways.

Recycling and Reducing





Our packaging promise
Since 1994, we have reduced the amount of plastic in our half-liter bottles by 60%. And since 2016, thanks to the high recycling rate of California residents and our partnership with CarbonLITE, 9 out of 10 of our bottles made in California incorporate 50% post-consumer recycled plastic content (rPET). This recent change increases the amount of recycled material used in ARROWHEAD bottles by 40%.

Why Plastic is a resource
All plastic is not created equal.  Some plastic, like the durable #1 PET (called rPET when recycled), is inherently reusable and can be more easily recycled and reused without losing its functionality. By using rPET in our bottles, we can have a measurable impact on reducing our production of greenhouse gases and reducing the amount of plastic in landfills.



One of the most commonly used plastics for single-use products.



91.6% less energy is needed to make rPET vs. virgin (or entirely new) plastics.



The energy saved by recycling one PET bottle will power a computer for 25 minutes.


For more information about the recycling process and plastics check out the GOOD guide to recycling.
