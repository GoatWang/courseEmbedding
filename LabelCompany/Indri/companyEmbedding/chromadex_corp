What is NIAGEN®?
NIAGEN®, also known as nicotinamide riboside (NR), is a very unique member of the vitamin B3 family. The body converts NR into Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+) which is an essential molecule found in every living cell.
Why is NAD+ so important?
NAD+ enables cells to convert the food that we eat into the energy that we need. NAD+ is also the communication molecule between the cell nucleus and the mitochondria which are the energy producing factories in the cell. If NAD+ levels are low, then communication may be impaired and mitochondria dysfunction may result. When this occurs, everything begins to breakdown.
Boosting NAD+ levels promote cellular metabolism, mitochondrial function, and energy production.
 
Why is NIAGEN® so revolutionary?
The cruel reality is NAD+ levels are highest at birth and decreases dramatically with age. Also, certain lifestyle choices such as over-eating or a sedentary routine deplete NAD+ levels.
In a recent human study, one serving of NIAGEN® increased NAD+ levels by 33% in 8 hours.

- Full Study Results to be Peer Reviewed for Scientific Publication -

IRVINE, Calif., Feb. 11, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- ChromaDex Corp. (OTCQX: CDXC) announced today that the initial results of the first human clinical study for the company's NIAGEN® nicotinamide riboside (NR) has met its primary endpoint. The results demonstrated that a single dose of NR resulted in statistically significant increases in the co-enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in healthy human volunteers. The study shows for the first time a similar conversion of NR into NAD+ as has been shown in prior animal studies.
Maintenance of sufficient levels of NAD+ is key to cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. If NAD+ levels go down or are redirected (as in cancer cells), mitochondrial function erodes, creating numerous adverse effects. For example, results of a mouse study conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in collaboration with ChromaDex published in November 2014 indicated that NR was effective at restoring NAD+ levels in mitochondria and rescuing phenotypes associated with a devastating accelerated aging disease known as Cockayne Syndrome (CS). The researchers concluded that NR showed promise as a potential therapy for the disease, as well as for other age-related neurodegenerative conditions.
In the first human clinical study of NIAGEN®, NAD+ metabolomic analyses were completed in blood for various time points over a 24-hour period. For the first time, the study also established an effective dose range for NR in humans.
A preliminary analysis of the results did not reveal any safety issues with NR, which is consistent with previous safety results demonstrated in numerous cell and animal studies.
The full results of the study will be submitted for peer review in the scientific literature.
The NAD+ metabolomics analyses were performed in the laboratory of Dr. Charles Brenner, the Roy J. Carver Chair of Biochemistry and Professor of Internal Medicine at the University of Iowa. In 2004, Brenner, who was then a faculty member at Dartmouth College, discovered NR to be a vital precursor of NAD+, which is made available by nicotinamide riboside kinases (Nrks) that are conserved between yeast and humans. In 2007, Dr. Brenner's lab discovered a second pathway by which NR is converted to NAD+ and showed that NR can extend the lifespan of yeast cells by virtue of elevating NAD+ levels and increasing the activity of the NAD+-dependent Sir2 enzyme. 
Dr. Brenner commented, "The results of this study constitute a significant milestone in the translation of NR technologies as it is the first time an increase in NAD+ in humans has been demonstrated through NR supplementation. As noted in numerous scientific studies, the potential health and therapeutic benefits of NR as a precursor to NAD+ are significant. The results of this clinical study should encourage more studies and research regarding the possible health benefits of NR in humans."
Nobel Laureate Dr. Roger Kornberg, who chairs ChromaDex's Scientific Advisory Board, commented, "Demonstrating that NR is an effective precursor to increase NAD+ in humans has significant positive implications and may be a cornerstone to developing solutions to delay or reverse the effects of aging, obesity and disease." 
Frank Jaksch Jr., founder and CEO of ChromaDex, commented, "We believe the confirmation that a single dose of NR increases NAD+ in humans is a landmark result and a significant bridge between the numerous animal studies previously conducted that have demonstrated not only an increase in NAD+, but also a broad range of therapeutic benefits." 
Jaksch continued, "Dysfunctional cellular energy metabolism in mitochondria is increasingly implicated in diseases of aging, autoimmune diseases, muscle wasting, neuropathies and other conditions, and this study opens the door to the development of both consumer products and pharmaceuticals addressing these conditions."
ChromaDex's NIAGEN® is the only commercially available form of NR and is supported by five patents issued and several pending, with patents rights acquired from Dartmouth College, Cornell University and Washington University.
Published research has shown that NR is perhaps the most effective precursor to boost the co-enzyme NAD+ in the cell. NAD+ is arguably the most important cellular co-factor for improvement of mitochondrial performance and energy. In recent years, NAD+ has also been shown to participate as an extracellular signaling molecule in cell-to-cell communication. NAD+ is essential in supporting healthy cellular metabolism, including the efficient conversion of blood glucose into energy.  
As organisms age, NAD+ levels drop, which leads to a decrease in mitochondrial health; this in turn leads to age-related health issues. Low NAD+ levels limit the activity of a group of enzymes called sirtuins, which are believed to play key roles in longevity. NAD+ levels can be depleted by many of the stresses of life. By boosting NAD+, NR can increase mitochondrial health and induce creation of new mitochondria. 
About Nicotinamide Riboside (NR):Sometimes referred to as the "hidden vitamin," NR is found naturally in trace amounts in milk and other foods and is a more potent, no-flush version of Niacin (vitamin B3). Researchers around the world are studying the effect of NR on mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell where macronutrients are converted to energy the cell can use. Mitochondria also play an important part in the aging process. Scientists hope that the stimulation of mitochondrial function with NR may result in increased longevity as well as other health improvements. Researchers worldwide are continuing to make  seminal discoveries characterizing the unique properties of NR in a wide range of health benefits, including increased mitochondrial health, increased muscle endurance, neuroprotection, sirtuin activation, protection against weight gain on high-fat diet, protection against oxidative stress and improvement of blood glucose and insulin sensitivity.
While scientists have known for decades that mitochondria produce energy for cells, it is only recently that mitochondrial function has been linked to general health, aging and numerous disease conditions. Key to mitochondrial function is the maintenance of sufficient levels of NAD+, which is used to generate energy efficiently and allows overall mitochondria function, such as signaling, immune regulation and cell death, to proceed properly. If levels go down or are redirected (as in cancer cells), mitochondrial function erodes, creating numerous adverse effects. Scientists have begun to show in animal models that the stimulation of mitochondrial function with NR may result in increased longevity as well as other health improvements. At the same time, mitochondrial dysfunction has been increasingly linked to a broad range of disease conditions, including autoimmune diseases, macular degeneration, cancer, Alzheimer's and other central nervous system diseases, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and others.
A study by researchers from Harvard Medical School conducted in conjunction with the National Institute on Aging and published in December 2013 in Cell demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction (a hallmark of aging) in aging mice is due to a disruption in Sirtuin1-dependent nuclear-mitochondrial communication. The study further showed that a reduction in NAD+ levels is responsible for this disruption. Excitingly, the study demonstrated that this mitochondrial dysfunction is readily reversible by the administration of a NAD+ precursor. The study reported that "One week of treatment with a compound that boosts NAD+ levels is sufficient to restore the mitochondrial homeostasis and key biochemical markers of muscle health in a 22-month-old mouse to levels similar to a six-month-old mouse," indicating that some aspects of aging may be theoretically reversible.
Separately, findings from a 2012 study conducted by researchers at Weill Cornell Medical College and the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Switzerland showed that mice on a high-fat diet that were fed NR gained 60 percent less weight than mice eating the same high-fat diet without NR. Moreover, unlike the mice that were not fed NR, none of the NR-treated mice had indications that they were developing diabetes, and their energy and lower cholesterol levels improved, all without side effects. The Swiss researchers were quoted as saying the effects of NR on metabolism were "nothing short of astonishing."

Early history[edit]
ChromaDex was founded in 1999. According to a Standard & Poor's research report, the company was created "in response to growing demand for natural product reference standards, materials and services. It has worked to establish itself as an industry leader in nutraceutical and botanical certification, and even publishes its own manual outlining specifications for phytochemicals." On July 14, 2008 ChromaDex merged with CDI Acquisition, a subsidiary of Cody Resources Inc. On July 29, 2008 the company completed a private placement agreement, which yielded gross proceeds of $4.67 million.[9]
Later in 2008, ChromaDex (OTCQX: CDXC) became a publicly traded company. Shares of ChromaDex are traded on the OTC Markets QX Marketplace. As of April 2015, there were 108 million shares outstanding.[10]
ChromaDex catalogue[edit]
The ChromaDex catalogue "provides phytochemical reference standards, botanical reference materials and research grade materials for the natural products industry." The company sells over 3,000 phytochemicals and 470 botanical reference materials in its catalogue. The company's products reach a wide range of markets including food & beverage, pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, research organizations and governmental groups.
pTeroPure[edit]
ChromaDex received exclusive worldwide patent rights for its pTeroPure pterostilbene product based on the technology licensed from the University of Mississippi and the USDA. Pterostilbene belongs to a class of compounds called phytoalexins, which are antimicrobial substances synthesized de novo by plants that accumulate rapidly at areas of incompatible pathogen infection.
Pterostilbene and resveratrol have similar pharmacologic properties. However pterostilbene has exhibited advantages over resveratrol including superior biological activity, better oral bioavailability, and a slower metabolizing time, which provides more time for the compound's antioxidant activities to act.[11][12][13]
According to the USDA, "pterostilbene is one of many aromatic hydrocarbons called stilbenes." ChromaDex's pTeroPure is an identical form of trans-pterostilbene.
The University of California, Irvine, is currently studying pTeroPure for its efficacy as a treatment for melanomas and other skin cancers when used in a skincare product.[14]
Niagen & Nicotinamide riboside technology[edit]
On July 13, 2011, Cornell University announced it granted ChromaDex exclusive worldwide rights to a novel manufacturing process for nicotinamide riboside (NR). NR, a vitamin found in milk, is a more potent version of niacin (vitamin B3). Like niacin, NR is a precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which is elevated by a calorie restricted diet. Increasing cellular NAD has demonstrated cell-protective and positive metabolic effects. In laboratory tests, "NR has shown promise for improving cardiovascular health, glucose levels and cognitive function and has demonstrated evidence of anti-ageing effects."[15][16]
ChromaDex markets and sells nicotinamide riboside as an ingredient under the brand name Niagen.
In 2015, ChromaDex announced the results of its first clinical study, stating "Niagen Nicotinamide Riboside Effectively Increases the Co-enzyme NAD+ and is Safe".[17]
In 2016, ChromaDex initiated a second human clinical trial on Niagen, a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled parallel study in 140 healthy adults ranging in age from 40-60, to examine the benefits if taken daily for eight consecutive weeks[5]
Contract research services & capabilities[edit]
ChromaDex also offers contract research services that help customers source raw materials, identify new compounds and develop processes for large scale manufacturing. The company also has a number of analytical capabilities including gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, Near-infrared spectroscopy, and high performance liquid chromatography.[10]

ChromaDex is a publicly traded natural products company based in Irvine, California. The company is most well known for its industry standard phytochemical testing laboratories and catalogue. In cooperation with the University of Mississippi, the company is currently exploring the effects of pterostiibene on humans.[1]
ChromaDex has licensed patents from the University of Mississippi and the USDA to commercially develop pterostilbene and sell the compound trademarked as pTeroPure via the company's BluScience product line.[2]
In 2010, ChromaDex won the North American Frost & Sullivan Award for Most Promising Ingredient of the Year for pTeroPure pterostilbene.[3]
In 2016, ChromaDex achieved GRAS status for its patented nicotinamide riboside product, NIAGEN, which allows it to be marketed in the food and beverage industries.[4] ChromaDex also initiated a 2nd human clinical trial on NIAGEN, to examine the benefits if taken daily for eight consecutive weeks.[5] In addition, ChromaDex was named as part of the OTCQX Best 50.[6]

Early history[edit]
ChromaDex was founded in 1999. According to a Standard & Poor's research report, the company was created "in response to growing demand for natural product reference standards, materials and services. It has worked to establish itself as an industry leader in nutraceutical and botanical certification, and even publishes its own manual outlining specifications for phytochemicals." On July 14, 2008 ChromaDex merged with CDI Acquisition, a subsidiary of Cody Resources Inc. On July 29, 2008 the company completed a private placement agreement, which yielded gross proceeds of $4.67 million.[9]
Later in 2008, ChromaDex (OTCQX: CDXC) became a publicly traded company. Shares of ChromaDex are traded on the OTC Markets QX Marketplace. As of April 2015, there were 108 million shares outstanding.[10]
ChromaDex catalogue[edit]
The ChromaDex catalogue "provides phytochemical reference standards, botanical reference materials and research grade materials for the natural products industry." The company sells over 3,000 phytochemicals and 470 botanical reference materials in its catalogue. The company's products reach a wide range of markets including food & beverage, pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, research organizations and governmental groups.
pTeroPure[edit]
ChromaDex received exclusive worldwide patent rights for its pTeroPure pterostilbene product based on the technology licensed from the University of Mississippi and the USDA. Pterostilbene belongs to a class of compounds called phytoalexins, which are antimicrobial substances synthesized de novo by plants that accumulate rapidly at areas of incompatible pathogen infection.
Pterostilbene and resveratrol have similar pharmacologic properties. However pterostilbene has exhibited advantages over resveratrol including superior biological activity, better oral bioavailability, and a slower metabolizing time, which provides more time for the compound's antioxidant activities to act.[11][12][13]
According to the USDA, "pterostilbene is one of many aromatic hydrocarbons called stilbenes." ChromaDex's pTeroPure is an identical form of trans-pterostilbene.
The University of California, Irvine, is currently studying pTeroPure for its efficacy as a treatment for melanomas and other skin cancers when used in a skincare product.[14]
Niagen & Nicotinamide riboside technology[edit]
On July 13, 2011, Cornell University announced it granted ChromaDex exclusive worldwide rights to a novel manufacturing process for nicotinamide riboside (NR). NR, a vitamin found in milk, is a more potent version of niacin (vitamin B3). Like niacin, NR is a precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which is elevated by a calorie restricted diet. Increasing cellular NAD has demonstrated cell-protective and positive metabolic effects. In laboratory tests, "NR has shown promise for improving cardiovascular health, glucose levels and cognitive function and has demonstrated evidence of anti-ageing effects."[15][16]
ChromaDex markets and sells nicotinamide riboside as an ingredient under the brand name Niagen.
In 2015, ChromaDex announced the results of its first clinical study, stating "Niagen Nicotinamide Riboside Effectively Increases the Co-enzyme NAD+ and is Safe".[17]
In 2016, ChromaDex initiated a second human clinical trial on Niagen, a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled parallel study in 140 healthy adults ranging in age from 40-60, to examine the benefits if taken daily for eight consecutive weeks[5]
Contract research services & capabilities[edit]
ChromaDex also offers contract research services that help customers source raw materials, identify new compounds and develop processes for large scale manufacturing. The company also has a number of analytical capabilities including gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, Near-infrared spectroscopy, and high performance liquid chromatography.[10]

ChromaDex Corp. Licenses Rights for Botanical Compound from University, ARS
March 31, 2010  by admin OXFORD, Miss. – A natural products chemistry company has licensed the  rights for a promising botanical compound from the University of  Mississippi and the Agricultural Research Service, which is the  principal intramural scientific research agency of the U.S. Department  of Agriculture.

ChromaDex Corp. has signed an agreement for the commercial development  of pterostilbene (tero-STILL-bean), a compound found in blueberries,  grapes and other small fruits, as well as the bark of some trees. In  laboratory tests, it shows promise for improving cardiovascular health,  glucose levels and cognitive function.
“Pterostilbene has the potential to be one of the most significant new  ingredients the dietary supplement field has seen in a long time,” said  Frank L. Jaksch Jr., co-founder and CEO of ChromaDex. “Based on the  technology we licensed from the University of Mississippi and the USDA,  ChromaDex will be announcing the commercial application of this  ingredient, marketed as pTeroPure pterostilbene, in the coming weeks.”
Pterostilbene is chemically related to resveratrol, a compound that is  plentiful in the skins of red grapes. Resveratrol is thought to be at  least partly responsible for the health benefits attributed to drinking  red wine, which include cardiovascular health and cancer prevention.
Research chemist Agnes Rimando first encountered pterostilbene when she  was a graduate student at the University of Chicago.
Rimando works with  the USDA Agricultural Research Service, Natural Products Utilization  Research Unit, housed in the UM National Center for Natural Products  Research. When studies in the 1990s suggested that resveratrol provided  substantial health benefits, Rimando began experimenting with  pterostilbene in hopes of finding similar activity.
In 2003, Rimando asked Dennis Feller, former UM professor and chair of  pharmacology, and Wallace Yokoyama at USDA-ARS Western Regional Research  Center in Albany, Calif., to collaborate on studies of the compound,  targeting a particular protein in cells that is involved in fatty acid  metabolism and transport. Results of their work were presented at the  American Chemical Society meeting in 2004 and attracted widespread  attention, including coverage on national and international TV and radio  stations, and mentions in Time, Parade and other consumer magazines.
The development of pterostilbene as a potential dietary  supplement demonstrates the value of collaborations between the School  of Pharmacy, NCNPR and USDA-ARS, said Barbara G. Wells, dean of the UM  pharmacy school.
“These types of projects allow us to share expertise and help  solve problems related to the health and well-being of people  everywhere,” Wells said. “We actively seek partnerships with other  academic institutions and state and federal agencies, and we are pleased  that this particular partnership has yielded such encouraging results.”
The licensing agreement with ChromaDex is a prime example of how  academic research can promote economic development, said Walt  Chambliss, UM director of technology management.
“ChromaDex is just the kind of company we want to work with,” Chambliss  said. “They know the value of our research, and that’s the key  ingredient in a partnership like this.
“UM and USDA-ARS researchers working at Ole Miss share a common desire  to translate research into commercial products. We couldn’t be happier  about our agreement with ChromaDex. It’s just further testament to the  ability of our researchers to do work that attracts commercial  interest.”
ChromaDex Corp. (OTCBB: CDXC), based in California, is a leader  in the development of phytochemical and botanical reference standards  and the creation of associated intellectual property. The public company  is committed to sustainable, “green chemistry” and provides the dietary  supplement, food, beverage, nutraceutical and cosmetic industries with  analytical tools, products and services.
The National Center for Natural Products Research, a unit based in the  UM School of Pharmacy, is the nation’s only university research center  devoted to improving human health and agricultural productivity through  the discovery, development and commercialization of pharmaceuticals and  agrochemicals derived from plants, marine organisms and other natural  products.
The USDA-ARS Natural Products Utilization Research Unit focuses on  discovery of natural product-based pest management solutions and  research in support of minor and new crops.
Each year, NCNPR’s international conference on the science of botanicals  draws eminent scientists from around the world to discuss issues  related to the safety and quality of botanical products.

ChromaDex is a publicly traded natural products company based in Irvine, California. The company is most well known for its industry standard phytochemical testing laboratories and catalogue. In cooperation with the University of Mississippi, the company is currently exploring the effects of pterostiibene on humans.[1]
ChromaDex has licensed patents from the University of Mississippi and the USDA to commercially develop pterostilbene and sell the compound trademarked as pTeroPure via the company's BluScience product line.[2]
In 2010, ChromaDex won the North American Frost & Sullivan Award for Most Promising Ingredient of the Year for pTeroPure pterostilbene.[3]
In 2016, ChromaDex achieved GRAS status for its patented nicotinamide riboside product, NIAGEN, which allows it to be marketed in the food and beverage industries.[4] ChromaDex also initiated a 2nd human clinical trial on NIAGEN, to examine the benefits if taken daily for eight consecutive weeks.[5] In addition, ChromaDex was named as part of the OTCQX Best 50.[6]
American billionaire and pharmaceutical entrepreneur Phillip Frost owns approximately 19% of ChromaDex.[7][8]

Early history[edit]
ChromaDex was founded in 1999. According to a Standard & Poor's research report, the company was created "in response to growing demand for natural product reference standards, materials and services. It has worked to establish itself as an industry leader in nutraceutical and botanical certification, and even publishes its own manual outlining specifications for phytochemicals." On July 14, 2008 ChromaDex merged with CDI Acquisition, a subsidiary of Cody Resources Inc. On July 29, 2008 the company completed a private placement agreement, which yielded gross proceeds of $4.67 million.[9]
Later in 2008, ChromaDex (OTCQX: CDXC) became a publicly traded company. Shares of ChromaDex are traded on the OTC Markets QX Marketplace. As of April 2015, there were 108 million shares outstanding.[10]
ChromaDex catalogue[edit]
The ChromaDex catalogue "provides phytochemical reference standards, botanical reference materials and research grade materials for the natural products industry." The company sells over 3,000 phytochemicals and 470 botanical reference materials in its catalogue. The company's products reach a wide range of markets including food & beverage, pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, research organizations and governmental groups.
pTeroPure[edit]
ChromaDex received exclusive worldwide patent rights for its pTeroPure pterostilbene product based on the technology licensed from the University of Mississippi and the USDA. Pterostilbene belongs to a class of compounds called phytoalexins, which are antimicrobial substances synthesized de novo by plants that accumulate rapidly at areas of incompatible pathogen infection.
Pterostilbene and resveratrol have similar pharmacologic properties. However pterostilbene has exhibited advantages over resveratrol including superior biological activity, better oral bioavailability, and a slower metabolizing time, which provides more time for the compound's antioxidant activities to act.[11][12][13]
According to the USDA, "pterostilbene is one of many aromatic hydrocarbons called stilbenes." ChromaDex's pTeroPure is an identical form of trans-pterostilbene.
The University of California, Irvine, is currently studying pTeroPure for its efficacy as a treatment for melanomas and other skin cancers when used in a skincare product.[14]
Niagen & Nicotinamide riboside technology[edit]
On July 13, 2011, Cornell University announced it granted ChromaDex exclusive worldwide rights to a novel manufacturing process for nicotinamide riboside (NR). NR, a vitamin found in milk, is a more potent version of niacin (vitamin B3). Like niacin, NR is a precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which is elevated by a calorie restricted diet. Increasing cellular NAD has demonstrated cell-protective and positive metabolic effects. In laboratory tests, "NR has shown promise for improving cardiovascular health, glucose levels and cognitive function and has demonstrated evidence of anti-ageing effects."[15][16]
ChromaDex markets and sells nicotinamide riboside as an ingredient under the brand name Niagen.
In 2015, ChromaDex announced the results of its first clinical study, stating "Niagen Nicotinamide Riboside Effectively Increases the Co-enzyme NAD+ and is Safe".[17]
In 2016, ChromaDex initiated a second human clinical trial on Niagen, a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled parallel study in 140 healthy adults ranging in age from 40-60, to examine the benefits if taken daily for eight consecutive weeks[5]
Contract research services & capabilities[edit]
ChromaDex also offers contract research services that help customers source raw materials, identify new compounds and develop processes for large scale manufacturing. The company also has a number of analytical capabilities including gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, Near-infrared spectroscopy, and high performance liquid chromatography.[10]

According to the USDA, "pterostilbene is one of many aromatic hydrocarbons called stilbenes." ChromaDex's pTeroPure is an identical form of trans-pterostilbene.
The University of California, Irvine, is currently studying pTeroPure for its efficacy as a treatment for melanomas and other skin cancers when used in a skincare product.[14]
Niagen & Nicotinamide riboside technology[edit]
On July 13, 2011, Cornell University announced it granted ChromaDex exclusive worldwide rights to a novel manufacturing process for nicotinamide riboside (NR). NR, a vitamin found in milk, is a more potent version of niacin (vitamin B3). Like niacin, NR is a precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which is elevated by a calorie restricted diet. Increasing cellular NAD has demonstrated cell-protective and positive metabolic effects. In laboratory tests, "NR has shown promise for improving cardiovascular health, glucose levels and cognitive function and has demonstrated evidence of anti-ageing effects."[15][16]
ChromaDex markets and sells nicotinamide riboside as an ingredient under the brand name Niagen.
In 2015, ChromaDex announced the results of its first clinical study, stating "Niagen Nicotinamide Riboside Effectively Increases the Co-enzyme NAD+ and is Safe".[17]
In 2016, ChromaDex initiated a second human clinical trial on Niagen, a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled parallel study in 140 healthy adults ranging in age from 40-60, to examine the benefits if taken daily for eight consecutive weeks[5]
Contract research services & capabilities[edit]
ChromaDex also offers contract research services that help customers source raw materials, identify new compounds and develop processes for large scale manufacturing. The company also has a number of analytical capabilities including gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, Near-infrared spectroscopy, and high performance liquid chromatography.[10]
