NEW YORK, May 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- An investor group led by Barington Capital Group, L.P., including NuOrion Partners AG, announced today that it is calling on the Board of Directors of Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:    AVP) to immediately begin a search for a new Chief Executive Officer.  








During more than five years as CEO, Sheri McCoy has overseen a tremendous destruction of shareholder value.  Avon's stock price has fallen by more than 80% since Avon announced that it had appointed Ms. McCoy as CEO – from $22.69 on April 9, 2012 to under $3.65 today.  Under Ms. McCoy's leadership, earnings per share have fallen from $1.20 in 2011, the year prior to her appointment, to a current consensus estimate of $0.32 for 2017.    
As we stated in our December 3, 2015 letter to the Avon Board, we strongly believe that with the right leadership in place Avon can recover its position as a leading global beauty brand and create significant long-term value for shareholders.  In that letter, we also questioned the ability of Ms. McCoy to manage the business effectively, including restoring sales growth and reducing the Company's bloated cost structure.  While Avon has taken steps to improve its operations, we believe that efforts need to be dramatically intensified under new leadership.  Based on today's substantial stock price decline, in spite of positive 2017 guidance, we believe that most shareholders would agree. 
Barington has a seventeen-year track record of assisting publicly traded companies in improving their corporate strategy, operations, profitability and corporate governance.  As significant shareholders of Avon, we are committed to helping the Company improve its long-term financial and share price performance.  
The full text of Barington's December 3, 2015 letter is available for viewing at the following link: www.barington.com/avon.html

James A. Mitarotonda, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Barington, stated, "We are pleased to have reached this agreement with Avon. We have spent time with Avon's management team and members of the Board discussing our strategic and operational suggestions, and we are confident that Avon is taking the necessary actions to improve the long-term performance of the Company. We are also pleased that the Company is actively strengthening its Board with the recent reconstitution and the addition of Cerberus representatives, and we supported the appointment of Cathy Ross who was announced this morning. We believe these are all positive developments regarding the direction of Avon and look forward to providing whatever assistance we can to help the Company." 
Avon will today file the Agreement on Form 8-K.
The 2016 Annual Meeting will be held on May 26, 2016. Further details, including time, location, admission requirements and the business to be conducted will be more fully described in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Proxy Statement.
