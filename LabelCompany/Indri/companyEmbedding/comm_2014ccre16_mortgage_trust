Fitch to Rate COMM 2014-CCRE16 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through Certificates; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate COMM 2014-CCRE16 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Certificates; Presale Issued
    





March 24, 2014 12:43 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM 2014-CCRE16 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$54,127,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$144,926,000 
      class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$74,206,000 class A-SB 
      'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$190,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook 
      Stable;--$281,426,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$819,153,000a 
      class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$74,468,000b class A-M 
      'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$58,513,000b class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook 
      Stable;--$180,853,000b class PEZ 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$47,872,000b 
      class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$160,906,000a,c class X-B 
      'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$54,521,000c class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook 
      Stable;--$25,266,000c class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;--$10,639,000c 
      class F 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a)Notional amount and interest only.(b)Class A-M, B and C 
      certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ certificates, and class PEZ 
      certificates may be exchanged for class A-M, B, and C certificates.(c)Privately 
      placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of March 21, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $83,777,908 
      interest-only class X-C or the $47,872,908 class G.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 56 loans secured by 84 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.064 
      billion, as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P., German American Capital 
      Corporation, and The Bancorp Bank.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 79.1% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 87.7%, and asset summary reviews on 93.1% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV of 1.13x and 108.5%, 
      respectively, are worse than the 2013 and YTD 2014 averages of 1.29x and 
      101.6%, and 1.16x and 104.9%, respectively.
    

      Traditional Property Type Mix: The pool contains a traditional mix of 
      property types with the largest property type in the pool being office 
      at 30.8%, followed by retail at 21.6%, hotel at 15.3%, mixed use at 
      14.2%, and multifamily at 13.4% of the pool. No other property type 
      comprises more than 3.3% of the pool.
    

      Limited Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 12.6% of the 
      initial pool balance prior to maturity. The pool's concentration of 
      partial interest loans (42.1%), which includes five of the 10 largest 
      loans, is higher than the 2013 average (34.0%). However, the pool's 
      concentration of full-term interest-only loans (14.2%), including two of 
      the 10 largest loans, is slightly lower than the 2013 average (17.1%).
    

      Geographic Concentration: The largest state concentrations are New York 
      (22.6%) and California (18.8%), which includes six of the 10 largest 
      loans. No other state represents more than 9.2% of the pool.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 5.7% below the 
      full-year 2013 net operating income (NOI; for properties that provided 
      2013 NOI, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to COMM 2014-CCRE16 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays slightly 
      above-average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in 
      which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe 
      scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. 
      The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities on pages 75-77.
    

      The master servicer will be KeyBank National Association, rated 'CMS1' 
      by Fitch. The special servicer will be LNR Partners, LLC, rated 'CSS1-' 
      by Fitch.

NEW YORK--2 Mar--S&P Global Ratings
NEW YORK (S&P Global Ratings) March 1, 2017--S&P Global Ratings today affirmed its ratings on five classes of commercial mortgage pass-through certificates from COMM 2014-CCRE16 Mortgage Trust, a U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) transaction.


Our rating actions reflect our analysis of the transaction, primarily using our criteria for rating U.S. and Canadian CMBS transactions, which included a review of the credit characteristics and performance of the remaining assets in the pool, the transaction's structure, and the liquidity available to the trust.
The affirmations reflect our expectation that the available credit enhancement for these classes will be within our estimate of the necessary credit enhancement required for the current ratings. The affirmations also reflect our views regarding the current and future performance of the transaction's collateral, the transaction structure, and the liquidity support available to the classes.
TRANSACTION SUMMARY
As of the Feb. 10, 2017, trustee remittance report, the collateral pool balance was $1.03 billion, which is 97.2% of the pool balance at issuance. The pool currently includes 55 loans down from 56 loans at issuance. One loan ($6.6 million, 0.6%) is with the special servicer; one ($5.2 million, 0.5%) is defeased; and two ($10.3 million, 1.0%) are on the master servicer's watchlist. The master servicer, KeyBank National Association, reported financial information for 100.0% of the nondefeased loans in the pool, of which 81.2% was partial or year-end 2016 data, and the remainder was partial or year-end 2015 data.
We calculated a 1.41x S&P Global Ratings' weighted average debt service coverage (DSC) and 89.1% S&P Global Ratings' weighted average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio using a 7.78% S&P Global Ratings' weighted average capitalization rate. The DSC, LTV, and capitalization rate calculations exclude the one defeased loan. The top 10 nondefeased loans have an aggregate outstanding pool trust balance of $572.2 million (55.3%). Using adjusted servicer-reported numbers, we calculated an S&P Global Ratings' weighted average DSC and LTV of 1.43x and 91.6%, respectively, for the top 10 nondefeased loans.
To date, the transaction has experienced $41,126 in principal losses, less than 0.1% of the original pool trust balance. We do not expect any losses in the near term.
CREDIT CONSIDERATIONS
As of the Feb. 10, 2017, trustee remittance report, the Felling 3-Hotel Portfolio loan ($6.6 million, 0.6%) is with the special servicer, LNR Partners LLC (LNR). The loan has a total reported exposure of $7.0 million and is secured by three limited-service properties totaling 192 rooms located in Indianapolis. The loan was transferred to special servicer on Nov. 10, 2014, as the franchise agreement was terminated without lender consent, which stands as default under the loan terms. LNR stated that the complaint was filed in May 2015 and the motion for summary judgement was filed in April 2016. LNR is currently reviewing the borrower's proposal to cure the default.

Fitch Affirms COMM 2014-CCRE16 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms COMM 2014-CCRE16
    





March 13, 2015 11:28 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 12 classes of Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM 2014-CCRE16 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are the result of stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral pool since issuance. As of the February 2015 distribution 
      date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.6%. 
      No loans are defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting class 
      G.
    

      There is currently one Fitch loan of concern which represents the only 
      specially serviced loan in the pool (0.65%). Four loans (18.25%) are 
      currently on the master servicer's watchlist, including the largest (25 
      Broadway) and fourth largest (Google and Amazon Office Portfolio) loans 
      in the pool. Both loans are on the watchlist for a decline in their debt 
      service coverage ratios (DSCR) since issuance; both loans had concession 
      periods which were accounted for and escrowed for at issuance. Neither 
      is considered to be a Fitch loan of concern. The other two watchlist 
      loans are both related to minor issues and are anticipated to be 
      resolved without transfer to the special servicer.
    

      The specially serviced loan is secured by a hotel portfolio comprised of 
      a total of 192 rooms from three hotels, a Quality Inn, Modern Inn and 
      Comfort Inn, all of which are located throughout Indiana. The loan was 
      transferred to the special servicer in November 2014 as a result of the 
      borrower terminating their in-place franchise agreement in August 2014 
      without lender notification. According to the special servicer, they are 
      working with the borrower to remedy the default by approving the change 
      in their franchise agreement. The loan continues to perform with 
      underwritten expectations with a 2014 partial-year net operating income 
      (NOI) DSCR of 2.2x which is nearly identical to issuance.
    

      The largest loan in the pool is 25 Broadway, which is secured by a 
      23-story office building located in the Financial District in New York 
      City. The loan is subject to a $130 million pari-passu note that is 
      within the COMM 2014-CR17 transaction. As of September 2014, 25 Broadway 
      was 96% occupied which is in line with issuance. The year-to-date (YTD) 
      NOI DSCR through September 2014 was 1.18x, down from 2.02x at issuance. 
      As mentioned above, the decrease in the DSCR is a result of free rent 
      for multiple tenants; the amount of free rent was approximately $10.6 
      million and was escrowed at issuance. According to the servicer, had the 
      escrowed rent been included in the analysis, the resulting DSCR would be 
      1.74x.
    

      The second largest watchlist loan is the Google and Amazon Office 
      Portfolio which is secured by two office properties containing 1.1 
      million square feet located in Sunnyvale, CA. Both properties are 100% 
      leased to Google (64%) and Amazon (36%) who reportedly just took 
      occupancy. The YTD NOI DSCR through September 2014 was reported at 
      1.08x, compared to 1.41x at issuance. The loan is on the watchlist due 
      to the decline in DSCR that is attributable to rent concessions to 
      Amazon. According to the servicer, reserves were distributed for the 
      free rent and if the reserves were included in the DSCR calculation, the 
      DSCR would increase to 1.18x.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      All classes maintain Stable Outlooks. Due to the recent issuance of the 
      transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not foresee positive or 
      negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset level 
      event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics. Additional 
      information on rating sensitivity is available in the report 'COMM 
      2014-CCRE16 Mortgage Trust' (May 30, 2014), available at www.fitchratings.com.
    

      Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated:
    

      --$47.6 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$144.9 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$74.2 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$190 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$281.4 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$74.5 million class A-M at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$58.5 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$0 class PEZ at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$47.9 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$54.5 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$25.3 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$10.6 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$812.6 million* class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$160.9 million* class X-B at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$25.3 million* class X-C at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      *Notional amount and interest only.
    

      Fitch does not rate the class G and class X-D certificates.
    

      Additional information on Fitch's criteria for analyzing U.S. CMBS 
      transactions is available in the Dec. 10, 2014 report, 'U.S. Fixed-Rate 
      Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance and Re-REMIC Criteria', which is

The pool currently includes 55 loans down from 56 loans at issuance.
