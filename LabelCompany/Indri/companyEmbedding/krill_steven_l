What is the Best Krill Oil on the Market Today? Our Own Opinions and Reviews







We created this website to spread awareness of the benefits of Omega-3 fatty acids for a wide variety of health condition. Many of you have heard of fish oil and its miraculous health benefits, but you may not be aware that there is a superior Omega-3 source which is found in krill oil. Krill are small crustaceans that live at the bottom of the Antarctic Ocean which makes them a much cleaner source of essential fatty acids as they do no accumulate toxins over their short life span as fish do. Krill oil is also stored in phospholipid form which makes it a lot more absorbable in the human body, providing more value and better health results. Krill oil has been shown to be effective for improving cardiovascular health, reducing cholesterol, eliminating pain from inflammation and arthritis as well as improving memory and increasing overall energy.
Both of us are nutritional practitioners who experienced our own health struggles and found natural approaches through which we were able to restore our health and change our lives We have researched the industry’s top krill oil products and wish to share our findings with you so that you too can be informed as to what to look for in a quality krill oil supplement.
Thanks,
Pat & Sue

What is the Best Krill Oil on the Market Today? Our Own Opinions and Reviews







We created this website to spread awareness of the benefits of Omega-3 fatty acids for a wide variety of health condition. Many of you have heard of fish oil and its miraculous health benefits, but you may not be aware that there is a superior Omega-3 source which is found in krill oil. Krill are small crustaceans that live at the bottom of the Antarctic Ocean which makes them a much cleaner source of essential fatty acids as they do no accumulate toxins over their short life span as fish do. Krill oil is also stored in phospholipid form which makes it a lot more absorbable in the human body, providing more value and better health results. Krill oil has been shown to be effective for improving cardiovascular health, reducing cholesterol, eliminating pain from inflammation and arthritis as well as improving memory and increasing overall energy.
Both of us are nutritional practitioners who experienced our own health struggles and found natural approaches through which we were able to restore our health and change our lives We have researched the industry’s top krill oil products and wish to share our findings with you so that you too can be informed as to what to look for in a quality krill oil supplement.
Thanks,
Pat & Sue
