https://lnkd.in/eTAJTHcMichael sharedSee all activitySummaryMichael Doyle is the inventor of Fetch-It Slide Gaff and SunStop Visors.  Fetch-It Slide-Gaff is a fishing accessory for landing fish when fishing from a bridge, pier, cliff, or tall charter fishing boat.  When a fish has been caught that is too heavy to be landed just by reeling it up or is likely to get away by throwing a hook or breaking the line on a piling, Fetch-It Slide-Gaff will be a great help.  Simply clip on, let go, and pull up.  Watch the 32 second video to see how it works.There are now four different standard SunStop Visor models.  They are all automotive safety accessories and the original stops the blinding light of the sun from coming around the rear view mirror when driving into the sun.  The second model is the Side Window SunStop, which comes in three different sizes, fills in whatever the OEM visor turned to the side fails to cover.  The third model is the Pull-Down SunStop Visor, which comes in two different sizes, for the more multitude of people for whom the OEM visor does not go low enough to help them.  The fourth model is the Box Truck SunStop Visor for trucks that have a space between the visors, but no mirror on which to have the original SunStop.  Custom made visors are also now available. Mr. Doyle has been an innovator since 1974 and has acquired multiple American Society for Quality certifications and dedicated 20 years since 1992 to his photography business where continuous process improvement was the standard operating procedure.ExperienceInnovator/Inventor/OwnerMD InnovationsNovember 2012  –  Present (4 years 9 months)Solving everyday problems with creativity.Special events, business portrait, and fine art photographerMichael Doyle Photography, LLCJuly 1992  –  August 2012 (20 years 2 months)I was a special event and portrait photographer from 1992 through 2012.

          GUITAR CENTER PROMOTES MICHAEL DOYLE 
          TO VICE PRESIDENT, PRODUCT MARKETING
WESTLAKE VILLAGE, CA — Guitar Center, Inc. 
          (Nasdaq NMS: GTRC), the leading musical instrument and professional 
          audio retailer, has named Michael Doyle to the newly created position 
          of Vice President of Product Marketing. In his new role, Doyle will 
          focus on increasing Guitar Center sales and brand awareness worldwide 
          through product oriented marketing initiatives. He reports directly 
          to Jay Wanamaker, Executive Vice President and General Merchandise Manager 
          for Guitar Center.
Doyle will work closely with all Guitar Center Merchandising 
          divisions to identify specific products that lend themselves to additional 
          marketing focus, and coordinate targeted marketing efforts via mass 
          market media, Guitar Center specific and music industry channels. To 
          ensure continuing success in this arena, Doyle will further coordinate 
          GC marketing efforts with the company's strategic advertising placements 
          and online presence for maximum effect.
Doyle has 25 years of international experience in the 
          music industry and has authored three books about guitar amplification 
          — two devoted specifically to the reputable Marshall Amplification 
          brand. He started his formal music career as Purchasing Manager at Korg 
          UK’s London headquarters. In 1986 Doyle moved to the U.S. where 
          he joined Korg USA as Product Manager for Marshall, progressing to District 
          Sales Manager for the West Coast. He represented Fender Musical Instruments 
          as Regional Sales Manager beginning in 1995 until joining Guitar Center 
          in 2003 as Director of Merchandising, Guitars and Amplifiers.
Jay Wanamaker commented, “Michael's new position 
          reflects Guitar Center’s commitment to raising the profile of 
          musical instruments in the mind of consumers worldwide through creative 
          marketing, while at the same time differentiating ourselves in an increasingly 
          competitive marketplace. With his successful management of many significant 
          product launches such as the Eric Clapton Gibson 335 and Fender 'Blackie' 
          Stratocaster Tribute, Michael has proven he is just the person to make 
          this happen.”
