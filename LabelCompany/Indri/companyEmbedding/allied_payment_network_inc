FlexPay from Allied Payment is an internet bill pay solution. This process revolutionizes bill pay pricing by offering financial institutions a transaction-based pricing model, which frees them from paying customers who do not use the service.


 


With FlexPay, the institution is only charged when a user makes a payment. Most other internet bill pay platforms operate on a per-user cost structure. This usually runs between $4 and $5 per month for each user, regardless of how many payments.




Internet Bill Pay




Seamless integration




FlexPay will seamlessly integrate with any online banking platform to match the look and feel of the existing website. This gives customers better continuity with their online banking experience. Users also have a variety of options to choose from based on their individual preferences.


 


FlexPay makes automatic enrollment a viable option by eliminating the enrollment process. It also easily integrates with our mobile bill pay solution PicturePay. This lets customers easily keep a digital record of payments.
