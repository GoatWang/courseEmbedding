Music distribution is shifting from traditional digital stores (e.g. iTunes) to direct-to-fan platforms like YouTube, SoundCloud, and Facebook. Digital streaming services like Spotify, SoundCloud, and Apple Music have also enabled artists to circumvent traditional music distribution channels and reach large global audiences. Thanks to these digital streaming services, music is being consumed at record levels. In the U.S., the volume of total music streams rose 93%, to 317 billion in 2015 as compared to 2014.i Digital platforms that allows users to upload content (e.g. YouTube) have an estimated user base of more than 900 million. However, these types of platforms, which distribute advertising-supported revenues to recording artists and musicians, generated only $634 million in 2015, and accounted for only 4% of global music revenues.iiBeatStars is a social music marketplace and distribution company that is reinventing the music collaboration industry. In addition to distributing finished songs, BeatStars’ platform enables music producers and recording artists to collaborate, share, sell, and distribute, any type of musical content (e.g. beats, lyrics, vocals) worldwide. BeatStars allows music creators of all levels to represent their content independently and generate multiple streams of revenue. The platform provides the tools to distribute, monetize, and protect content, allowing music producers, recording artists, songwriters, and beatmakers to collaboratively publish songs in the most efficient and affordable way possible. ProductBeatStars’ Social Music Marketplace is a networking site for musicians to find and connect with other artists and producers. Recording artists can look for musical content to license and producers can look for artists to collaborate with. Musicians can sell songs, singles, albums, as well as production track licenses for beats, beats with choruses, vocals, and full song references.BeatStars’ Blaze Players help artists sell their tracks online. These embeddable HTML5 and Flash players act as a store, allowing customers to lease beats, download free beats, or make an offer for an exclusive license. The players provide instant delivery of MP3, WAV or Zip files, a free download option in exchange for a social follow, and instant payments through PayPal or Stripe. Artists can also create custom contracts, promo codes, deals, and voice tags. Paid members keep 100% of their sales.The BeatStars’ Collabos feature lets multiple artists, producers, and/or writers split music revenue distributions automatically. Music collaborators simply upload their music to BeatStars, assign the collaborators, and set the percentage splits.BeatStars helps artists get paid from other people’s YouTube videos that use their music without authorization. When artists upload their music to BeatStars.com, they can submit it for YouTube Content ID. BeatStars will then review the submission and deliver the approved files directly to YouTube. YouTube’s Content ID system then identifies third party videos that are utilizing music content without the artist’s permission and allows BeatStars to place advertisements on these videos to collect revenue on behalf of the artist every time the video is played.BeatStars has also partnered with SoundCloud for their OnSoundCloud monetization program to help musicians earn revenue from their SoundCloud streams. Artists log in to BeatStars.com, connect their SoundCloud profile, and select tracks they want to monetize with advertisements. Artists get monthly revenue payouts directly to their PayPal account.BeatStars’ Pro Pages give musicians all the tools they need to create their own custom website and music player. Pro Pages can operate as a dedicated music website to sell singles, albums, or beats directly to fans, or simply as a place to host and stream music. With custom themes and domain names, Pro Pages help artists look and operate professionally. Pro Pages are responsive across all mobile, tablet, and desktop browsers and come with a fully integrated shopping cart. Paid members keep 100% of their sales.Notable ProducersNotable producers using BeatStars include the following (pictured above from left to right):Focus…: Multi-Grammy winning music producer who has worked with Dr. Dre, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, Snoop Dogg, Beyonce, Christina Aguilera, Ice Cube, and Rick RossKrucial Keys: Multi-Grammy winning music producer who has worked with Alicia Keys, Drake, Mario, Nas, Keyshia Cole, and GoapeleJahlil Beats: Platinum selling music producer who has worked with Jay-Z, Diddy, Lil Wayne, Chris Brown, Rick Ross, T.I., and 50 Cent!llmind: Platinum selling music producer who has worked with Kanye West, Drake, J.

Digital streaming services like Spotify, SoundCloud, and Apple Music have enabled audiences to listen to a virtually unlimited catalog of music for an affordable subscription fee, enabling artists to circumvent traditional music distributors. Globally, revenue from digital channels (subscriptions, ad-supported services, and digital downloads) was $6.7 billion in 2015, up 10.2% year-over-year, and accounted for 45% of total industry revenue. Revenue from streaming services, which includes subscriptions and ad-supported channels, grew 45.2% to $2.9 billion.ivThanks to digital streaming services, music is being consumed at record levels. In the U.S., the volume of total music streams rose 93%, to 317 billion.v Primary music distribution is shifting from traditional digital stores to direct-to-fan platforms like YouTube, SoundCloud, and Facebook. Digital platforms that allow users to upload content (e.g. YouTube) have an estimated user base of more than 900 million. However, these types of platforms, which distribute advertising-supported revenues to recording artists and musicians, generated only $634 million in 2015, and accounted for only 4% of global music revenues.viYouTube has over 400 hours of new videos uploaded every minute of every day.vii That’s the equivalent of 16.5 days’ worth of video uploaded every 60 seconds. Many of these uploaded videos use music without the authorization of the artists that created the song. To detect unauthorized use, YouTube’s Content ID system scans uploaded videos against a database of files submitted by content owners. Owners then have the option of muting the audio, blocking the video, or monetizing the video by running ads against it. Since the launch of Content ID in 2007, YouTube has paid out $2 billion to content rights holders.viii   Competitors AdRev: Founded in 2011, AdRev is digital rights management company. The company helps music owners find YouTube videos that use their content without authorization and monetize this usage through ad revenue. Users get 80% of the ad revenue off of YouTube videos that use their music.ix AdRev has monetized over 30 million videos to date and has paid out over $10 million to rights holders in 2016 alone.x Zealot Networks acquired AdRev’s parent company, AudioMicro, in 2014 for around $20 million.MyFlashStore: MyFlashStore is a platform for producers and artists to buy and sell beats and instrumentals online. Other offerings include custom voicetags, custom hooks, and professional mixing and mastering services. MyFlashStore offers three membership plans, a free plan that permits 10 beat uploads, a Gold plan that costs $9.99 per month that allows up to 50 beat uploads, and a Platinum plan that costs $19.99 per month for unlimited beat uploads.xi Since it was founded in 2009, producers have earned over $16 million using MyFlashStore.xiiBandCamp: Founded in 2008, Bandcamp is a publishing platform for musicians. The platform hosts homepages and provides a space for musicians with existing websites to stream full music tracks and albums. It also provides fan base management and statistics, digital distributions, search engine optimization, web programming, audio transcoding, and internet marketing. In 2015, BandCamp grew 35%xiii and has paid $182 million to artists to date, with $4.7 million paid in the last 30 days alone.xiv Bandcamp does not charge their artists for accounts, instead it makes money through revenue share on sales. The company takes 15% of digital sales, 10% of digital sales over $5,000, and 10% of merchandise sales.xv   Executive Team Abe Batshon, Founder and CEO: Before founding BeatStars in 2008, Abe worked at INgrooves Music Group in artists and repertoire (A&R) and content development.

Policy






Set forth below are the terms and conditions (these "Terms and Conditions") governing the BeatStars.com Inc web site located at, or linked to through, the root URL www.BeatStars.com, which may expand or change from time to time (the "Website"). As used herein, the term "BeatStars.com" refers to BeatStars.com, the sole owner and operator of the Website; the term "you" or "your" refers to an individual, representing yourself or, if applicable, acting as legal representative for a group, business entity or corporation.
CAREFULLY READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. BY AVAILING YOURSELF OF THE WEBSITE OR RELATED SERVICES, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS SUCH TERMS MAY BE MODIFIED FROM TIME TO TIME AS DESCRIBED BELOW.
Use of Materials Found on the Website: The information, artwork, text, video, audio, pictures, software and other intellectual property (collectively, "Materials") contained on the Website are protected by copyright and international laws. You may only access and use the Materials for personal or educational purposes or as expressly provided for in applicable BeatStars.com program terms and conditions. You may not otherwise reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, modify or create derivative works of the Materials, unless authorized by the appropriate copyright owner(s). In the event that you print Materials found on the Website, you must include any copyright notice originally included with the Materials on all copies. You may not link directly to any media file located on a BeatStars.com server, except where explictly allowed to do so. You should not attempt to claim any Materials as your own work. Any computer software downloadable or otherwise available on the Website is provided subject to the terms of the applicable license agreement. Before using any BeatStars.com logo or trademark, please contact BeatStars.com.
Copyright and Trademark Infringement Policy and Notification Procedure: BeatStars.com does not own the musical compositions, sound recordings, art or other written or visual images (collectively, the "Content") posted by third parties to the Website. All Content is posted by an individual, group or company (collectively, the "Artist") who has represented and warranted to BeatStars.com that, among other things, neither the Content nor the names, trademarks and service marks under which Content is promoted (collectively, the "Name") infringes any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights, rights of publicity or privacy, or moral rights (see the section titled 'Representations and Warranties' of the current BeatStars.com Music Submission Agreement at http://www.BeatStars.com/docs/legal.cfm). Buyers are subject to clear any samples on any composition purchased.
Since BeatStars.com is not in a position to determine who has the prevailing claim to use any particular Content or Name posted to the Website, its policy on such matters is that they be resolved directly by the parties alleging misuse of their Content and/or Name (the "Complainants") and the Artists. We recommend that Complainants immediately notify Artists about allegations of infringement by going to the Artist's page on the Website, clicking the Contact link and contacting the Artist directly. It has been BeatStars.com's experience that most Artists are honest and responsible citizens who may not realize they are engaged in infringing activities. Typically, once notified of a claim, Artists voluntarily cease using such infringing Content and/or Name on the Website and elsewhere.
Complainants may notify BeatStars.com concerning any Content and/or Name being used on the Website in violation of their rights by sending an email to info@BeatStars.com. BeatStars.com only shall use information provided by Complainants in accordance with its then-current Privacy Policy and as reasonably necessary to address any allegations contained therein, which may include disclosing some or all of the information to Artists. In most cases, soon after receiving written notice alleging infringement, BeatStars.com either will remove the allegedly infringing Content and/or Name from those web pages identified or, at its election, remove those web pages.
Refund policy: BeatStars.com does not offer refunds. If there are any issues with a premium service or an ordered item please contact BeatStars.com immediately, we aim to solve any issue amicably. Premium services (recurring billings) can be cancelled anytime for any reason. Cancellations by the individual, group or company that signed up for the premium service (collectively, the "Subscriber") will be effective after the paid period. In case of cancellation by the Subscriber the period that is already paid for will not be reimbursed. The premium service will then remain active until the end of the paid period. BeatStars.com reserves the right to cancel premium services for any reason at any time without notification. If BeatStars.com cancels a premium service before its expiration date, Subscriber might be entitled to a pro-rated refund of the last payment. No refund will be given if user violated the Terms and Conditions of Web Site Use, or the Music Submission Agreement.
Premium service can be cancelled by emailing info@BeatStars.com with cancellation request and artist name or order ID. Cancellation will be confirmed by email.

The non-exclusive electronic, digital, and mobile rights in the Content to create digital and/or electronic copies and compilations, to distribute, to sell, and to publicly perform the Content via all electronic, digital, and mobile platforms owned and/or controlled by third parties with whom Licensee has or enters into agreements with during the Term (“Licensee Partners”).

Licensor will have an online account with Licensee known as the “Dashboard.” The Dashboard enables Licensor to see its activities with Licensee Partners.

publicly display and make available for download as part of the sale of the Masters, the lyrics of the Compositions;
collect monies for the playing of the Masters on non-interactive webcasts and streaming of the Masters (payable by SoundExchange in the USA). This collection right is only for Licensor’s Masters.

with prior written approval from Licensor, include the Content in audio and/or audiovisual compilation(s) for sale via physical distribution, and in such cases, to manufacture, make copies of, distribute, and sell physical embodiments of the Content;

Licensee’s grant of rights to Licensee Partners for use of the Content shall always be subject to the terms and limitations of this Agreement.



4) Promotional & Other Rights

Unless otherwise instructed in writing by Licensor, Licensee shall have the non-exclusive right, in its sole discretion and in line with customary practices, to market the Masters and other Content as applicable, for promotional purposes and without compensation to Licensor.
In order for Licensee to provide marketing and licensing services under this Agreement, Licensor grants Licensee the right to:

publicly perform the Masters (and other Content as applicable) on Licensee’s websites and permit Licensee Partners to publicly perform the Masters on their website(s) on a gratis basis for the purposes of promoting the sale of the Content. Licensor hereby acknowledges that Licensee and Licensee Partners shall be exempt from any payments of performance royalties otherwise due to owners of sound recordings for digital performances of the same if the use is for promotional purposes. Licensee shall require Licensee Partners to pay any public performance royalties which may be due to publishers/writers of the Compositions for promotional uses of the Compositions;
include the Masters in one or more streaming electronic radio formats to promote and market the Masters;
print, publish, disseminate, and otherwise use and permit others to use the “NIL Materials” (defined below) for the purposes of trade, advertising, and other exploitations solely in connection with the marketing, sale, and exploitation of the Content. The “NIL Materials” are defined as the approved likeness, approved biography, approved photos, and other approved promotional material provided by Licensor, including the name, both legal and professional, whether presently or hereafter used by Licensor, and name(s) of others whose work is embodied on the Content including the “Performer” (as defined below). All NIL Materials provided by Licensor to Licensee shall be deemed approved. All material provided by Licensor to Licensee may be edited to fit the format of the specific use without further approval from Licensor. Licensee shall have the right to permit Licensee Partners, successors and designees the right to use the approved NIL Materials as outlined in this subparagraph. “Performer(s)” as used in this Agreement means any person whose musical, vocal or production services are embodied on the Content.



5) Payment

Licensee shall pay Licensor the percentages of “Revenue” as outlined on Revenue Shares attached to this Agreement and forming a part of it.
“Revenue” means income actually received by or credited to Licensee that is derived solely from the exploitation of the Content less mechanical royalties, if any. Income received by Licensee may be subject to taxes, surcharges or fees imposed by government agencies or Licensee Partners before payment is sent to Licensee. Licensee shall have no obligation to pay Licensor Revenue which Licensee has not actually received until such time as Licensee receives such Revenue.

In certain emerging digital media markets (“New Territories”), Licensee has entered into an agreement with one or more Licensee Partner(s) to manage the distribution and appropriate marketing of the Content in that specific New Territory. As such these particular Licensee Partners retain a higher percentage of the income from the distribution, marketing and sales of the Content than is typically maintained in developed digital media markets prior to paying Licensee.
Licensor shall always have the option to withhold or withdraw Content from New Territories.


Revenue shall be paid monthly on the 15th of each month or the following business day if such date occurs on a weekend or holiday. Each payment will be accompanied by a detailed statement showing all sales and other Revenue-generating exploitations of the Content. If Licensor has not received payment or a statement indicating that no payment is due by the 20th day of the month, Licensor shall promptly advise Licensee that Licensor has not received payment or a statement. Licensee shall investigate the situation and assure that payment and/or a statement are sent to Licensor. In no event shall Licensee be deemed in breach of its payment obligations under this Agreement if Licensor has not received payment or a statement on the 15th of the month. However, Licensee may be deemed in breach of its payment obligations if Licensee fails to make payments or provide a statement thirty (30) days after receiving notice from Licensor as outlined above.
No payment shall be made to Licensor in any month when less than one hundred fifty U.S. dollars ($150) is due and payable to Licensor via paper check or Paypal. In the event payment is not made to Licensor for this reason, such amounts below one hundred fifty U.S. dollars ($150) as applicable, will accrue to Licensor’s account and shall be paid in the first month in which Licensor’s account reflects a balance greater than one hundred fifty U.S. dollars ($150) as applicable.
All payments to Licensor from Licensee under this Agreement shall be made via paper check or Paypal.
Licensor hereby acknowledges that in the United States among the ways that mechanical royalties for digital sales are customarily paid include: (i) payment directly to the publishers/writers by the music services/retailers, and (ii) an all-in payment as part of the fee paid by the music services/retailers to Licensee and are not paid separately to the publishers/writers of compositions. In those instances when Licensee receives what is considered the mechanical royalty as part of the fee from Licensee Partners, the portion deemed the mechanical payment shall be included in Revenue paid to Licensor. Licensor shall be fully and solely responsible for paying the mechanical royalty to the appropriate publishers/writers for use of the Compositions under this Agreement.

6) Accountings & Audits
All statements shall be binding upon Licensor and not subject to objection by Licensor unless specific objection in writing, stating the basis thereof, is given to Licensee within two (2) years from the date the statement is rendered, viewed, and/or downloaded. Licensor shall have two (2) years from the date each statement is rendered, viewed and/or downloaded to conduct an inspection of Licensee’s books and records specifically relating to Licensor’s sales and payment activity. Such inspection shall take place at the location where Licensee normally keeps such books and records and shall be conducted during normal business hours. All such inspections shall be made upon prior written notice to Licensee at least thirty (30) days prior to the date Licensor intends to conduct such inspection. Licensor may only inspect records relating to each statement once and may only conduct such an inspection once a year. Licensee shall have the absolute right in accounting to Licensor to rely upon the statements received by Licensee from third parties and shall not be liable in any manner whatsoever for any error, omission, or other inaccuracy of any such statement(s) or information received by Licensee. However, if Licensee knows or has a reliable business reason to know of an error, omission or other inaccuracy in such third party statement or information, Licensee shall promptly act to correct it and when corrected, Licensee shall appropriately correct Licensor’s statement and Revenue.
7) Confidentiality
Licensee and Licensor shall keep the terms and conditions of this Agreement confidential both during the Term and thereafter, and shall not disclose any information concerning the terms and conditions of this Agreement to any other person or entity. Each party may refer generally to the existence of this Agreement but shall not reveal the terms of this Agreement, including but not limited to the payment provisions, other confidential information, proprietary information, business plans, business models, customers, clients, technology, products, or any other information which either party identifies as confidential (collectively, the “Confidential Information”) without the prior written consent of the other party. Either party may disclose the Confidential Information on a “need to know” basis to its attorneys, financial, and other advisors who are under a duty of confidentiality to the disclosing party without the prior written consent of the other party so long as those agents are informed of this Confidentiality provision and agree to be bound by it and maintain the Confidential Information confidential. If required by law or governmental regulation, either party may disclose the Confidential Information only after it provides the other party with notice of the potential disclosure and the other party has the opportunity to narrow the information to be disclosed or dispute the disclosure. Nothing in this provision shall prohibit either party from disclosing that an agreement exists between Licensor and Licensee so long as the terms and conditions of this Agreement are not disclosed.
